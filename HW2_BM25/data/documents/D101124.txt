which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures although other distinct game modes exist as well each league of legends match is discrete with all champions starting off fairly

game 13 the game consists of 3 current running game modes summoners rift twisted treeline and howling abyss 14 another game mode the crystal scar has since been removed 15 players compete in matches lasting anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes on average in each game mode teams work together to achieve a victory condition typically destroying the core building called the nexus in the enemy teams base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets or towers in all game modes players control characters called champions chosen or assigned every match who each have a set of unique abilities 16 champions begin every match at a low level and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18 gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champions special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character if a champion loses all their health they are defeated but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes players also begin each match with a low amount of gold and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways by killing nonplayer characters known as minions and monsters by killing or helping to kill enemy players by destroying enemy structures passively over time and through unique item interactions or champion abilities this gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy ingame items that further augment each champions abilities and game play in a variety of ways champion experience gold earned and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches thus all players begin each match on moreorless equal footing relative to their opposing team across matches players also earn rewards that are applied to their account player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played player level is separate from character level both a level 30 account and a level 5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game from 2009–2017 the maximum account level was 30 and as players progressed they unlocked additional content and abilities this system was reworked in november 2017 with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a runes  masteries system that gave progressive bonuses to players based on their account level 17 playing matches and leveling up provides blue essence called influence points ip from 2009–2017 a currency that can be used in lieu of real money to access certain locked features accounts are given rankings based on the elo rating system with proprietary adjustments 18 these ratings are used in automated matchmaking to make games with players of comparable skill level on each team game maps league of legends consists of three main maps or fields of justice each have different terrain objectives and victory conditions as well as varied summoner spells and items a fourth map the crystal scar was discontinued summoners rift a simplified representation of summoners rift the yellow paths are the lanes where endless waves of troops known as minions march blue and red dots are the defensive turrets that defend the lanes not pictured are the two turrets that flank each nexus  the ultimate goal of the game which are within each teams base in their corner the dotted black line is the river that divides the sides summoners rift is the most popular map in league of legends 14 on this map type two teams of five players compete to destroy an enemy building called a nexus which is guarded by the enemy team and a number of defensive structures called turrets or towers 19 one nexus is located in each enemy base on opposite sides of the map in the lowerleft and upperright hand corners these structures continually create weak nonplayer characters known as minions which advance toward the enemy base along three paths top middle and bottom lanes players compete to advance these waves of minions into the enemy base which allows them to destroy enemy structures and ultimately win the match between lanes are neutral areas of the map known as the jungle arrayed in four quadrants a shallow river divides the map between the teams but doesnt actually impede movement all champions can wade through it no differently than dry land each team wishes to defend their own structures and destroy the other teams structures these include 20turrets  each lane is guarded by powerful defensive structures called turrets turrets deal exceptionally high damage and will attack enemy minions and players that approach them turrets prioritize enemy minions in their vicinity but will immediately attack enemy players if they attack allied players thus by advancing an allied minion wave into the range of a turret a player can do damage to the structure without themselves being attacked when destroyed turrets provide gold and experience turrets that are destroyed are destroyed permanently for that match and will not respawn some turrets depending on location will regenerate health over time if they are damaged but not destroyed inhibitor  each lane contains one inhibitor a lanes inhibitor can be attacked after a team has destroyed the three turrets guarding its lane destroying an inhibitor will cause the allied nexus to spawn super minions more powerful minions that provide a buff to surrounding minions if destroyed inhibitors will respawn after five minutes nexus  each team has a nexus that can only be damaged once all the turrets in a lane and that lanes inhibitor is destroyed destruction of the enemys team nexus ends the game some objectives are neutral meaning that they will not attack champions who pass by but champions can choose to pick a fight with them if they wish to gain a reward at the cost of having to fight for it they include jungle monsters  neutral monsters spawn at various intervals in the jungle and provide the player with gold experience and sometimes other rewards for killing them they are the most common neutral objective elemental drakeselder dragon  elemental drakes are powerful monsters located in the bottom half of the river all members of the team that kills the drake are provided with buffs that last the entire game and accrue cumulatively the drakes are flavored after the four elements with each drake granting a thematically appropriate buff a random elemental drake will respawn six minutes after the previous one is killed the elder dragon spawns instead after 35 minutes have passed ingame when killed it provides a stronger buff than an individual elemental drake but it wears off with time unlike the earlier drake rewards rift herald  the rift herald is a powerful enemy located in the upper side of the river killing the rift herald allows it to be summoned again as a battering ram to attack enemy towers this monster will never respawn after it is killed 21baron nashor  baron nashor is the most powerful neutral enemy located in the upper side of the river it will spawn after twenty minutes replacing the rift herald all living members of the team that kills baron nashor are given a buff which makes nearby minions more powerful baron nashor will respawn seven minutes after it is killed many of the details have changed over time league is not a static game with mechanics being both introduced and removed since launch in 2009 for example the rift herald was only added in 2016 and had its abilities reworked in 2017 22 21 dragons gave gold rather than buffs from 2009–2014 and the dragons only became elementally flavored drakes in 2016 jungle monsters have been added and retuned the length of time it took for inhibitors to respawn was 4 minutes rather than 5 minutes for a time baron nashor gave a stronger buff to the statistics of champions but no buff to minions from 2009–2014 and so on twisted treeline in the twisted treeline two teams of three players compete to destroy the opposing teams nexus which is guarded enemy towers 23 it is conceptually similar to summoners rift but smaller to account for three vs three rather than five vs five 23 rather than summoners rift 3 lanes of turrets and 3 inhibitors twisted treeline has only 2 lanes and 2 inhibitors with the jungle in between the other differences are the addition of two altars control of which grants the occupying team a variety of bonuses and the replacement of baron nashor with vilemaw an evil spider deity living members of the team that slays vilemaw are granted a temporary bonus similar to the death of nashor howling abyss the howling abyss is used for aram all random all mid matches and is five vs five 19 the difference between the abyss and the other maps is that there is only a single narrow lane of turrets and an inhibitor and no neutral jungle area thus rather than skirmishes and hidden movement the abyss focuses exclusively on large teamfights in the sole middle lane players cannot return to their allied base to replenish health and mana or purchase items unless they have been killed 23 aram was launched as an official mode in september 2013 24crystal scar the crystal scar was used for dominion mode a discontinued game format where teams of five players competed to capture control points and hold those points for the longest possible period of time 25 the map consists of a circle with 5 control points each team controls a base known as a fountain located at the bottom left and right hand corners of the map each team scores points by capturing and owning more objectives than the other team over time which is then reduced from the other teams life total these points count down from an initial score of 200 the first team to reduce the other team to 0 points achieves victory dominion was launched on september 26 2011 and was retired on february 22 2016 although the crystal scar is used for certain other rotating formats such as ascension 26 27games types league of legends includes several game types players can select 13 28the tutorial is the first game type available to new players the tutorial is played on the howling abyss and is intended to teach new players the rules and gameplay of league coop vs ai is available to new players after completing or opting out of the tutorial it is played on summoners rift twisted treeline and formerly the crystal scar and pits teams of human players against an opposing team of computercontrolled artificial intelligence champions normal matchmaking uses an automated match making system to pair teams of similarlyskilled players against one another ranked matchmaking is available to players upon reaching account level 30 it uses a similar system as normal matchmaking however premade teams must be of comparable elo strength so expert players and weak players are not allowed to team together in ranked after playing 10 or more ranked games accounts are given a public rank that roughly correlates with their elo ranking custom games allow players to play any map with any combination of player or ai teammates and opponents league of legends also includes three ways teams may choose what champion they will play for a given match blind pick allows the two teams to select their champions simultaneously the players only learn the champion selections of the opposing team when the match begins it is available on summoners rift twisted treeline and the crystal scar for normal matchmaking games and coop vs ai and for all modes in custom games draft pick allows each team to ban five champions each a total of ten champions banned removing them from the match teams then take turns selecting their champions while being able to see the selections of the other team it is available on summoners rift for matchmaking games and for all modes in custom games random pick randomly assigns a champion to each player players accumulate rerolls by playing multiple matches which they can use to randomly select another champion for that match it is available on howling abyss for aram all random all mid games and for all modes in custom games champion types there are currently 140 champions in league of legends as of march 17 2018 29 league divides its champion types up a number of ways the most salient difference is the type of damage a champion deals some champions deal largely physical damage which is resisted by the armor stat and other champions deal largely magic damage which is resisted by the magic resistance stat some champions deal a combination of both and can choose which to emphasize and some rare abilities deal true damage which is not mitigable by either armor or magic resistance riot games has classified all champions as one of six types to aid beginners 30 not all champions perfectly fit their type of course the official riot classifications are as follows marksman marksmen also known as ad carries are ranged champions that usually deal physical damage these champions deal sustained damage over time rather than in a short burst and are usually the best at destroying objectives like enemy turrets or elemental drakes they tend to have weak defense though examples of marksmen are ashe caitlyn miss fortune and varus 31mage mages sometimes known as ap carries are champions with powerful magic damage skills and support skills but weak defense and low mobility mages are a diverse set of champions some emphasize killing single champions from range very quickly some specialize in area of effect damage to multiple targets some specialize in immense range to attack enemies safely from afar examples of mages are karthus lissandra lux and swain 30assassin a champion who specializes in killing another champion as fast as possible usually within melee range 32 these champions tend to go after the enemys adap carry and other squishy champions but tend to have weak defenses themselves if caught they are distinguished in having excellent mobility which allows them to reach and strike at priority targets examples of assassins are diana fizz katarina and zed 30tank champions who are hard to kill and soak up damage for their team in exchange they usually deal less damage but can compensate with useful crowd control abilities to distract or disable enemies or force enemies to fight through them first before they can attack the carries examples of tanks are malphite sejuani rammus and zac 30fighter champions that blend the attributes of a damage dealer and tank combining moderate survivability with damage a common designation for closerange melee fighters since they need to be able to survive long enough to close in on their target examples of fighters are jax elise reksai and wukong 30support champions whose skills are meant to directly aid the rest of the team by providing healing buffing allies debuffing the enemy team or a combination of the above support champions often are paired with another champion in the early laning phase of the game where the support doesnt attack minions but instead focuses on aiding their partner and harassing the enemy champions supports are also expected to pay the most attention to the map as a whole placing wards which grant vision and watching for surprise enemy movements example of supports are alistar nami soraka and taric 30 31item choice plays an important role in the above and can shift the style of a champion for example if the champion jarvan iv purchases all damage items he functions something like an assassin he can kill enemies quickly but dies rapidly himself if jarvan buys all defensive items hes a tank focused on disruption and buffing his allies somewhere inbetween hes a fighter in the same way champions like morgana annie and karma can build item sets that are focused on high damage like a mage or item sets focused on disrupting enemies and aiding allies like a support special game modes riot games starting in 2013 has released a number of special limitedtime game modes these special modes would usually be accessible for two weeks then retired in 2016 riot announced that rotating games mode would be a recurring event so that every weekend a previously released game mode would be made accessible again for that weekend 33 game modes in the current rotation include ascension ultra rapid fire urf hexakill twisted treeline one for all summoners rift nemesis draft nexus siege legend of the poro king doom bots of doom and hunt of the blood moon special game modes not seen in the rotation include one for all howling abyss hexakill summoners rift black market brawlers definitely not dominion and snowdown showdown the ultra rapid fire urf mode was originally a 2014 april fools day prank that proved so popular it became a proper rotating game mode in urf champion abilities have no resource cost and have their cooldowns reduced by 80 double the normal cap of 40 that can be attained through items additionally champions have increased movement speed faster passive gold gain and faster attacks 34 35business model league of legends is funded through microtransactions using riot points rp an ingame currency which can be purchased by players in the client store rp can be used to purchase champions champion skins ward skins summoner icons emotes and certain multigame boosts an additional currency blue essence be known as influence points from 2009–2017 is earned by playing the game and leveling up league of legends is freetoplay and all ingame purchases with a material effect on gameplay may be acquired by either rp or be only cosmetic items are locked to rponly setting and lore league of legends takes place in the fictional world of runeterra in runeterra the champions of league of legends are a collection of heroes and villains who have a variety of backstories often related to the political struggles of the various countries of the main continent of valoran additionally some champions are extraplanar and come from worlds other than runeterra but are visiting for their own purposes these champions sometimes clash with each other roughly reflected in the gameplay of league of legends the setting has gone through two phases the original setting that was canon from 20092014 and the rebooted setting from 2014–present 36 the original setting was very focused on justifying the exact mechanics of a game of league in the world of runeterra the moba predecessor to league defense of the ancients featured two warring sides with two separate hero rosters however in league any combination of champions was legal to create a team to explain this in the original setting valoran was functionally ruled by extremely powerful time mages who could intimidate the other nations into compliance with their whims they created the institute of war also known as the league of legends to resolve disputes and act as something like an international sports league in these disputes summoners aka the game player could control any of runeterras greatest heroes or villains in their struggles thus justifying why a team of 5 characters who all hated each other might form additionally these time mages would actually powerdown the characters to level 1 before each match to make things fair some characters backstories even involved them explicitly having their powers sealed by the institute of war due to them being too powerful otherwise such as the demigoddesses kayle and morgana this explained why characters might participate in multiple matches and have to relearn the same skills each time after a match a judgment would sometimes be handed down with the winning summoners able to give land and privileges to those they favored the narrative team at riot eventually decided this setup was too constraining and rebooted the story behind league of legends in 2014 37 in essence the original story put too much emphasis on the faceless player standin summoners and the time mages of the institute the very idea of allpowerful summoners made champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers 36 any interesting champions the narrative team created were rendered as secondary mere servants to the summoners unable to influence their own destiny many champions lore did not give them reason to join the institute such as serial killer fire spirit brand or void monster reksai riot wished to let champions take the center stage and have stories of their own pursuing their own unique goals for example riot has since released a plotline about a lost empire in the shurima desert 38 and a plotline about a clash between the pirate gangplank and the piratehunter miss fortune in the city of bilgewater 39 both of which were driven by the champions of league of legends not summoners riot compared this style of narrative to comic book characters and classic literature where interesting characters can have many adventures over time and not necessarily have all of them make sense in the same continuity 36 a side effect of this is that the game and story aren’t onetoone copies of each other 36the world of runeterra consists of a number of countries and citystates locked in a web of rivalry alliance and conflict 40 the two largest and most powerful entities are the states of demacia and noxus who have fought wars in the past and are in a cold war esque state currently with each seeking to quietly undermine the other demacia is inspired by an idealized medieval european kingdom while noxus is reminiscent of the roman empire demacian champions tend to value themes like chivalry and honor while noxus prides itself on vision might and guile 41 42 piltover and zaun are a citystate at the forefront of technology piltover the respectable half of the city has a steampunk style while zaun the neglected undercity of piltover is a darker vision of the power of technology engaging in ethically questionable research 43 the freljord is an icy domain riven by a threeway civil war between rival claimant queens ashe sejuani and lissandra 44 bandle city is a peaceful domain of yordles a race of small humanoids unique to league of legends ionia is an island nation with a strong connection to magic and features champions inspired by monk and ninja archetypes as well the vastaya a race of animalhuman hybrid creatures also unique to league of legends 45 bilgewater is a port town with a pirate theme the shadow isles is an island chain that was magically corrupted and has become haunted by a malign force known as the black mist which leeches life and empowers the undead 46 targon is an ancient mountain peak with a greek mythology theme shurima is a recently resurrected empire that was until recently lost to the desert with a somewhat egyptian theme 47 icathia is another fallen and abandoned city where void monsters from another dimension have crossed into runeterra with a lovecraftian theme 48of the current maps summoners rift is set at the institute of war from the original league storyline the twisted treeline is set in the shadow isles 49 and the howling abyss map is set in the frejlord 24development the games developer riot games was cofounded by brandon ryze beck and marc tryndamere merrill who were roommates while they attended the university of southern california they partnered with steve guinsoo feak the previous designer of the popular warcraft iii the frozen throne custom map defense of the ancients and steve pendragon mescon the administrator of the former official support base for the map to develop league of legends 50the original inspiration for dot a was a 1998 mod for star craft created by community member aeon64 called aeon of strife 51 after the release of warcraft iii reign of chaos and its subsequent world editor in 2002 dot a was created by another modder eul he ported and expanded the aeon of strife mod to the new engine and named it defense of the ancients guinsoo later made dot a allstars by inserting his own mix of content to dot a greatly expanding the number of heroes added recipes and items and introduced various gameplay changes guinsoo then passed the mod to ice frog after accepting a job at the newly formed riot games 52the idea of a spiritual successor to defense of the ancients was that it would be its own standalone game with its own engine rather than another mod of warcraft iii began to materialize at the end of 2005 league of legends was born when a couple of very active dot a community members believed that the gameplay was so much fun and so innovative that it represented the spawning of a new genre and deserved to be its own professional game with significantly enhanced features and aroundgame services 53riot games officially opened its office in september 2006 and as of 2013 has over 1000 people working on league of legends 54 according to marc merrill when creating the various champions in the game instead of leaving the champion creation to just a few people they decided to open up the champion creation process to everyone in the company based upon a template where they could vote on which champions made it into the game  citation neededleague of legends was
