difference between sugar and starch posted on december 23 2013 by yash last updated on december 23 2013starch vs sugar starch and sugars are two types of carbohydrates found in food carbohydrates are the organic compounds made up of carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen o in the ratio of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms for every one carbon atom ch 2 o this ratio is characteristic for each and every carbohydrate for example the sugar glucose has the chemical formula c 6 h 12 o 6 where c h o is in the ratio of 121 sugar is the monomer unit of complex carbohydrates the sugar molecules are assembled to form complex carbohydrates there are two types of carbohydrates found in food 1 simple carbohydrates which include sugars and 2 complex carbohydrates which include starches and fiber starch starch is polysaccharides which contains long carbohydrate chains of glucose plants store starch as their energy source which is used during plant growth and reproduction several types of starch storages are found in plants including grains legumes and tubers the two forms of starch found in plants are amylose and amylopectin amylose is composed of long unbranched chains of glucose molecules whereas amylopectin is made up of long branched chains of glucose molecules in plants amylose to amylopectin ratio is about 14 but the proportion can vary depending on the plant species for example wheat flour contains a large amount of amylose whereas the rice flour contains a large amount of amylopectin sugar sugars are the simple carbohydrates which contain a single sugar molecule or two joined sugar molecules based on that the simple sugars can be divided into two categories monosaccharides and disaccharides monosaccharides are the sugars that cannot be broken down during the digestion the most common three types of monosaccharides are glucose fructose and galactose all these sugars have the same chemical formula c6 h 12 o 6 but different atomic arrangements disaccharides are the sugars that contain two monosaccharide units linking together by a glycosidic bond the three disaccharides that are important in human nutrition are sucrose common table sugar lactose major sugar in milk and maltose product of starch digestion these simple sugars are naturally present in fruits milk and other foods and can act as monomers which link together to form complex carbohydrates called polysaccharides what is the difference between starch and sugar• starch is a complex carbohydrate whereas sugar is a simple carbohydrate• starch is made up of long chains of simple sugar called glucose whereas sugar can be made up of either a single sugar molecule or two simple sugar molecules linking together by a glycosidic bond• two types of starch are amylose and glycogen whereas two types of sugars are monosaccharide and disaccharide• starch can be further digested into simple sugars unlike the sugar monosaccharide• polymerization of simple sugars glucose forms the starch• starch is the storage source of energy whereas sugar is the direct energy source • starch has no sweet taste but sugar does• sugar has no or single glycosidic bond whereas starch has many glycosidic bonds related posts difference between glass and crystal difference between sugar and sugar alcohol difference between amylase and amylose difference between amylose and amylopectin difference between ionization energy and electron affinity help us to improve our writing please rate  1 votes average 500 out of 5cite this page difference between sugar and starch difference between com december 23 2013  httpwwwdifferencebetweencomdifferencebetweensugarandstarch filed under chemistry tagged with starch sugar sugar and starch
