fact checking occupy democrats denmark something that i believe needs to happen is a fact check on these economic memes it’s sad to me that there are many people who would actually lead the people in accordance with their own agenda instead of informing people of the truth my findings will always be the truth whether they agree with my views or not i am always welcoming a fact check on my work as well you won’t find this with those who care about the education of others first on the list of fact checking economic memes is denmark the meme suggests that denmark is the world’s happiest nation because the minimum wage is 20 per hour there are 33hour work weeks and there’s free college healthcare and childcare before saying “let’s copy them” we need to understand a few things in comparison with the united states denmark vs us population according to the cia world factbook the population of denmark as of july 2014 is estimated at 5569077 for a little perspective the state of washington had an estimated population of 7061530 the united states has a population of 318857056 it’s hard to compare and contrast legislation and policies with these two nations because the population is extremely different obamacare is a prime example of taking legislation that works for a population the size of a state and applying it to an entire nation massachusetts has a population of 6745408 it’s a little larger than denmark but it will work for our comparison what’s called “romneycare” the massachusetts version of obamacare that inspired the national policy works for massachusetts however the idea of obamacare lowering the costs of insurance just didn’t work there is no incentive for insurance companies to have lower premiums because they can start acting like an oligopoly which like gas stations increase their prices when others increase prices long story short it’s not always a good idea to take a great piece of legislation that works for one smaller population and amplify it denmark vs us economy something that we need to understand is the economy of both the us and denmark in terms of gdp the us had a gdp of 1746 trillion while denmark had a gdp of 3472 billion just as a reminder 1 trillion is the same of 1 billion times 1000 there’s also something else that’s interesting to me unemployment and poverty the unemployment rate of denmark in april 2015 was 63 percent in april 2015 the united states had an unemployment rate of 54 percent in denmark the population below the poverty line was 134 percent while in the united states it was 151 percent before occupy democrats starts jumping for joy over one little data point one should ask themselves “why are these rates so high and close to the rates of a nation that has a population of more than 50 times its own” we’ll revisit this question a little later addressing the meme finally we can start to address the meme and check it i don’t mean to mislead anybody but when i say that i’m fact checking occupy democrats i’m not just going to double check on the data no we need to understand whether or not it’s a good move for the united states in order to fully understand this we need to dive deep into each part20 minimum wage believe it or not the minimum wage in denmark really is 20 per hour many minimum wage increase opposers will say that it makes everything else more expensive in a nutshell yes it can however it’s not always an immediate spark of inflation either way it’s important to note that denmark actually is an expensive country in fact copenhagen is among the five most expensive cities in the world for a quick comparison on the cost of living numbeo is my source you can view the numbeo pages by clicking on the links provided in the country names the currency on numbeo has been left as danish krone dkk because i will convert it into us dollars using the exchange rates that are current as i’m writing currently 1 dkk is equal to 015 us dollars 15¢ in denmark the average price of an inexpensive meal at a restaurant is 100 dkk which is 15 in the united states this average price is just 10 a meal at mc donalds in denmark is around 65 dkk which is 975 in the united states this price is 650 rent believe it or not is relatively cheaper on a national scale in denmark than in the united states but this could be due to possible government subsidies with a lot of small businesses in the united states opposing a 15 minimum wage there are currently cities that are forcing this minimum wage into law the reason why it wouldn’t work out so well in the united states is because it’s too high of an increase in too short of an amount of time when this happens it instantly doubles the cost of labor on businesses this means that either prices need to increase or the number of employees needs to be cut down or both smaller increases over a very long period of time would be best for a 15 minimum wage33hour work week first what is the average work week in denmark while many sources such as cnn  and sources that use cnn as a source say that it’s 33 hours per week the average was 345 hours per week in 2006 this is according to euro found a european union eu agency that provides “knowledge in the area of social and workrelated policies” of course the average hours per week may have dropped to 33 hours per week since then let’s do a little math before taxes 20 per hour gets you 660 per week or 2640 per month this would equate to 17600 dkk per month according to numbeo the average posttax income for denmark is 2071322 dkk per month or 310699 per month this means that posttax the average hourly wage in denmark that is currently being paid is 2354 per hour this doesn’t seem like much more but as we can see it results in an extra 460 after taxes would a 33hour work week be good for the united states it really depends it would make life difficult for business owners that offered 10hour shifts i once had a job in security working 10hour shifts i worked four days per week for jobs like this i could see cuts being made to three days per week no matter what anybody that is working 40 hours per week will take a pay cut even if it’s only 7 hours fewer per week however the benefit would be that if you had 10 people that worked 40 hours per week cut down to 33 that would create an opening for 70 hours to be worked which is two more people that could be hired this benefit will always seem small to the people losing hours free university according to study in denmarkdk college is tuition free for students from the eu and switzerland tuition is anywhere between 8000 to 21000 per year if you don’t qualify however there are some news sources such as business insider that claim that this is actually hurting denmark’s economy according to business insider many in industry and politics feel like this is hurting its economy because it’s a “free lunch”for those that aren’t aware something you hear quite often in economics courses is “there is no free lunch” this means that no matter what anybody says somebody had to pay for that free item it may be paid for in the cost of labor manufacturing or whatever else but somebody actually paid for it many believe that if you are given a “free lunch” you won’t really appreciate what’s been given to you and throw it away without a second thought the united states may have a huge issue if it started to institute tuitionfree college it really all depends on who would stay in school and who would drop out we would also see colleges become much more selective since there would be a huge surge of students applying for college not everybody can be accepted if the university were to have an influx of applicants and it could only accept a certain amount of students then the university would reject more people either way this could create a huge mess if not handled properly one result would be higher tax rates which will be addressed later free childcare and healthcare there is free healthcare in denmark but again it ties in with the high tax rate no nation can provide free healthcare and keep taxes low there usually aren’t enough people donating money to make it work like that there’s no incentive to again a little later i will address the tax rates of denmark“there is no free lunch”before celebrating and thinking about learning danish tomorrow it’s important to understand that denmark has a very high tax rate according to the us embassy in denmark the tax rate ranges between 45 percent and 56 percent this is not something that denmark hides denmark states this very plainly on its nation’s website the basic principle of the danish welfare system often referred to as the scandinavian welfare model is that all citizens have equal rights to social security within the danish welfare system a number of services are available to citizens free of charge this means that for instance the danish health and educational systems are free the danish welfare model is subsidised by the state and as a result denmark has one of the highest taxation levels in the world remember when i mentioned that the average posttax income in denmark was 310699 per month i’m not sure how denmark’s tax brackets work but i know that if the tax rate was 46 percent then the pretax amount of 310699 is 575369 if the tax rate was 56 percent the pretax amount of 310699 is 706134 keeping this in mind with the minimum wage in denmark 20 per hour is only pretax after taxes you’re really only making between 880 and 1080 per hour something isn’t working right for denmark earlier i mentioned that those living below the poverty line and the rate of unemployment in denmark is close to the united states’s rates why is that i understand that in a nation where the population is small it’s easier to get higher rates like that but japan isn’t like that japan has a population of 127103388 an unemployment rate of 36 percent and 161 percent of its people living below the poverty line 2013 estimate sure japan’s poverty rate is higher than that of the united states but the unemployment rate is low and there are many more people in japan than there are in denmark japan keeps its minimum wage low because it sometimes forces prices to stay low which controls inflation either way if the 20 minimum wage really is doing so much good in denmark then why is there so much unemployment and poverty in a nation of 5569077 134 percent is 74625632 people so is the welfare state really a good way to go if it’s not really lowering the amount of people in poverty i don’t believe so if it isn’t really working the way it’s “supposed to” in denmark then why would it work in the united states america shouldn’t follow denmark’s lead the united states already can’t afford a lot of things why should it go deeper into debt it’s already going to take a long time to pay it off that is if the government even plans on paying it off internationally it’s not a good idea to have such high amounts of debt because other nations may begin to feel as if they own a piece of the united states if this were to stir up tensions it could eventually lead to war free healthcare and tuitionfree college are longterm goals of many americans but is it feasible obamacare was intended to provide healthcare to those who couldn’t afford it but the promise included lowering premiums everywhere else and they have been increasing some increased by triple digits when many thought they were getting a tripledigit decrease who’s to say that this wouldn’t happen with college tuition i don’t believe that we’ll be able to find a way to make tuitionfree college or completely free healthcare work in the united states but i do believe that the price tag on both should be lowered creating laws that state pharmaceutical companies are forbidden to advertise could keep the cost of medication down better budgeting and use of income from collegiate sports could help lower tuition for everybody either way americans need to think about how we could lower the cost of these two things before they can be offered at no cost to the recipients occupy democrats denmark analysis in short occupy democrats mean well with this meme however i think that more research needed to be done as i mentioned earlier the tax rate in denmark for everybody ranges between 45 percent and 46 percent there is no way that the united states could do this with that kind of tax rate because we would then have 880 per hour earned after taxes this is lower than the minimum wage in washington and oregon as many of my readers know i believe that organizations like this create memes either based upon ignorance or having a knowledge of what’s going on and not caring either way the american public for the most part doesn’t know any better and would believe it because it aligns with their personal beliefs so it must be true this is why i’ve begun searching for occupy democrats economic memes to
