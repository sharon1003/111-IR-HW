according to legend glorifying the counts of laval mediaeval chroniclers portrayed the citizens of laval as being the offspring of charles martel s grandson wala of corbie by virtue of the chroniclers accounts laval should be a synonym for vala or valla—the two spelling variants of wala 5etymologically spoken however the name of laval in all likelihood merely stands for the valley in french la vallée in contemporary language to capture the lush valley of the mayenne river wherein laval is situated this name commonly appears in other french location names sometimes with a second word such as in lavaldaurelle  ardèche or lavalsurdoulon  hauteloire  6the first mention of the town was the latin vallis guidonis meaning guys valley because the counts of laval were all called guy on its side

castle stands the urban structure there dates back from the middle ages and is limited to the western bank of the mayenne river this old core is today the main shopping area with several pedestrian streets and little shops several medieval halftimbered houses are still visible but most of the buildings are dating from the 18th and 19th centuries and are made of tufa the suburb of avesnières located one kilometer 06 miles south of the castle is a former commune which merged with laval in 1863 founded in 1073 it still comprises several old houses and a medieval basilica other large medieval hamlets absorbed by the town include le bourg hersend and saintmartin the eastern bank of the mayenne was also settled in the middle ages along the street that leads to the bridge crossing the river but it was mostly developed during the second half of the 19th century when the train station was built there the old faubourgs surrounding the town centre date from the same period and are mainly composed of individual houses the 20thcentury suburbs comprise some council estates but individual houses are much more common some shopping centres and several industrial areas are located on the outskirts of the town laval is encircled by a small ring road and the paris  rennes highway bypasses the town by the north until the 20th century laval had had a port on the mayenne river which was surrounded by several factories mainly linen manufactures the old industrial areas were redeveloped after 1970 and the river has since become a recreational area aerial view of the lycée douanier rousseau on the eastern bank of the mayenne river the medieval town is still encircled by several portions of city walls view on the mayenne river and on the faubourg of avesnières south of the centre

12the largest park is the jardin de la perrine located in the centre at the top of a rocky promontory formerly a private garden it encircles an 18thcentury mansion and comprises a french and an

editthe coat of arms of laval the coat of arms of laval is gules a lion passant guardant the coat of arms were those of the house of laval and not to the city still several members of the family permitted the town to use their arms notably in 1211 when the direct branch died and in 1464 15the house of laval had a motto eadem mensura of same measure which is sometimes associated with the town of laval in 1987 the municipality adopted a logotype replaced in 2010 by a new one which uses the heraldic lion as well as the palindrome as the two symbols of laval this logotype is made of laval written in capital letters with the final l held by the lion and reversed to suggest the palindrome 16middle ages  editthe castle of laval and its 13thcentury keep before the construction of the castle during the 11th century laval did not exist however the site of the town was already a thoroughfare because it was located on the roman road that connected le mans to corseul a provincial capital in presentday brittany 17 moreover some parts of the city territory had been settled by the gauls for instance a gallic stele has been unearthed in the suburb of pritz north of the centre 18 the chapel of pritz was on its side first mentioned in 710 19 the body of tudwal a breton saint is believed to have been brought to laval in 870 or 878 during a norman invasion in brittany 20guy ii of laval second lord of the town after a seal from 1095 the site of laval had a strategic importance because the travelers taking the roman road had to cross there the mayenne river on a ford the western bank of the river was further dominated by a rocky promontory which could ensure a total control on the ford during the 10th century a first military structure was built on it and a villa was mentioned there at the end of the century in a charter issued by the count of maine around 1020 herbert i of maine offered the new barony of laval to guy i who became the first lord of the town guy i of laval built a new castle and the town slowly appeared around the roman road and on the river banks 21the castle built by guy i was much wider than the presentday structure it was encircled by an earthen wall and it spread from the presentday keep to the cathedral a motte built over the wall commanded the access to the top of the promontory where the lords lived and the second motte was probably located inside the compound 22 the basilica in avesnières located several kilometers south of the castle was founded in the 12th century by guy iii around 1200 the earthen wall was pulled down and the castle became smaller taking its presentday appearance the town developed on its side its own defense system 21beatrix of gavere the wife of guy ix de laval who lived in the 13th century is believed to be at the origin of the textile tradition of the town born in flanders she would have brought flemish weavers with her and would have encouraged linen production linen weaving remained the main economic activity of the town until the 19th century 23during the hundred years war the town was taken by the english in 1428 commended by john talbot it became french again a year later the fighting occasioned great damages and the town was fully rebuilt afterwards thus all the halftimbered houses that still stand in the medieval centre were not built before the 15th century 21 during that period the towns walls were completed by the addition of a powerful artillery fort in an innovative design known as the tour renaise around 1450 guy xiv de laval had the castle refurbished new rooms and halls were built and new gothic windows were opened on the courtyard at the beginning of the 16th century 22modern period  editguy xvii count of laval between 1531 and 1547 portrait by françois clouet guy xvii built a renaissance gallery in extension to the castle around 1542 the gallery was later slightly redecorated in 1747 22 guy xvii was a member of the court of francis i one of the greatest kings of the french renaissance the house of laval played a certain role in the development of the renaissance arts in the region jean of lavalchâteaubriant built for instance a large palace at the château de châteaubriant located in brittany on his side guy xix became a huguenot during the 17th century laval became very prosperous and the counterreformation led to the foundation of many religious institutions large convents were opened including ursulines benedictines and capuchins all these convents were later sold and demolished during the french revolution during the 18th century the town which had kept its medieval appearance started to expand new faubourgs appeared and the local aristocracy built there many elegant hôtels particuliers particularly around the place de hercé which became the most fashionable area of laval 21in the middle of the 18th century laval had around 18000 inhabitants and 3525 households it was the second most populous town in maine after le mans it enjoyed several institutions such as a présidial an office of the ferme générale a local jurisdiction a hospital a gendarmery and a city hall laval was also at the head of a pays délection fiscal region encompassing 65 parishes in southern maine because it was located close to the breton border laval had a large salt storehouse which controlled the collect of the gabelle a tax on salt because brittany was a large salt producer it was exempted from gabelle but people living in maine or other hinterland provinces had to buy a certain amount of salt every year thus paying the gabelle was compulsory for them a salt storehouse such as the one in laval was therefore a tax office and it had to deal with salt contraband 26 fairs were held each year in the pays délection and three markets were held in the town at that time laval was made up of three parishes 24the hôtel dargentré is one of the numerous hôtels particuliers built in laval during the 18th century the textile industry in laval reached its zenith just before the french revolution the town had the right to produce eight sorts of cloth including the royales and demihollande which were among the finest linen weaved in france the neighbouring towns of mayenne and châteaugontier also had the right to produce linen but in only three or four kinds of cloth 24the royales and demihollande were the best linen of laval as well as the most expensive a demihollande could cost up to 700 pounds and a toile forte the cheapest one had a worth of 50 pounds the other sorts of linen made in laval were also cheap and of a low quality but they represented the largest share of the total production the linen of laval were sold mainly in france but also abroad the rustic nonbattues were only made for the spanish market some of the best linen were sold in portugal and the stronger clothes were exported to the french colonies in america the royales and the demihollande were usually sold in troyes senlis and beauvais three towns located around paris which were renowned for their markets laval also produced a specific kind of linen the pontivy for the french army 24in the 18th century the old medieval centre was still encircled by city walls and its narrow plots and streets forbade any large urban transformation however the authorities planned to build a large thoroughfare bypassing the centre by the north that involved the construction of a new bridge on the mayenne river because at that time laval only had one which was small and very old the project was validated in 1758 but works did not start before 1804 the idea of a new axis was important not only for the town but also for the whole region because laval was on the road between paris and brittany every traveler taking that road had to cross the mayenne river on the old bridge and to cross the insalubrious and narrow walled town 21the war in the vendée which opposed french revolutionaries and royalist catholics during the last decade of the 18th century started in the département of vendée located south of the loire but it quickly spread in brittany anjou and maine which were catholic strongholds laval which had been under the control of the revolutionaries since 1789 was seized by the royalists the 22 october 1793 the town was on their itinerary to the english channel where they were waiting for reinforcement however the expedition to normandy was a total failure and they were defeated there by the republican army the royalists came back to laval the 25 december 1793 but they lost a siege in angers and were definitely defeated in 1794 contemporary period  editlaval as seen from the railway viaduct in the 19th century with the place du 11novembre then place de lhôteldeville  the mayenne river the bridges the castle and the cathedral after the french revolution the local authorities decided to achieve the master plan planned in the 18th century the new bridge was completed in 1824 and the new eastwest axis bypassing the old centre by the north was developed during the 1820s and 1830s a new town centre emerged on the axis and a new square was built close to the bridge several official buildings were constructed around including a new city hall the préfecture and a theatre around the new bridge the mayenne river was deviated to form a straight waterway and new quays were built between 1844 and 1863 after 1850 major works were carried in the medieval centre several new streets were built and the square in front of the castle was enlarged 21 in 1855 laval obtained a diocese and a railway station that year trains coming from paris had their terminus in laval but the line was further extended towards brittany in 1856 laval experienced a significant demographic growth throughout the 19th century it had 15000 inhabitants around 1800 and that figure rose to 21293 in 1861 two years later the neighbouring communes of avesnières and grenoux were absorbed into laval together with parts of changé as a consequence of this amalgamation laval counted 27000 inhabitants by 1863 in 1866 the town numbered 30627 inhabitants but then it experienced a slight decline which lasted until the end of the second world war 21 this decline was due to both socioeconomical and geopolitical factorsthe decline of the textile industry at the beginning of the 19th century linen prices dropped and the region stopped to produce flax instead the factories in laval imported cotton but process costs were too high for the activity to be profitablethe invasions of germany and ensuing costs caused by these invasions both in terms reparations and the human misery 25at the beginning of the 20th century laval had several institutions such as courts of justice a chamber of commerce a board of tradearbitrators a seminary and a secondary school for boys the declining textile industry was still employing 10000 hands in laval and its suburbs other activities included metalfounding flourmilling tanning dyeing the making of boots and shoes and the sawing of marble 26during the second world war laval was occupied by nazi germany the town was bombed several times by the allies in june and july 1944 the train station and the surrounding area as well as the viaduct and some streets in the centre were heavily damaged general patton s troops arrived in laval the 6 august 1944 the german occupiers did not surrender immediately and they destroyed the bridges before leaving the town at around 3pm after the war laval experienced a quick industrialisation most of the old cloth factories were closed down and the town developed instead a large food processing sector particularly dairies it also developed plastics processing and car manufacturing during that period the town quickly
