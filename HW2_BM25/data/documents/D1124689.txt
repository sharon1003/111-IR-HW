of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation treatment with campral should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support the efficacy of campral in promoting abstinence has not been demonstrated in subjects who have not undergone detoxification and not achieved alcohol abstinence prior to beginning campral treatment the efficacy of campral in promoting abstinence from alcohol in polysubstance abusers has not been adequately assessed dosage and administrationthe recommended dose of campral is two 333 mg tablets each dose should total 666 mg taken three sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed times daily a lower dose may be effective in some patients although dosing may be done without regard to meals dosing with meals was employed during clinical trials and is suggested in those patients who regularly eat three meals daily treatment with campral should be initiated as soon as possible after the period of alcohol withdrawal when the patient has achieved abstinence and should be maintained if the patient relapses campral should be used as part of a comprehensive psychosocial treatment program dosage in renal impairment for patients with moderate renal impairment creatinine clearance of 3050 m lmin a starting dose of one 333 mg tablet taken

development and milder forms of neurological and behavioral disorders in humans there are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women campral should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus nonteratogenic effects a study conducted in pregnant mice that were administered acamprosate calcium by the oral route starting on day 15 of

delivery is unknown nursing mothers in animal studies acamprosate was excreted in the milk of lactating rats dosed orally with acamprosate calcium the concentration of acamprosate in milk compared to blood was 131 it is not known whether acamprosate is excreted in human milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk caution should be exercised when campral is administered to a nursing woman pediatric use the safety and efficacy of campral have not been established in the pediatric population geriatric use fortyone of the 4234 patients in doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trials of campral were 65 years of age or older while none were 75 years of age or over there were too few patients in the ≥ 65 age group to evaluate any differences in safety or effectiveness for geriatric patients compared to younger patients this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function see clinical pharmacology adverse

populations and clinical pharmacologydigestive disease myths slideshow pictures10 facts about the amazing brain weight gain shockers slideshow clinical pharmacology clinical pharmacologymechanism of action the mechanism of action of acamprosate in maintenance of alcohol abstinence is not completely understood chronic alcohol exposure is hypothesized to alter the normal balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition and studies in animals have provided evidence to suggest acamprosate may interact with glutamate and gaba neurotransmitter systems centrally and has led to the hypothesis that acamprosate restores this balance in vitro in vivo pharmacodynamics pharmacodynamic studies have shown that acamprosate calcium reduces alcohol intake in alcoholdependent animals in a dosedependent manner and that this effect appears to be specific to alcohol and the mechanisms of alcohol dependence acamprosate calcium has negligible observable central nervous system cns activity in animals outside of its effects on alcohol dependence exhibiting no anticonvulsant antidepressant or anxiolytic activity the administration of acamprosate calcium is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence in animal studies campral did not produce any evidence of withdrawal symptoms in patients in clinical trials at therapeutic doses post marketing data collected retrospectively outside the u s have provided no evidence of campral abuse or dependence campral is not known to cause alcohol aversion and does not cause a disulfiramlike reaction as a result of ethanol ingestion pharmacokinetics absorption the absolute bioavailability of campral after oral administration is about 11 steadystate plasma concentrations of acamprosate are reached within 5 days of dosing steadystate peak plasma concentrations after campral doses of 2 x 333 mg tablets three times daily average 350 ngm l and occur at 38 hours postdose coadministration of campral with food decreases bioavailability as measured by cmax and auc by approximately 42 and 23 respectively the food effect on absorption is not clinically significant and no adjustment of dose is necessary distribution the volume of distribution for acamprosate following intravenous administration is estimated to be 72 109 liters approximately 1 lkg plasma protein binding of acamprosate is negligible metabolism acamprosate does not undergo metabolism elimination after oral dosing of 2 x 333 mg of campral the terminal halflife ranges from approximately 2033 hours following oral administration of campral the major route of excretion is via the kidneys as acamprosate special populations gender campral does not exhibit any significant pharmacokinetic differences between male and female subjects age the pharmacokinetics of campral have not been evaluated in a geriatric population however since renal function diminishes in elderly patients and acamprosate is excreted unchanged in urine acamprosate plasma concentrations are likely to be higher in the elderly population compared to younger adults pediatrics the pharmacokinetics of campral have not been evaluated in a pediatric population renal impairment  peak plasma concentrations after administration of a single dose of 2 x 333 mg campral tablets to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment were about 2fold and 4fold higher respectively compared to healthy subjects similarly elimination halflife was about 18fold and 26fold longer respectively compared to healthy subjects there is a linear relationship between creatinine clearance values and total apparent plasma clearance renal clearance and plasma halflife of acamprosate a dose of 1 x 333 mg campral three times daily is recommended in patients

desipramine naltrexone and 6beta naltrexol were unaffected following coadministration with campral however coadministration of campral with naltrexone led to a 33 increase in the cmax and a 25 increase in the auc of acamprosate no adjustment of dosage is recommended in such patients clinical studies the efficacy of campral in the maintenance of abstinence was supported by three clinical studies involving a total of 998 patients who were administered at least one dose of campral or placebo as an adjunct to psychosocial therapy each study was a doubleblind placebocontrolled trial in alcoholdependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were abstinent from alcohol on the day of randomization study durations ranged from 90 days to 360 days campral proved superior to placebo in maintaining abstinence as indicated by a greater percentage of subjects being assessed as continuously abstinent throughout treatment in a fourth study the efficacy of campral was evaluated in alcoholics including patients with a history of polysubstance abuse and patients who had not undergone detoxification and were not required to be abstinent at baseline this study failed
