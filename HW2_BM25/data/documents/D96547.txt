health diseases  conditions heart diseases what does a stress test consist of1 following 9 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer a stress test sometimes called a treadmill test or exercise test helps a doctor find out how well your heart handles work as your body works harder during the test it requires more oxygen so the heart must pump more blood the test can show if the blood supply is reduced in the arteries that supply the heart it also helps doctors know the kind and level of exercise appropriate for a patient a person taking the test is hooked up to equipment to monitor the heart walks slowly in place on a treadmill then the speed is increased for a faster pace and the treadmill is tilted to produce the effect of going up a small hill may be asked to breathe into a tube for a couple of minutes can stop the test at any time if needed afterwards will sit or lie down to have their heart and blood pressure checked heart rate breathing blood pressure electrocardiogram ecg or ekg and how tired you feel are monitored during the test healthy people who take the test are at very little risk its about the same as if they walk fast or jog up a big hill medical professionals should be present in case something unusual happens during the test a physician may recommend an exercise stress test to diagnose coronary artery disease diagnose a possible heartrelated cause of symptoms such as chest pain shortness of breath or lightheadedness determine a safe level of exercise check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve coronary artery circulation in patients with coronary artery disease predict risk of dangerous heartrelated conditions such as a heart attack depending on the results of the exercise stress test the physician may recommend more tests such as a nuclear stress test or cardiac catheterization thallium stress test this is a type of nuclear scanning test or myocardial perfusion imaging test it shows how well blood flows to the heart muscle its usually done along with an exercise stress test on a treadmill or bicycle the thallium stress test is useful to determine extent of a coronary artery blockage prognosis of patients whove suffered a heart attack effectiveness of cardiac procedures done to improve circulation in coronary arteries cause s of chest pain level of exercise that a patient can safely perform when the patient reaches his or her maximum level of exercise a small amount of a radioactive substance called thallium is injected into the bloodstream then the patient lies down on a special table under a camera gamma camera that can see the thallium and make pictures the thallium mixes with the blood in the bloodstream and hearts arteries and enters heart muscle cells if a part of the heart muscle doesnt receive a normal blood supply less than a normal amount of thallium will be in those heart muscle cells the first pictures are made shortly after the exercise test and show blood flow to the heart during exercise the heart is stressed during the exercise test — thus the name stress test the patient then lies quietly for 23 hours and another series of pictures is made these show blood flow to the heart muscle during rest if the test is normal during both exercise and rest then blood flow through the coronary arteries is normal the coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle if the test shows that perfusion blood flow is normal during rest but not during exercise a perfusion defect then the heart isnt getting enough blood when it must work harder than normal this may be due to a blockage in one or more coronary arteries if the test is abnormal during both exercise and rest theres limited blood flow to that part of the heart at all times if no thallium is seen in some part of the heart muscle the cells in this part of the heart are dead from a prior heart attack they have become scar tissue sometimes you cant do an exercise test because youre too sick or have physical problems in this case a drug such as dipyridamole or adenosine is given this drug increases blood flow to the heart and thus mimics an exercise test then the thallium test is given garry · 1 decade ago1 1 comment the stress test consist of starting out walking slowly on a treadmill and than the speed is increased the treadmill is than slanted and you are walking faster your blood pressure is being taken while you are on the treadmill and in your other heart arm an iv is inserted with some type of dye the doctor is watching the monitor to see your heart rate it doesnt hurt but it is tiresome if you feel that you cant continue walking on the treadmill they will stop the test but try to go as long as you can and place your hands and feets close to the bar on the treadmill  you wear a heart monitor while you are on the treadmill  it helps you are being monitor to see how your heart acts under stress and other things source s i had one recentlynanaofthree · 1 decade ago0 0 comment

make my veins show up on xray i then waited about 15 minutes so that it could get into my system then i was placed on a table where there was this big xray machine above me that moved and took pictures of my heart after this was completed i went into another room where they hooked me up to a heart monitor and blood pressure cup on my arm then i was put on the treadmill which started at a slow pace then speeded up and elevated it about half way through the test lasted about 10 or 15 minutes then they took me off and set me in a chair checking my blood pressure and heart rate until it was down to normal after the treadmill was completed they sent me to eat telling me to eat something greases so that it would help take the solution out of my body had to be back at doctors office in one hour after i atethey put me back on the same table under that big xray machine and took more xrays got my results from test the next day hope this helpscubby · 1 decade ago0 0 comment this site
