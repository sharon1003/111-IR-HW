toilets  marine toilets use  maintenance installation faqaccessories how to order sitemap water factalthough each septic system can make an insignificant contribution to groundwater contamination the sheer number of such systems and their widespread use in every area that does not have a public sewage treatment system makes them serious contamination sources epa citizens guide to ground water protection 1990testimonial linda ochs of homestead ny excel ne installed 1996one of the features i like about the sunmar nonelectric unit is the fact that it uses no electricity or water which saves hundreds of thousands of gallons of water as well as no additional electrical loads our house runs on solar power for electricity so this is an important feature mother nature composts naturally and this product follows along this guideline our society has a crazy system of dirtying clean water with our waste shipping it to a treatment plant adding potentially deadly chemicals to clean it up and then put it back into our waterways again this system is not an effective or efficient way to deal with our wastes if we could get the idea of composting as the way to deal with waste disposal we could save hundreds of thousands of gallons of water from going through the business as usual system i also wouldnt mind my photo that i am sending with this letter being used in your catalog i tell all my friends about my system and give tours of my home so people can see the environmentally friendly items that do exist and can be incorporated into their homes i put cedar closet boards behind the unit to help control possible odorsinsect problems and decorated the stack air vent with a silk ivy garland to make it blend in better with the decor there are two fulltime residents at our house so this unit works pretty well for our needs visiting friends and relatives are surprised there is no big odor problem and how simple the composting idea is the problem i see with most new or different environmentally friendly products is that society does not like change we are used to the status quo and dont want to have to do things differently nor do we want to know what happens to our waste a flush takes care of everything we think i urge people to take a tour of the sewer plants in their area and really see what happens to our resources i try to encourage people to take some kind of responsibility for their wastes and this is one way they can do that i havent had anyone actually purchase one to date and the most common answer is that they are very expensive compared to a standard system maybe if they had to pay their sewer bills out of their pocket instead of being hidden in their tax bill they might see the true cost and change their minds thats what i hope for linda s ochs3 types of composting toilets  which is best for you composting toilets for residential use are available in either selfcontained units or central composting systems selfcontained composting toilets selfcontained composting toilets are installed directly in the bathroom they are available in both electric and nonelectric versions electric units plug into a regular 3prong outlet to power a fan and a thermostaticallycontrolled heating element in the base of the unit usually you unplug the unit if it is not going to be used for a few days depending on the size of the unit power usage varies between 80150 watts composting capacity varies with the size of the biodrum electric units normally have more capacity than nonelectric units because they have extra warmth and air movement to enhance bacterial activity although stated composting capacities can be doubled for short periods sunmar recommends a margin of safety so choose a unit with more capacity than you think you need advantages of selfcontained units no plumbing required being waterless no plumbing or water connection is necessary this means the units are quick and easy to install since the only major task is to assemble the vent stack which comes with the unit economical there is no need to purchase a separate toilet so they are more economical than central units better suited to winter operation depending on your situation it may be easier to keep the bathroom warm in winter than to warm the space that houses a central composting unit approvals not normally required most units evaporate all liquids during seasonal operation since the whole waste stream is recycled approvals are not normally required easy to clean all selfcontained units have a bowl liner beneath the seat which can be removed for
