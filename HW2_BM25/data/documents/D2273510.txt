essenza c101 espresso maker nespresso accessories quick links nespresso aeroccino milk frother storage racks for your nespresso capsules more about your favourite brand of espresso machine one of the things that sets the nespresso range of coffee makers apart is their unique capsule system the way the coffee is ground and sealed within the foil container enables them to create a very consistent flavour time and time again some people prefer to grind their own beans and take full control over how they make their coffee and that’s fine for those who have the time and interest in doing so however nespresso seem to have identified a very large market of coffee lovers who either don’t have the time the interest or the skill in manually making a good espresso for these people the automated way in which nespresso machines work is perfect there are a handful of different models in the range and they each offer a varied set of features some machines offer the fully automated latte or cappuccino making experience by not only making the espresso shot but by also frothing and adding the milk to the cup too other machines will offer only the ability to make a simple espresso and you can also buy a separate aeroccino milk frother if you wish to do this part separately the brand has been made famous by some high profile celebrity endorsements but at the end of the day there needs to be a great cup of coffee behind it all to back it up – and this is why nespresso continue to grow and become more and more popular amongst busy folks who love coffee and want to have it made for them in style so let’s take a look at the nespresso range of espresso machines de longhi lattissima plus nespresso capsule system the lattissima nespresso espresso machine is the most popular and best selling model in the entire range – and for good reason it gives you the ultimate onebutton coffee making experience and can make all your favourite milkbased espresso drinks as well of course as a simple espresso we think it also looks pretty cool tooclick here to read our full review of the lattissima nespresso citi z automatic espresso maker the citi z is an amazingly elegant looking machine which is the first thing that will strike anyone reading this page now the main difference between the citi z and the lattissima is that the citi z will pull your espresso shot and with the attached aeroccino milk frother it will froth your milk but you will need to combine the two to make your cup of coffee the two functions are separate on the citi z the citi z also comes without the frother attached as it can also be bought separately making it a much more slim unit to keep on your kitchen counter if you are short on space to read our full review of the citi z click this link nespresso c60 pixie espresso maker the pixie is the smallest and most straight forward espresso machine in the range it has a small footprint great for people with limited kitchen space but does not suffer for its size as it still makes the most of the same nespresso capsules as every other machine and can pull a single shot in around 30 seconds if you want to make a milkbased drink you’ll need the aeroccino frother since the pixie is an espresso only machine but this machine is really designed for people who just want a straight shot of great espresso we recently did a full review of the pixie here nespresso essenza c101 espresso maker the final nespresso machine in our list is the cute little essenza functionally it’s pretty much the same as the pixie with the only real differences being in the styling the essenza does come in a manual and an automatic version and it’s not always clearly marked so pay attention to that if you are considering purchasing this unit it’s makes a great espresso as you would come to expect by now and the model we reviewed here comes with an optional aeroccino but you can also choose to have it without the nespresso aeroccino milk frother there are two models of aeroccino the aeroccino plus and the aeroccino 3 both of these machines offer a quick and easy method of turning cold milk into rich foamy warm froth perfect for pouring into your favourite nespresso shot in around a minute they really only differ in appearance and are priced similarly so the only two questions you really need to ask yourself are do you want to be able to make silky foam for your cappuccino’s and if so which one do you like the look of the most we recently did a writeup on the two frothers – click here to learn more about them
