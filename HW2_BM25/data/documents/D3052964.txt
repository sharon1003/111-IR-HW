limousines cars and automobiles how many people can fit into a limo12 answers chris preston formerly a professional chauffeur for about 6 years in austin and el paso answered oct 30 2015there are many things that can be considered a limo from a simple elegant sedan such as a lincoln town car to a private bus for the sake of this conversation ill assume you mean a traditional stretch limousine the thing is thats still a broad category the typical stretch limos ive seen are generally stretched by somewhere between 80 and 180 inches with a 120 stretch being pretty common these days inside such a car youll usually find a normal back seat at the very rear and a j seat running the length of the stretched section on one side usually along the drivers side and turning across the back of the drivers bench near the front of the car i recall our management quoting these cars with a capacity of 10 people with 10 people they would need to be of small to average size and be fairly comfortable rubbing elbows and legs together if youre dressed is flowing elegant gowns andor stuffy tuxedos you may want to plan on less than max capacity in the car if you want to arrive at your destination looking fresh if youre going clubbing dressed in more casual clothing and youre ok with being cramped on a dance floor most of the night anyway full capacity wont be such a big deal for you ive been out of the business for a few years but the dimensions of humans and cars havent changed all that much in the last decade so ill list some typical capacity quotes that i recall note all counts are maximums with pretty cozy seating and excludes the driver lincolncaddy sedan 4 passengers aka pax lincolncaddy 80 stretch 68 pax lincolncaddy 120 stretch 910 pax excursionescaladenavigator 180 stretch 16 pax 15pax van 14 pax mini bus 2228 pax i have also seen hummer limos that i would estimate may be stretched as much as 200 or more inches and probably can accommodate up to 20 pax but i have no direct experience with those limos performing a brief search i find that several limousine companies are quoting more conservative estimates for capacities and would agree that such estimates will ensure a more comfortable ride for all enjoy your event whatever it may be and dont forget to tip your driver well at least 20 if heshe gives good service58k views · view upvoters your response is
