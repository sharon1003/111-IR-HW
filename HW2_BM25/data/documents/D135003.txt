an acetyl moiety circled with dark green and a benzyloxy moiety circled with light orange other divisions can be made in organic chemistry functional groups are specific groups  moieties of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules the same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction s regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of 1 2 this allows for systematic prediction of chemical reactions and behavior of chemical compounds and design of chemical syntheses furthermore the reactivity of a functional group can be modified by other functional groups nearby in organic synthesis functional group interconversion is one of the basic types of transformations the atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds functional groups can also be charged eg in carboxylate salts –coo −  which turns the molecule into a polyatomic ion or a complex ion functional groups binding to a central atom in a coordination complex are called ligands complexation and solvation is also caused by specific interactions of functional groups in the common rule of thumb like dissolves like it is the shared or mutually wellinteracting functional groups which give rise to solubility for example sugar dissolves in water because both share the hydroxyl functional group –oh and hydroxyls interact strongly with each other combining the names of functional groups with the names of the parent alkanes generates what is termed a systematic nomenclature for naming organic compounds in traditional nomenclature the first carbon atom after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is called the alpha carbon the second beta carbon the third gamma carbon etc if there is another functional group at a carbon it may be named with the greek letter eg the gammaamine in gammaaminobutyric acid is on the third carbon of the carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group iupac conventions call for numeric labeling of the position eg 4aminobutanoic acid in traditional names various qualifiers are used to label isomers for example isopropanol iupac name propan2ol is an isomer of npropanol propan1ol contents  hide 1 table of common functional groups11 hydrocarbons12 groups containing halogen13 groups containing oxygen14 groups

tertbutyl bornyl cyclohexyl etc hydrocarbons may form charged structures positively charged carbocations or negative carbanions carbocations are often named um examples are tropylium and triphenylmethyl cations and the cyclopentadienyl anion groups containing halogen  edithaloalkanes are a class of molecule that is defined by a carbon– halogen bond this bond can be relatively weak in the case of an iodoalkane or quite stable as in the case of a fluoroalkane in general with the exception of fluorinated compounds haloalkanes readily undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions or elimination reactions the substitution on the carbon the acidity of an adjacent proton the solvent conditions etc all can influence the outcome of the reactivity chemical class group formula

the names of halides and substituents in larger molecules when the parent hydrocarbon is unsaturated the suffix yl ylidene or ylidyne replaces ane eg ethane becomes ethyl otherwise the suffix replaces only the final e eg  ethyne  becomes  ethynyl  4note that when used to refer to moieties multiple single bonds differ from a single multiple bond for example a methylene bridge methanediyl has two single bonds whereas a methylene group methylidene has one double bond suffixes can be combined as in methylidyne triple bond vs methylylidene single bond and double bond vs methanetriyl three single bonds there are some retained names such as methylene for methanediyl 1x phenylene for phenyl1xdiyl where x is 2 3 or 4 5 carbyne for methylidyne and trityl for triphenylmethyl chemical class group
