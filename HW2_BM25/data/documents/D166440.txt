from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search not to be confused with glycogenesis or glyceroneogenesis simplified gluconeogenesis pathway gluconeogenesis  gng is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from certain non carbohydrate carbon substrates from breakdown of proteins these substrates include glucogenic amino acids although not ketogenic amino acids  from breakdown of lipids such as triglycerides  they include glycerol although not fatty acids  and from other steps in metabolism they include pyruvate and lactate gluconeogenesis is one of several main mechanisms used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood glucose levels avoiding low levels  hypoglycemia  other means include the degradation of glycogen  glycogenolysis 1 and fatty acid catabolism gluconeogenesis is a ubiquitous process present in plants animals fungi bacteria and other microorganisms 2 in vertebrates gluconeogenesis takes place mainly in the liver and to a lesser extent in the cortex of the kidneys in ruminants this tends to be a continuous process 3 in many other animals the process occurs during periods of fasting starvation lowcarbohydrate diets or intense exercise the process is highly endergonic until it is coupled to the hydrolysis of atp or gtp effectively making the process exergonic for example the pathway leading from pyruvate to glucose6phosphate requires 4 molecules of atp and 2 molecules of gtp to proceed spontaneously gluconeogenesis is often associated with ketosis gluconeogenesis is also a target of therapy for type 2 diabetes such as the antidiabetic drug metformin which inhibits glucose formation and stimulates glucose uptake by cells 4 in ruminants because dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting lowcarbohydrate diets exercise etc 5contents  hide 1 precursors2 location3 pathway4 regulation5 see also6 references7 external links precursors  editcatabolism of proteinogenic amino acids amino acids are classified according to the abilities of their products to enter gluconeogenesis 6glucogenic amino acids have this ability ketogenic amino acids do not these products may still be used for ketogenesis or lipid synthesis some amino acids are catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic products in humans the main gluconeogenic precursors are lactate glycerol which is a part of the triacylglycerol molecule alanine and glutamine altogether they account for over 90 of the overall gluconeogenesis 7 other glucogenic amino acids as well as all citric acid cycle intermediates the latter through conversion to oxaloacetate can also function as substrates for gluconeogenesis 8 in ruminants propionate is the principal gluconeogenic substrate 5 9 generally consumption of gluconeogenic substrates in food does not result in increased gluconeogenesis 10lactate is transported back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase pyruvate the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway can then be used to generate glucose 8 transamination or deamination of amino acids facilitates entering of their carbon skeleton into the cycle directly as pyruvate or oxaloacetate or indirectly via the citric acid cycle the contribution of cori cycle lactate to overall glucose production increases with fasting duration 11 specifically after 12 20 and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers the contribution of cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis was 41 71 and 92 respectively 11whether evenchain fatty acids can be converted into glucose in animals has been a longstanding question in biochemistry 12 it is known that oddchain fatty acids can be oxidized to yield propionylco a a precursor for succinylco a which can be converted to pyruvate and enter into gluconeogenesis in plants specifically seedlings the glyoxylate cycle can be used to convert fatty acids  acetate into the primary carbon source of the organism the glyoxylate cycle produces fourcarbon dicarboxylic acids that can enter gluconeogenesis 8in 1995 researchers identified the glyoxylate cycle in nematodes 13 in addition the glyoxylate enzymes malate synthase and isocitrate lyase have been found in animal tissues 14 genes coding for malate synthase have been identified in other metazoans including arthropods echinoderms and even some vertebrates mammals found to possess these genes include monotremes  platypus and marsupials  opossum but not placental mammals genes for isocitrate lyase are found only in nematodes in which it is apparent they originated in horizontal gene transfer from bacteria the existence of glyoxylate cycles in humans has not been established and it is widely held that fatty acids cannot be converted to glucose in humans directly however carbon14 has been shown to end up in glucose when it is supplied in fatty acids 15 despite these findings it is considered unlikely that the 2carbon acetylco a derived from the oxidation of fatty acids would produce a net yield of glucose via the citric acid cycle – however acetylco a can be converted into pyruvate and lactate through the ketogenic pathway 12 16 put simply acetic acid in the form of acetylco a is used to partially produce glucose acetyl groups can only form part of the glucose molecules not the 5th carbon atom and require extra substrates such as pyruvate in order to form the rest of the glucose molecule but a roundabout pathway does lead from acetylco a to pyruvate via acetoacetate acetone hydroxyacetone acetol and then either propylene glycol or methylglyoxal 16 17 18location  editin mammals gluconeogenesis has been believed to be restricted to the liver 19 the kidney 19 the intestine 20 and muscle  citation needed but recent evidence indicates gluconeogenesis occurring in astrocytes of the brain 21 these organs use somewhat different gluconeogenic precursors the liver preferentially uses lactate alanine and glycerol especially alanine while the kidney preferentially uses lactate glutamine and glycerol especially glutamine 22 7 lactate from the cori cycle is quantitatively the largest source of substrate for gluconeogenesis especially for the kidney 7 the liver uses both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to produce glucose whereas the kidney only uses gluconeogenesis 7 after a meal the liver shifts to glycogen synthesis whereas the kidney increases gluconeogenesis 10 the intestine uses mostly glutamine and glycerol 20propionate is the principal substrate for gluconeogenesis in the ruminant liver and the ruminant liver may make increased use of gluconeogenic amino acids eg alanine when glucose demand is increased 23 the capacity of liver cells to use lactate for gluconeogenesis declines from the preruminant stage to the ruminant stage in calves and lambs 24 in sheep kidney tissue very high rates of gluconeogenesis from propionate have been observed 25in all species the formation of oxaloacetate from pyruvate and tca cycle intermediates is restricted to the mitochondrion and the enzymes that convert phosphoenolpyruvic acid pep to glucose are found in the cytosol 26 the location of the enzyme that links these two parts of gluconeogenesis by converting oxaloacetate to pep – pep carboxykinase pepck – is variable by species it can be found entirely within the mitochondria entirely within the cytosol or dispersed evenly between the two as it is in humans 26 transport of pep across the mitochondrial membrane is accomplished by dedicated transport proteins however no such proteins exist for oxaloacetate 26 therefore in species that lack intramitochondrial pepck oxaloacetate must be converted into malate or aspartate exported from the mitochondrion and converted back into oxaloacetate in order to allow gluconeogenesis to continue 26gluconeogenesis pathway with key molecules and enzymes many steps are the opposite of those found in the glycolysis pathway  editgluconeogenesis is a pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzymecatalyzed reactions the pathway will begin in either the liver or kidney in the mitochondria or cytoplasm of those cells this being dependent on the substrate being used many of the reactions are the reverse of steps found in glycolysis gluconeogenesis begins in the mitochondria with the formation of oxaloacetate by the carboxylation of pyruvate this reaction also requires one molecule of atp and is catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase this enzyme is stimulated by high levels of acetylco a produced in βoxidation in the liver and inhibited by high levels of adp and glucose oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using nadh a step required for its transportation out of the mitochondria malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate using nad  in the cytosol where the remaining steps of gluconeogenesis take place oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to form phosphoenolpyruvate using the enzyme pepck a molecule of gtp is hydrolyzed to gdp during this reaction the next steps in the reaction are the same as reversed glycolysis however fructose 16bisphosphatase converts fructose 16bisphosphate to fructose 6phosphate using one water molecule and releasing one phosphate in glycolysis phosphofructokinase 1 converts f6p and atp to f16bp and adp  this is also the ratelimiting step of gluconeogenesis glucose6phosphate is formed from fructose 6phosphate by phosphoglucoisomerase the reverse of step 2 in glycolysis glucose6phosphate can be used in other metabolic pathways or dephosphorylated to free glucose whereas free glucose can easily diffuse in and out of the cell the phosphorylated form glucose6phosphate is locked in the cell a mechanism by which intracellular glucose levels are controlled by cells the final reaction of gluconeogenesis the formation of glucose occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where glucose6phosphate is hydrolyzed by glucose6phosphatase to produce glucose and release an inorganic phosphate like two steps prior this step is not a simple reversal of glycolysis in which hexokinase catalyzes the conversion of glucose and atp into g6p and adp glucose is shuttled into the cytoplasm by glucose transporters located in the endoplasmic reticulums membrane  show metabolism of common monosaccharides including glycolysis gluconeogenesis glycogenesis and glycogenolysis regulation  editwhile most steps in gluconeogenesis are the reverse of those found in glycolysis three regulated and strongly endergonic reactions are replaced with more kinetically favorable reactions hexokinase  glucokinase phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase enzymes of glycolysis are replaced with glucose6phosphatase fructose16bisphosphatase and pep carboxykinase pyruvate carboxylase these enzymes are typically regulated by similar molecules but with opposite results for example acetyl co a and citrate activate gluconeogenesis enzymes pyruvate carboxylase and fructose16bisphosphatase respectively while at the same time inhibiting the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase this system of reciprocal control allow glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to inhibit each other and prevents a futile cycle of synthesizing glucose to only break it down the majority of the enzymes responsible for gluconeogenesis are found in the cytosol the exceptions are mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase and in animals phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase the latter exists as an isozyme located in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol 27 the rate of gluconeogenesis is ultimately controlled by the action of a key enzyme fructose16bisphosphatase which is also regulated through signal transduction by c amp and its phosphorylation global control of gluconeogenesis is mediated by glucagon  released when blood glucose is low  it triggers phosphorylation of enzymes and regulatory proteins by protein kinase a a cyclic amp regulated kinase resulting in inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis recent studies have shown that the absence of hepatic glucose production has no major effect on the control of fasting plasma glucose concentration compensatory induction of gluconeogenesis occurs in the kidneys and intestine driven by glucagon glucocorticoids and acidosis 28see also  editbioenergetics references  edit silva pedro the chemical logic behind gluconeogenesis archived from the original on august 26 2009 retrieved september 8
