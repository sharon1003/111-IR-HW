the peace bridge in fort erie ont corey larocquecpclément gignac special to the globe and mail published october 7 2013updated march 25 2017canada has become an attractive pole for immigrants from around the world who are looking for a host country that will give them good opportunities according to the organization for economic cooperation and development canadas annual immigration flow is now proportionately one of the highest among oecd members at 07 per cent of its population in 2011 there were 249000 new permanent residents after a record year of 281000 in 2010 the official planned admission range is between 240000 and 265000 new permanent residents a year that is not counting the 190800 temporary foreign workers that were admitted in 2011 as well as the 98400 foreign students who came to benefit from our universities and may decide to stay and put their skills to use in canadas industries there are many myths floating around about immigrants ranging from them being lowskilled workers to them having difficulty integrating into the labour force a quick read through the oecds 2013 international migration outlook debunks all of those myths – and makes the reader realize just how well canada is faring on the immigration front time to address unfounded myths about immigrants the oecd finds that employment for foreignborn canadian citizens has gone up since 2008 while it has stalled for nativeborn citizens see p71 here  the employment rate for canadian immigrants in 2012 was the third highest in the oecd this shows that immigrants are quickly integrating into the labour force and putting their skills to work for that matter it is worth noting that more than 50 per cent of canadian immigrants are highly educated putting canada at the top among the oecd countries as well a significant number of the almost 100000 foreign students visiting canada each year decide to stay after getting a degree from one of our worldclass universities mc gill university of toronto ubc etc many other immigrants are also looking in canadas direction attracted by job prospects and the openarm culture for which canadians are known one reason why foreign immigrants favour canada as a destination is the labour mobility it offers according to its latest global competitiveness report published last month the world economic forum ranks canada as the worlds seventh most efficient labour market high labourmarket efficiency means that workers are more likely to be allocated to their most effective use and provided with an environment where they are encouraged to give their best effort on a macroeconomic level this also means that the countrys work force is flexible enough to shift workers from one economic activity to another – for example from factories in quebec and ontario to oil sands in alberta – rapidly and at low cost it also means that there are strong incentives in place for employees promoting meritocracy and providing equity in the business environment canada has gone to great lengths to liberalize its labour market and it is paying off canadas labour market now offers a great deal of mobility to its workers it is quite easy for anyone to move from montreal to toronto calgary or vancouver and vice versa as a former quebec minister responsible for economic development and trade let me tell you that i am proud to have had the opportunity to work with my provincial counterparts on internal trade agreements fostering canadas economic ties and ultimately strengthening the federation positive implication on canadian economic growth – and real estate canadas strong economic performance since 2008 is explained by many factors including wellcapitalized banks massive public infrastructure spending – and a strong influx of immigrants immigration last year explained twothirds of canadas population growth of 12 per cent well ahead of the 07 per cent and 03 per cent seen in the united states and the euro zone respectively why is this so important because without this immigration flow canadas population aged between 20 and 44 years old would be declining that cohort which constitutes most of the labour force is the one that creates new households buys new houses has children and pays the greater part of taxation revenue without immigration canadas natural population growth would not be enough to sustain economic growth and welfare quebec given its demographic structure especially needs immigration to increase its labour force in the short term so as to sustain the costs of its social programs we also note that a large percentage of every provinces immigrants are in the 20to44 age group meaning that the benefits of household formation are spread all across canada this helps explain why the housing market in canada has been so resilient during the past five years i am happy to see that one of canadas strengths is clearly working in its favour as canadians we need foreign talent to sustain the countrys demographic and economic growth and we have just the labour market to attract it canadians need immigration just as much as immigrants need a destination such as canada immigration as it turns out is most likely the key to canadas prosperity clément gignac is senior vicepresident and chief economist at industrial alliance inc vicechairman of the world economic forum council on
