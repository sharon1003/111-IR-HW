asia have been in parts of the contemporary united states since the 17th century largescale immigration did not begin until the mid18th century nativist immigration laws during the 1880s–1920s excluded various asian groups eventually prohibiting almost all asian immigration to the continental united states after immigration laws were reformed during the 1940s–60s abolishing national origins

social and economic disparities among asian americans7 see also8 references9 further reading10 external links terminology  editas with other racial and ethnicity based terms formal and common usage have changed markedly through the short history of this term prior to the late 1960s people of asian ancestry were usually referred to as oriental asiatic and mongoloid 10 11 additionally the american definition of asian originally included west asian ethnic groups particularly afghan americans jewish americans armenian americans assyrian americans and arab americans although these groups are now considered middle eastern american 12 the term asian american was coined by historian yuji ichioka who is credited with popularizing the term to frame a new interethnicpanasian american selfdefining political group in the late 1960s 10 changing patterns of immigration and an extensive period of exclusion of asian immigrants have resulted in demographic changes that have in turn affected the formal and common understandings of what defines asian american for example since the removal of restrictive national origins quotas in 1965 the asianamerican population has diversified greatly to include more of the peoples with ancestry from various parts of asia 13today asian american is the accepted term for most formal purposes such as government and academic research although it is often shortened to asian in common usage 14 the most commonly used definition of asian american is the u s census bureau definition which includes all people with origins in the far east southeast asia and the indian subcontinent 8 this is chiefly because the census definitions determine many governmental classifications notably for equal opportunity programs and measurements according to the oxford english dictionary asian person in the united states is sometimes thought of as a person of east asian descent 15 16 in vernacular usage asian is often used to refer to those of east asian descent or anyone else of asian descent with epicanthic eyefolds 17 this differs from the u s census definition 8 18 and the asian american studies departments in many universities consider all those of east south or southeast asian descent to be asian 19census definition  editin the us census people with origins or ancestry in the far east southeast asia and the indian subcontinent are classified as part of the asian race 20 while those with origins or ancestry in north asia  russians siberians  central asia  kazakhs uzbeks turkmens etc  western asia  diaspora jews turks persians west asian arabs etc  and the caucasus  georgians armenians azeris are classified as white or middle eastern 21 22 as such asian and african ancestry are seen as racial categories for the purposes of the census since they refer to ancestry only from those parts of the asian and african continents that are outside the middle east and north africa before 1980 census forms listed particular asian ancestries as separate groups along with white and black or negro 23 asian americans had also been classified as other 24 in 1977 the federal office of management and budget issued a directive requiring government agencies to maintain statistics on racial groups including on asian or pacific islander 25 the 1980 census marked the first classification of asians as a large group combining several individual ancestry groups into asian or pacific islander by the 1990 census asian or pacific islander api was included as an explicit category although respondents had to select one particular ancestry as a subcategory 26 the 2000 census onwards separated the category into two separate ones asian american and native hawaiian and other pacific islander 27debates  editthe definition of asian american has variations that derive from the use of the word american in different contexts immigration status citizenship by birthright and by naturalization acculturation and language ability are some variables that are used to define american for various purposes and may vary in formal and everyday usage 28 for example restricting american to include only u s citizens conflicts with discussions of asian american businesses which generally refer both to citizen and noncitizen owners 29in a pbs interview from 2004 a panel of asian american writers discussed how some groups include people of middle eastern descent in the asian american category 30 asian american author stewart ikeda has noted the definition of asian american also frequently depends on whos asking whos defining in what context and why the possible definitions of asianpacific american are many complex and shifting some scholars in asian american studies conferences suggest that russians iranians and israelis all might fit the fields subject of study 31 jeff yang of the wall street journal writes that the panethnic definition of asian american is a unique american construct and as an identity is in beta  32scholars have grappled with the accuracy correctness and usefulness of the term asian american the term asian in asian american most often comes under fire for encompassing a huge number of people with ancestry from or who have immigrated from a wide range of culturally diverse countries and traditions in contrast leading social sciences and humanities scholars of race and asian american identity point out that because of the racial constructions in the united states including the social attitudes toward race and those of asian ancestry asian americans have a shared racial experience 33 because of this shared experience the term asian american is still a useful panethnic category because of the similarity of some experiences among asian americans including stereotypes specific to people in this category 33

status of asian americans asian immigrants are also changing the american medical landscape through increasing number of asian medical practitioners in the united states beginning in the 1960s and 1970s the us government invited a number of foreign physicians particularly from india and the philippines to address the acute shortage of physicians in rural and medically underserved urban areas the trend in importing foreign medical practitioners however became a longterm chronic solution as us medical schools failed to produce enough physicians to match the increasing american population amid decreasing interest in medicine among american college students due to high educational costs and high rates of job dissatisfaction loss of morale stress and lawsuits asian american immigrants maintained a supply of healthcare practitioners for millions of americans it is well documented that asian american international medical graduates including highly skilled guest workers using the j1 visa program for medical workers tend to serve in health professions shortage areas hpsa and specialties that are not filled by us medical graduates especially primary care and rural medicine 109 110 thus asian american immigrants play a key role in averting a medical crisis in the us a lasting legacy of asian american involvement in medicine is the forcing of us medical establishment to accept minority medical practitioners one could speculate that the introduction of asian physicians and dentists to the american society could have triggered an acceptance of other minority groups by breaking down stereotypes and encouraging trust 111traditional asian concepts and practices in health and medicine have attracted greater acceptance and are more widely adopted by american doctors indias ayurveda and traditional chinese medicine which also includes acupuncture are two alternative therapy systems that have been studied and adopted to a great extent for instance in the early 1970s the us medical establishment did not believe in the usefulness of acupuncture since then studies have proven the efficacy of acupuncture for different applications especially for treatment of chronic pain 112 it is now covered by many health insurance plans herbalism and massage therapy from ayurveda are sweeping the spas across america meditation and yoga from india have also been widely adopted by health spas and spiritual retreats of many religious bases they are also part of the spiritual practice of the many americans who are not affiliated with a mainline religious group

very different from the rate of 27 for all americans 121 according to the us census bureau in 2010 while the high school graduation rate for asian americans is on par with those of other ethnic groups 50 of asian americans have attained at least a bachelors degree as compared with the national average of 28 122 and 34 for nonhispanic whites 123 indian americans have some of the highest education rates with nearly 71 having attained at least a bachelors degree in 2010 119 according to carolyn chen director of the asian american studies program at northwestern university as of december 2012

article bamboo ceiling this concept appears to elevate asian americans by portraying them as an elite group of successful highly educated intelligent and wealthy individuals but it can also be considered an overly narrow and overly onedimensional portrayal of asian americans leaving out other human qualities such as vocal leadership negative emotions risk taking ability to learn from mistakes and desire for creative expression 126 furthermore asian americans who do not fit into the model minority mold can face challenges when peoples expectations based on the model minority myth do not match with reality traits outside of the model minority mold can be seen as negative character flaws for asian americans despite those very same traits being positive for the general american majority eg risk taking confidence empowered for this reason asian americans encounter a bamboo ceiling the asian american equivalent of the glass ceiling in the workplace with only 15 of fortune 500 ceos being asians a percentage smaller than their percentage of the total united states population 127the bamboo ceiling is defined as a combination of individual cultural and organisational factors that impede asian americans career progress inside organizations since then a variety of sectors including nonprofits universities the government have discussed the impact of the ceiling as it relates to asians and the challenges they face as described by anne fisher the bamboo ceiling refers to the processes and barriers that serve to exclude asians and american people of asian descent from executive positions on the basis of subjective factors such as lack of leadership potential and lack of communication skills that cannot actually be explained by job performance or qualifications 128 articles regarding the subject have been published in crains fortune magazine and the atlantic 129illegal immigration  editsee also deportation of cambodians from the united states in 2012 there were

chinese are awaiting visas 130 as of 2009 filipinos and indians accounted for the highest number of alien immigrants for asian americans with an estimated illegal population of 270000 and 200000 respectively indian americans are also the fastest growing alien immigrant group in the united states an increase in illegal immigration of 125 since 2000 131 this is followed by koreans 200000 and chinese 120000 132due to the stereotype of asian americans being successful as a group and having the lowest crime rates in the united states illegal immigration is mostly focused on those from mexico and latin america while leaving out asians 133 asians are the second largest racialethnic alien immigrant group in the u s behind hispanics and latinos 134 while the majority of asian immigrants to

following the attack on pearl harbor 140 and korean american businesses targeted during the 1992 los angeles riots 141 attacks on chinese in the american frontier were common this included the

late 1980s south asians in new jersey faced assault and other hate crimes by a group of latinos known as the dotbusters 143 in the late 1990s the lone death that occurred during the los angeles jewish community center shooting by a white supremacist was a filipino postal worker 144after the september 11 attacks sikh americans were targeted being the recipient of numerous hate crimes including murder 145 other asian americans have also been the victim of race based violence in brooklyn 146 philadelphia 147 san francisco 148 and bloomington indiana 149 furthermore it has been reported that young asian americans are more likely to be a target of violence than their peers 146 150 in 2017 racist graffiti and other property damage occurred to a community center in stocktons little manila 151 racism and discrimination still persists against asian americans occurring not only to recent immigrants but also towards welleducated and highly trained professionals 152recent waves of immigration of asian americans to largely african american neighborhoods have led to cases of severe racial tensions 153 acts of largescale violence against asian american students by their black classmates have been reported in multiple cities 154 in october 2008 30 black students chased and attacked 5 asian students at south philadelphia high school 155 and a similar attack on asian students occurred at the same school one year later prompting a protest by asian students in response 156asianowned businesses have been a frequent target of tensions between black and asian americans during the 1992 los angeles riots more than 2000 koreanowned businesses were looted or burned by groups of african americans 157 from 1990 to 1991 a highprofile raciallymotivated boycott of an asianowned shop in brooklyn was organized by a local black nationalist activist eventually resulting in the owner being forced to sell his business 158 another raciallymotivated boycott against an asianowned business occurred in dallas in 2012 after an asian american clerk fatally shot an african american who had robbed his store 159 during the ferguson unrest in 2014 asianowned businesses were looted 160 and asianowned stores were looted during the 2015 baltimore protests while africanamerican owned stores were bypassed 161 violence against asian americans continue to occur based on their race 162 with one source asserting that asian americans are the fastest growing targets of hate crimes and violence 163racial stereotypes  editmain articles stereotypes of east asians in the united states and stereotypes of south asians see also ching chong until the late 20th century the term asian american was adopted mostly by activists while the average person of asian ancestries identified with their specific ethnicity 164 the murder of vincent chin in 1982 was a pivotal civil rights case and it marked the emergence of asian americans as a distinct group in united states 164 165stereotypes of asians have been largely collectively internalized by society and these stereotypes have mainly negative repercussions for asian americans and asian immigrants in daily interactions current events and governmental legislation in many instances media portrayals of east asians often reflect a dominant americentric perception rather than realistic and authentic depictions of true cultures customs and behaviors 166 asians have experienced discrimination and have been victims of hate crimes related to their ethnic stereotypes 167study has indicated that most nonasian americans do not generally differentiate between asian americans of different ethnicities 168 stereotypes of chinese americans and asian americans are nearly identical 169 a 2002 survey of americans attitudes toward asian americans and chinese americans indicated that 24 of the respondents disapprove of intermarriage with an asian american second only to african americans 23 would be uncomfortable supporting an asian american presidential candidate compared to 15 for an african american 14 for a woman and 11 for a jew 17 would be upset if a substantial number of asian americans moved into their neighborhood 25 had somewhat or very negative attitude toward chinese americans in general 170 the study did find several positive perceptions of chinese americans strong family values 91 honesty as business people 77 high value on education 67 169there is a widespread perception that asian americans are not american but are instead  perpetual foreigners  170 171 172 asian americans often report being asked the question where are you really from by other americans regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in united states and been a part of its society 173 many asian americans are themselves not immigrants but rather born in the united states many east asian americans are asked if they are chinese or japanese an assumption based on major groups of past immigrants 171 174moreover americans lack knowledge when it comes to knowing the differences between cultures from asian asian americans continue to be portrayed as foreigners and outsiders who are potential harm and threats to the fabric of american society asian americans are characterized as model minority continues to promote interracial between asian americans and other groups of color and workingclass whites cite error a ref tag is missing the closingref see the help page  statistics such as high household income and low incarceration rate 175 low rates of many diseases and higher than average life expectancy are also discussed as positive aspects of asian americans 176the implicit advice is that the other minorities should stop protesting and emulate the asian american work ethic and devotion to higher education some critics say the depiction replaces biological racism with cultural racism and should be dropped 177 according to the washington post the idea that asian americans are distinct among minority groups and immune to the challenges faced by other people of color is a particularly sensitive issue for the community which has recently fought to reclaim its place in social justice conversations with movements like model minority mutiny 178the model minority concept can also affect asians public education 179 by comparison with other minorities asians often achieve higher test scores and grades compared to other americans 180 stereotyping asian american as overachievers can lead to harm if school officials or peers expect all to perform higher than average 181 the very high educational attainments of asian americans has often been noted in 1980 for example 74 of chinese americans 62 of japanese americans and 55 of korean americans aged 20–21 were in college compared to only a third of the whites the disparity at postgraduate levels is even greater and the differential is especially notable in fields making heavy use of mathematics by 2000 a plurality of undergraduates at such elite public california schools as uc berkeley and ucla which are obligated by law to not consider race as a factor in admission were asian american the pattern is rooted in the preworld war ii era nativeborn chinese and japanese americans reached educational parity with majority whites in the early decades of the 20th century 182the model minority concept can be emotionally damaging to some asian americans particularly since they are expected to live up to those peers who fit the stereotype 183 studies have shown that some asian americans suffer from higher rates of stress depression mental illnesses and suicides in comparison to other races 184 indicating that the pressures to achieve and live up to the model minority image may take a mental and psychological toll on some asian americans 185the model minority stereotype fails to distinguish between different ethnic groups with different histories when divided up by ethnicity it can be seen that the economic and academic successes supposedly enjoyed by asian americans are concentrated into a few ethnic groups cambodians hmong and laotians and to a lesser extent vietnamese all of whose relatively low achievement rates are possibly due to their refugee status and that they are nonvoluntary immigrants 186 additionally one in five hmong and bangladeshi people live in poverty 73social and economic disparities among asian americans  editin 2015 asian american earnings were found to exceed all other racial groups when all asian ethnic groups are grouped as a whole 187 yet a 2014 report from the census bureau reported that 12 of asian americans were living below the poverty line while only 101 of nonhispanic white americans live below the poverty line 188 189 according to the center for american progress a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization when comparing wealth inequality between asian americans and nonhispanic white americans asian americans suffered a greater gap between wealthy and nonwealthy asian americans 190 once country of birth and other demographic factors are taken into account a portion of the subgroups that make up asian americans are much more likely than nonhispanic white americans to live in poverty 191 192 193 194 according to an article published by national public radio some asian ethnic groups poverty rivaled african american when they were quoted as saying when you break it down by specific ethnic groups the hmong the bangladeshi they have poverty rates that rival the africanamerican poverty rate 189there are major disparities that exist among asian americans when specific ethnic groups are examined for example in 2012 asian americans had the highest educational attainment level of any racial demographic in the country 49 yet there are many sub groups of asian americans who suffer in terms of education with some sub groups showing a high rate of dropping out of school or lacking a college education 193 194 195 this occurs in terms of household income as well in 2008 asian americans had the highest median household income overall of any racial demographic 196 197 there are asian sub groups have average median incomes lower than both the u s average and nonhispanic whites 193 in 2014 data released by the united states census bureau revealed that 5 asian american ethnic groups are in the top 10 lowest earning ethnicities in terms of per capita income in all of the united states 198the asian american groups that have low educational attainment and high rates of poverty both in average individual and median income are bhutanese americans 199 200 bangladeshi americans 189 199 201 cambodian americans 192 194burmese americans 193 nepali americans 202 hmong americans 189 194 199 and laotian americans 194 this affects vietnamese americans as well albeit to a lesser degree as early 21st century immigration from vietnam are not from refugee backgrounds 203 these individual ethnicities experience social issues within their communities some specific to their individual communities themselves issues such as suicide crime and mental illness 204 other issues experienced include deportation and poor physical health 205 within the bhutanese american community it has been documented that there are issues of suicide greater than the worlds average 206 cambodian americans some of who immigrated as refugees are subject to deportation 207 crime and gang violence are common social issues among southeast asian americans of refugee backgrounds such as cambodian laotian
