weve all experienced food cravings in general they tend to be for things like potato chips ice cream and other highcalorie foods that doctors say will murder us some cravings though are the result of deep and correct instincts telling us what we need to eat to stay alive here are ten ways your bodys inner pharmacist tries to make you want whats good for you10 when you crave dirt you need to detox either that or youre pregnant pregnant women have been known to crave dirt some say that its because they need calcium as late as the nineties some markets actually sold dirt for this kind of human consumption and gaining calcium might still be the case for those currently knockedup but dirt also seems to be a good way to detox internally it was once thought that only humans and macaws ate clay but recently researchers have observed more and more species doing it they notice especially that animals do it in seasons when fruits arent yet ripe unripe fruits and berries contain alkaloids they have been found to be toxic to humans and animals alike certain people today smear clay on unripe potatoes which contain solanine a bitter and toxic alkaloid clay contains kaolin which neutralizes the bitter taste and takes out the alkaloids making the food safe and tasty when people get a craving to eat clay theyre acting on ancient and correct instincts that tell them theyve been poisoned9 when you crave rice and beans you need protein lysine is an amino acid that everyones body needs but cant manufacture methionine is another beans have lysine corn wheat and rice have methionine if youve thought of and are now craving a meal that contains all of these things it shows that you live somewhere on earth within walking distance of a burrito to be fair there are plenty of less popular cuisines that blend those same foods together they do this because the taste combination is incredible they also do this because the combo of foods substitute for meat pretty much perfectly the flavor and nutrition complement each other so well that for a long time it was thought that unless some combination of rice and beans were eaten at the same meal the body couldnt absorb the amino acids properly since then its been shown that its not necessary to combine the two in the same meal but both are needed and the body craves them both the same way it might crave say a nice juicy steak this means that our body makes us crave not only certain food but suggests certain food combinations that give us complete nutrition our cooking isnt as inventive as we think8 when you crave spice you need to cool down there are quite a few reasons why spicy foods and hot climates go together spicy food especially of red peppers triggers immediate sweating generally when you sweat you dont feel cool the body sweats only enough so that it doesnt overheat a sweating person is still warm and uncomfortable theyre just not dying eating food with capsaicin though triggers sweating above and beyond what is needed to keep the body from overheating capsaicin stimulates receptors that sense heat in the mouth and along the mucus membranes of the nose the body sweats everywhere trying to respond to the heat and flush away the irritant and the person eating the food finally feels cool when they sweat instead of just sticky7 when you crave licorice you need hormones addisons disease is a disease of the adrenal system often brought on by an attack from a persons own immune system that causes the adrenal glands to produce too few steroid hormones this can cause weakness abdominal pain and can even cause bloodpressure crashes that end in coma one of the hormones regulates salt excretion which causes people with the disease to get rid of too much salt and have extreme cravings for it thats pretty straightforward stranger though is their craving for licorice doctors couldnt account for it until they saw that licorice contained glasorisic acid which causes salt retention without having any idea as to why they might want licorice patients gravitated toward a food that had substance that relieved their symptoms6 when you crave milk in your tea you need protection with your morning beverage tea is not the bland inoffensive leaf stew that daytime tv commercials make it out to be it is out to get you â€” with tannins these are a kind of astringent that scours everything from one opening in your body to the other theyre also found in coffee just waiting to scrub you out until you get sick with a digestive disorder they have a dry bitter quality that the body is supposed to interpret as dont drink this dummy sadly people overcome that happily they instinctively know how to cope with it milk protects the throat from tannin and consequently cuts the bitter taste the fact that we can tolerate milk at all as adults is its own kind of nutritional adaptation feeding milk to adult animals often makes them sick lactose intolerance is still a problem in a lot of humans milk drinking in adult humans has happened relatively recently so its doubly impressive that as soon as we developed the ability to tolerate milk our taste buds lead us to ways that it can protect us from other dumb stuff we swallow5 when you crave ice you need iron for some reason people who are anemic tend to have a voracious craving for ice whenever the iron levels in their body increase the craving goes away this is one of the cravings that isnt quite explainable since chewing ice doesnt increase a persons iron level it could be though that patients are seeking to relieve their symptoms and not their core deficiency with iron deficiency comes inflammation and with inflammation comes soreness anemic patients especially tend to get inflammation in their tongue and mouth area chewing ice can relieve the pain before they even know that they have it4 when you crave fish cooked in greens you need calcium two different culinary traditions cook fish wrapped in certain green leaves west africans often wrap fish in banana leaves before cooking french cooks wrap fish in sorrel leaves both have a practical convenience  the bones of the fish dissolve making for less picking and choking more importantly though it gives the fish a richer flavor that people come to crave this is because the bones dont disappear or drip away the calcium from the bones dissolves into the flesh of the fish causing a huge boost in calcium received by the body a vegetarian alternative to this was found in mexico where people soaked corn for tortillas in water in which they had dissolved limestone limestone is calcium carbonate and the tortillas delivered a huge amount of calcium to the diners3 when you crave ginger you need to heal your heart literallyginger is one of those herbal medicines that make the rest of herbal medicine look good it suppresses nausea reduces pain quiets the need to cough clears head aches and flavors food enough to make it tolerable to the queasy doctors found though that even when they werent sick in any measurable way some people craved ginger studies revealed though that ginger reduced clotting that might lead to heart attacks that it lowered cholesterol and that it strengthened heart muscles considering how much damage it might have done to people who see results from ginger and then put their faith in unregulated herbal supplements though and it would have to do heart surgery itself to break even socially2 when you crave caffeine you need a painkiller lets say youve exhausted the painkilling power of ginger and moved on to manufactured painkillers if one of them doesnt get the job done reach for a cup of coffee caffeine doesnt just cause headaches via withdrawal its been shown to boost the power of painkillers and stop migraines from setting in in fact while some health professionals warn people away from coffee others say about two cups a day are good the stuff can decrease both physical and emotional pain since its a mild stimulant that can decrease mild depression some studies show that it can actually help people sleep better and get them on a better sleep cycle since its generally a regulated habit that can get someone up at a certain time every day basically this isnt the devilbrew that many doctors make it out to be which is why so many people crave the kick1 when you crave chocolate you need to get high chocolate took most western nations by storm and looking at it today its easy to think you know why it has all the necessary components its sweet and fatty and the perfect dessert of course the cocoa beans that first became popular werent any of those things although they were dressed up different ways for a long time chocolate was relatively coarse and bitter originally it was mostly served with spices as a drink or over snow while early americans did occasionally sweeten it it took a while before europeans thought to add sugar to chocolate and even longer before they added milk it was often served over meat as a savory substance so why was this flavor so very very popular some people point to phenylethylamine pea the socalled love chemical that people produce when theyre in love or feeling especially happy and excited researchers point out that pea breaks down to quickly in the body to actually affect the way that people act and that other food like cheese contains more pea anyway a more likely story is the cannabinoids that chocolate contains these chemicals related to the thc found in marijuana trigger anandamide known as the bliss molecule this triggers a high of happiness and wellbeing that a lot of people feel after eating chocolate researchers point out that most people would have to eat pounds of chocolate to get the same high as they would from pot chocolate also contains theobromine a compound similar to the caffeine that gets people addicted to coffee chocolate as it turns out is a bubbling brew of 380 chemicals a bunch of which are known to have an effect on mood its a darling little meth lab of feelgood chemicals in a heartshaped box forget alcohol or tobacco this is the drug of choice for pretty much everyone top image pen waggener rice image irrilicorice
