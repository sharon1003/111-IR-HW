there is evidence that many statues were painted in bright colors 3 most of the color was weathered off over time small remnants were removed during cleaning in some cases small traces remained which could be identified 3 a travelling exhibition of 20 coloured replicas of greek and roman works alongside 35 original statues and reliefs was held in europe and the united states in 2008 gods in color

expansion you can help by adding to it april 2013while byzantine art flourished in various forms sculpture and statue making witnessed a general decline although statues of emperors continued to appear 16 an example was the statue of justinian 6th century which stood in the square across from the hagia sophia until the fall of constantinople in the 15th century 16 part of the decline in statue making in the byzantine period can be attributed to the mistrust the church placed in the art form given that it viewed sculpture in general as a method for making and worshiping idols 16 while making statues was not subject to a general ban it was hardly encouraged in this period 16 justinian was one of the last emperors to have a fullsize statue made and secular statues of any size became virtually nonexistent after iconoclasm and the artistic skill for making statues was lost in the process modern era  editstarting with the work of maillol around 1900 the human figures embodied in statues began to move away from the various schools of realism that been followed for thousands of years the futurist and cubist schools took this metamorphism even further until statues often still nominally representing humans had lost all but the most rudimentary relationship to the human form by the 1920s and 1930s statues began to appear that were completely abstract in design and execution
