of his stamford bridge tenure master of all he surveys roman abramovich has changed the game in his decade at stamford bridge photo paby jeremy wilson800am bst 29 jun 2013follow april 2003 falling in love with football the headlines were shared by david beckham and the brazilian ronaldo who scored five goals between them but real madrid’s extraordinary champions league victory over manchester united held a more farreaching significance among the spectators at old trafford that night was an unknown billionaire russian who was sufficiently captivated to decide that a football club should be his next purchase abramovich quickly settled on chelsea as his desired club as well as the london location the share structure meant chelsea was relatively quickly attainable a meeting was swiftly arranged at stamford bridge between abramovich and then chief executive trevor birch related articles mata i am not leaving chelsea26 jun 2013rooney couldnt cope in london24 jun 2013schurrle completes

birch abramovich made no attempt to haggle over money and accepted the asking price the meeting lasted less than 20 minutes birch contacted ken bates then chelsea owner and a meeting was arranged later that day at the dorchester hotel a £140 million deal to buy chelsea and cover their debts was soon agreed within two months abramovich had spent more than £100 million on new players within two years john terry was lifting the premier league trophy english football would never be the same again january 2005 the ashley cole affair the extravagant style of abramovich’s ownership was soon evident as was the impression that chelsea thought that money could buy them just about whatever they wanted a succession of audacious moves quickly followed peter kenyon the manchester united chief executive was lured away from old trafford abramovich reportedly even tried simply to buy cagliairi the italian club that gianfranco zola had pledged to join in an attempt to keep the iconic striker at stamford bridge a then world record offer of £50 million was made to arsenal for thierry henry there were also costly mistakes notably in the fee of £30 million for an ageing andrei shevchenko abramovich’s pockets however were always sufficiently deep to simply move on to the next target no deal was considered beyond chelsea yet their brazen methods and willingness to pay extraordinary sums of money provoked frequent controversy this was most notoriously evident in the pursuit of arsenal leftback ashley cole with chelsea found guilty of ‘tapping up’ after mourinho met the england leftback in a london restaurant arsène wenger famously described chelsea’s approach under abarmovich as “financial doping” abramovich though did ultimately get the player he wanted and with cole still in the team chelsea have won a further eight major trophies july 2007 the new training ground abramovich’s millions have also been used to build a lasting infrastructure at chelsea and they are now in a position where they can stand on their own two feet financially with the elite clubs in the world on the most recent deloitte list of football’s biggest clubs chelsea stood fifth above the likes of arsenal ac milan liverpool and juventus for the first time under abramovich they even registered a profit in their most recent annual accounts with more than £700 million worth of loans from abramovich turned into equity chelsea can now claim to be debt free and self sustainable abramovich’s push to build chelsea at every level was very quickly evident with the move from harlington to the stateoftheart training centre at cobham that was officially opened in 2007 one regret has been that abramovich’s vast investment in the academy has not been complimented by a firstteam environment in which managers feel sufficiently emboldened to give young talent a prolonged opportunity abramovich’s desire for chelsea to produce players however should not be underestimated september 2007 appointing avram no appreciation of abramovich’s decade at chelsea would be complete without reference to his ruthless and perhaps even eccentric or impulsive approach to managers mourinho after all reportedly first lost his job after a chance meeting in a corridor with abramovich that degenerated in him challenging the owner to sack him although he has been consistently surrounded by a core of key advisers from chairman bruce buck to directors eugene tenenbaum and marina granovskaia others have entered the inner circle at different times this was evident with avram grant who remains a good friend but somehow persuaded abramovich in 2007 that his work in israel qualified him to become director of football and then an upgrade on mourinho as manager that grant then guided chelsea to the champions league final seemed to give abramovich the idea that provided you had a sufficiently good squad of players managerial instability was not necessarily counterproductive as abramovich then went through luizfelipe scolari guus hiddink carlo ancelotti andre villasboas roberto di matteo and finally rafael benítez suspicions of excessive player power have persisted it is a theory that is emphatically denied however by one of the dressing room’s strongest voices“if you wanted to take that chance you would probably get sacked yourself” said frank lampard may 2012 munich victory speech at various stages during the past decade the rumour has circulated that abramovich is falling out of love with football and may seek a buyer for chelsea there have certainly been periods when he has been more frugal in the transfer market attended less games or his focus has switched beyond chelsea most notably the high court battle last year with boris berezovsky those around abramovich however consistently stress that his passion for football and vision for chelsea remain just as strong as ever even minutes after chelsea had won the champions league last year those inside the dressingroom say that he was looking to the future“roman gave a little thank you speech in the dressing room” said buck using tenenbaum as a translator abramovich called for calm and spoke quietly to the players of their collective triumph“we’ve won it — but this is just the beginning” was the crux of tenenbaum’s translation january 2013 snubbed by pep embraced by jose after di matteo was sacked just six months after delivering the champions league to abramovich the wall street journal posed a question“who would want to be a chelsea manager” it asked the answer of course is “plenty of people” but the headline was still prophetic in identifying an obvious flaw in abramovich’s style by overseeing so much managerial change and by demanding not just trophies but aesthetically pleasing football abramovich has risked limiting his options the best salary was clearly not the only consideration for pep guardiola as he opted for bayern munich rather than chelsea earlier this year it was a significant moment and it was then instructive that abramovich should ultimately turn full circle and come back to mourinho his first managerial appointment at chelsea it also felt like an acceptance that mistakes have been made in his treatment of managers and perhaps also that he was wrong to ever part company with his best and most successful choice although it can be argued that the all the managerial upheaval has been justified by continual silverware how much would chelsea have won if mourinho had kept his job throughout this past decade we are told that both abramovich and mourinho now crave a productive period of stability against that the desire not just to win but to win with a stylish identity burns just as strongly as it did 10 years ago chelsea sport »football »football
