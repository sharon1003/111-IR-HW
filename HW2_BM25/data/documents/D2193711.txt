overlyattached to people and i feel as though no one thinks much of me this problem is starting to bother me to the point where it seems like a main contributor to my depression these strong feelings of attachment seem to start when i first make plans with a new friend this happened the other day when i invited a girl i met recently over to my house we planned on watching a movie but instead ended up talking for hours we both seemed to relate on many levels it was the first time ive felt genuinely happy even secure in a couple of weeks since i went through a rough breakup but after she went home i felt lost and familiar feelings of worthlessness began crawling back into me i started thinking about how much she really sparked my interest and how much i just wanted to get to know her better wondering at the same time if she thought half as much of me since then weve been talking through texting facebook etc but she just hasnt seemed to act the same as she did that day she came over which is bothering me just too much we made plans to hang out again but she made it clear that she didnt want to anymore when our other two friends cancelled which made me feel like she was already bored of me or i upset her or something i just cant stop thinking about her the next time i can see her and so on i also cant stop wondering what she thinks about me and i think attaching myself to her and other friends is my way of just trying to be accepted but it never feels like im getting anything out of it except for stress and depression so i have this attachment problem with almost everyone i meet there just seems to be a place in me for everyone i think this problem was first brought up in me as a result of the many times ive lost best friends due to moving all over the us since those years of losing friends ive always been so desperate to have just one genuine friendship with someone who i know i can rely on so i wanted to know if anyone else has problems with becoming strongly attached to others while feeling pathetic for it id just like to relate to someone and i would be so thankful to get a bit of advice to help me through this disorderjustin99 is

having anybody in my life aside from family i have nobodyhardly any acquaintances and no friends or significant other s so when somebody does enter my life and seems to want to stick around i sometimes get overly excited because its such a rare occurrence and because it is so rare for me whether or not im conscious of it i attach a lot of importance to the newfound relationship its a problem if other people dont also see things the same way which they rarely do because well i dont meet too many crazies like myself so i have to balance my craving for attention and not wanting to come off as clingy which is tough but im rarely fortunate enough to find myself in that position anyway furthermore if there isnt equal investment in the relationship by both of parties ifwhen they decide theyre done with me it hurts a lotfuggitman is offline quotepost 3 of 39  permalink old 03182011 1019 pm thread starterjustin99sas member join date mar 2011gender male age 24posts 4i understand you completely i think i used to come off as clingy but ive quickly changed that recently to where im a bit more reserved around others that only seems to make matters worse though because the thoughts about what they might think of me increase tenfold in addition to this i come off as someone with not much of a personality which makes it very hard to establish friendships its very hard to remain socially activeinteresting when theres no guidelines to tell you if youre trying too hard or not enough to make an impact on someonejustin99 is offline quotepost 4 of 39  permalink old 03292011

but the rule of the average the mediocre real leaders are pioneers they go ahead in front on the basis of understanding and inner convictions even if they have to go alone lachlan is offline quotepost

experimenter join date nov 2006location malaysia gender female age 29posts 724sort of i went for a subject field trip last year which lasted a week with my classmates which made me feel really happy with them within that short period i dont think they ever thought that much of that trip or me that the trip is just a compulsory thing and it passes by and i am just a classmate but i felt really fond of them after that and i missed the trip and the experience very much even when during those times i didnt talk to them much i was just with them silently and they were like amazed at how quiet i was while theyre all really friendly with each other theyve known each other longer and had always been good friends among themselves they all moved on happily afterwards and i who never spoke with them much within that 1 week time eventually had to move on myself knowing from then on i wont be around them that much anymore and none of us will really talk about our trip anymore i miss my classmates and the fun trip lol i have accepted it though i was too attached to the good times i had with them within the time of that trip although i dont appear like it id like to think that in the end it will be worthwhile httptwittercomcrazynifiedfictionz is offline quotepost 7 of 39  permalink old 04152011 0313 pmatomicsteph sas member join date apr 2011location maryland gender female age

some reason its only with guys im dating and not friends i dont have many close friends so i guess that could be part of it i wish i could get over it because it prevents me from doing so many things

im trying to deal with im pretty aware of my general over excitment when im being phatically amiable ive just learned to curb it somewhat its filling the balance in needs with genuinely fulfilling relationships thats the hard part especially when youre nervous but its definitely possible for me i just need to be a lot more prosocial i think the existential dilemma is were social animals so we all wrestle with a sense of inadequacy but when we realize that were not as inadequate as we thought we were and when we realize that everybody elese also thinks theyre inadequate then the ache goes away and the idea that were not a person of value disappears to some extent i wash myself with a rag on a stickjimmy deans retarted cousin is offline quotepost 9 of 39  permalink old 04162011 0658

join date feb 2011location bronx nygender male age 30posts 136yeesss sir i def agree with that i walk around everywhere being open and friendly to people even when they dont open back up to me the the thing i hate is that its not that i dont like talking to people but when i do it right after i feel bad and cant stop thinking about it like i did something wrong to myself its weird ive always been attached to people since young but i used to have control over it i always kept a close circle of friends a few guys i hang out with that really know me now all my friends grown up and moved on started relationships and got their own places im still stuck at my crib with my mother grandmother and annoying sister who also suffers from mental illness but isnt open about it nowadays my attachments to people is out of control im all gushy and soft to everybody i meet its annoying the real reason why i do that is because of being single for over 2years i kno if i met a girl similar to me with my same issues it would prob go away and i will get that feeling of warmth and connectness that i havent felt in a long time idk all my friends say im a loverboy and its prob gonna b the death of me but i cant help it i am truelly from the bottom of my heart a romantic till the day i die some of my boys advise me to make myself feel better to treat girls like  but i cant thats who i am i have a natural respect for people even when they treat me like  i might be mad at that person and want to hurt them but i always refrain myself from going out of character and calling a girl a  or curse them out i always choose to swallow whatever pain and move on show love to somebody else so yea i too get to attached to people it started off with women from puberty but now at 23 its with everybody its almost kind of impulsive maybe its a disease who knows everything is a disease now what i really feel is the cure for alot of people on this site is to just find love one person or thing that makes u dont care about nothing or nobody else and be able to share what precious time you share with that person and dont worry about nobody else or death or insanity and just enjoy every day

problem when i meet a new person i instantly become attached to them i feel as though i have the potential to love this person whoever it is at the time wholly and unconditionally despite there faults and flaws in my eyes they are perfect and i treat them as such i become addicted to them needing their constant attention and reassurance this attachment problem has obviously caused me alot of problems in relationships in one relationship caused me to be used as he could see this all unfolding and abused it having me basically pay for everything his rent drug habit etc in my last relationship in ended it it was long distance and so obviously most of our communication was internetphone based it got to the point that i would get upset and feel abandoned when he had to get off the phone despite talking for several hours despite being obviously aware of these problems i cant seem to break the behavioural cycle it seems as though i can only value people at the two extremes either not at all or they are my entire world and when they leave my world shatters i think it is because i really dont have anyone else in my life no real friends or family no other social support so they instantly take on all of those roles it is somewhat comforting to see that i am not the only person suffering in this waycindy8701 is offline quotepost 18 of 39  permalink old 05062011 0418
