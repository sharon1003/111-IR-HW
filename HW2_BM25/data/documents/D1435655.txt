what the world would look like if all the ice melted if we keep burning fossil fuels indefinitely global warming will eventually melt all the ice at the poles and on mountaintops raising sea level by 216 feet explore what the world’s new coastlines would look like this story appears in the september 2013 issue of national geographic magazine the maps here show the world as it is now with only one difference all the ice on land has melted and drained into the sea raising it 216 feet and creating new shorelines for our continents and inland seas there are more than five million cubic miles of ice on earth and some scientists say it would take more than 5000 years to melt it all if we continue adding carbon to the atmosphere we’ll very likely create an icefree planet with an average temperature of perhaps 80 degrees fahrenheit instead of the current 58 related stories global warming solutions worlds happiest country also has no carbon emissions more sharks ditching annual migration as ocean warms cities emit 60 more carbon than thought north america the entire atlantic seaboard would vanish along with florida and the gulf coast in california san franciscos hills would become a cluster of islands and the central valley a giant bay the gulf of california would stretch north past the latitude of san diego—not that thered be a san diego watchphoto evidence shows glacier national park melting away south america the amazon basin in the north and the paraguay river basin in the south would become atlantic inlets wiping out buenos aires coastal uruguay and most of paraguay mountainous stretches would survive along the caribbean coast and in central america africa compared with other continents africa would lose less of its land to the ultimate sealevel catastrophe but earth’s rising heat might make much of it uninhabitable in egypt alexandria and cairo will be swamped by the intruding mediterranean europe london a memory venice reclaimed by the adriatic sea thousands of years from now in this catastrophic scenario the netherlands will have long since surrendered to the sea and most of denmark will be gone too meanwhile the mediterraneans expanding waters will also have swelled the black and caspian seas asia land now inhabited by 600 million chinese would flood as would all of bangladesh population 160 million and much of coastal india the inundation of the mekong delta would leave cambodias cardamom mountains stranded as an island australia predominantly desert the continent would gain a new inland sea—but it would lose much of the narrow coastal strip where four out of five australians now live antarctica east antarctica the east antarctica ice sheet is so large—it contains fourfifths of all the ice on earth—that it might seem unmeltable it survived earlier warm periods intact lately it seems to be thickening slightly—because of global warming the warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor which falls as snow on east antarctica but even this behemoth is unlikely to survive a return to an eocene climate west antarctica like the greenland ice sheet the west antarctic one was apparently much smaller during earlier warm periods its vulnerable because most of it sits on bedrock thats below sea level the warming ocean is melting the floating ice sheet itself from below causing it to collapse since 1992 it has averaged a net loss of 65 million metric tons of ice a year all maps by jason treat matthew twombly web barr maggie smith ngm staff art kees veenenbos sources philippe huybrechts vrije universiteit brussel richard s williams jr woods hole research center james c zachos university of california santa cruz usgs noaa etopo1 bedrock 1 arcminute global relief model copyright © september 2013 national geographic societywatchsee the extreme changes near the antarctic peninsula
