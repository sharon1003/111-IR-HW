pixels is a terrible video game movie by tyler wilde 20150725t030415205zcomments i’m hiding under my baseball cap as i walk into the theater inside the metreon a blue block of a building that sony dropped on san francisco in the late ‘90s it’s an appropriate setting the metreon once housed a big unpopular arcade i frequented in college but under westfield’s ownership it’s now just a theater a target and some restaurants and i’m here to see pixels the adam sandler film about arcade classics come to destroy earth this is their revenge i use a machine to buy my ticket waving it on as it hangs on the screen displaying my order i grab the ticket and lower my cap this is fun i feel like a spy i even brought a notebook do people take notes while reviewing movies i don’t know this is my first movie review i put on my 3d glasses why did i think i’d be able to take notes in a dark theater with 3d glasses on i tear up a little at the trailer for the good dinosaur and then pixels spoilers ahead if you care15 minutes into pixels the early80s opening sees young versions of all the characters go to an arcade tournament which is apparently the only one that was ever held and they set all the records there are to set young peter dinklage eddie beats young adam sandler who cares and mocks him as he should we jump to present day adam sandler is the lead of course a geek squad parody manchild who was super good at arcade games way back when but has no ambition now he falls in love with michelle monaghan who’s like a lieutenant colonel of something and here we go it’s that godawful ‘nerd approval’ plot where the lifelong loserman tries to prove his worth so he can sleep with an attractive woman who’s otherwise too snobby to be into him nerds are valuable too and if they say you’re sexy you should kiss them of course sandler only has value in this movie because aliens are literally attacking earth with real versions of the arcade games he’s good at also he knows the president of the united states kevin james plays the president of the united states i drink half my medium diet coke being sure to shake all the ice cubes around during quiet parts to express my displeasure30 minutes into pixels two people leave the theater here’s what they’re missing the footage from that 80s arcade tournament was misinterpreted by aliens as a threat as a result they’ve challenged earth to an arcade game tournament with a televised message that aired during a rerun of one tree hill josh gad discovers this after first checking 4chan for the sole purpose of mentioning 4chan so if earth loses at the lifesized arcade games we invent magic light cannons to shoot the alien arcade guys with by the way the aliens will destroy us all the games have no clear rules no one cares there’s a robot man losing track of time eddie peter dinklage is now a convict and desperately wants to sleep with serena williams and martha stewart in the white house this joke comes up more than once but even without the promise that he can have sex with these women eddie agrees to fight the aliens he uses a pacman “cheat code” while driving a ‘ghost’ mini cooper teleporting himself around new york city this all happens offscreen and is not explained the aliens get mad but no one knows the aliens are pissed off yet so they decide to have a ball it’s a weird as hell adult prom and adam sandler asks michelle monaghan to go with him and she shows up in a dress looking all good then kevin james—who i must protest is the president of the united states—refers to her a lieutenant colonel as a “ten” while standing next to his wife the first lady is played by jane krakowski who is the best person in the film even though she does nothing because she does nothing so monaghan falls in love with sandler i guess even though he keeps telling her that nerds are good kissers because they appreciate it more no one pities him im blowing bubbles in my diet coke now i have to pee because i drank too much diet coke did i mention that qbert was given to earth as a trophy he was he becomes a “traitor” to the aliens for some reason and mentions that his civilization used to be peaceful before all this crap with earth none of this matters and no one cares no one cares about the plot of this movie at all so adam sandler and crew go to the mothership to face his achilles’ heel donkey kong to defeat donkey kong sandler has to take the advice of a kid stop trying to find a pattern like in galaga or whatever and just try to survive like you do in modern games like the last of us he jumps over some barrels it’s super easy and the aliens are like “ahh oh nooo” you never actually see the aliens meanwhile josh gad is still fighting on the ground his character is a basementdweller who’s in love with lady lisa a sexy arcade character who coincidentally comes to life as one of the pixel creatures attacking earth except shes not pixelated shes ashley benson but joins our side when he proposes to her she never speaks sadly lisa is killed when adam sandler defeats the aliens but it’s ok qbert who again was a trophy given to earth by the aliens transforms into ashley benson thank goodness the kid who cried when he thought qbert was dead earlier is fine with this sandler is the only one to object but we move on because the movie is almost over it’s implied that peter dinklage has sex with serena williams and martha stewart in the white house qbert disguised as lady lisa gives birth to a litter of qberts who we see gad coming home to he slept with qbert in the form of ashley benson and they had qbert babies that’s what happens that’s the last thing in this movie pixels i can finally pee out all this diet coke i knew pixels would be bad but i thought at least that there might be some silly references—maybe even some pc game references—that i could say were fun pixels does not care about games they’re just there remember galaga asteroids they’re here some guy screwed qbertthe lazy drooling sexism isn’t funny and neither are the game references pixels is a stupid and bad movie and i feel bad for going watch wreckit ralph instead because it’s infinitely better wreckit ralph cares about where it comes from whereas pixels does jokes like “have you been playing space invaders recently because you’re invading my space”i’m exhausted see comments load
