philadelphia eagles alltime jersey numbers 1 150 of 15nick lahamgetty images for many players the number on their uniform is simply that a number its a quick way to identify a player on the field and unlike a name its much easier for fans to pick out from the nosebleed section oftentimes the number holds a personal significance to the player such as a variation of his college number or the number of his favorite nfl star however such significance is rarely conveyed beyond the locker room still there are a few instances when the significance of a players number transcends the norm through exceptional play on the field a player can cause his number to become permanently associated with his name some like the bengal formerly known as chad johnson take it a step further going so far as to assimilate their number into their public personality while the following fifteen eagles havent exactly changed their last names to reflect the digits on their chest they have made an impact to the franchise in such a way that a part of their legacy lives on through the numbers here are the most memorable eagles ever to wear the numbers one through 151 tony franklin1 of 15photo courtesy of philadelphia eaglescom after getting selected by the eagles in the third round of the 1979 nfl draft placekicker tony franklin out of texas am enjoyed a solid fiveyear career in philadelphia what made franklin so memorable was his barefoot kicking style for every kick he would trot out onto the field wearing nothing but a halfsock on his right foot although unconventional franklins tactic brought him success during a game against the cowboys in 1979 he managed to kick the fourthlongest field goal in nfl history at the time a 59yarder which helped the eagles to a 3121 victory to this day franklin remains one of only a handful of players to ever placekick barefoot on a professional level2 david akers2 of 15mike ehrmanngetty images any football fan who has followed the eagles in the past decade is familiar with the impressive resume of placekicker david akers in his 12 seasons with the eagles akers has garnered six pro bowl selections including one this past year five allpro selections and three nfc special teams player of the month awards he also holds the nfl records for most consecutive postseason field goal conversions 19 most points in a single decade 1114 and points in pro bowl history 48 through his unbeatable poise on the field akers has solidified his legacy in philadelphia earning the following team records including the record for breaking the most kicking records singleseason field goal conversion success rate 882field goals made in a single season 33career field goal conversions 294singleseason extra point conversion success rate tie 100career extra point conversions 441 only 6 missed out of 447 attemptscareer games started 18850 yard field goal conversions lifetime 15points scored lifetime 1327its hard to believe that after going undrafted as a rookie akers was once summarily rejected by both the panthers and the redskins before landing with the eagles in 20003 jack concannon3 of 15photo courtesy of pro football hofcom although quarterback jack concannon spent the majority of his time with the eagles behind starter norm snead he did have one very memorable season back in 1966 charged with the starting position after a quarterback rotation concannon led the eagles on a threegame winning streak to finish the season 95 and earn a spot in the playoff bowl during a regular season game against pittsburgh the nimble concannon accumulated 129 rushing yards the most by an eagles quarterback in a single game until michael vicks 130 yard rushing game this past year quickly developing a modest fan base concannon managed to impress his teammates as well including center ray mansfieldif coach kuharich played either of the other two quarterbacks norm snead or king hill our defense wouldve smothered them but concannon was something different he was just too nimble you dont expect to see a quarterback run for that kind of yardage source the eagles encyclopedia by ray didinger  robert s lyons unfortunately concannons brief stardom would end with his fourinterception performance in the playoff bowl against the baltimore colts although he was shipped off to chicago the following season he remained a curiously fond memory in the hearts of eagles fans for years to come4 kevin kolb4 of 15jed jacobsohngetty images although he has only had brief stints as a starting quarterback in the nfl kevin kolb has become one of the most talkedabout players in the 2011 offseason of the few eagles players ever to don the number four kolb will doubtlessly rank among the most memorable in only seven career starts kolb has racked up nine passing touchdowns and one rushing score he garnered two nfc offensive player of the week awards for his victories over the chiefs in 2009 and the falcons in 2010 despite missing his chance to be the eagles permanent starting quarterback after a concussion in week one of 2010 kolb has provided invaluable security behind donovan mc nabb and vick and finally appears poised to take over as a fulltime nfl starter5 donovan mc nabb5 of 15al bellogetty images love him or hate him donovan mc nabb will go down in history as one of the most talented quarterbacks to ever wear an eagles uniform mc nabbs list of accolades accumulated over his 10 year career in philadelphia could fill a small textbook among other honors he was selected to six pro bowls won the 2004 nfc offensive player of the year title and broke the following franchise records most career attempts 4303most pass completions 2534most passing yards 29320most passing touchdowns 203most singleseason completions 345 2008 seasonmost singleseason yards 3916 2008 seasonmost nfc championship appearances 5although one of mc nabbs most memorable moments will be his failure to lead the eagles to a super bowl xxxix victory his ability to keep the eagles a legitimate playoff contender over the course of 10 years should never be forgotten by the fans6 sav rocca6 of 15photo courtesy of pro football hofcom nick lahamgetty images sav roccas inclusion on this list among eagles greats may come as a surprise to many but the former aussierules player presents one of the most intriguing storylines among the handful of eagles to wear the number six after a prolific 15year career in the australianrules football league the 33year old rocca wasted no time in starting the next stage of his athletic career he sent highlight videos around to several nfl teams searching for a job as a punter before getting invited to the eagles training camp in 2007 as a result he was awarded the dubious honor of becoming the oldest rookie in the history of the nfl once rocca donned the midnight green there was no turning back he beat out incumbent punter and eightyear nfl veteran dirk johnson and has since enjoyed a four year career as the eagles punter and as the holder for david akers placekicks so far roccas inconsistency has kept him from earning a pro bowl selection but he did manage to earn the nfl special teams player of the month award in september of 2008 leading the league with a 441yard net punting average and having seven punts downed inside the 20yardline7 ron jaworski7 of 15george rosegetty images ron jaws jaworski left quite an impression during his ten season in the city of philadelphia the most memorable season by far was his 1980 run to super bowl xv with only brief appearances in the playoffs during the 1978 and 1979 seasons jaworski managed a pro bowl year in 1980 completing 257 out of 451 passes for 3529 yards during the regular season including 27 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions the magical run ended with the eagles firstever super bowl appearance where they fell to the raiders 2710 still jaworski had managed in a short amount of time to turn his team of misfits around and lead them to the franchises first nfl championship game in twenty years at the time of his release in the spring of 1986 jaworski had accumulated a franchise record 170 regular season touchdowns  a record that wouldnt be broken until donovan mc nabb came to town 22 years later8 davey obrien8 of 15photo courtesy of sports illustratedcom most notable for having the davey obrien award best collegiate quarterback named after him obrien also enjoyed a brief but successful career in philadelphia despite being a miniscule 57 151 pounds obrien was considered to be one of the top prospects in the 1939 nfl draft and was chosen fourth overall by the eagles the tcu product fit in immediately as their starting quarterback and lived up to the hype by leading the league in passing yards as a rookie with 1324 yards in 11 games in his second professional season obrien again produced top statistics leading the league in both attempts and completions he also contributed as both a defensive back and as a punter racking up four interceptions and a 407 yard punt average unfortunately obriens great career ended almost before it had begun apparently football was not his true love because despite a 2000 pay raise he retired after the 1940 season to become an fbi agent still obriens football legacy lives on even if most of it is from his college days9 sonny jurgensen9 of 15photo courtesy of pro football hofcom although hall of fame quarterback sonny jurgensen was only a starter with the eagles for three seasons before his trade to the redskins he still managed to propel himself into the upper echelon of franchise players after getting drafted by the eagles in the fourth round of the 1957 nfl draft jurgensen spent three seasons behind hall of fame quarterback norm van brocklin and was a member of the franchises 1960 nfl championship team in his first year as a starter jurgensen earned his first of five pro bowl selections as well as passing for an nfl record 3723 yards and tying the nfl record with 32 touchdown passes the eagles finished second in the division that year going on to lose to the lions in the playoff bowl two more seasons under his belt although injury plagued were enough to entice the eagles to use jurgensen as trade bait which they promptly did netting the younger less effective norm snead in return10 de sean jackson10 of 15nick lahamgetty images in his three short years in the nfl de sean jackson has already made a big impact on eagles franchise history becoming the first player selected to the pro bowl as both a wide receiver and a kick returner although showboaty and cocky at times many fans cant help but fall in love with jacksons onfield antics his bigplay ability and sheer speed allow him to back up his showboating and make him a nearimpossible player to catch which he demonstrated in the 2009 season by racking up eight touchdowns of over 50 yards the total was good enough for jackson to tie an nfl record previously held only by elroy crazy legs hirsch and devin hester jacksons most memorable play will forever stay in the minds of the eagles fans lucky enough to witness it live the miracle at the new meadowlands on december 19th 2010 the giants and eagles were tied 3131 with 014 left in the game a high snap by giants center zak de ossie led to matt dodges punt sailing straight into the waiting arms of jackson who returned it in a suspenseladen 65yard run for the gamewinning score with only three nfl seasons under his belt one has to wonder how many more exciting plays de sean jackson will produce before his career comes to an end11 norm van brocklin11 of 15as one of the few eagles players to receive a bust in the pro football hall of fame norm van brocklin deserves a special place in the franchise history books in addition to earning a pro bowl berth for each of his three years on the team van brocklin led the eagles to their third nfl championship victory in 1960 his 1713 defeat of the packers marks the only time legendary head coach vince lombardi suffered a playoff loss12 randall cunningham12 of 15mike powellgetty images a dual threat on both the ground and through the air randall cunningham ranks among the most exciting players in eagles history after taking over the reins from ron jaworski in 1987 cunningham promptly turned the eagles from a slumping franchise with a sixyear sentence in the nfcs cellar to a competitive team that made the playoffs five times over the next eight seasons through his 11season tenure in philadelphia cunningham racked up 150 passing touchdowns third most among eagles quarterbacks and 32 rushing touchdowns fourth most among all eagles players he was selected to three pro bowls and earned mvp honors in the 1988 pro bowl leading the nfc over the afc 34313 george keneally13 of 15doug pensingergetty images turning the clock back to 1933 we find offensive lineman george keneally one of the scant few eagles to be caught wearing the unlucky number 13 however despite the superstition surrounding the number on his chest keneally enjoyed a successful and productive nfl career originally joining the nfl in 1926 as a member of the pottsville maroons keneally took his leadership skills around the league eventually finding his way to philadelphia in 1933 and becoming one of the eagles inaugural members over the next three seasons keneally enjoyed his status as team captain and assistant coach earning his second allpro selection in the process14 ty detmer14 of 15rick stewartgetty images although his career statistics dont even approach those of eagles quarterback greats like norm van brocklin and donovan mc nabb ty detmer managed to carve out a small legacy for himself during his two years as an eagle shortly after signing as a free agent in 1996 detmer was thrust into the starting position after rodney peete was lost for the year detmer responded admirably by winning his first four games including a fourtouchdown performance against the dolphins and a 3121 thumping of the cowboys it was the first win the eagles earned over dallas since 1991 and it earned detmer nfl player of the week honors continuing his strong performance detmer led the eagles to a 106 record and a wild card game appearance against steve youngs 49ers the following year detmer was part of a quarterback carousel that included peete and bobby hoying but was never again able to replicate the success of his 1996 season15 steve van buren15 of 15as one of only six eagles to have his number retired hall of fame running back steve van buren set the standard for greatness in the franchise over the course of eight years in philadelphia the 61 200pound battering ram that was van buren earned seven allpro selections as well as setting multiple league and franchise records to this day van buren still ranks as the eagle with the most career rushing touchdowns 69 and the highest singleseason rushing yards per game average 955 in 1949 most notable was van burens propulsion of the eagles to two consecutive nfl championships a 70 victory over the chicago cardinals in which van buren scored the only touchdown and a 140 shutout of the los angeles rams however all good things must come to an end in 1952 a knee injury forced van burens retirement leaving him as the nfl record holder for career rushing yards 5860 and career rushing touchdowns 69 to this day van buren remains one of the greatest players to ever suit up in the philadelphia colors
