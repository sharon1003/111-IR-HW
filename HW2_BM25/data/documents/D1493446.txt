vanish but just as he was giving in the rider departed at a trot samwise then remarked upon the black rider that had spoken to his father gaffer gamgee some time earlier this made frodo wish that he had waited for gandalf that night they were again overtaken by a black horseman this time it seemed to be able to sniff out their hiding place but as it approached it was driven away by the song of a group of elves their leader gildor greeted the hobbits warmly and lauded frodo for his knowledge of their tongue frodo tried to get information from gildor on the black riders but the elf would tell him very little gildor foresaw that frodo would have many dealings with the riders in the future and urged him to flee them whenever he met them he and his party left the hobbits before daybreak while

met toms wife goldberry and frodo was moved to poetry over her loveliness he was interested in bombadil himself and several times tried to learn who he was that night he dreamed of a whitehaired figure on a pinnacle of stone borne away by an eagle the next day frodo tried on the ring after finding it had no effect on bombadil tom nevertheless could see him for he was not subjected to the ring’s power that night he dreamed once more a dream he never forgot frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey raincurtain and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver until at last it was rolled back and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise— the fellowship of the ring fog on the barrowdowns after bidding goldberry and tom farewell the hobbits went on and passed through the barrowdowns getting lost in the mist however they were taken by the barrowwights frodo last of all frodo woke in the barrow to find the barrowwight bending over his three friends he rose and in a tremendous act of bravery and resilience took a sword and smote off the wights hand then he summoned bombadil with a song

to their room where they found strider waiting to talk to them strider was honest and blunt telling what he had overheard and what he knew of them as well as warning them of the black riders and traitors in bree he urged them to accept his aide by inviting him into the company frodo was leaning to believe the ranger when butterbur broke in giving frodo the longawaited letter from gandalf undelivered by butterbur’s forgetfulness after some little bit of light was shed on the situation to the innkeeper he swore to help the hobbits in any way he could as a friend of gandalf and one very much afraid of mordor frodo reading the letter learned that gandalf recommended strider as one to whom frodo could go for help after some further debate frodo agreed to let strider lead them to
