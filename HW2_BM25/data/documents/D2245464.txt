best chromecast alternatives apple tv roku  more features michael grothaus 1903 8 mar 2018facebook twitter googlethere are tons of devices that stream to your tv besides googles chromecast google’s chromecast has been a smash hit for the company it first got a lot of attention for its original diminutive design it started the stick formfactor model of digital media players and originally looked like a small usb memory stick except it had an hdmi port on the end instead which allows you to simply plug it into the back of your tv this means you don’t need to buy a smart tv and for the most part upgrade your hdtv at all — unless you’re dying to get a 4k monster devices like chromecast which cost next to nothing have collectively saved millions of people a lot of money whether by extending the life of their existing hdtv or allowing them the freedom to cancel their cable or sky tv subscription or switch to something infinitely cheaper like now tv for all its early momentum says ihs chromecast had been unable to outship the apple tv this finally changed during the first quarter of 2016 with apple tv shipping 17 million units compared to google pushing 32 million chromecasts to market we anticipate that this reversal will persist since the introduction of the fourthgeneration apple tv apple and google have pursued vastly different strategies”the apple tv starting at 149 has inexorably been shuttled into the segment’s top end the device is now positioned as a premium hub that appeals to consumers of digital video to casual gamers and to i os owners who are intrinsically attracted to apple’s singular userinterface chromecast at 35 is a veritable bargain naturally complements portable android devices and offers a nofrills casting experience that obviates the very need for a userinterface i used to pay a fortune for sky per month but now i simply use apple tv amazon tv and chromecast for all my needs this way i can always find what i’m looking for whether sports movies or tv shows and i pay way less per month and as these devices become ever more popular getting access to newer and better content is going to become a lot easier i mean i’d rather pay £20 a month for a subscription to now tv and netflix than cough up £50 for the basic sky package — it’s a no brainerwhen other players started to copy the chromecast’s stick form factor google switched it up with the chromecast 2 and changed its design to that of something like a small hockey puck while no other media streaming sticks have followed suit with that design choice however there a a ton of devices that mimic some or all of the features of the chromecast here are 10 alternatives to the google chromecast worth checking out apple tvperhaps the most wellknown

turn it into a media streamer however the pi cast doesn’t work over a wifi network–you’ll need to use a hardware ethernet connection to stream your videos which isn’t a bad thing as a hardwired connection is a lot more reliable when streaming massive amounts of data samsung allshare cast being the gadget giant it is of course samsung has a streaming device the samsung allshare cast allows you to stream not only your audio and video to external displays like tvs but also presentations as well great for work however the samsung allshare cast requires a samsung device to stream from which is a bit of a let down so yep you’ll need a samsung smartphone or tablet if you want to use the samsung allshare cast wd tv live hard drive giant western digital has gotten into the media streaming
