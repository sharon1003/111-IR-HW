injected into the body which causes certain nodes to “light up” like a sentinel indicating thatthey are the most appropriate ones for examination they are detected by both the light created by the dye and the radioactive substance that is monitored by a gamma camera if the sentinel nodes do not contain malignant cells this usually eliminates the need for removal of more distalnodes called also
