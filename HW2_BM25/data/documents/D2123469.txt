refers to the end of time one of the biggest differences between the eastern thought of for example hinduism and buddhism and the western thought of judaismchristianity and islam is the concept of time followers of western monotheistic religionstend to view time as linear with a beginning andend and often have a difficult time evenimagining another way of thinking it just seemsobvious under such a frame of reference thateverything started at some time in the past andwill end at some time in the future in religionsarising out of eastern thought however time is circular repeating itself endlessly for most of humankinds existence linear thinking was noteven an option when thinking in terms of a beginning and an end however the mind immediately jumps to how theend will come and what happens next the study of the end of time is called eschatology whenvisions of the end were experienced and written down usually in intricate symbolism that only theinitiated would understand the writing was called apocalyptic writing one notable book in thistradition is the book of revelation in the christian new testament often called the apocalypse of saint john but there were many many more books like this that didnt pass muster for the finalbiblical cut an early instance of apocalyptic writing appears in persian zoroastrianism zoroaster called zarathustra by the greeks lived in 550 bce though some sources place him as early as 1000bce a good case can be made that the religion he founded was the first monotheistic religion although most people assume judaism takes this honor until the babylonian captivity when jewsfirst experienced persian religion their writing was filled with sentences such as jehovah is a mighty god and a great god above all gods psalm 953 the phrase all gods suggests that judaism was not yet monotheistic the principal concept of zoroastrian apocalyptic writing is dualism a battle between good and evil is being carried out on planet earth the good god ahura mazda is using humankind to bait ahrimanthe evil god into the world ahriman will tempt humans who by resisting will wear him down so that he can eventually be destroyed history will end at the last judgment and a new purified earthwill be formed humans will be rewarded with paradise an ideal heavenly realm with a divine courtabiding over the blessed or hell which is not eternal but will purify the wicked along with earth justbefore this happens zoroaster will return as a prophet conceived by a virgin with his own seedwhich has been stored in a mountain lake a prophet will then appear in this way every thousandyears until the final restoration of the world three thousand years later when the jews returned from the babylonianpersian captivity their writings showed evidence of thekind of apocalyptic literature they encountered there the later prophets of judaism beginning with daniel wrote with good against evil and light against dark imagery the dead sea scrolls left by the essene community make it clear that apocalyptic theology was a potent force in their struggleagainst roman oppression it may well have been a sense of apocalyptic curiosity that prompted some zoroastrian priestscalled magi or wise men to make the long journey to bethlehem they had seen an astrologicalevent in the heavens that signaled the birth of the king of the jews the quran of islam continues the tradition of monotheistic apocalyptic writing then on the day of judgment he will cover them with shame and say where are my partnersconcerning whom ye used to dispute with the godly  to those who do good there is good in thisworld and the home of the righteous gardens of eternity which they will enter beneath them flowpleasant rivers they will have all that they wish thus doth allah reward the righteous namelythose whose lives the angels take in a state of purity saying to them peace be on you enter ye the garden because of the good which ye did in the world 162732apocalyptic literature of all monotheistic religions shares a sense of linear time a fiery judgmentdelivered from the mouth of god or his messenger rewards for the blessed and punishment for thewicked believers

outdated or ideologically biased apocalypsethe book of revelation of the apostle john the evangelist a book of the new testament the oldest christian work of literature that has been preserved the apocalypse was written in the middle of a d 68 and early 69 soon after the death of the romanemperor nero by a jew who became a christian according to the tradition of the church theapostle john the evangelist is author of the apocalypse the apocalypse followed from the prophetical books of the old testament and has partially borrowed from the latter in its content it drastically differs from other writings of the new testament the apocalypse describes through a series of fantastic visions that the author claims are “revelations” he received from god the future of the world and of mankind the allegedly impending struggle between the “heavenly host” and antichrist the “end of the world” the “last judgment” and the “thousandyear kingdom of god” on earth the apocalypse reflects the dissatisfaction and the rebellious sentiments of the israelitepeople who lived under the yoke of rome and who hoped for an early end of the roman empire but the apocalypse expresses for the first time the ideas of long suffering and humility and calls forpassively awaiting the outcome of the struggle between the divine forces and antichrist in the hopefor god’s retribution—the “thousandyear kingdom of god” the chiliastic sentiments waiting for thethousandyear kingdom expressed in the apocalypse became very widespread in christiansectarianism for many centuries the reactionary forces of the church and the sects used the apocalypse with its mystical and terrifying scenes as an ideological weapon to influence theminds of believers referencesengels f “bruno
