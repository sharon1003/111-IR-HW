dwm luger p08 9mm pistol by the guns and shooting online staff the dwm luger that is the subject of this review photo by chuck hawks the luger pistole parabellum or p08 is perhaps the most aesthetically and ergonomically pleasing of all autoloading centerfire pistols it is also one of the strongest most accurate and most recognizable service pistols ever made bill ruger frankly admitted styling his 22 auto the best selling 22 caliber pistol in the world after the luger the standard luger calibers are 765mm and 9mm for both civilian and military models the 9mm luger cartridge developed by georg luger is the most popular and widely distributed pistol cartridge in the world today georg luger developed his famous pistol in 18981899 starting with the borchardtluger transitional pistol the luger is essentially a much improved borchardt type pistol which was itself based on the toggle action concept used by sir hiram maxim in the worlds first practical machine gun the maxim shot its way to bloody fame in world war one which also became the combat proving ground for the luger pistol the 1893 borchardt pistol was the first commercially successful autoloading pistol it was produced by ludwig lowe of berlin germany where georg luger was employed hugo borchardt and georg luger were coworkers for a time and their families lives within a few blocks of each other it was luger who in 1894 exhibited a borchardt pistol to the u s naval ordinance board two years later the ludwig lowe firm acquired the dmk ammunition company and from this merger a new entity emerged deutsche waffen und munitionsfabriken dwm dwm became the producer of the borchardt pistol and in 1900 its famous successor the luger pistol the luger was officially adopted by the swiss military in 1901 the imperial german navy in 1906 and the german army in 1908 which resulted in its common p08 designation the standard german army luger used in ww i had a 4 barrel the navy luger a 6 barrel and the artillery model an 8 barrel the luger was also the standard service pistol of switzerland portugal holland chile brazil and bulgaria it was used officially or semiofficially in austria luxemburg sweden finland norway spain persia iran russia bolivia china japan captured from the dutch in the east indies during ww ii and remarked with japanese characters france post ww ii occupation forces in germany the u s post ww ii occupation forces in germany east germany gdr state police and probably other countries it was tested by the u s military on three occasions and almost adopted as our standard service pistol many police forces around the world adopted the luger in 1922 dwm was absorbed by the holding company b k i w and in 1930 dwm was acquired by mauser during 19301931 all luger production machinery and many technicians were moved from the dwm factory in berlin to the mauser factory in oberndorf germany where lugers were produced until 1942 when the luger was finally replaced as the standard german service pistol by the walther p38 mauser made lugers bear the mauser logo on top of their first toggle link where the dwm logo had previously been stamped mauser produced most of the ww ii era and post ww ii lugers mauser sold commercial lugers in the 1970s and finally ceased manufacture in 1997 incredibly the lugers design changed very little during its long production life the principal change being the substitution of a coil mainspring for the flat mainspring used in the early 1900s the majority of german luger pistols were produced by dwm however lugers were also produced in large numbers under license by the royal german arsenal at erfurt between 19101914 and 19161918 about 2000000 lugers were produced during ww i by dwm and erfurt combined after ww i simson  company and kreighoff produced lugers under license as did mauser after their acquisition of dwm in switzerland waffenfabrik produced complete pistols and sig made parts the swiss turned out some 50000 military and commercial lugers vickers ltd of england produced a batch for the government of the netherlands around 1921 small runs of stainless steel lugers were made in texas usa in the 1990s for stoeger and mitchell arms but the high cost of producing this exquisitely fitted pistol and disputes over rights to the design ultimately scuttled these american efforts in the early postww i years dwm assembled commercial lugers from parts left over after the war the pistol that is the subject of this review is apparently one of those it is chambered for the 9mm luger 9x19mm cartridge and was supplied to us by harry johnson of wasichu warrior stoneworks in florence oregon usa we believe it was made between 1920 and 1922 and probably exported to north america this is because made in germany is stamped at the front of the left frame rail in english otherwise it bears the usual crown over n for nitro commercial german proof mark geschert safe by the safety lever geladen loaded on the extractor and dwm on the front toggle link the serial number is stamped on the front of the frame and the last two digits of the serial number are stamped on most of the guns major parts the serial number on the frame is accompanied by the dwm suffix h indicating manufacture in 1918 ww i ended on 11 november 1918 except for the made in germany frame stamp these are all typical dwmgerman markings unlike military lugers there is no production year stamped into the top of the front receiver ring dwm commercial model lugers usually lacked this date and lugers assembled for commercial sale in the early 1920s from surplus military parts usually had the date if any ground off the frame before final polishing and finishing our test pistol has a wide trigger lanyard ring and stock lug but no grip safety characteristics typical of commercial lugers of the period it came to us with one original early type magazine with a wooden floorplate and two aftermarket magazines with plastic probably bakelite floorplates dwm lugers were normally supplied with two numbered magazines but these rarely accompany used lugers today the grips are the original fully checkered walnut panels the typical dmw luger pistol barrel lengths are 378 after ww i only 4 434 6and 8 dmw luger carbines normally came with 1134 barrels our sample luger is unusual in that it has a 5 barrel as far as we know dwm did not supply 5 barrels on 9mm pistols and the pistols serial number is not stamped on the bottom of the barrel which was common practice nor is there a witness mark on the bottom of the barrel although there is an index mark on the frame we therefore believe that this luger was rebarreled at some point in its career in the 1920s and 1930s serviceable lugers were common in the u s and aftermarket replacement barrels were available in many lengths despite the barrels odd length and questionable provenance it has the typical thick luger contour early luger barrels were thinner than later barrels and wears a luger dovetail mounted front sight we also believe that our test pistol was reblued at some point as evidenced by the slight rounding of sharp corners and the shallowness of the proof and part of the made in germany markings on the receiver this is caused by the buffing and polishing required before a gun can be reblued the bluing is worn on the front and back grip straps and the barrel and frame show some holster wear at the edges but most of our guns bluing remains specifications as testedmanufacturer dwmmodel commercial p08 luger vintage 19201922

in shootable condition are priced beyond the means of many shooters luger collectors drive luger prices to ever higher levels and a large number of lugers today reside in private collections what has made the luger so desirable for so long here are some of the distinguishing characteristics mentioned by the ordinance board from the u s army tests of 1907 in comparison to all contenders but in particular compared to the colt 45 auto the shape of the grip conforms to the anatomical features of the hand the center of gravity is well to the rear there are two points of support as the pistol lies naturally in the hand there is an automatic indication that the chamber is loaded visible to the eye and sensible to the touch the empty magazine may be expelled by the pistol hand the parts are easily accessible superior accuracy 10 shots at 25 yards  13 luger and 24 colt autoperhaps the nicest thing about a luger pistol aside from its superior pointability is its obviously high quality and tight fit there is no looseness or slop anywhere it is assembled like a fine watch there are no screws holding the luger lockwork together the only screws one per side hold the grips to the frame you know you are holding a top quality beautifully made and fitted firearm no browning type tiltbarrel action pistol comes close to the precision feel of a luger of course the luger actions great strength is reassuring the toggle action is considerably stronger than normal tiltbarrel recoil operated actions lugers handle maximum loads with aplomb it is underpowered loads that can cause problems by failing to fully operate the action this is how the luger functions as concisely explained in the history section of the online luger forum wwwlugerforumcomthe most distinctive feature of the luger is undoubtedly the togglelock mechanism which holds the breech closed by locking in a manner not unlike the human knee which can sustain a heavy weight when straight but once bent is quite easy to continue to bend    when a round is fired the entire breech barrel and toggle move straight rearward on rails until the toggle begins to ride up on a pair of cams that breaks the toggle makes it bend at the joint once the toggle joint is no longer straight it bends freely allowing the bolt to come rearward and the striker to be cocked the spent cartridge is extracted by a combination extractorloaded chamber indicator on the top of the toggle and is ejected as the toggle nears the end of its rearward travel a new round is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the toggle is driven back to the straight position by a spring our test lugers single action only trigger has a long takeup and some creep typical of lugers but releases at a light 25 pounds after over 90 years of service the parts are undoubtedly well worninthe safety lever takes a fair amount of pressure to slide up or down it is positive and unlikely to be moved accidentally lever down is safe geschert is visible and lever up geschert covered is fire racking the action is different than with slide operated autoloading pistols we found the easiest way is to grip the pistol normally in the shooting hand with the trigger finger alongside the frame not touching the trigger point the pistol directly away from the shooter and upward at about a 45degree angle use the thumb and index finger of the weak hand to firmly grasp the toggle joint knobs and yank back and upward at about a 45degree angle in relation to the line of bore this should retract the breech block to hold the action open do this with an empty magazine in place as it takes an empty magazine to activate the hold open catch once the action is locked open the empty magazine can be removed to reset the trigger after dry firing the action only needs to be opened about 516 there is no external holdopen lever to release a lockedopen breech block insert a loaded magazine or no magazine at all and pull the toggle joint about 18 rearward then release before venturing to a gun range to fire the luger we field stripped and cleaned it field stripping is accomplished without any tools the procedure is first to remove the magazine and cycle the action to ensure that the gun is unloaded then pull back the toggle and turn the locking bolt takedown lever 90degrees downward the trigger plate on the left side of the frame just behind the takedown lever may now be removed sometimes moving the slide a bit forward helps dislodge the trigger plate the barrel receiver breech block toggle joints and their components can now be slid as a unit forward off the frame the large connecting pin between the rear link and the receiver may now be pushed free and lifted out to the left a spitzer bullet point or the tip of a ball point pen works fine thereby detaching the toggle joints from the barrel and receiver take care that the smaller pin between the breech bolt and front toggle link does not fall out and get lost this is as far as the pistol needs to be disassembled for normal cleaning reassemble in reverse order we thoroughly sprayed the innards of our luger with prolix to flush out dirt and crud and then pulled a bore snake through the barrel twice after drying the gun we applied a small amount of sigs white lubricant to the frame rails and breech block rails our test shooting with the luger was conducted at the izaak walton gun range south of eugene oregon this outdoor facility has covered shooting positions with bench rests and target stands at 25 50 100 and 200 yards we did our test shooting at a distance of 25 yards our usual range for testing handguns the weather was sunny with a high temperature of about 75degrees f and 510 mph winds we requested test ammunition from our friends at hornady remington and winchester without whose help these reviews would not be possible the ammunition we used included remingtonumc 115 grain mc mv 1145 fps remingtonumc 124 grain mc mv 1100 fps winchester 124 grain

255we know that lugers of this vintage were designed for full power loads today that would be nato spec ammo using 124 grain rnfmj bullets most functioning problems are caused by reduced power ammunition or bullets with flat tips or aggressive hollow points which didnt exist when the luger pistols feeding geometry was designed in our testing we had one failure to feed with the remingtonumc 115 grain mc load and two failures to feed with the hornady 124 grain xtp hollow points the hornady 115 grain critical defense and 135 grain critical duty loads caused the most malfunctions among the loads for which we recorded groups essentially making the luger a single shot pistol the hornady custom 147 grain xtpjhp cartridges have long bullets with a large hollow point these would not even feed from the magazine by hand and testing was discontinued with this load the winchester and remington 124 grain ball ammo caused no malfunctions these results are about what we expected we tried one original luger magazine and two vintage aftermarket magazines of unknown manufacture the aftermarket magazines simply did not feed cartridges correctly jamming the gun with almost every shot the original luger magazine worked perfectly after testing the magazines all subsequent shooting was done with the luger magazine this time out rocky shot the smallest groups the luger is a full size all steel gun with a long extremely comfortable grip that minimizes recoil and aids accurate shooting we have previously mentioned the pistols toggle action with straight line barrel recoil and light sa trigger these characteristics combined to make our range session with the luger pleasurable as you can see from the results above its accuracy was good for a 90 year old service pistol the fine sights and especially the small rear vnotch are difficult to see with our aging eyes they are certainly inferior to modern patridge square notchsquare blade sights especially for fast acquisition and target shooting despite this we managed to shoot some decent 25 yard groups from a bench rest with the luger although we probably could have done better with modern sights for most of us the luger shot to the correct elevation at 25 yards a good thing since the only possible sight adjustment is for windage and then only by sliding the front sight laterally in its mounting dovetail if a windage adjustment is necessary with a luger move the front sight in the opposite direction from the way you want the point of impact to move for example if you want to move the bullets impact right you must slide the front sight to the left in summation we found the luger fun to shoot accurate with all loads except the remumc 115 grain fodder very comfortable and exquisitely made it points better than any other service pistol we have reviewed it is probably the highest quality and best fitted of all successful autoloading service pistols those individuals who own a luger pistol are indeed fortunate note most of the historical information in this article was gleaned from the book the luger pistol pistole parabellum by fred a datig also helpful in our research was the 33rd edition of fjestads blue book of gun values and the luger forum wwwlugerforumcom online there have been myriad luger variations and we do not pretend to be experts on the subject our historical research almost inevitably given the long production span and multiple manufacturers of luger pistols in various countries revealed discrepancies even between knowledgeable sources this article can only attempt to skim the surface of the luger pistols long history and any errors or omissions are ours and ours alone
