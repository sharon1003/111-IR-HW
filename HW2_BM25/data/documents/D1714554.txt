vehicle from following this instructable the author cannot be held responsible add tip ask question comment download step 1 exterior cleaning so you wanna get that great factory color to rebel against the dirt and grime covering your car and regain control well it needs a little help this is where you come in begin with a nice clean bucket a hose a good car soap and a sponge or other soft scrubbing utensil i always begin my rinsing out the bucket to make sure there is nothing in there that would add scratches to my car after that read the label on your bottle of car soap for the specific amount to add once you have added the soap to the bucket fill the bucket with water i usually do this in a two step process i begin by swirling the soap with the jet setting on my hose head then once the suds have built up i move the hose head into the water and get a good amount of water going down under the suds now that you have the perfect amount of suds and water it is time to commence washing your car urgent do not wash your car on an excessively hot or sunny day the water will evaporate too quickly and you will get soap spots on your car wait for a cooler overcast day urgent as long as the day is cool and overcast begin by rinsing down your car it doesnt have to be extremely thorough but start at the top of your car and rinse down along the sides this is to remove any large particles of sediment that could scratch your paint when you begin scrubbing it also helps to cool the body of your car which will keep the water from evaporating more rapidly than usual when you begin washing your car keep in mind the zones of washing shown in the pictures below begin washing by rinsing the roof of your car with water absorb some sudswater in your sponge or rag and begin washing the roof in tight scrubbing circles go row by row across the roof section of your car keep the scrubbing rows parallel and overlapping to prevent any gaps of uncleanliness once you are finished with the roof section of your car rinse it thoroughly to remove the soap you used to scrub the dirt off repeat the above paragraph going section by section top to bottom on your car for me it goes roofwindows and roof supports top of hood and upper quarter panels middle of doors and trunk front bumper lower quarter panels lower doors and back bumper there is a reason beyond organization for this method of washing when you drive your car you pick up the heaviest and largest sediment on the frontallower surfaces of your car you collect the lighter and smaller sediment on the rearupper surfaces of your car finally when replenishing your soap supply in your sponge wring it out anywhere except over your water bucket if you do wring it out over your water bucket you will put all of the dirt you just scrubbed of straight into your water thus when you scrub again your putting dirt back on your car add tip ask question comment download step 2 interior cleaning while your waiting for the exterior to dry you can clean the interior i always begin this with an exodus of all extraneous materials from my cabin area for me this means anything from clothes to textbooks old notes to old breakfast whatever you need to remove remove it then move in with the vacuum cleaner and suck out all of the dirt and grime from everywhere this goes for the dash the floor the seats even the trunk take out the floor mats and vacuum those and and floor beneath them once i finish vacuuming everything i usually make use of some vinyl moisturizing wipes made by armorall i wipe down every vinyl surface in my car this product is something to consider purchasing if you live in a hot area where your vinyl bakes while youre at work or school like florida it gets ungodly hot here in the summer at this point you can wipe down your windows interior and exterior with any type of cleaner you have i use clear vue auto cleaner and it works very well afterwards you can add rain x to your windshields if you so desire by now the exterior of your car should be nice and dry if it is not take a break add tip ask question comment download step 3 the finishing touches the finishing touches are what makes the difference between a cleaning your car and cleaning your car like a pro this is where you break out the wax of your choice and go the extra mile for things that regular human passengers wouldnt even notice in the awareness portions of their brains but subconsciously theyre like ohhh this guy or gal cleans his or her car like a pro so what do i do for this subconscious approval you ask this is it urgent wax your car in a cool shady spot do not do so after a warm sunny day do not do so unless you have cleaned your car before hand do not do so unless you are adequately prepared to do so urgent i begin with the front section of my car and see how far i get typically night hits once ive done the hood both quarterpanels and the front bumper i do however wax without the aid of a machine if you do youll probably make it further as with washing do your car in logical sections topbottom or frontback doesnt really matter when waxing i try to do it in the areas that will receive the most wear and tear first such as the front hoodbumper and the drivers side read the instructions on the back of your bottle of wax to learn how i will not discuss that here once you finish the outer body of your car go crazy i wax the inner door areas that are painted metal but thats just because on a 1998 accord they are especially noticeable if you use your trunk a lot wax the metal on the underside of the roof of the trunk use it anywhere you want within reason i wouldnt wax door hinges or anywhere inside the engine compartment because i do not know if there would be any poor consequences use your head with the correct products you can also shine up your tires at this point or gloss your rims add tip ask question comment download step 4 conclusion if you have completed the preceding steps to your car enjoy the pay off driving around in a nice clean car is great especially when you are driving around passengers and receive complements on your work if you dont feel like going the extra mile or hours dont do step three all three steps usually take me a day with breaks for lunch and the hottest parts of the day if you get really into cleaning your car consider upgrading your cleaning utensils or trying out other waxes otherwise just enjoy your hard work add tip ask question comment download share did you make this project share it with usi made

mercedesbenz mint condition  citibanncomaannecunningham589 3 years ago replysorry but this isnt what i would call detailing a car how about using some tar  glue after its dry to remove tar and other crap that wont come off with detergent etc and instead of waiting for the car to dry use a chamois cloth or a proper microfibre cloth thus leaving no water marks all over the car as it dries in air blowers polishers and use foam based cleaners on the vinyl and after all that i still wouldnt consider it finished what about engine bays door sills parcel shelves after many valets i noticed not one pro hadnt done mine anyone wanting to open a valeting business needs to have a passion for it and it doesnt start overnight everything is trail and error and there is a lot out there trying to do this so you need to be ready to be better than anyone i agree with the washing the cars in sections but not with a sponge nor polishing by hand i could fully detail 2 cars per day advice buy a pressure washer and a buffer but dont buy cheap then you will see your car in all its glory dakota joel98 3 years ago reply nice very instructive dakota how do youcom 3 years ago reply here are some more great

look httpblogunhagglecommechaniccleandetailcarguyzer36 4 years ago reply good guide only thing i would change is the spongeno where for grit to go so ends up scratching car i prefer a noodle mitt doesnt scratch car as grit is drawn in and use 2 buckets one with shampoo and one clean water for washing out mitt on a regular basis rpillott 4 years ago reply thanks for the washing instructions it makes a lot of sense to do it in those sections and order big james 5 years ago reply i recently found this stuff called water armour wwwwaterarmourca that works fantastic for keeping your car clean i have no idea how it works but it keeps dirt and road grime and everything from sticking to the car it works awesome and has saved me a lot of time cleaning it all the time because my car is white i
