on this page at a glance what is being tested the test common questions related information at a glance also known as c difficile c diff c diff infection cdiwhy get tested to detect the presence of an infection caused by toxinproducing clostridium difficile bacteria when to get tested when a patient has mild to moderate nonbloody diarrhoea that persists for several days with abdominal pain loss of appetite and fever most commonly following antibiotic therapy sample required a fresh faecal sample that has not been contaminated with urine or water test preparation needed none what is being tested this test detects the presence of toxin producing clostridium difficile in fresh or frozen faecal samples this bacterium is a component of the normal gastrointestinal bacterial flora in up to 65 of healthy infants but only 3 of healthy adults clostridium difficile most commonly causes diarrhoea in people who have recently received antibiotics antibiotics disrupt the normal gastrointestinal bacterial flora allowing clostridium difficile to replicate and overgrow in the bowel other risk factors for acquisition of c difficile infection include advanced age being immunocompromised recent gastrointestinal surgery chemotherapy or the use of acid suppressive medications most commonly used for gastroesophageal reflux about 75 per cent of c difficile produces two main toxins  toxin a and toxin b the combination of an overgrowth of c difficile and toxin production can damage the lining of the colon causing diarrhoea dead tissue fibrin and numerous white blood cells can form a layer over the inflamed bowel which is referred to as pseudomembranous colitis c difficile toxins are detected from stools of 1525 of patients with antibioticassociated diarrhoea and in stools of more than 95 of patients with pseudomembranous colitis c difficile is a common cause of diarrhoea in hospitalised patients most infections are acquired whilst in hospital a minority of infections are acquired in the community many patients may have c difficile in their intestine on hospital admission without any specific symptoms and it only becomes a problem after they are treated with antibiotics the disease manifestations of c difficile infection vary in the simplest form c difficile causes a mild diarrhoeal illness the more severe manifestations are a severe diarrhoeal illness associated with fever dehydration septicaemia and in rare circumstances marked distension of the bowel wall called toxic megacolon  treatment typically consists of stopping the original antibiotic and administering specific oral antibiotic therapy to which the c difficile is susceptible most patients improve as the normal flora reestablishes itself but about 20 per cent of patients relapse occuring usually within a week of completion of therapy multiple relapses are possible in a minority of patients recently a new more dangerous variety of c difficile called ribotype 027 strain has been implicated in hospitalacquired infection outbreaks in north america and europe which have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality there have been isolated cases of this severe strain in australia but overall it is uncommon how is the sample collected for testing a fresh faecal stool sample is collected in a sterile container the faecal sample should not be contaminated with urine or water once it has been collected the faecal sample should be taken to the laboratory immediately or refrigerated and taken to the lab as soon as possible is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample no test preparation is needed the test how is it used the clostridium difficile toxin test is used to diagnose antibioticassociated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis that is caused by c difficile it may also be ordered to detect recurrent disease if the patient has a positive toxin test the doctor will typically discontinue any antibiotics that the patient may be taking and prescribe an appropriate treatment of oral antibiotic such as metronidazole or vancomycin to eliminate the c difficile bacteria when is it requested early diagnosis is key to preventing complications from severe c difficile infection as well as preventing transmission to other people stool tests for c difficile infection may be considered in the following circumstances hospitalised patients with frequent loose stools  abdominal pain  fever particularly if these symptoms follow within 68 weeks a course of antibiotics or if the patient has recently undergone gastrointestinal surgery or chemotherapy community dwelling patients with unexplained frequent loose stool motions particularly if symptoms follow antimicrobial exposure relapse of frequent loose stools shortly after treatment for a confirmed episode of clostridium difficile infection what does the test result mean if the c difficile toxin test is positive it is likely that the patient’s diarrhoea and related symptoms are due to an overgrowth of toxinproducing c difficile occasionally false positives may be seen with grossly visibly bloody faecal samples if the test is negative but the diarrhoea continues another sample needs to be tested the rapid c difficile toxin tests detect less than 85 of cases so the toxin may have been missed the first time since the toxin breaks down at room temperature a negative result may also indicate that the sample was not transported stored or processed promptly a negative test result may also mean that the diarrhoea and other symptoms are being caused by something other than c difficile is there anything else i should know there are a number of tests that are available to detect the infection and to determine if the strain that is present produces toxin exact procedures between different laboratories vary but in most circumstances a combination of tests are performed on the stool sample to optimise the sensitivity and specificity of the test some of the commonly used tests include c difficile toxin b or toxins a and b by enzyme immunoassay eia tests are some of the most common tests used by laboratories results are typically available within 1 to 4 hours though these tests are rapid and widely available they are not sensitive enough to detect many infections they miss up to 30 of cases therefore they are not recommended for use by some professional organisations a glutamate dehydrogenase gdh test detects an antigen that is produced in high amounts by c difficile both toxin and nontoxin producing strains it may be used as a first step to rule out an infection with c difficile but it should not be used alone since it is not very specific for toxinproducing c difficile it is often used in combination with a test for toxin by eia or a cytotoxicity culture a relatively new molecular pcr polymerase chain reaction test can rapidly detect the c difficile toxin b gene tcd b in a stool sample this test is sensitive and has become increasingly available in australian laboratories tissue culture to detect the c difficile toxin is a test that looks for the effects of the cytotoxin on human cells grown in culture it is a more sensitive method to detect toxin but it requires 24 to 48 hours to get the test result toxigenic stool culture which requires growing the bacteria in a culture and detecting the presence of the toxins is the most sensitive test for c difficile and it is still considered to be the gold standard however it can take 2 to 3 days for results a culture will also not distinguish between c difficilecolonisation and overgrowthinfection a commonly employed testing algorithm is to use a screening test such as the glutamate dehydrogenase test and follow this up with a confirmatory test with either enzyme immunoassays for stool toxins or pcr for toxins common questions what else can cause diarrhoea diarrhoeacoeliac disease why must the stool sample be fresh c difficilefalse negative why shouldn’t i take an over the counter antidiarrhoea medicine when i have diarrhoea caused by c difficile once i’ve had a c difficile infection can i be reinfected yes but relapses of symptoms soon after the cessation of treatment for c difficile infection are thought to be related to repopulation of the bowel by clostridium difficile spores spores are a dormant form of the bacterium  rather than reinfection are some antibiotics more likely to cause antibioticrelated diarrhoea broadspectrum antibiotics c difficile related information related lab tests stool faecal culture more on this
