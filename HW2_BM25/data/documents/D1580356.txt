the sodiumpotassium pump the process of moving sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrance is an active transport process involving the hydrolysis of atp to provide the necessary energy it involves an enzyme referred to as na  k  atpase this process is responsible for maintaining the large excessof na  outside the cell and the large excess of k  ions on the inside a cycle of the transport process is sketched below it accomplishes the transport of three na  to the outside of the cell and the transport of two k  ions to the inside this unbalanced charge transfer contributes to the separation of charge across the membrane the sodiumpotassium pump is an important contributer to action potential produced by nerve cells this pump is called a ptype ion pump because the atp interactions phosphorylates the transport protein and causes a change in its conformation the sodiumpotassium pump moves toward an equilibrium state with the relative concentrations of na  and k  shown at left index reference karp sec 47hyper physics  biology r nave go back
