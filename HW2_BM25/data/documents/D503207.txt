only eight seats in the canadian house of commons the ccfs leadership restructured the party during the next three years and in 1961 it merged with the canadian labour congress to create the new democratic party ndp most provincial wings of the ccf also transformed themselves into new democratic party organisations before the year was over with saskatchewan as the only exception there was very little opposition to the change in manitoba and the manitoba ndp was formally constituted on november 4 1961 future manitoba ndp leader howard pawley was one of the few ccf members to oppose the change outgoing ccf leader russell paulley easily won the new partys leadership defeating two minor figures who offered little in the way of policy alternatives the ndp did not initially achieve an electoral breakthrough in manitoba falling from eleven seats to seven in the provincial election of 1962 they recovered to ten seats in the 1966 election but were still unable to seriously challenge dufferin roblin s progressive conservative government party leadership contest in 1968  editmany in the ndp considered paulleys leadership a liability especially after the 1966 election paulley was known as an oldstyle labour politician and could not appeal to the broader constituency base that the party needed for an electoral breakthrough in 1968 he was challenged for the party leadership by sidney green a labour lawyer from northend winnipeg the 1968 leadership challenge was unusual in that many of paulleys supporters wanted him to resign the following year so that he could be replaced by federal member of parliament mp edward schreyer some also regarded the challenge as reflecting ideological divisions in the party with green depicted as a candidate of the radical left greens supporters tended to be from the partys youth wing while paulley was supported by the party establishment and organized labour paulley won the challenge 213 votes to 168 and resigned the following year edward schreyer entered the contest to replace him and defeated green by 506 votes to 177 provincial election of 1969  editthe ndp won 28 of 57 seats in the 1969 election and formed a minority government after gaining the support of maverick manitoba liberal party member of the legislative assembly mla laurent desjardins although the party had been expected to increase its parliamentary presence its sudden victory was a surprise to most political observers the question of leadership was important to the ndps victory after dufferin roblin resigned as premier in 1967 the progressive conservatives chose walter weir as his replacement while roblin was a red tory weir was from the partys rural conservative wing and alienated many urban and centreleft voters who had previously supported the tories the liberals for their part chose robert bend as their leader shortly before the election like weir bend was a rural populist who had difficulty appealing to urban voters the liberal partys rodeotheme campaign also seemed anachronistic to most voters in 1969 schreyer by contrast was a centrist within the ndp he was not ideologically committed to democratic socialism and was in many respects more similar to liberal prime minister pierre trudeau than to the provinces traditional ndp leadership he was also the first of manitobas socialdemocratic leaders who was not from an anglosaxon and protestant background a german  austrian catholic from rural manitoba he appealed to constituencies that were not previously inclined to support the ndp in power  editduring the years of ndp government major tax and social reforms were carried out a major hydroelectricity development project was launched in the north of manitoba while the province spent heavily on public housing 3 schreyers first administration introduced several important changes to the province it amalgamated the city of winnipeg introduced public auto insurance and significantly reduced medicare premiums schreyers cabinet was divided on providing provincial funding for denominational schools with green and others opposing any such funding but resolved the issue by a compromise the government also continued energy development projects in northern manitoba schreyers government was reelected with a parliamentary majority in the 1973 provincial election his second ministry was less ambitious on policy matters than was his first though the government did introduce a new tax on mining resources in the 1977 election schreyers new democrats were upset by the tories under sterling lyon schreyer resigned as party leader in 1979 after being appointed governorgeneral of canada howard pawley was chosen as interim leader over sidney green and saul mark cherniack in a caucus vote and later defeated muriel smith and russell doern to win the partys leadership at a delegated convention green left the ndp soon thereafter claiming the trade union movement and militant feminists had taken control of the party in 1981 green formed the progressive party of manitoba joined by new democratic mlas ben hanuschak and bud boyce despite these defections pawleys new democrats were able to win a majority government in the 1981 election pawleys government introduced progressive labour legislation and entrenched french language services in manitobas parliamentary and legal systems doern who had served as a cabinet minister in schreyers government left the ndp in 1984 on the language issue declining popularity in the late 1980s  editthe new democrats were reelected with a narrow majority in the 1986 election over the next two years the party suffered a significant decline in its popularity auto insurance premiums rose significantly during this period and the governments support for the meech lake accord also alienated some voters future party leader gary doer has claimed that an internal party poll put the ndp at only 6 popular support in early 1988  citation neededearly in 1988 jim walding a disgruntled ndp backbencher voted with the opposition against his governments budget this defection brought about the governments defeat in the house and forced a new election before the ndp could recover its support base pawley immediately resigned as party leader though he continued to lead a caretaker administration as premier gary doer narrowly defeated len harapiak on the third ballot of the leadership convention which followed doer declined to be sworn in as premier after the convention the pawley governments achievements included the construction of the limestone hydro project in northern manitoba and the enactment of the manitoba human rights code which included for the first time in manitoba protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation electoral defeat and years in opposition 1988–1999  editthe ndp was defeated in the 1988 election winning only 12 seats out of 57 gary filmon s tories won 25 seats and the liberal party under sharon carstairs won 20 seats to supplant the ndp as the official opposition most of the ndps seats were in northend winnipeg and the north of the province doer was not personally blamed for his partys poor performance and remained as leader filmon called another provincial election in 1990 to seek a majority mandate he was successful but doer brought the ndp back to official opposition status with 20 seats benefiting from a strong personal showing the leaders debate the ndp began the 1995 election well behind the tories and liberals but received a lastminute surge in popular support and came very close to forming government the party won 23 seats with the liberals falling to only three filmons tories lost much of their popular support between 1995 and 1999 due to increased unemployment the privatization of manitoba telecom services mts and a votemanipulation scandal in the 1995 election voters were also unnerved by filmons announcement that his government would undertake a further shift to the right if reelected with the liberals suffering from internal divisions the ndp were able to present themselves as the only viable alternative the 1999 election was considered too close to call until election day but the ndp benefited from a decline in liberal support and won 32 seats to form a majority government doer was sworn in as premier after eleven years in opposition return to government 1999–2016  editdoer government  editthe doer government did not introduce as many radical initiatives as the schreyer and pawley governments though it retained the ndps traditional support for organized labour manitoba has the lowest unemployment rate in canada as of 2004 and doers government remained generally popular with the electorate in the 2003 election the ndp were reelected with 35 seats and almost 50 of the popular vote an impressive result in a threeparty system doer was reelected in his eastend winnipeg riding of concordia with over 75 of the popular vote and the ndp also made inroads into traditional tory bastions in southend winnipeg doer became the only ndp premier in manitoba history to capture a third majority when his party was reelected during the 2007 provincial election it won more seats than it had before 36 again support was gathered from the south and western areas of winnipeg which were traditionally thought to be safe for the progressive conservatives under doer the ndp ran a moderate government that introduced a succession of balanced budgets doers first budget delivered in 2000 removed 15000 lowincome manitobans from the tax rolls and introduced 150 million in tax breaks over three years while projecting a 10 million surplus 4 his 2003 budget the last of his first term reduced provincial taxes by 827 million and increased spending by about 5 mostly in health and education 5despite a series of economic setbacks the government was able to post a balanced budget in 2004 through increased taxes and drug premiums as well as civil service reduction through attrition tobacco and liquor taxes were increased and the provincial sales tax expanded to cover more services 6 although doer rejected a panel recommendation to increase the sales tax by 1 7the government was able introduce a more expansive budget in 2005 after an infusion of federal revenues reducing personal and property taxes increasing spending by 35 and putting 314 million into a rainy day fund 8 doers 2006 and 2007 budgets introduced further tax cuts and the 2007 budget offered increased education spending and a new child benefit to assist lowincome families 9at the manitoba ndps march 2009 convention doer announced that manitoba would continue its commitment to education training and research despite a global economic downturn and a slowing economy he argued that the province was still recovering from the filmon governments spending cuts during the economic downtown of the 1990s and that his policies would allow manitoba to emerge from the recession in a strong competitive position 10 his government introduced a balanced budget with economic stimulus programs a few weeks later even as the global recession forced other provincial governments across canada into deficit 11selinger government  editafter leading the party for over two decades doer retired as premier and leader of the ndp on 27 august 2009 and was named canadian ambassador to the united states the next day 12 13 following doers retirement greg selinger became leader of the party at the leadership convention in october 2009 12 despite gloomy predictions selinger led the ndp to its fourth straight majority government in the october 2011 general election surpassing doers record and winning 37 seats in april 2013 the selinger government did not fulfill an earlier promise not to increase the provincial sales it instead implemented a 1 percentage point increase in the provincial sales tax from 7 to 8 which resulted in a precipitous decline in popular support for the government and ultimately a caucus revolt against selingers leadership culminating in the resignation of five cabinet ministers 14 15 due in part to the unpopularity of the tax increase the ndp fell far behind the opposition progressive conservatives in public opinion polls in the fall of 2014 several cabinet ministers privately asked selinger to resign in hopes that the party would recover under a new leader however selinger declined in september 2014 during a caucus retreat several mlas openly told selinger that he needed to resign however he refused again 15 a month later at the end of october jennifer howard fort rouge minister of finance stan struthers dauphin minister of municipal government theresa oswald seine river minister for jobs and the economy andrew swan minto minister of justice and erin selby southdale minister of health 16 and several senior party officials went public with their call for selingers resignation 15 on november 3 the five ministers resigned from cabinet due to their opposition to selingers continued leadership they did however remain in the ndp caucus as backbench mlas selinger responded on november 9 by asking the party executive to hold a leadership election during the partys annual convention scheduled for march 6–8 2015 stating his intention to be a candidate 17 the party executive subsequently agreed theresa oswald one of the five rebel exministers challenged selinger for the leadership and so did minister of infrastructure and transportation steve ashton who had not protested against selinger but who resigned from cabinet to enter leadership contest 18 at the march 8 2015 leadership election ashton was eliminated on the first ballot and selinger prevailed on the second ballot with 5093 of ballots cast defeating oswald by 33 votes 19the selinger governments popularity never recovered from the 2013 decision to raise the pst it was heavily defeated at the april 19 2016 provincial election dropping to only 14 seats the partys worst showing since 1988 the progressive conservatives under brian pallister were elected to a majority government selinger announced his
