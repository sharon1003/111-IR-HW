arts  humanities history was slavery in the constitution before it was abolished1 following 15 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer yes the original constitution did it stayed that way until the civil rights act of 1866 the constitution that the delegates proposed included several provisions that explicity recognized and protected slavery without these provisions southern delegates would not support the new constitutionand without the southern states on board the constitution had no chance of being ratified provisions allowed southern states to count slaves as 35 persons for purposes of apportionment in congress even though the slaves could not of course vote expressly denied to congress the power to prohibit importation of new slaves until 1808 and prevented free states from enacting laws protecting fugitive slaves slavery as all students of history know continued to be a divisive issue up through the civil war southern states worried that the balance in congress might tip against slavery and so were anxious to extend slavery to new territories and states the missouri compromise of 1820 enacted at a time when slave states and nonslave states had equal representation in the senate permitted slavery in missouri but prohibited slavery in portions of the louisiana purchase north of 36°30 the supreme court in its infamous decision in dred scott v sandford 1857 ruled that congress lacked the power to prohibit slavery in its territories in so doing scott v sandford invited slave owners to pour into the territories and pass proslavery constitutions the decision made the civil war inevitable chief justice roger taney writing for the majority in scott also concluded that people of african ancestry whether free or a slave including scott could never become citizens within the meaning of the constitution and hence lacked the ability to bring suit in federal court before the civil war ended congress passed and sent to the states for ratification the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude and authorized congress to enact appropriate legislation implementing the abolition the amendment was understood to also make blacks citizens of the united states overruling dred scott on that point the house vote to propose the thirteenth amendment followed the senate vote and barely made the 23 majority requirement when the vote was announced the galleries cheered congressmen embraced and wept and capitol cannons boomed a 100gun salute congressmena george julian of indiana wrote in his diary i have felt ever since the vote as if i were in a new country ratification by the states quickly followed and secretary of state seward proclaimed the amendment adopted on december 18 1865 less than a year after ratification of the thirteenth amendment congress used its newly conferred power to pass the civil rights act of 1866 giving black citizens the same right in every stateto make and enforce contracts to sue be parties to inherit purchase sell and convey real and personal property and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens supporters if the 1866 law argued that its guarantees constituted appropriate means of enforcing the right of blacks not to be held in bondage the thirteenth amendment unlike most provisions in the constitution is selfexecuting in that it directly reacheseven without action by congress conduct by private individuals slave holders because of this fact congresss power under the thirteenth amendment allows it to punish forms of private conduct when it might not be able to do so under an amendment such as the fourteenth which restricts the conduct of states prohibiting states from denying equal protection of the laws or due process source sexcerpt from httpwwwlawumkcedufacultyprojectspnkn0312 · 1 decade ago3 3 comment askers rating slavery in the constitution source shttpsshrinkima8bh b · 2 years ago0 0 comment a little clarification on the 35 propositionit was actually good for slaves why the southern states wanted to count slaves a full person giving them more representatives in the house or representatives more reps would have meant more power for the southern states with that power perhaps the northwest ordinances making the land north of the ohio river free would never have happened perhaps the missouri compromise that stated that missouris southern boundary would be the northern boundary of the slave states as the nation expanded west would never have happened we still had to fight a war between the states in order to settle the question but without the 35 compromise perhaps the issue of slavery and abolition never would have reached the point
