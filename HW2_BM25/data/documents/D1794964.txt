was named after the spanish troops who stayed there while building a fortified post for spain in 1768 much of the area was once the property of james de st vrain a brother of the last spanish lieutenant governor of upper louisiana it was in this district near spanish pond that an old log cabin said to have been used as a government building by lieutenant governor de lassus de st vrain the last spanish executive to rule this section was erected 5spanish lake prospered in the nineteenth century as a crossroads farming village came into being the bellefontaine road area was settled largely after general bissell relocated fort bellefontaine fort bellefontaine was established in 1806 by gen james wilkerson governor of the territory of louisiana the fort served as one of the most important military posts west of the mississippi river until the troops were removed to the jefferson barracks reservation in 1827 traffic between st louis and the fort was busy many officials had homes in both places and visiting dignitaries usually went to both sites the liveliest traffic was effected by the farmers riding back and forth to the city 5spanish lake became a welldeveloped neighborhood with the arrival of german immigrants farmland was intensely cultivated and small businesses and industries sprang up around the intersection of bellefontaine parker and spanish pond roads forming the village’s center the catholic parish of st aloysius in spanish lake was founded by and for many years served as a mission of baden located in the northern portion of st louis the bank of baden played a large role in farm financing in spanish lake and many county farmers also had business interests in baden the german dominance of the region was almost complete by the 1870s and most of the surviving farm houses and outbuildings are associated with that era 5spanish lake was a rural farming community for many years until the 1950s when neighborhoods of tract housing were built the area became a rural refuge from st louis city and received an exclusively white population the 1970s saw the proliferation of dense apartment housing to spanish lake africanamericans fleeing the failed pruittigoe public housing high rises in the city moved into the apartments via the section 8 voucher system which immediately struck racial tensions in the area particularly in local schools the 1990s saw a mass exodus of the white population spurred on by blockbusting a practice some u s real estate agents use to encourage white property owners to sell their houses quickly at a loss implying the africanamericans moving into their neighborhood will depress their property values this era of the citys history is chronicled in the documentary spanish lake although its depiction comes with some disagreement from community stakeholders 6  better source neededdemographics  edithistorical population census pop ±1970 15647 —1980 20632 3191990 20322 −152000 21337 502010 19650
