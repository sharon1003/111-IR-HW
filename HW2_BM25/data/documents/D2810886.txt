principles of humanitarian ethicsby walter johnson updated september 26 2017humanist ethics or humanitarianism is an ethical approach that places great weight on the condition of human beings everywhere without distinctions of any kind this doctrine holds that human needs are basically the same and revolve around the protection of basic freedoms within a context of an economic system that serves the population as a whole rather than groups of wellconnected elites potential humanitarian ethics begins from the point of view that human beings can only prosper under specific conditions governments and economic systems must be geared to real needs such as food shelter work and education the goal is not merely to prevent atrocities and catastrophes but to create a social world where the potential of each person is maximized potential is stifled for example when people do not have legal right to property are forced to work long hours or do not have a stable home because of war or economic hardship responsibility humanitarian ethics recognizes that human rights entail corresponding duties preventing human rights abuses responding to catastrophes and monitoring the behavior of governments and other political actors are positive duties incumbent on all peoples and states in short not only do people have the negative duty to avoid harming people but they also have the positive duty to actively intervene when suffering has become the norm neutrality intervention in times of great suffering needs to be independent of all political concerns humanitarian ethics holds that the positive duty to relieve suffering does not imply any political or religious commitment when intervening in a foreign dispute that has created a large refugee population for example the only criterion of action is need humanitarianism on a global scale refuses to take political affiliation into consideration and insists on positively assisting suffering people regardless of their background or stance on political or religious issues transformation charity is only the beginning for humanitarianism the ultimate principle of humanitarian ethics is transformation it is one thing to intervene to feed the starving it is another to make sure such disasters dont happen again humanitarianism wants to build institutions and attitudes that respond to peoples and their direct needs not those who belong to the “right” political party or religion humanitarianism seeks to slowly revolutionize societies to prevent atrocities human rights abuses and violence of all kinds the “reduction of vulnerability” is the proximate end of all humanitarianism the duty is first to protect then finally to create institutions where people can not only survive but thrive references international ethics a critical introduction richard shapcott 2010understanding peacekeeping alex j bellamy paul williams stuart griffin 2009about the author walter johnson has more than 20 years experience as a professional writer after serving in the united stated marine corps for several years he received his doctorate in history from the university of nebraska focused on economic topics johnson reads russian and has published in journals such as “the salisbury review” the constantian and “the social justice review cite this article choose citation style mlaapachicago bjohnson walter principles of humanitarian ethics bizfluent httpsbizfluentcominfo7751647principleshumanitarianethicshtml 26 september 2017 johnson walter 2017 september 26 principles of humanitarian ethics bizfluent retrieved from httpsbizfluentcominfo7751647principleshumanitarianethicshtml johnson walter principles of humanitarian ethics last modified september 26 2017 httpsbizfluentcominfo7751647principleshumanitarianethicshtml copy citation note depending on which text editor youre pasting into you might have to add the italics to the site name
