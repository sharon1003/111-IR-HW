focus on the following changes1 credits you forgot to claim tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe and can sometimes trigger a refund the irs offers a huge range of credits for donations to charity child care expenses interest paid on student loans and much more there’s also an earned income tax credit eitc—as of 2017 families with incomes up to 53930 can qualify but the limits vary based on your filing status and number of children that can be a very useful credit for reducing tax debt and if you forgot to claim it you should go back and do it retroactively2 changes
