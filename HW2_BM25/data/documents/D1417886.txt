the basics on generalized anxiety the symptoms first lets look further at the physical symptoms although the specific manifestations of anxiety vary for each person this chronic state of tension can affect six major systems of the body in the cardiovascular system anxiety increases blood pressure which causes tachycardia rapid heartbeat constriction of the blood vessels in the arms and legs and dilation of the vessels surrounding the skeletal muscles these changes produce symptoms of palpitations an uncomfortable awareness of the heart rate headaches and cold fingers in the gastrointestinal system anxiety leads to reduced salivary secretions spasms within the esophagus the hollow muscular tube leading from the nose and mouth to the stomach and alterations in the stomach intestines and anal sphincter these systemic changes result in symptoms of dry mouth difficulty swallowing butterflies in the stomach the gurgling sounds of gas in the intestines and mucous colitis an inflammation of the colon causing spasms diarrhea andor constipation and cramplike pains in the upper stomach in the respiratory system anxiety leads to hyperventilation or overbreathing which reduces the carbon dioxide in the blood with symptoms of air hunger deep sighs and pinsandneedles sensations in the genitourinary systems the anxious person can experience the need for frequent urination men may have difficulty maintaining an erection during intercourse women may have difficulty becoming sexually aroused or achieving orgasm in the musculoskeletal system the muscles become tense involuntary trembling of the body tension headaches and other aches and pains may develop through changes in the central nervous system the anxious person is generally more apprehensive aroused and vigilant feeling on edge impatient or irritable he may complain of poor concentration insomnia and fatigue generalized anxiety or panic attacks when someone complains about these symptoms and if he has excessive worries too then he might be suffering from what we call generalized anxiety disorder there is often a fine line between the diagnosis of panic disorder and that of generalized anxiety disorder three features distinguish them first the symptoms themselves if an individual is chronically anxious as he would be with generalized anxiety disorder and also experiences episodes of panic then panic disorder will be the more likely diagnosis the second distinction is the kind of fearful thoughts associated with the problem most people with generalized anxiety disorder will worry about the kinds of interactions they will have with others will i fail in this work setting are they going to accept me im afraid hes going to leave me what if they discover how little i know ill never perform up to their expectations with panic disorder the imagined response of others is secondary to the fear of personal catastrophe or loss of control and the persons internal statements and questions will reflect this apprehension what if i faint become hysterical have a heart attack cause a scene     and people see me the panicprone person focuses more on his inability to be in 100 percent control of all his physical and mental capacities the anxious person focuses more on his inability to cope with the expectations and responses of those around him the third difference has to do with the persons response to his fears the anxious person thinks about withdrawing from situations that increase his anxiety and may procrastinate on performance tasks the person with panic disorder on the other hand is quick to use avoidance as a way to diminish discomfort in a matter of days he will begin to identify the situations that are associated with the symptoms and determine how he can steer clear of them with panic he immediately views avoidance as the single best solution to the problem treatment of generalized anxiety mental health professionals have developed a variety of treatment approaches that have proved successful against this disorder these often include cognitive behavioral therapies that seek to alter the way that generalized anxiety sufferers think about and respond to troubling situations some individuals report that they have regained control of their lives without medication or extensive psychological counseling by learning anxiety management techniques systematic tensing and relaxing of muscle groups a technique known as progressive muscle relaxation has helped a large percent of these sufferers some patients report that physical exercise programs perhaps requiring no more than 30 minutes a day and no more strenuous than brisk walking provide relief from generalized anxiety meditation yoga massage and biofeedback are other relaxation tools that may be beneficial for some people controlled breathing and refusing ones thoughts on the present may also reduce anxiety these techniques do not provide instant relief as a rule they take effect gradually and they must be practiced regularly for lasting benefit understanding their own thought processes and how they evaluate disturbing situations helps some people control their anxieties cognitive therapy is designed to reduce anxiety by giving individuals the skills to assess situations more realistically patients may be trained to identify anxious and unrealistic thoughts and develop techniques to change their responses cognitive therapy may be supported by instruction in altering behavior or by lifestyle changes designed to cut down on stress medication has also proven effective in relieving anxiety symptoms particularly in providing fast relief from acute anxiety and allowing other therapy to go forward
