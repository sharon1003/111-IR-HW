frankish empire the name france comes from the latin francia or country of the franks  21 modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have the same historical meaning there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm 22 the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank  free in english 23 it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation 24 another theory is that it is derived from the protogermanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca 25 however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around 26history main article history of france prehistory before the 6th century bcmain article prehistory of france one of the lascaux

most famous and best preserved lascaux 27 approximately 18000 bc at the end of the last glacial period 10000 bc the climate became milder 27 from approximately 7000 bc this part of western europe

shores of the mediterranean sea this makes it frances oldest city 29 30 at the same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc 31the maison carrée was a temple of the galloroman city of nemausus presentday nîmes and is one of the bestpreserved vestiges of the roman empire the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italia around 125 bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french 32 julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc 33 gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces 34 many cities were founded during the galloroman period including lugdunum presentday lyon  which is considered the capital of the gauls 34 these cities were built in traditional roman style with a forum a theatre a circus an amphitheatre and thermal baths the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech  latin from which the french language evolved the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism from the 250s to the 280s ad roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians 35 nevertheless the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul 36 in 312 the emperor constantin i converted to christianity subsequently christians who had been persecuted until then increased rapidly across the entire roman empire 37 but from the beginning of the 5th century the barbarian invasions resumed 38 and germanic tribes such as the vandals suebi and alans crossed the rhine and settled in gaul spain and other parts of the collapsing roman empire

fleeing the anglosaxon settlement of britain settled the western part of armorica as a result the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region the pagan franks from whom the ancient name of francie was derived originally settled the north part of gaul but under clovis i conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central gaul in 498 clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church  french la fille aînée de léglise by the papacy 40 and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france  rex christianissimus  with clovis s conversion to catholicism in 498 the frankish monarchy elective and secular until then became hereditary and of divine right the franks embraced the christian galloroman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs so four kingdoms emerged from cloviss paris orléans soissons and rheims the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household one mayor of the palace charles martel defeated an islamic

10th centuries continually threatened by viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobilitys titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the kings vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for example after the battle of hastings in 1066 william the conqueror added king of england to his titles becoming both the vassal to as duke of normandy and the

augustus the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades in order to restore christian access to the holy land french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the twohundredyear span of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france 44 the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant making french the base of the lingua franca litt frankish language of the crusader states 44 french knights also made up the majority in

the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of france 45 later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental france including most of the north centre and

an heir in 1328 46 under the rules of the salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line 46 accordingly the crown passed to philip

the height of its medieval power 46 philips seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england and in 1337 on the eve of the first wave of the black death 47 england and france went to war in

claimed lands in the americas for france paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion where in the most notorious incident thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st bartholomews day massacre of 1572 51 the wars of religion were ended by henry iv s edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots under louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s he systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence  dueling carrying weapons and maintaining private army by the end of 1620s richelieu established the royal monopoly of force as the doctrine 52 during louis xivs minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france

acquisitions such as lorraine 1766 and corsica 1770 an unpopular king louis xvs weak rule his illadvised financial political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court–

most emblematic event of the french revolution facing financial troubles king louis xvi summoned the estatesgeneral gathering the three estates of the realm in may 1789 to propose solutions to his government as it came to an impasse the representatives of the third estate formed into a national assembly signalling the outbreak of the french revolution fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789 a date which would become frances national day in early august 1789 the national constituent assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen 27 august 1789 france established fundamental rights for men the declaration affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of man to liberty property security and resistance to oppression freedom of speech and press were declared and arbitrary arrests outlawed it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth in november 1789 the assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the roman catholic church which had been the largest landowner in the country in july 1790 a civil constitution of the clergy reorganised the french catholic church cancelling the authority of the church to levy taxes et cetera this fueled much discontent in parts of france which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later while king louis xvi still enjoyed popularity among the population his disastrous flight to varennes june 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility in august 1791 the emperor of austria and the king of prussia in the declaration of pillnitz threatened revolutionary france to intervene by force of arms to restore the french absolute monarchy in september 1791 the national constituent assembly forced king louis xvi to accept the french constitution of 1791 thus turning the french absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy in the newly established legislative assembly october 1791 enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the  girondins  who favored war with austria and prussia and a group later called  montagnards  or  jacobins  who opposed such a war but a majority in the assembly in 1792 saw a war with austria and prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that france would win a war against those gathered monarchies on 20 april 1792 therefore they declared war on austria xivon 10 august 1792 an angry crowd threatened the palace of king louis xvi who took refuge in the legislative assembly 56 57 a prussian army invaded france later in august 1792 in early september parisians infuriated by the prussian army capturing verdun and counterrevolutionary uprisings in the west of france murdered between 1000 and 1500 prisoners by raiding the parisian prisons the assembly and the paris city council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed 56 58 the national convention chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage 56 on 20 september 1792 succeeded the legislative assembly and on 21 september abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the french first republic exking louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in january 1793 france had declared war on england and the dutch republic in november 1792 and did the same on spain in march 1793 in

abolished slavery in its american colonies but would reintroduce it later political disagreements and enmity in the national convention between october 1793 and july 1794 reached unprecedented levels leading to dozens of convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined meanwhile frances external wars in 1794 were going prosperous for example in belgium in 1795 the government seemed to

switzerland in the east italy and monaco in the southeast and andorra and spain in the south and southwest with the exception of the northeast most of frances land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features to the south and southeast the pyrenees and the alps and the jura respectively and to the east the rhine river due to its shape france is often referred to as lhexagone the hexagon  metropolitan france includes various coastal islands of which the largest is corsica metropolitan france is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° n and longitudes 6°

hydrography mont blanc shared with italy is the highest summit in western europe the topography provides a major source of water and hydropower thanks to the numerous dams throughout the mountain ranges  montcenis lake metropolitan france has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes large parts of the current territory of france were raised during several tectonic episodes like the hercynian uplift in the paleozoic era during which the armorican massif the massif central the morvan massif the vosges and ardennes ranges and the island of corsica were formed these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the aquitaine basin in the southwest and the paris basin in the north the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of beauce and brie various routes of natural passage such as the rhône valley allow easy communications the alpine pyrenean and jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms at 481045 metres 15782 ft 84 above sea level mont blanc located in the alps on the french and italian border is the highest point in western europe although 60 of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks these risks remain moderate the coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges along the french riviera coastal cliffs such as the côte dalbâtre and wide sandy plains in the languedoc corsica lies off the mediterranean coast france has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers seine the loire the garonne the rhône and their tributaries whose combined catchment includes over 62 of the metropolitan territory the rhône divides the massif central from the alps and flows into the mediterranean sea at the camargue other water courses drain towards the meuse and rhine along the northeastern borders france has 11 million square kilometres 42 × 10 6 sq mi of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction of which 97 are overseas climate most of the lowlying areas of metropolitan france are located in the oceanic climate zone cfb and cfc in the köppen classification corsica and a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the csa and csb zones as the french metropolitan territory is relatively large the climate is not uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances the west of france has strictly oceanic climate cfb – it extends from flanders to the basque country in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide narrower to the north and south but wider in brittany which is almost entirely in this climate zone the climate of the southwest is also oceanic but warmer the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier away from the coast the climate is oceanic throughout but its characteristics change somewhat the paris sedimentary basin and more so the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter therefore most of the territory has a semioceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and other climate zones the semicontinental climate cfc of the north and centreeast alsace plains of the saône the middle part of the rhône dauphiné auvergne and savoy  the mediterranean and the lower rhône valley experience a mediterranean climate csa and csb due to the effect of mountain chains isolating them from the rest of the country and the resulting mistral and tramontane winds the mountain or alpine climates dfc and et are confined to the alps the pyrenees and the summits of the massif central the jura and the vosges in the overseas regions there are three broad types of climate a tropical climate am in most overseas regions including eastern french guiana high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season an equatorial climate af in western french guiana high constant temperature with even precipitation throughout the year a subpolar climate et in saint pierre and miquelon and in most of the french southern and antarctic lands short mild summers and long very cold winters environment see also

law main article law of france france uses a civil legal system 83 that is law arises primarily from written statutes judges are not to make law but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law  basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code which was in turn largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv  in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality that is law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy the basic principles that the french republic must respect are found in the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen french law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law private law includes in particular civil law and criminal law public law includes in particular administrative law and constitutional law however in practical terms french law comprises three principal areas of law civil law criminal law and administrative law criminal laws can only address the future and not the past criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited 119 while administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries it is completely separated in france and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court ordinary courts which handle criminal and civil litigation are headed by the court of cassation and administrative courts are headed by the council of state to be applicable every law must be officially published in the journal officiel de la république française france does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions france has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws the latter being abolished in 1791 however offences against public decency   contraires aux bonnes mœurs or disturbing public order  trouble à lordre public have been used to
