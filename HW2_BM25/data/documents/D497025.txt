name jay i really like this house i think the only issue with it is the parkingparking lot horrible they should try to do something about that ive seen cars park in places that werent even actual parking spots that needs to be fixed comment date 11122012 name chuck a the biggest gripe with this bowling alley is the parking its a very good bowling alley with a small parking lot and it shares the lot with just tires last year and this year for the tnba eastern regional we either had to park across the street in the shopping center or park on side streets and walk to the bowling alley comment date 1192012 name chuck a heading up there for the tnba eastern regional i hope the parking is better at amf price lanes last year for the tournament i had to park across the street comment

date 3242009 name mike a very sad day yesterday for me at price lanes i did bowl 2 games and it was fun bowled a 99 with 2 spares and a 113 with 5 spares but i hate to say this but im never coming back here again me and a couple other people there had to wait at least 10 minutes for the lady to come to the desk so that we could order our bowling games and shoe rental on top of that only half of the video games in the arcade were actually workingthe other games were only halfway plugged in and to me thats a safety hazard on top of that there were about a dozen kids there yesterday and im just breathing a huge sigh of relief and thanking god that they did not wander into that unsafe arcade there service was terrible as the lady there kept taking break after break thanks for reading my comment about this place hope you have a better day than i did here yesterday  comment date 3162009 name anonymouswhat happend to that hot girl that used to work there comment date 10142008 name letting u knohey guys u might want to check ur invetory cause e m has sticky fingers comment date 6282008 name frequent bowler i have to say that this place is one of the most expensive places to bowl it also has the worst shot that ive ever bowled on there doesnt seem to be many machine breakdowns but the oil pattern is just so unusual compared to everywhere else it would be worth the money if the shot was better and more of a league pattern i must also add that the staff does a great job in making sure that you have everything as far as food and drinks comment date 4142008 name open bowlerbest
