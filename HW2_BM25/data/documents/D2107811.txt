patients occasionally ask me if i’ll be the doctor who’ll take out a gallbladder or deliver a baby i tell them “you deserve better” i’m a primarycare internist and my expertise is broader than it is deep i manage high blood pressure and cholesterol but refer people with heart attacks to cardiologists i perform pap tests and prescribe birthcontrol pills but send pregnant women to obstetricians and i often diagnose but never treat cancer with mental illness though the limits of my role are less clear i’m comfortable helping people get through life’s more common emotional challenges like divorce retirement disappointing children if you’re hearing voices or if you walk into my office and announce that you’ve decided to kill yourself as someone did not long ago i know exactly what to do escort you to a psychiatrist but what about the lawyer who’s having trouble meeting deadlines and wants medication for attentiondeficit disorder or the businesswoman whose therapist told her to see me about starting an antidepressant or the civil servant trying to shake his oxycontin addiction they’ve all asked me to treat them because they don’t want or can’t easily access psychiatric care this winter i’ll see more patients with seasonalaffective disorder than the flu and the tissues in my exam room will dry tears more often than they muffle sneezes the problem is i lack the time or training to diagnose and manage many psychiatric disorders and some studies such as this one about low rates of detection of anxiety and depression by primarycare doctors show that i’m probably not all that great at doing so still over a third of all mentalhealth care in the u s is now provided by primarycare doctors nurse practitioners pediatricians and family practitioners one reason is that there aren’t enough psychiatrists i recall discussions fifteen years ago among members of my internalmedicine group about whether it was ethical for us to prescribe antidepressants when we practiced in a hospital with dozens of mentalhealth professionals on staff we no longer have those discussions demand by patients for mentalhealth care has increased such that if primarycare doctors didn’t offer it many people would go without it it’s estimated that seventy per cent of a primarycare doctor’s practice now involves management of psychosocial issues ranging from marriage counselling to treatment of anxiety and depression some argue that the increased demand is artificial driven by overdiagnosis of mental illness and overuse of psychiatric medications with one in four adults and one in five children currently carrying a psychiatric diagnosis—and one in five americans taking psychiatric medications regularly such skepticism seems warranted regardless access to psychiatric care is nowhere near large enough to meet the growing demand fewer medical students are going into psychiatry partly because psychiatrists like primarycare doctors earn among the lowest salaries of all physicians those who do choose psychiatry often don’t accept insurance including medicare and medicaid requiring patients to pay out of pocket affordable psychiatric treatment is especially limited for children and in rural states wyoming for example which has one of the highest suicide rates in the nation had according to one count from a few years ago a mere twentyseven psychiatrists—just over five per hundred thousand residents massachusetts by comparison had around over two thousand psychiatrists or around thirtytwo per hundred thousand residents but even in boston where i practice primarycare doctors are treating more mental illness some patients don’t have adequate insurance to obtain specialized mentalhealth care despite legislative efforts including the affordable care act to create parity between mentalhealth coverage and coverage for other medical conditions some people want psychiatric care without having to see a psychiatrist having finally confided a longheld secret of compulsive handwashing or bulimia to me some patients would rather not share it all over again with someone else and some wish to avoid having as one of my patients put it “a psychiatric rap sheet”—a record that an insurance company employer or nosy family member might discover they’d prefer to have their psychiatric diagnoses tucked discreetly between my notes about their heartburn and their eczema harvard medical school’s center for primary care recently announced a new program to improve the quality of psychiatric care offered by primarycare doctors in its initial phases it will place mentalhealth workers in six bostonarea primarycare clinics and target the treatment of depression it will also outfit the clinics with videoconferencing technology to enable consultations with psychiatrists and other specialists programs like harvard’s aren’t only responding to a shortage of psychiatrists though they’re part of a movement toward what’s called the “ patientcentered medical home ” first conceived in the nineteensixties by pediatricians who were trying to provide bettercoordinated care for chronically ill children the medicalhome model urges patients to receive most of their care in the offices of their primarycare doctors with consultants coming and going when a patient needs to see a specialist the primarycare provider arranges and oversees the consultation often it occurs in the primarycare doctor’s office or even in the patient’s actual home via something like skype this modern medical home depends heavily on technology such as electronic health records and video and digital communication between patients and their doctors—and between the primarycare team and consultants to get a sense of how this model differs from current norms i told dr russell phillips director of the center for primary care about the businesswoman whose therapist had recommended that i prescribe her an antidepressant i mentioned that i’d prescribed it arranged to meet with the patient frequently and crossed my fingers that the drug would be effective and wouldn’t cause side effects if the medication didn’t work or if she didn’t tolerate it i’d likely have to convince her to see a psychopharmacologist—if i could find one who accepted her insurance how would things have been different if i practiced in one of the clinics participating in his new program phillips said that first my patient would fill out a phq9 survey a ninequestion screener for depression the survey isn’t perfect but it might cut down on some of the antidepressant prescriptions written by primarycare doctors too busy to verify that a patient is clinically depressed if she met the criteria for depression set by the phq9 her name would be entered in a registry of patients in my practice who were assigned followup care with a psychiatric nurse social worker or other mentalhealth professional on my medical team if appropriate i’d prescribe an antidepressant but with access to consultation by phone or videoconferencing with a psychopharmacologist paid to assist me while it sounds reasonable for a primarycare doctor to get an opinion about a rash or a chest xray via computer it’s less obvious that a patient’s mental health could be assessed this way but it turns out “telemental health” works surprisingly well a 2013 review of several programs in which patients received psychiatric evaluation and counselling by phone email or video showed that telemedicine can improve symptoms reduce length of hospital stays and help people adhere to medication as well as facetoface psychiatric care for children and adolescents telemedicine often works better than facetoface care still i confessed to phillips that surveys registries and videoconferencing didn’t sound like the kind of patient interactions that made me choose primary care in the first place he argued that actually the type of care he’s proposing is simply a modern version of what an oldfashioned general practitioner offered a few generations ago the family doctor was a onestop resource for health care and emotional support he might deliver you take out your tonsils write your collegerecommendation letter and if he outlived you preside over your deathbed phillips envisions twentyfirstcentury primary care as being no less inclusive “our patients are coming in to see us” he told me “they have needs we should be able to address as many of those needs as possible and we know behavioralhealth disorders are front and center so it should be something that primarycare doctors can manage”he also pointed out that in the current system in which a doctor who cares for a patient’s body often has little contact with the doctor who cares for her mind doesn’t make much sense psychiatric drugs and conditions can affect physical health and drugs for medical conditions as well as the medical conditions themselves have psychological effects and people with mental illness are two to four times as likely to die from their medical conditions as people without mental illness several studies have shown that when primarycare doctors team up with mentalhealth workers their patients’ physical health improves the key to making teambased medical care work phillips said is helping the patient feel that his or her relationship with the primarycare provider is at its center “i’ve actually done some of this” he told me “and it’s very meaningful to patients to have a connection to a member of the team when they realize that the team is an extension of their physician so it can’t be a faceless person who’s anonymous and is a robocaller”not long ago a patient of mine came to my office accompanied by his worried family he’d been acting peculiarly and it wasn’t clear whether his behavior was caused by some longstanding psychiatric issues or by his many medical problems and medications i phoned a psychiatrist at my hospital to see if i might expedite an appointment for an evaluation to complement my medical work “is he with you now” the psychiatrist asked i said that he was and she told me that she happened to be free and would come to my office and meet with him there the patient and his family were greatly reassured by the psychiatrist’s visit i have no doubt that much of that reassurance came from seeing the psychiatrist and me even briefly in the same room together—from a sense that i the doctor who knows the patient best was running the show i thought wouldn’t it be great if a psychiatrist appeared in my office every time a patient needed one in the future one will—most
