the short answer yes its possible to go blind from drinking moonshine but its also possible to go blind staring at the sun when consuming alcoholic beverages of the diy variety the important thing is to let common sense be your guide the idea that moonshine or other homedistilled liquors can cause blindness is rooted in truth but its important to separate the causes of said blindness from the alcohol distillation process itself when homemade spirits cause damage to the optic nerve the culprit is almost always methanol cousin to the ethanol you consume when you toss back any glass of tipple methanol is a byproduct of alcohol distillation but only forms in tiny nontoxic amounts during regular distillation and anyhow it is easy to separate and discard from the first few ounces of alcohol that drip from the condenser these first few ounces contain other socalled foreshotslowboilingpoint compounds that come out of the still first methanol is among these compounds others are acetone aldehydes and other undesirables that impart unappetizing flavors to perfectly good moonshine any distiller worth his salt will discard these at the start eliminating methanol which also leads to nasty hangovers in small doses by the way from the equation so where does the methanol that causes blindness come from its not the alcohol itself you need to be worried about so much as the distiller methanolalso known as wood alcoholis cheap and its physiological effects on the body are the same as ethanols at least at first unscrupulous moonshiners will actually add methanol to their product to up the potency and when they do so the results can range from slightly unhealthy to absolutely deadly methanol helps impart a good drunk to the consumer but just a few hours later as the body metabolizes everything things can turn physiologically very bad optic nerve damage could end up being the least of your worries its very very toxic so even a small amountjust 10 milliliters of pure methanolcan cause blindness says dr bruce goldberger professor and director of toxicology at the university of florida college of medicine but just a few ounces of methanol can kill so one effect is someone becomes permanently blind due to the effect of methanol on the optic nerve but the second is that its just lethal physiologically to the body such was the case in indias west bengal state where 168 people died from drinking a methanoltainted batch of moonshine just last year but methanol isnt the only danger inherent in spirits of unknown provenance the copper coils generally used as condensers in the distillation process arent exactly optimal for making large batches of moonshine for distribution for large volume illicit stills nothing works quite like a truck radiator immersed in the product of course alcohol is a solvent and will leach all kinds of things from a radiator including lead salts that can lead to lead poisoning glycol products from antifreeze have shown up in batches of moonshine as well thats another way of saying that while the distillation process is inherently safe and easy enough to make even safer through the discarding of any trace methanol that may have formed early in the process there are various external factors that can make the finished product decidedly dangerous to consume pop sci isnt endorsing the purchase or consumption of unregulated and possibly illegal spirits but if you simply must dabble in homemade hooch youd better be sure you trust your distiller or alternatively study up and make the stuff yourself as with so many other things when it comes to diydistilled spirits its buyer beware
