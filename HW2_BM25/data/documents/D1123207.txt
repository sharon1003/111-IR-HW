adjourned its regular session on may 27 2013 there is no regularly scheduled session until 2015 state legislators created a select committee to launch an investigation into possibly impeaching wallace hall an appointed member of the university of texas system board of regents that committee has been holding a series of meetings in late 2013 the most that the select committee can do would be to recommend to the full state house that articles of impeachment be drafted if that is the case then the state house must follow procedures outlined regarding calling a special session specifically for the process of impeachment background after he was appointed in 2011 hall began looking into what he believed to be clout scandals within the university of texas system hall investigated the universitys forgivableloans program and admissions policies and preferential treatment to politicallyconnected individuals 8 hall as an individual citizen filed foia requests with the university system after his inquiries via his role as a regent were rebuffed 9 according to his accusers hall filed requests of more than 800000 pages which some texas administrators called an unnecessary burden 10 11 however a letter from university chancellor francisco cigarroa in february 2014 said that hall likely requested fewer than 100000 pages 12 13 in addition cigarroa wrote during testimony before the select committee some early witnesses implied that the u t system has not protected the privacy rights of students staff and patients this is simply not true 14an effort was begun in june 2013 to try and impeach hall from his position as regent some legislators are justifying the impeachment on the grounds that hall did not disclose several lawsuits that he was involved in when he originally

from office 17 governor of texas rick perry s spokesperson said the investigations send a chilling message to gubernatorial appointees 18 he added that the investigation was extraordinary political theater 19 texas state legislators have never previously tried to remove an appointed official only two elected officials in the history of texas have ever been successfully impeached 20a january 2014 review by the law firm hilder  associates concluded that there was no credible evidence of a violation of the state government code that would warrant a referral for criminal prosecution the report concluded that hall had a legitimate reason for having the documents in question in light of the fundamental role attorneys play it would lead to an absurd result were it criminal for an official to provide student records to his or her attorney in the face of litigation or anticipated litigation involving these records philip hilder wrote in the report hilder submitted the report to the legislative committee the board of regents hired the firm to review whether hall may have violated any federal privacy laws in his handling of student information november 2013 testimony prompted
