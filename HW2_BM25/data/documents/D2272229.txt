considering that most of northern europe including eg sweden norway and scotland is colder than southern europe closer to the equator however why is it that australia new guinea and new zealand are considered hot countries when they are close to the south pole i would love to know the answer edited august 27 2012 by jimmydasaintswansont evil liar or so im toldmoderators639939125 posts location washington dc region posted august 27 2012australia has the tropic of capricorn and 30º latitude lines running through it making its location the equivalent of northern africa not europe new zealand is well north of the antarctic circle — around 45º — so comparing it to swedennorway or even scotland is not a fair comparison new guinea is entirely tropical almost touching the equator southern europe doesnt extend past 30º — its closer to 40ºhttpwwwlibutexasedumapsworldmapsworldpol495jpg in short your north vs south comparisons are offdimreepr genius senior members7435412 posts location

i made unfair comparisons for the countries that i chose so it was only a perception then what about the hemispheres by themselves i should choose different countries at the same latitude from the equator to make a reasonably fair comparison what about mongolia kazakhstan ukraine and france compared to southern argentina southern autralia and new zealand would that be an acceptable comparison about north and southdimreepr said the truth of the matter is the opposite the northern hemisphere temperature exceeds the southern by an average of approximately 2 degrees chttpitg1meteorwisceduwxwiseackerman knoxchap14climatespatialscaleshtml i see that the reports talked about average temperatures over both hemispheres at a large scale which misses out climatic differences in a single country and that is ok however it is a surprising result for me because i would not have expected people to flock to northern hemispheres from the likes of africa for warm holidays but it tends to be the case for people in britain to go south when they want warmer climes i suppose i am being excessively insularhttpcdiacesdornlgovtrendstempjonescrugraphicsglnhshpng

suppose i am being excessively insular as swansont points out there is no real way to compare local topography is important and affects the weather in many ways britain being a prime example without the large coastline not to mention the north atlantic currents the temperatures both winter and summer would be much more extreme and thus negate the need for the citizenry to travel for their sunshine and skiing holidayshttpwwwweatheronlinecoukreportswxfactsnorthatlanticdriftgulfstreamhtmhttpenwikipediaorgwikiweatherinbritainjimmydasaint atom senior members161910 posts location farnham royal bucks posted august 27 2012 editednice links dimreepr need to read through them now will get back to you i read through both links with interest although i just quickly scanned the wiki article because it was quite lengthy from what i can tell there are specific factors which affect climate add to these for clarification guys1 latitude as it increases temperature decreases2 large bodies of water can affect overall temperatures of land nearby3 windward wet or leeward drier parts of a slope4 elevation  higher means colder5 ocean currents eg the thermohaline circulation you referred to above which bring warmth to the northern atlantic ocean the combinations lead to differences in temperature from region to region of the same country as well as between countries therefore the op was just speculation and is not backed up with evidence edited august 27 2012 by jimmydasaint
