consistency of standard cement paste is4031part41988suryakanta  may 4 2013  how to tests on cement  31 comments overview standard consistency of a cement paste is defined as that consistency which will permit a vicat plunger having 10 mm dia and 50 mm length to penetrate to a depth of 3335 mm from top of the mould apparatus measuring instruments name capacity  range  size accuracy  least countvicat apparatus should be made as per is5513 —balance 1000 g 1 g measuring cylinder 100 ml 1 ml other accessories tray glass plate vicat apparatus environmental condition temperature 27 ± 2 0 chumidity 65 ± 5 procedure take 400 g of cement and place it in the enameled tray mix about 25 water by weight of dry cement thoroughly to get a cement paste total time taken to obtain thoroughly mixed water cement paste ie “gauging time” should not be more than 3 to 5 minutes fill the vicat mould resting upon a glass plate with this cement paste after filling the mould completely smoothen the surface of the paste making it level with top of the mould place the whole assembly ie mould  cement paste  glass plate under the rod bearing plunger lower the plunger gently so as to touch the surface of the test block and quickly release the plunger allowing it to sink into the paste measure the depth of penetration and record it prepare trial pastes with varying percentages of water content and follow the steps 2 to 7 as described above until the depth of penetration becomes 33 to 35 mm calculation calculate percentage of water p by weight of dry cement required to prepare cement paste of standard consistency by following formula and express it to the first place of decimal wherewquantity of water added cquantity of cement used precautions gauging time should be strictly observed room temperature should be well maintained as per test requirement all apparatus used should be clean the experiment should be performed away from vibrations and other disturbances technical

project related to phospho gypsm how can i find out the standard consistency of phospho gypsm is it same as for cement abhideep singh february 1 2018 reply is the consistency 35 for opc 43 grade of cement is correct as the value lies in between 25 to 33abhideep singh february 1 2018 reply in our lab consistency test for opc 43 grade was carried out it came 35 is it correct as because the standard value lies in between 25 to 33ramakanth g february 1 2018 replywhy we take water content in setting test of cement lesser than the consistency value severine november 2 2017 reply085 is it a factor how to calculate it… rajesh october 27 2017 reply hii iam rajesh we know the percentage of water is added for initial setting time is 085p take an eg  cement 1000 g or 1kg water required 085p ×wtof cement 085×025×1000 2125ml of water added tanq rajesh october 27 2017 reply hii iam rajesh we know the percentage of water is added for initial setting time is 085p take an eg  cement 1000 g or

correct result ravi shankar thakur may 2 2017 reply correction please plunger diameter 1mm rather then 10mm do correction asap prithwin krishna january 9 2018 reply1mm sqaure needle is used for initial setting 10mm needle is used for normal consistency test lalan kumar march 9 2017 reply dear sir please suggest me about concistency related trouble  i want to know about 85 times  what is it please help me thanks regards  lalan kumar asst lab tech tek bahadur kc march 4 2017 reply sir i m doing project on geopolymer using fly ash but i dont know how to find the normal consistency of fly ash i tried as like cement but its taking the water around 80 is it right or how much should be the maximum percentage ashwini january 30 2017 reply why 25 of water we addingplz help me out manju july 8 2017 reply same dout pls help me pavan september 11 2017 reply based on trial and error we get the standard value that is in between 25 to 33 of water by weight of the cement we will achieve the standard consistency for different type of cement note consistency means amount of water required to form uniform cement pasteribin november 20 2016 replywhat is the standard consistency of cement pastewhy we are determining the consistency of cement saurabh srivastava november 19 2016 replywhat is the logic behind p43 of combined mass of cement and sand deepanjali das november 9 2016 reply okay i got the consistency part but when i go for initial setting time or finap setting time the amount of water to be added is mentioned as “085p” so my doubt is if i am taking 100gm of cement and amount of water as “221”gm 085×26 it is ok but if i take larger amounts for eg 2000gm of cement will amount of water according to 085p be “221gm”  but that will be too small amount isn’t it plz help… saurabh srivastava november 20 2016 reply085 times the water required in ml is the equation for water demand for ist and fst hence you need to reestimate the water qty when any changes occur in cement qtywater required for 100 gm cement will be different from water for 200 gm cement as it is to be as per standard consistency 57cm in vicat apparatus gopal december 5 2016 reply085p this is new percentage of water to be added so for 2000 gms u need 085p2000 ml of water deepanjali das november 9 2016 reply okay i got the consistency part but when i go for initial setting time or finap setting

consistency depanjal november 9 2016 reply bcz that indicates that chemical bonds are taking place in the mixture and the cement is now becoming solid and usually it happens in about 10 minutes lone bilal august 10 2017 reply do you have any literature supporting it…ahn february 22 2017 reply how we have to multiply weight of cement to 85p cuz it state 85p by weight of cement…shouldn’t we divide 85p by cement weight dheeraj dasari november 1 2016 reply why the penetration limit 57mm fixed in consistency testfarooq june 28 2016 replytest procedure will repeat untill get the reading 5 to 7 mm instead of 33 to 35mm sandeep yadav july 14 2016 replywhen we taking reading from bottom of the mould then it should come 5 to 7 mm confirming to is 4031 part 4  and above he is clearly mention that he was takes reading from the top of mould kp april 28 2016 replywhy 25 of watershrikant january 20 2016 reply good … add a comment your email address will not be published required fields are marked
