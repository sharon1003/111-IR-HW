cover the most tantalizing parts of her anatomy teasing yet accentuating the hidden mysteries of the female charm it wasnt always this way early bathing suits bore a closer resemblance to the burka than to anything a woman might wear in the water these early suits werent even called swimsuits because they were so heavy it was impossible to swim in them the modern bikini was invented by french engineer louis réard in 1946 he named it after the bikini atoll in the pacific the site of the operation crossroads nuclear weapon test on july 1 1946 réard reasoned that the burst of excitement created by his new swimsuit would be like the explosion of the atom bomb since his contemporary jacques heim had called his bikini precursor the atome in view of its size réard claimed to have split the atome  to make it even smaller his innovation was largely based on exposing the navel which was concealed by earlier twopiece bathing costumes crossroads able a 23kiloton airdeployed atomic bomb

course these ancient bikinis disappeared during the dark ages which is why we call them the dark ages the bikini finally made its reappearance in the midtwentieth century before that bikinitype garb began appearing in the dance halls and in pulp fiction precursor to the bikini — exotic dancecleopatra before caesar detail by orientalist painter jean léone gérôme 1866the distinguishing characteristic of the bikini is of course its bellybaring style previous swimsuit styles revealed the legs back and shoulders but kept the torso modestly covered the belly baring characteristic which later found its way into womens swimwear was first seen in the west in the form of exotic dance most popularly belly dancing belly dancing arose from various dancing styles which were performed in the middle east and north african regions belly dance was popularized in the west during the romantic movement of the 18th and 19th centuries when orientalist artists depicted romanticized images of harem life in the ottoman empire around this time dancers from middle eastern countries began to perform at various world fairs often drawing crowds in numbers that rivaled those for the science and technology exhibits it was during this period that the term oriental or eastern dancing is first used several dancers including the french author colette engaged in oriental dancing sometimes passing off their own interpretations as authentic in the west the costume most associated with belly dance is the bedlah arabic for suit it owes its creation to the victorian painters of orientalism and the harem fantasy productions of vaudeville burlesque and hollywood during the turn of the last century rather than to authentic middle eastern dress the bedlah style includes a fitted top or bra usually with a fringe of beads or coins a fitted hip belt again with a fringe of beads or coins and a skirt or harem pants the bra and belt may be richly decorated with beads sequins braid and embroidery the belt may be a separate piece or sewn into a skirt the hip belt is a broad piece of fabric worn low on the hips it may have straight edge or may be curved or angled the bra usually matches the belt and does not resemble lingerie the classic harem pants are full and gathered at the ankle but there are many variations sometimes pants and a sheer skirt are worn together skirts may be flowing creations made of multiple layers of one color sheer fabric chiffon badia masabni a cairo cabaret owner is credited with bringing the costume to egypt because it was the image that western tourists wanted however belly dancing has been banned in egypt since the 1950s mata hari ca 1907one of the more famous western practitioners of the belly dance was mata hari mata hari was the stage name of margaretha geertruida zelle 18761917 a dutch exotic dancer courtesan and accused spy who was executed by france for espionage during world war i from 1894 to 1902 margaretha was married to a dutch colonial army they moved to java in the dutch east indies margaretha studied the indonesian traditions intensively joining a local dance company her stage name mata hari is indonesian for sun in 1903 margaretha moved to paris where she performed as a circus horse rider by 1905 she began to win fame as an exotic dancer it was then that she adopted the stage name mata hari mata hari was a contemporary of dancers isadora duncan and ruth st denis leaders in the early modern dance movement which around the turn of the 20th century looked to asia and egypt for artistic inspiration critics would later write about this and other such movements within the context of orientalism promiscuous flirtatious and openly flaunting her body mata hari captivated her audiences and was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the musée guimet on 13 march 1905 she became the longtime mistress of the millionaire lyon industrialist emile etienne guimet who had founded the musée she posed as a java princess of priestly hindu birth pretending to have been immersed in the art of sacred indian dance since childhood she was photographed numerous times during this period nude or nearly so mata hari this brought this carefree provocative style to the stage in her act which garnered wide acclaim the most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments upon her arms and head although the claims made by her about her origins were fictitious her act was spectacularly successful because it elevated exotic dance to a more respectable status and so broke new ground in a style of entertainment for which paris was later to become world famous however paris could also be a cold and unforgiving place in 1916 the french military leaders needing a scapegoat for their ineptitude on the battlefield had mata hari shot as a spy as with the earlier case of alfred dreyfus mata hari was accused of spying for germany in order to protect an actual french traitor who was never punished pulp fiction influence on the bikiniedgar rice burroughs 1932 novel the moon maid mata haris melodramatic life and untimely death was the stuff the pulp fiction was made of except of course pulp fiction dealt with fiction like the exotic dancers pulp fiction did much to popularize the baretorso look which eventually became the bikini

the dime novels featured lurid cover art the pulp magazines and dime novels were collectively termed pulp fiction the lurid covers of both the novels and the magazines often depicted scantily clad women in garb similar to a bikini for example the cover of edgar rice burroughs novel the moon maid depicts a girl in what can only be described as a bikini the cover of the pulp magazine oriental stories in 1933 portrays an even more scantilyclad lass with both the dancers and the pulp fiction depicting women in bikinilike garb it was only a matter of time before real women started wearing

les folies bergères in paris heim was working on a new kind of beach costume it comprised two pieces but the bottom was still large enough to cover its wearers navel in may 1946 he advertised it as the worlds smallest bathing suit dubbing the suit the atome réard named his swimsuit the bikini taking the name from the bikini atoll one of a series of islands in the south pacific where testing on the new atomic bomb was occurring that summer historians assume reard termed his swimsuit the bikini because he believed its revealing style would create reactions among people similar to those created by america’s atomic bomb in japan just one summer earlier micheline bernardini modeling louis réards bikini in 1946réard sliced the top off the bottoms and advertised it as smaller than the smallest swimsuit for the first time the womans belly button was revealed réard could not find a model to wear his design he ended up hiring micheline bernardini a nude dancer from the casino de paris

bardot bikini its nothing more than a gstring its at the razors edge of decency modern girl magazine a fashion magazine from the united states was quoted in 1957 as saying it is hardly necessary to

numbers that summer though very few were ever worn in public by the end of the season gernreich had sold 3000 swimsuits at 24 apiece which meant a tidy profit the novelty of the design caught significant attention and the san francisco chronicle featured a woman in a monokini with her exposed breasts clearly visible on its first page a photograph of peggy moffitt the famous model for the suit appeared in womens wear daily life and numerous other publications in the mid1960s led by movie starlets and models in cannes and sainttropez women began to remove their bikini tops while

legal statute or by custom beaches permitting topless swimming and sunbathing became common in europe australia and israel where the practice mostly became uncontroversial by the mid1990s australian researchers found that 88 percent of australian university students of both sexes considered it socially acceptable for women to remove their tops on public beaches in the u s except for designated nude beaches topless bikinis remain rare however on miamis south beach or so be topless sunbathing is common due to the large number of european tourists and lax enforcement sports bikinigreek beach volleyballer vassiliki karadassiou of course since the bikini is a swimsuit you might think of it as sports wear however competition swimmers dont wear bikinis except sometimes in practice for competition the onepiece is preferred because it produces less drag in the olympics the competition suits are padded to act as a flotation device similar to water wings to an ordinary layman such as yourself using a flotation device in a swimming competition would be considered cheating but the international olympic committee doesnt agree with you thats why the olympic suits cover the entire body including the legs torso and chest the more area covered the more flotation the suit provides however the bikini hasnt been completely eliminated as sporting wear even from ancient times the bikini was used for sport there is evidence of ancient roman women playing expulsim ludere an early version of handball whatever that is in a bikinitype outfit high jumper melanie skotnik in modern times
