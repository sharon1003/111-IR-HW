inhabited by yuki and wintuan speakers the name pomo derives from a conflation of the pomo words pʰoːmoː and pʰoʔmaʔ 1 it originally meant those who live at red earth hole and was once the name of a village in southern potter valley near the presentday community of pomo 2 it may have referred to local deposits of the red mineral magnesite used for red beads or to the reddish earth and clay such as hematite mined in the area 3 in the northern pomo dialect pomo or poma was used as a suffix after the names of places to mean a subgroup of people of the place 4 by the year 1877 possibly beginning

geography lineage and marriage traditionally they relied upon fishing hunting and gathering for their food history  editthe pomo indian tribe is a linguistic branch of native american of northern california their historic territory in the past was on the pacific coast between cleone and duncans point the pomo indians preferred to live in small groups which they called bands their bands were linked by geography lineage and marriage the pomo was composed of about hundreds of independent communities like many other native groups the pomo indian of northern california relied upon fishing hunting and gathering for their daily food supply they ate salmon wild greens gnats mushrooms berries grasshoppers rabbits rats and squirrels acorns were the most important part of their diet the pomo indian women were gatherers while men were hunters and fishers they were somewhat nomadic people and liked to migrate around the california great plains wherever they found peaceful and well adapted they began building homes the pomo people lived a very simple life they did not use a lot of clothing men were usually naked and women mostly wore short and thick skirts made of deerskin in the cold winter more clothing made of animals skin might be worn the pomo indians are known as masters of basket weaving and jewelry making some of their most culturally important dances are ghost dance and far south during a ghost dance ceremony they believed that the dead were recognized and a far south dance was celebrated as the rite of passage for children to the tribe 5 many pomo languages disappeared and have been replaced by english there are about twelve pomo languages that are used by pomo people nowadays most of the remaining pomo people live on reservations now main article pomoan languages pomo also known as kulanapan is a language family that includes seven distinct and mutually unintelligible languages including northern pomo northeastern pomo eastern pomo southeastern pomo central pomo southern pomo and kashaya john wesley powell classified the language family as kulanapan in 1891 based on the name first used by george gibbs in 1853 he referred to the language by the name of one band from the clear lake pomo 6religion  editdoctors headdress guktsushua pomo native american 19061907 brooklyn museum the pomo people participated in shamanism one form this took was the kuksu religion which was held by people in central and northern california it included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume an annual mourning ceremony puberty rites of passage shamanic intervention with the spirit world and an allmale society that met in subterranean dance rooms 7 8 the pomo believed in a supernatural being the kuksu or guksu depending on their dialect who lived in the south and who came during ceremonies to heal their illnesses medicine men dressed up as kuksu their interpretation of a healer spirit a later shamanistic movement was the messiah cult introduced by the wintun people it was practiced through 1900 this cult believed in prophets who had dreams waking visions and revelations from presiding spirits and virtually formed a priesthood the prophets earned much respect and status among the people 9traditional narratives  editmain article pomo traditional narratives the record of pomo myths legends tales and histories is extensive the body of narratives is classed within the cent layla i ral california cultural pattern influences from the  indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest main article pomo mythology the pomo had a strong mythology of creation and world order it includes the personification of the kuksu or guksu healer spirit spirits from six cardinal directions and the coyote as their ancestor and creator god 10prehistory  editaccording to some linguistic reconstructions the pomo people descend from the hokan speaking people in the sonoma county california region this area was where coastal redwood forests met with interior valleys with mixed woodlands in this hypothesis about 7000 bce a hokanspeaking people migrated into the valley and mountain regions around clear lake and their language evolved into protopomo the lake was rich in resources about 4000 bce to 5000 bce some of the protopomo migrated into the russian river valley and north to presentday ukiah their language diverged into western southern central and northern pomo another people possibly yukian speakers lived first in the russian river valley and the lake sonoma area the pomo slowly displaced them and took over these places 11 recently analysis of archaeological evidence has suggested that the indigenous historical economy observed by the spanish at their arrival in the pomo lands of central california may have first developed during the mostin culture period 85006300 bp in the clear lake basin this was an economy that was based on women processing acorns by mortar and pestle 12tolay lake site  editover 1000 prehistoric charmstones and numerous arrowheads have been unearthed at tolay lake in southern sonoma county these are attributed to both pomo and coast miwok people as a sacred site the lake was a ceremonial gathering and healing place 13lake sonoma sites  editat the broken bridge site researchers used radiocarbon dating of artifacts to determine it was inhabited about 3280 bce the oldest humaninhabited site in the valley they consider it part of skaggs phase 3000 bce—500 bce 14oregon oak place was dated at 1843 bce the surveyors suggested that compared to the lower river valleys this remote area was more sparsely settled before the pomo people arrived a pomo indian in a tule boat circa 1924 both of these skaggs phasesites contained millstones and handstones for grinding seeds the villages may have been used for hunting or temporary camps obsidian was used rarely and it came from mt konocti in presentday lake county there were no petroglyphs the population lived only along major creeks 14the dry creek phase lasted from 500 bce to 1300 ce during this phase the indigenous people settled the lands more extensively and permanently archaeologists believe a pomo group took over the lands from the earlier peoples in this phase they created 14 additional sites in the warm springs and upper dry creek areas bowl mortars and pestles appeared in this phase probably used by women to pound acorns as opposed to the milling stones used for seeds the sites were more permanent and lifeways more complex decorative beads and ornaments were made in this phase and half the artifacts were made of obsidian steatite or soapstone objects were found which must have been imported into the region through trade as the rock does not exist locally relatively soft and easy to carve soapstone was used to make beads pendants and mortars trade was on a large scale beyond the region 15the next phase named the smith phase after the pomo consultants lasted from 1300 ce to the mid19th century researchers mapped 30 sites in this era showing a gradual transition and intensification of trends the bow and arrow appeared as the main technological advancement manufacturing of shell beads with accompanying production of drills to make holes for stringing and sewing was important drills were found in high numbers numerous clamshell beads a major currency among the indians of central california were also found indicating a vast trade network 16post contact  editras kdee dry creek pomo singer and editor of snag magazine 17 performing in point arena california in 1800 there were estimated to be 10000 to 18000 pomo in total among 70 tribes speaking seven pomo languages 18 the way of life of the pomo changed with the arrival of russians at fort ross 1812 to 1841 on the pacific coastline and spanishmissionaries and europeanamerican colonists coming in from the south and east the pomo native to the coastline and fort ross were known as the kashaya they interacted and traded with the russians the spanish missionaries moved many of the southern pomo from the santa rosa plain to mission san rafael at presentday san rafael between 1821 and 1828 only a few pomo speakers moved to mission sonoma the other franciscan mission located on the north side of san francisco bay the pomo who remained in the presentday santa rosa area of sonoma county were often called cainameros in regional history books from the time of spanish and mexican occupation in the russian river valley a missionary baptized the makahmo pomo people of the cloverdale area many pomo left the valley because of this one such group fled to the upper dry creek area the archeology surveyors of the lake sonoma region believe that european encroachment was the reason why pomo villages became more centralized the people retreated to the remote valley to band together for defense and mutual support 16national thorn was the first of grace hudson s 684 popular portraits of pomo individuals the pomo suffered from the infectious diseases brought by the european migrants including measles and smallpox they did not have immunity to such diseases and fatalities were high 18 in 1837 a deadly epidemic of smallpox originating in settlements at fort ross caused numerous deaths of native people in the sonoma and napa regions 19the russian river valley was settled in 1850 by the 49ers and the lake sonoma valley was homesteaded out the us government forced many pomo on to reservations so that the europeanamericans could homestead the former pomo lands some pomo took jobs as ranch laborers others lived in refugee villages on 15 may 1850 after tensions and raids by a band in the area the 1st dragoons us cavalry attacked a different group of indians as mistaken punishment they slaughtered from 60400 people mostly women and children of the clear lake pomo and neighboring tribes on an island in clear lake 20 the event became known as the bloody island massacre one ghost town in the lake sonoma valley excavations was identified as amacha built for 100 people but hardly used elder natives of the region remember their grandfathers hid at amacha in the mid1850s trying to evade the oncoming immigrants they tell that one day soldiers took all the people in the village to government lands and burned the village houses 21from 1891 to 1935 starting with national thorn the artist grace hudson painted over 600 portraits mainly of pomo individuals living near her in the ukiah area her style was sympathetic and poignant as she portrayed domestic native scenes that would have been fast disappearing in that time 22basket weaving tradition  editgirls coiled dowry or puberty basket kolchu or tiribuku late 19th century brooklyn museum pomo basket bowl c 1880 made from sedge root willow beads and shell pomo basket on display ca1900pomo basket collected in 1905 in the ethnological museum of berlin in the past  editwomen traditionally wove pomo baskets with great care and technique the three different techniques of pomo basket weaving are plaiting coiling and twining 23 one drying method was wrapping maiden fern in blue clay and placing underground for several days this prevented fading in the sun or when cooking mush pomo baskets made by pomo indian women of northern california are recognized worldwide for their exquisite appearance range of technique fineness of weave and diversity of form and use while women mostly made baskets for cooking storing food and religious ceremonies pomo men also made baskets for fishing weirs bird traps and baby baskets there are many different designs that are woven into the baskets that signify different cultural meanings for example the dau is a pattern woven into a basket by creating a small change in the stitching to create a small opening between two stitches the dau is the design that is also called the spirit door this spirit door allows good spirits to come and circulate inside of the basket while the good or bad spirits are released 24making the baskets required great skill and knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials materials for weaving baskets changed with the seasons and years so did the materials used for the baskets the pomo usually covered a basket completely with the vivid red feathers of the pileated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself with the feathers 3050 to every inch beads were fastened to the basket’s border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets the materials used to make the baskets—including but not limited to swamp canes saguaro cactuses rye grass black ash willow shoots sedge roots the bark of redbud the root of bulrush and the root of the gray pine—were harvested annually 25 after being picked the materials are dried cleaned split soaked and dyed sometimes the materials are also boiled over a fire and set in the sun to dry although baskets were made for decorating homes and as gifts they were centrally used in pomo daily life as well basket weaving is considered sacred to the pomo tribe and baskets were produced for a variety of purposes pomo children were cradled in baskets acorns a major food staple to the pomo were harvested in great conical burden baskets and food was stored cooked and served in baskets—some even being watertight 23 there were even baskets that were made as boats to be pushed by men to carry women across rivers the first pomo basket craze lasted from about 1876 to the 1920s within this time period in addition to basket weaving the pomo also manufactured elaborate jewelry made from abalone and clamshells 25 assembled during the winter during the summer the pomo would travel from various sites along the coast where they would fish and gather all of their materials needed to create their jewelry the pomo indians would create stunning beautiful and intricate forms of jewelry that were worn during celebrations and rituals and even given as gifts 23 both of these traditions of creation and culture have slowly dispersed and have become less common over the history of the tribe but more evident in today’s culture crosscultural impacts  editeuropean impact  editin the 1800s the pomo indian entered a busy market with european people one of their most wanted items was pomo indian fur the pomo indian mostly traded fur with russian people the russian missionaries began preaching and converting people 26 then the spanish missionaries came and did the same thing pritzker par 15 as a result many pomo indian members died due to the spread of smallpox and measles king 626 in the 1830s and 1840s the californian mexicans who tried to turn them into slaves attacked the pomo indians if they decided not to cooperate with their demands 26the united states marches to round valley  editlike many other native groups the pomo indians were also attacked and pressured by the u s government the pomo were a part of the relocation known as marches to round valley in 1856 which was conducted by the u s federal government by using bullwhips and guns whitesettlers demanded relocation to reservations of the pomo indian to protect their culture the pomo indians had to be removed from their ancestral land 26during this time period two settlers named andrew kelsey and charles stone enslaved many pomo people in order to work as cowboys on their ranch 27 they forced the pomo indians to work in very intense and unorthodox conditions and sexually used the pomo women the pomo men were also brutally used they were forced to work in harsh conditions and were not given any respect by the settlers eventually the pomo indians got sick of the disrespect and horrid practices of stone and kelsey so they rebelled the pomo men set up a sneak attack and killed both stone and kelsey 26 because of the deaths of kelsey and stone united states lieutenant j w davidson and captain nathaniel lyon sent an army to retaliate against the pomo people this resulted in an event called the bloody island massacre of 1850 in clear lake 28 this resulted in dozens of pomo indians being killed richerson  richerson stated that before the european conquests there was an estimated 3000 pomo indians that lived at clear lake after all of the death disease and killings there were only about 400 pomo indians left 28united states indian reservations – a false sense of hope  editshortly after the massacre in 1851–1852 four indian reservations were opened up by the united states government in california the pomo indians saw it as a way to retain certain aspects of their cultural heritage a time for rebuilding  editeven though most of their original land was taken over this was the first turning point for the pomo people they had finally escaped the harsh road they were once a part of and even though they had to settle on poor isolated land they finally got to make a stride towards tradition and basket weaving 26 from 18521878 many pomo indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what had happened to them many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time where they could have visions and see what the future would have in store it was a time to build a time to connect a time of hope and a time of change 29the pomo indians did not have enough money to buy land the pomo men decided to work for ranchers and the woman went back to making baskets the white people loved the baskets especially the designer feathered ones which led to a basketry movement 26 finally in 1878 the pomo indians bought their first piece of land in california paula giese noted in 1878 a group of northern pomo people bought 7 acres in coyote valley in 1880 another northern pomo group bought 100 acres along ackerman creek now known as pinoleville 1996 par 30 in 1881 yokaya rancheria was financed by central pomo people once the pomo indians had bought the land it was time to make money baskets were in so much demand at this point even though they were once used for trade and bartering with other tribes and people they now became the pomo people’s way to make money and build their newly found empires 26 it was the women who had held the basket weaving tradition which made a huge change for the pomo people the baskets were wanted all over california it was a piece of art that traders wanted grandmothers and daughters taught other pomo women who had lost the tradition of basket weaving how to make the allpowerful baskets basket weaving turned into an art and lifestyle that helped the pomo people prosper basket weaving is not something that many people know how to craft and even in today’s society the handmade pomo baskets are something that is truly valuable and collectable 30 overall it wasn’t the pomo people who wanted to give up their traditions and arts it was the forcefulness of other cultures if the pomo people were not so objectified and attack in their past there would have been more baskets traditions and pomo people alive in this day and age basket weaving today  editpomo basket weaving is still valued and honored today not only by the pomo indians themselves but also by amateur enthusiasts buyers for curio dealers and scientific collectors the federated indians of graton rancheria are a federally recognized american indian tribe of coast miwok and southern pomo indians during the past 30 years the appreciation for american indian art has been on the rise and the art has become in demand – specifically pomo indian basketry dr joallyn archambault director of the american indian program at the smithsonian institution’s national museum of natural history says since the 1880s when pomo baskets first became sought after the pomo have changed their lifestyles enormously pomo today live normal modern lifestyles but the basket weavers are still heralded and praised within the community for their artistic ability and skill 31one of those basket weavers is julia f parker she is a master weaver having woven under lucy telles her childhood was rough constantly moving around until boarding school after her parents’ death at 6 lucy had taught julia because of her perceived interest in preserving indian culture and specifically basketry julia parker became cultural demonstrator after lucy telles death in 1956 she continued in her studies and later studied pomo basketry with pomo master weaver elsie allen 1899–1990 at ukiah and several others julia belongs to the miwok pomo and federated indians of graton rancheria many of her baskets are in museums in yosemite mono lake and other museums she even presented her baskets to the queen of england 26the materials for baskets were sedge root willow shoots and roots bulrush or blackroot redbud shoots sometimes bracken fern and a variety of colorful bird feathers abalone and other types of shells magnesite beads and sometimes glass beads redbud shoots used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in october good redbud is hard to obtain around ukiah so it is usually found at clear lake all these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants they were after all living things that were giving themselves for something useful and beautiful in order to preserve the soil and creek banks sedge gathering was done with care the commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found dyeing of the bulrush root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts rusty metal and ashes in water 32although the number of pomo basket weavers has decreased their skill and artistic vision is still intact and people pay a pretty penny to get their hands on the art today new pomo baskets might sell for as much as 1000 and the more historical ones might sell for more than 10000 dealing of these baskets has not always been so lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market but it still paid well enough to provide income to pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival 31today you will see rare baskets being sold for the prices mentioned above due to the time and preparation necessary to weave these pieces of art basket weavers today have more requests than they can fulfill and many customers wait months before receiving orders the rarity of the baskets and the skill are required in making them in what makes them valuable the demand is greater than the supply and collectors facilitate a high demand for these artistically made baskets wikimedia commons has media related to pomo baskets population  editin 1770 there were about 8000 pomo people in 1851 population was estimated between 3500 and 5000 and in 1880 estimated at 1450 33 the 1910 census reported 777 pomo but that is
