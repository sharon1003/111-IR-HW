the first 6 months of treatment and may be preceded by malaise weakness lethargy facial edema anorexia and vomiting teratogenicity do not use in women of childbearing age unless the drug is essential

for seizures or manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder that are unresponsive to other treatments pregnancy category x for migraine headache prevention results from epidemiologic studies concluded that children born to women who take valproate sodium or related products valproic acid divalproex sodium during pregnancy have an increased risk for lower cognitive test scores compared with children exposed to other antiseizure medications during pregnancy known to cause neural tube defects evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester decreases risk for congenital neural tube defects lactation excreted in breast milk use caution aap and acog say compatiblepregnancy categories a generally acceptable controlled studies in
