ethnical racial or religious groups a national group means a set of individuals whose identity is defined by a common country of nationality or national origin an ethnical group is a set of individuals whose identity is defined by common cultural traditions language or heritage a racial group means a set of individuals whose identity is defined by physical characteristics a religious group is a set of individuals whose identity is defined by common religious creeds beliefs doctrines practices or rituals usually people are born into these four groups these four groups share the common characteristic that individuals are most often born into the group while some individuals may change nationality or religion  or even adopt a new cultural ethnic or racial identity  usually people do not choose their group identity in genocide people are targeted for destruction not because anything they have done but because of who they are group idenity is often imposed by the perpetrators perpetrators of genocide frequently make group categories more rigid or create new definintions which impose group identity on individuals eithout regard to peoples individual choices key terms the crime of genocide has two elements intent and action “intentional” means purposeful intent can be proven directly from statements or orders but more often it must be inferred from a systematic pattern of coordinated acts intent is different from motive whatever may be the motive for the crime land expropriation national security territorrial integrity etc  if the perpetrators commit acts intended to destroy a group even part of a group it is genocide the phrase in whole or in part is important perpetrators need not intend to destroy the entire group destruction of only part of a group such as its educated members or members living in one region is also genocide most authorities require intent to destroy a substantial number of group members – mass murder but an individual criminal may be guilty of genocide even if he kills only one person so long as he knew he was participating in a larger plan to destroy the group other information kofi annans stockholm
