the inviolable place of worship until they first attack you there but if they attack you there then slay them such is the reward of disbelievers 2193 and fight them until persecution is no more and religion is for allah 2216 warfare is ordained for you though it is hateful unto you but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you allah knoweth ye know not 2244 fight in the way of allah and know that allah is hearer knower 533 the only reward of those who make war upon allah and his messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off or will be expelled out of the land such will be their degradation in the world and in the hereafter theirs will be an awful doom source s quran aj · 1 decade ago69 25 8 comments askers rating the true definition of an infidel from what i researched and read about within those particular verses is anyone who is an oppressor terrorist or a violent instigator upon a society infidel does not refer to anyone whos a nonmuslim which seems to be an interpretation of what an infidel is today by many in the west if that were so then the quran would be contradicting itself because it preaches to respect anyone no matter the race creed or political system unfortunately many islamic governments dont live by this ruling and treat any nonarab or nonmuslims as 2nd class citizens and dont respect their individuality and freedoms the corruption is within the leadership from most middle eastern countries for whatever reason and thats why theres a civil unrest between the citizens and their respective rulers s · 2 years ago2 4 3 comments the best answer is misleading the verses cited eg 2191193 do not advocate killing infidels simply because they are infidels nowhere in the quran does it say to kill all infidels in fact the quran explicitly forbids killing except in defence against an enemy which seeks to destroy islam or make war on allah or someone who has attacked ones home or family these are the them to which 2191193 refers i dont know why the asker gave the best answer a fivestar rating marissas answer from 9 years ago ie 2006 is far better btw i wish nonmuslim politicians would stop calling groups like isil aka isis al qaeda  al shabab islamic extremists these groups purport to be islamic or muslim but in fact they are not they are just gangs of murderous thugs who obviously have no respect for the quran or islam moreover the notion that a suicide bomber is a martyr and will have his way with dozens of virgins in the afterlife is utter bs and completely contrary to the quran calling these groups islamic gives them unwarranted credibility and and foments resentment toward muslims radical jihadists might be a better term but really they are just savages gtanonymous · 2 years ago4 7 2 comments some people say that the verses say it s not the infidels who need to be killed but the idolaters really  kill the idolaters and that s ok what another human believes is no business if yours if he worships idols or does not worship anything so what what gives anyone the right to go out and kill them an idol is a symbol the symbolized is different from the symbol a word is a symbol that is heard the word allah god is also a symbol as much as any idol there are only two religions in the world one that ordains freedom in how to exist and another that says there is only one right way right name for god chosen people a god

of aggression and questionable actions but that is history and we must acknowledge that history as we confront the difficulties of the present presently it is clear that christianity has evolved to embrace and promote the tenets of peace there may be sects that occasionally pop up and commit atrocities but those acts are quickly condemned by the larger christian community unfortunately we do not see a similar evolution with islam the 911 attacks were publicly celebrated and revered throughout the islamic world and has martialed in the new era of islamicbased aggression the islamic world has been overwhelmingly silent on the recent decades atrocities committed in the name of god which indicates it s tacit agreement with such actions and policies and because of this we nonmuslims are very curious about muhammad s message to kill nonbelievers we nonmuslims want to understand the problem to learn what might be done to mitigate or eliminate it a complementary question might be are true muslims willing to accept and live with others don estif · 3 years ago12 2 1 comment it seems that religious defenders always say they did it so it must be ok for me to do it people reference the crusades forgetting occupation of europe by muslims under the jihad slogan to force their religious belief on others yes there were atrocities in judaism christianity and islam the salient point that most people miss is that the vast majority of jews and christians admit that atrocities existed in the past when people were ignorant superstitious and could not understand the physical world around them remember epilepsy was viewed as demonic possession nowadays over 99 of the earth population know that it is a disease and not demonic possession muslims need to learn from the experience of the all the other religions admit that atrocities in the name of god were committed and that any reference to killing or execution does no longer apply and are not part of the religion they should teach their children to ignore any reference to violence in the quran as a thing of the past that is no longer acceptable or correct this way the children cannot allegedly misinterpret the verses and start beheading i am against any religion that still include killing maiming and rape as part of its holy scripture past is past if people really are against the violence remove it from the teaching any in response to some of the comments that might be added in reference to modern wars any educated person knows that modern day conflicts are all economical about money money influence greed and has nothing to do with forcing others to convert the wars in afghanistan and iraq were not to force muslims to convert but has to do with oil and other resources i lived in the middle east for few years and i was it is illegal not to have a religion and even it was explained to me that if i say i am atheist or agnostic i will get in serious even fatal trouble anonymous · 4 years ago6 0 commentwikipedia charles matthews writes that there is a large debate about what the quran commands as regards the sword verses and the peace verses according to matthews the question of the proper prioritization of these verses and how they should be understood in relation to one another has been a central issue for islamic thinking about war 4 prior to the hijra travel muhammad struggled nonviolently against his oppressors in mecca 5 it wasnt until after the exile that the quranic revelations began to adopt a more defensive perspective 6 according to oliver leaman a number of islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the sword verses over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances 7 for example according to diane morgan ibn kathir 1301–1372 asserted that the sword verse abrogated all peace treaties that had been promulgated between muhammad and idolaters 8 modernists reject the abrogating status of the sword verses which would result in the abrogation naskh of numerous quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation meisam · 2 years ago0 0 comment for the best answers search on this site httpsshorturlimsx by b my dear newcomer sister to the islamic way of life assalam o alaikum wa rahmatullahi wabarakatuh no one in thier right minds  or with their best of intentions  can prove any verse of the quran to be something to be ashamedrebuked of why because quran was from god saying it wont matter to the disbelievers the best way to rebuttle any argument is to go into the context of the ayah mentioned this was the verse u qouted right attaubah  129 verses  repentance سورة التوبة sura 9  madina 5 then when the sacred months have passed slay the idolaters wherever ye find them and take them captive and besiege them and prepare for them each ambush but if they repent and establish worship and pay the poordue then leave their way free lo allah is forgiving merciful but have u read the verses above and esp the one below it and if anyone of the idolaters seeketh thy protection o muhammad then protect him so that he may hear the word of allah and afterward convey him to his place of safety that is because they are a folk who know not how can there be a treaty with allah and with his messenger for the idolaters save those with whom ye made a treaty at the inviolable place of worship so long as they are true to you be true to them lo allah loveth those who keep their duty how can there be any treaty for the others when if they have the upper hand of you they regard not pact nor honour in respect of you they satisfy you with their mouths the while their hearts refuse is there a religion which says  protect ur enemy if he is innocent and if he repents then what about joan of arc so this clearly states that only when the peace
