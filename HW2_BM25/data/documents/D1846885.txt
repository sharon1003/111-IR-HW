thomas h clarke  january 31 2014jefferson city mo — on wednesday rep chris kelly dcolumbia introduced house bill 1659 which would allow adults to possess and grow small amounts of marijuana and set up a taxed and regulated marijuana commerce if passed adults 21 or older would be allowed to grow up to eight plants and possess up to sixteen ounces of marijuana per household the bill would also establish a process for allowing medical marijuana with a doctor’s recommendation for those under 21 and allow the cultivation of industrial hemp in addition two additional bills have been filed this year house bill 1324 which would allow medical marijuana in the state and house bill 1325 which would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of cannabis the primary sponsor of both bills is representative rory ellinger of university city article continues after ad advertisement currently missouri has some of the harshest marijuana laws in the country possession of any amount of marijuana — even as little as a gram — can be punished by up to a year in prison and a 1000 fine under state law possession of over 35 grams — about 125 ounces — is a felony subject to a prison sentence of up to seven years and a 5000 fine last year two bills that would have relaxed missouri’s marijuana laws died in committee without getting a vote  house bill 668 would have removed criminal penalties for the medical use of marijuana for seriously ill patients with their doctors’ recommendations and house bill 512 would have reduced penalties for possession of marijuana for adults neither of these bills advanced during the 2013 session largely due to the efforts of missouri speaker of the house rep timothy jones who prevented the bills from moving forward article continues after ad

mc neill • 4 years ago im not an mj user however i am completely in favor of legalization the social harm of keeping the drug illegal far outweighs the any benefits of keeping the drug illegal in fact mj is clearly less harmful than alcohol ironically lives would be saved if we could reroute users of alcohol to mj i am assuming for argument that the drug user will use one or the other since alcohol is the only common denominator in traffic deaths switching users of alcohol to mj would save lives directly alcohol is a sedative and causes reflexes to slow the effects of mj are not as adverse as alcohol on the road jake stevens • 4 years ago im interested since you are aware of all this why are you not an mj user and would legalization effect whether youd use it or not mike • 4 years ago nothing wrong with that most of the people in this country who oppose prohibition do not use marijuana we should keep this in mind as we have far more allies now than we have enemies its just that the prohibitionists are much better funded and have access to government resources all the trends in polling and public opinion demonstrate that the marijuana majority exists  and most of them dont even bother to get high maybe they just prefer being around us rather than a bunch of drunks the democrat • 4 years ago maybe he doesnt want to blow money on it jeremy n jacqulin mc murray • 4 years ago dear god they better pass this frank rozkiewicz • 4 years ago every state is in need of funding for things like infrastructure and medicare for the elderly and disabled it only makes since to collect tax money from a new source like marijuana and use it to help in these areas lets face it a lot of our roads and bridges are falling apart we need the money it would generate and we could reallocate the wasted money were spending on preventing it to fighting real problems like crackheads and alcoholics beating there spouses and kids the state legislature needs to wake up it is safer then alcohol you want proof go to any bar and watch the alcohol turn normal men into abusive womanizers and women into aggressive lust driven tramps where cannabis creates easy going mellow patrons guest • 4 years ago why cant they just make it legal for everyone in every state  those who want it will get it  and those that dont want it wont guest3 • 4 years ago smoking is generally considered bad for youngsters and has typically a 16 years age limit cannabis products intended purely for digestion such as cannamilk or cannabutter used for ice cream and smoothies and chocolate bars and brownies could be given a break cannabis has an impact on appetite for reasons we do not fully understand yet but it has never been a crime to enjoy a good steak so why not give cannamilk and cannabutter a break we politely ask and enquire cj macintosh • 4 years ago why cant you grow up we all out of high school now  hey your moms yelling your pop tart is ready eli • 4 years ago you need to stop trolling the debate here and posting false facts simply because you do not approve cj macintosh • 3 years ago its only called trolling to you when someone is posting something negative about your point i guess  i will post my opinion you will not stop me melinda hawkeye snyder • 4 years ago legalize it tax it like you do cigarettes and fix the state budget once and for all cj macintosh • 3

cigarettes if i want to destroy my lungs thats my bizz and not yours i get not smoking indoors but u grow up palwh08501 • 4 years ago for a good and thorough background behind why mary jane and hemp were put on the controlled substances list i would recommend the book titled smoke signals by martin a lee the whole thing was an illegitimate attempt to control a market so that william randolph hearst and pierre s du pont could capitalize on their lumber and new petrochemical fiber synthesis respectively while making hemp and mary jane look like the natural monsters that they most certainly are not henry anslinger was the governments first drug czar and he was a total jerk  even the us governments own internal research reports could not muster evidence to show that mary jane is a gateway drug or that its effects were anything but transiently potent to the user no one has ever died from an overdose of mary jane  regardless if eaten smoked or whatever potency level the thc reached in the street  my point of view get hemp and mary jane off the controlled substances list and repeal all laws regarding their possession let the states decide if they want to tax it or otherwise regulate it and the federal government should take its nose out of the whole affair and get back to doing things for which it is fit and constitutionally allowed to be involved with witchy currier • 4 years ago be informed 2014  research the facts and then decided  legalize  cj macintosh • 4 years ago marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 more cancercausing substances than tobacco smoke one major research study reported that a single cannabis joint could cause as much damage to the lungs as up to five regular cigarettes smoked one after another longtime joint smokers often suffer from bronchitis an inflammation of the respiratory tract guest • 3 years ago where on earth are you getting your ridiculously twisted information i am not a pot smoker but i do have friends who have smoked it since we were in our early 20s all around my age which is 65 none of them suffer any of the ill effects you speak of because of this about 10 years ago i started to do research on cannabis and found many many benefits about the plant and no negetives maybe you should do some honest research yourself if so youll find this plant is a truly a gift from god for all the wonderful things that can be made from it let alone being far more safe and healthy than alcoholby along shot cj macintosh • 3 years ago it is always funny to me when an article that posts something negative about marijuanaeven ones from research from top universitiesthat you still will have people dismiss it they will think of everythingand make up something that they think in their mind dismisses facts it is truly unbelievable we on the left think that only the right dismisses facts and scientific evidence and the right does the same to the left i have always been someone who respects science i can identify solid accurate studies and research a study is solid through and through and has been backed by multiple centers with a large number of patients and reviewed by peers before publication you cannot dismiss that as bogus if you are not worried then why the take down just move on carry on with what you are doing and dont dismiss scientific factthat is just a sign of ignorance and denial neither of which is a sign of an open minded individual the internets being manipulated by ones who are going to profit billions of dollars from legalization marijuana if it has medical properties like everybody says  why do we have marijuana dispensaries it needs to in the hands of doctors  pharmacies  hospitals only  because i do believe it does help small children with seizures from the videos and from what i read from parents with children that are having seizures  when penicillin was put on the market a thousand dispensary did not open up to market it  so we do not some corn rolled hair hippie selling it in some hole in the wall shop  called dispensaries  they really care about kids as they say all you want is to make a profit for the ones you are working for  your not doing this for nobody but your self stop lying its a joke people would actually move to a state just so they can smoke pot legally pot smokers are really no different that alcoholics believe me we drug test at my company and if any of these people would ever apply for a job i would fire hisher a55 before they ever got started pot is a gateway drug and dont let anyone tell you differently if it has medical properties like everybody says  why do we have smoke shops it needs to in the hands of doctors  pharmacies  hospitals only  not some corn rolled hair hippie selling it in some hole in the wall shop you dont care about kids all you want is to make a profit for the ones you are working for your not doing this for nobody but your self stop lying shayne • 3 years ago people that seek an arise on the internet about a subject that they arent in favor of priceless but weak man cj macintosh is dumb • 4 years ago where are you getting your facts from i highly doubt that it contains any cancer causing substances considering that it is used in therapy for cancer patients for painomahakid24 • 3 years agoyha and who cares if thats true or not  ofcorse if u inhale a paper there are carcinagens  but no one is putting it in ur face to smoke or putting booz in ur hand to drink why do u care its what makes people happy sometimes healthy but at the end of it there high paying taxes and going to work like anyone els thwere just as emportant to the econemy as anyone els jake stevens • 4 years ago so it looks like we have a pretty solid majority in favor of legalization but i worry that this is the kind of situation where the polls and the results might not match up does anybody know how the referendums in colorado washington and oregon did compared to their polls jake stevens • 4 years ago actually maybe im wrong polls in colorado showed 53 in favor to 38 opposed and the ultimate vote was 55 in favor to 44 opposed so the undecideds did break mostly towards opposition but those whod said they were in favor did make it out to vote and didnt change their minds suddenly im optimistic about thisguest3 • 4 years ago in recent years scientists have become increasingly aware of the endocannabinoid system’s role in regulating sleep in addition to maintaining a regular sleep pattern the endocannabinoid system has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of insomnia studies show that endocannabinoids act to induce sleep and that insomnia may even be caused by a dysfunctional endocannabinoid system  good sleep adds value to health and life and well being  dont let anyone with a badge take it away why is sleep so important we still do not know exactly why what we do know sleep deprivation is frequently and successfully used as part of torture by secret military police in countries no one wants to live in in usa millions of people consume pharmacological products and substances for insomnia some are very harmful in the long runoctodad • 4 years agohad an unbelievable convo w msw that is certified

experts truth leads to freedom mark entry • 4 years ago i retired from making comments sometime ago may the peace of god be with you all farewell tanqueray blvd • 4 years ago that dude has some nasty ass handsmichael dieker • 4 years ago i would like to give a pharmacists opinion 1 we have learned from cigarettes that things that you light on fire and sucks into your lungs kills people mj contains even more carcinogens than tobacco 2 nicotine and alcohol are very simple compounds that are well understood and most importantly are cleared from the body quickly and completely 3 because the dramatic negative impact to society is well known with alcohol and cigarettes why would we consider legalizing another detrimental drug 4 most importantly thc and cannabinoids of which they are many are very potent psychotropic drugs that we do not fully understand especially in the adolescent brain while it is true that violence and trauma associated with alcohol is much less with mj we simply dont fully understand it at least with alcohol the content is labeled and regulated furthermore it takes many weeks to completely eliminate thc and cannabinoids from the body 5 please ask yourselves if you believe that alcohol abuse and related morbidity and death increased or decreased with the end of prohibition 6 consideration for legalizing his in a smokable form instead of an extracted content and potency labeled e  cigarette or other less harmful delivery system us unconscionable mike • 4 years ago1 studies have repeatedly shown cannabis is not associated with cancer it contains substances that are anticarcinogenic which may explain why further research is needed to understand that your claim of it containing more carcinogens than tobacco is debatable but its clearly not causing cancer for whatever reason and there are always brownies2 the harms caused by tobacco and alcohol are obviously not cleared from the body quickly and completely glad youre just dispensing meds and not prescribing as you have a very oddly selective way of evaluating facts3 the harms caused to individuals society and our system of government by prohibition are far far greater than any demonstrable harm caused by cannabis its illegal status serves as cover for police abusing their authority by focusing on enforcement among minority populations  even though whites actually use it at higher rates4 you may not understand it but in a nation with millions of cannabis users peacefully going about their work and recreation its obvious that were not having axmurders on every block due to cannabis and if you want it regulated and labeled correctly you do exactly what co and wa did make it legal and do exactly that as for lingering thc actually no it doesnt linger its quickly converted into other compounds that do linger but these have been shown to have no significant effect within hours of use if they were harmful then where are all the threeheaded cannabis babies and why is it that hundreds of thousands die every year from alcohol and tobacco but there are zero deaths associated with cannabis5 i doubt there was much difference in alcohol use and harms after prohibition ended but after it ended it took place under regulated conditions and caused less problems with crime since its a far more toxic drug than cannabis whatever happened with alcohol has little relevance to a debate about the legality of cannabis and if the point of your comment was that a lot more people will use cannabis youre simply wrong people who want to for the most part already do so without issues in most cases because the war on marijuana is such a joke the effect of 40 years of dea efforts is that it operates as a price support mechanism for the drug cartels pure and simple im curious to know what their end game looks like other than generating fat retirement checks for their agents its time to halt a wasteful and failed policy and try something new6 youve obviously got a strange conscience its also a plant anyone can grow easily people will do with it what they will just as they do now its just that society will have better things to do than hassle them after cannabis is legal hes kind of milquetoast and middle of the road definitely not a cannabis activist but i think dr gupta gave careful consideration to wildeyed claims similar to yours and found them as unpersuasive as i do yours httpwwwcnncom201308 maureen long wiehage • 4 years ago and obviously big pharma will lose money as it becomes legal  its safer than most prescription drugs  big pharma just wants it to be used in a eay where they control it and make money off it  running scared as they should be  americans are realizing they have been brainwashed the past 70 years to believe a harmless plant could only do harm  cj macintosh • 4 years ago marijuana is dangerous and it kills it is a leading cause of injury crashes sure marijuana may have never killed anyone as

other cases such as admitted pot lover 16yearold jeff weise who murdered nine people and injured five others in red lake minnesota and charles “andy” williams a regular marijuana user who smoked the

with which a seemingly trivial argument or confrontation can assume murderous proportions the stories have a common theme the perpetrators of the violence often in their very young teens were high on ’skunk’ at the time mike • 4 years ago leading cause of injury accidents i dont think so cite your source as for your list you forgot to include any ax murders harry anslinger is disappointed in you make a list of alcoholrelated crimes and youll find it is far far longer sure some whack people smoke dope and hurt people they wouldve probably done that even if they didnt have any weed dont hand them excuses for their behavior cannabis did not make them hurt anybody they made that choice at least the ones where it really might have been a factor in some way the ones where prosecutors claim someone was high on cannabis because of the presence of metabolites a week after smoking a joint are just laughable it may have been detectable but it had no influence on their driving we allow adults to do lots of things that can be very dangerous from using alcohol to owning firearms to driving cars because a few people abuse that responsibility is no reason to destroy the freedoms and lives of millions of other americans why do you hate our freedoms eli • 4 years ago you have wasted your time posting all of that i can say simply that the lists of deaths for alcohol is longer and much more graphic if weed does become legal it should be treated as alcohol dont smoke and driveguest • 4 years ago people should be able to do whatever they want that doesnt do harm to others or rips them off financially bottom line why do you care so much why not revolt against alcohol or cigarettes because clearly they do a a lot more damage to the human body and alcohol is a big killer on the roads makes more sense to me to take this route if you truly care about the greater good of people you dont even know does the thought of someone inhaling marijuana smoke keep you up at night get the fuck out of my business im a tax paying citizen who has to feel like a criminal just because i unwind in a way that has been looked down on based on propaganda none of us are permanent so treat others with dignity and let them live how they want to live i am but a visitor as are you i dont give a flying fuck what you do with your free time so if i could kindly ask you to shut up because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about and just how short life is the real one • 4 years ago lmfao hmm bro u gotta do some more researchpascoupe • 4 years agohttpdruglibraryorgscha this speaks for itself in shock • 3 years ago wow straight out the mouth of the biggest death dealer on the planet not this time buddy we are tired of this sht kyle hershberger • 4 years ago in israel where marijuana is legal the government actually helps support research on weed in mice when given weed actually help cued the mice with cancer i got this on the cnn report weed really good informative work on marijuana its on you tube heather • 4 years ago ok but you are a pharmacist are you afraid that those that use mj wont need your drugs that are harmful to the body anymore would this put you out of work hmmmm i wonder why you would be against legalizing it i dont smoke but i know several that would benefit from the pain relieving side of mj my husband would probably benefit narcotic pain relievers have caused him to lose weight and dont work very well once again that would be money out of your pocket i hope it passes here as well as for the numerous children that could really benefit from it as well its not a bad thing kyle hershberger • 4 years ago very good cooments i just feel like when people start to get educated on marijuana its really an easy decision boston university did a study on effects on brain they found no harm done to the brain compared to smokers and non smokers when you see very sick people throw away these harsh pills for weed to help them its a violation of our rights to have this prohibition but bottom line its already a multi billion dollar industry do you want criminals running it or do you want regulate it tax it and make it safer marijuana is never going away just how its gunna be regulated is what the vote is truly on ashley nicole eilers • 4 years ago i hope this passes i mean come on government cigarettes which kill us are legal and taxed yet something that has never killed or hurt a single personkid or adult is illegal wasting all those cells in prison and jail over this when perfectly bad murderersrapistsmeth sellersmakers now thats a bad drug and others run free by the way take all the fathers and mothers outa jail and prison for not paying child support that is one of the stupidest reasons to imprison a person ive ever heard you wont pay us money even though you actually take care of your kid your kid is healthy and happy we send you to prison anyway cause you cant pay your child support dumb what is the government comming tomlt500 • 4 years ago i firmly believe that legalization while popular in other areas of the country will not take hold anytime in the next decade in missouri the logic behind taxing it seems fantastic until you do cost analysis of how much money is collected on the arrest prosecution conviction and sentencing that ultimately results in free labor for the state but more specifically privatized prisons no one in their right mind is going to pass legislation that affects their profits if they have anything to do to stop it in places like california it is not cost effective to arrest for pot possession too much stuff going on and bigger fish to fry so to speak washington and others contain legislators who acknowledge their constituents wishes and allow progressive thinking can make laws that reflects those they represent wishes missouri has little towards that end in fact they are going backwards remember strip clubs see how they disappearred that makes my point even clearer the prison complex is entrenched here in the middle of the country its just too much money to be made keeping it illegal here my prediction kansas symbolic of country small town living will legalize years before missouri does mike • 4 years agomlt500 well youre entitled to your opinion it all depends what the voters say once its on the ballot even a loss at close to 50 will be a victory because that will just measure the short distance needed to win when all the demographics and trends are going in the direction of legalization one thing to keep in mindyour problem formulation here sounds a lot like that which might go through the minds of various secret supporters who are elected officials doesnt apply to you as a private citizen but they owe it to their constituents to start standing up for change instead of coming up with reasons not to do anything point is once you as a politician reach the very closeby tipping point with the voters they will just as surely vote you out of office as they will those who openly oppose legalization the time for excuses is past its time to take a stand michael votaw • 4 years ago the 320000 number isnt really quite right even if we collected signatures from the six largest districts in the state it would only be around 160000 valid signatures needed but to be fair about half of signatures are invalid so in that sense we do need 320000 mark jones • 4 years agothis was confusing this initiative is completely different than what show me cannabis is doing mike • 4 years ago this is interesting from a tactical point of view in the movement and people in other states should keep an eye on it because its liable to be a scenario playyed out again and again theyve stonewalled change on marijuana for years now the support numbers for outright legalization are such that in states where the people have initiative or constitutional amendment powers its now easier to bypass the stuckinthemud legislators last year legislation went nowhere now that there is a constitutional amendment likely to go on the ballot and poll numbers that make a win look possible legislators are putting up more proposals some are from friendly supporters many will likely be from those who want to undercut the more liberating popular initiatives for instance legislators could sub in a decrim bill pass it and say good enough hoping that would persuade enough people to not support a better amendment later on the ballot its also possible that a reasonably good bill could get offered and then altered into a bad bill then passed states all vary in their processes dont know what may apply specifically to mo the point is that we the people need to be involved dont count on someone else offering your rights on a silver platter it doesnt happen that way this is a time of great promise and great peril for our movement unless we keep these folks honest theyll pass just enough to cause the issue to die down then manipulate us all into second class citizenship remember that the relatively good laws  not perfect but good  in co and wa were passed by citizen initiative not state lawmakers if you want good laws not halfassed ones passed in your state keep active and keep an eye on those who are many of the same folks whove voted before to oppress us they may be honestly trying to help now in many cases having realized the error of their previous ways but many are not trustworthy and would best be replaced unless they clearly support good positions on legal marijuana
