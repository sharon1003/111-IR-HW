from wikipedia the free encyclopedia redirected from analgesianavigation searchpainkiller redirects here for other uses see painkiller disambiguation opium poppies such as this one provide ingredients for the class of analgesics called opiates an analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia relief from pain analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems they are distinct from anesthetics which temporarily affect and in some instances completely eliminate sensation analgesics include paracetamol known in north america as acetaminophen or simply apap the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids such as the salicylates and opioid drugs such as morphine and oxycodone when choosing analgesics the severity and response to other medication determines the choice of agent the world health organization who pain ladder 1 specifies mild analgesics as its first step analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain for neuropathic pain traditional analgesics are less effective and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants 2contents1 uses2 contraindications3 classification31 paracetamol acetaminophen32 nsaids33 cox2 inhibitors34 opioids35 alcohol36 medical cannabis37 combinations38 alternative

provided pain relief in common conditions such as muscle sprains and overuse injuries since the side effects are also lesser topical preparations could be preferred over oral medications in these conditions 3contraindications  editeach different type of analgesic has its own associated side effects classification  editanalgesics are typically classified based on their mechanism of action 4paracetamol acetaminophen  editmain article paracetamol paracetamol also known as acetaminophen or apap is a medication used to treat pain and fever 5 it is typically used for mild to moderate pain 5 in combination with opioid pain medication paracetamol is now used for more severe pain such as cancer pain and after surgery 6 it is typically used either by mouth or rectally but is also available intravenously 5 7 effects last between two and four hours 7 paracetamol is classified as a mild analgesic 7 paracetamol is generally safe at recommended doses 8nsaids  editmain article nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs usually abbreviated to nsaids are a drug class that groups together drugs that decrease pain and lower fever and in higher doses decrease inflammation the most prominent members of this group of drugs aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen are all available over the counter in most countries 9cox2 inhibitors  editmain article cox2 inhibitor these drugs have been derived from nsaids the cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibited by nsaids was discovered to have at least 2 different versions cox1 and cox2 research suggested most of the adverse effects of nsaids to be mediated by blocking the cox1  constitutive enzyme with the analgesic effects being mediated by the cox2  inducible enzyme thus the cox2 inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the cox2 enzyme traditional nsaids block both versions in general these drugs such as rofecoxib celecoxib and etoricoxib are equally effective analgesics when compared with nsaids but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular 10after widespread adoption of the cox2 inhibitors it was discovered that most of the drugs in this class increase the risk of cardiovascular events by 40 on average this led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib and warnings on others etoricoxib seems relatively safe with the risk of thrombotic events similar to that of noncoxib nsaid diclofenac 10opioids  editmain article opioid morphine the archetypal opioid and other opioids eg codeine oxycodone hydrocodone dihydromorphine pethidine all exert a similar influence on the cerebral opioid receptor system buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the μopioid receptor and tramadol is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri with weak μopioid receptor agonist properties 11tramadol is structurally closer to venlafaxine than to codeine and delivers analgesia by not only delivering opioidlike effects through mild agonism of the mu receptor but also by acting as a weak but fastacting serotonin releasing agent and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor 12 13 14 15 tapentadol with some structural similarities to tramadol presents what is believed to be a novel drug working through two and possibly three different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a snri the effects of serotonin and norepinephrine on pain while not completely understood have had causal links established and drugs in the snri class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids especially tapentadol and tramadol with greater success in pain relief dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity confusion respiratory depression myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils seizures  tramadol  but opioidtolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance 16 opioids while very effective analgesics may have some unpleasant sideeffects patients starting morphine may experience nausea and vomiting generally relieved by a short course of antiemetics such as phenergan  pruritus itching may require switching to a different opioid constipation occurs in almost all patients on opioids and laxatives  lactulose macrogol containing or codanthramer are typically coprescribed 17when used appropriately opioids and other central analgesics are safe and effective however risks such as addiction and the bodys becoming used to the drug tolerance can occur the effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect when safe to do so the dosage may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness against tolerance which may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain and requiring an analgesic over long periods opioid tolerance is often addressed with opioid rotation therapy in which a patient is routinely switched between two or more noncrosstolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect alcohol  editsee also ethanol describing the effects of using alcohol to treat pain is difficult 18 alcohol has biological mental and social effects which influence the consequences of using alcohol for pain 18 moderate use of alcohol can lessen certain types of pain in certain circumstances 18 attempting to use alcohol to treat pain has also been observed to lead to negative outcomes including excessive drinking and alcohol use disorder 18medical cannabis  editmain article medical cannabis medical cannabis or medical marijuana can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms 19 20 there is evidence suggesting that cannabis can be used to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms with some trials indicating improved relief of neuropathic pain over opioids 21 22 23combinations  editanalgesics are frequently used in combination such as the paracetamol and codeine preparations found in many nonprescription pain relievers they can also be found in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as pseudoephedrine for sinus related preparations or with antihistamine drugs for allergy sufferers while the use of paracetamol aspirin ibuprofen naproxen and other nsaids concurrently with weak to midrange opiates up to about the hydrocodone level has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action 24 several combination analgesic products have been shown to have few efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components moreover these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events including accidental overdoses most often due to confusion that arises from the multiple and often nonacting components of these combinations 25alternative medicine  editmany people use alternative medicine treatments including drugs for pain relief 26 there is some evidence that some treatments using alternative medicine can relieve some types of pain more effectively than placebo 27 the available research concludes that more research would be necessary to better understand the use of alternative medicine 27psychotropic agents  editother psychotropic analgesic agents include ketamine an nmda receptor antagonist clonidine and other α 2 adrenoreceptor agonists and mexiletine and other local anaesthetic analogues other drugs  editmain article analgesic adjuvant drugs that have been introduced for uses other than analgesics are also used in pain management both firstgeneration such as amitriptyline and newer antidepressants such as duloxetine are used alongside nsaids and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics such as using hydroxyzine promethazine carisoprodol or tripelennamine to increase the painkilling ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic adjuvant analgesics also called atypical analgesics include nefopam orphenadrine pregabalin gabapentin cyclobenzaprine hyoscine scopolamine and other drugs possessing anticonvulsant anticholinergic andor antispasmodic properties as well as many other drugs with cns actions these drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate andor modify the action of opioids when used against pain especially of neuropathic origin dextromethorphan has been noted to slow the development of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the nmda receptors  citation needed some analgesics such as methadone and ketobemidone and perhaps piritramide have intrinsic nmda action 28highalcohol liquor two forms of which were found in the us pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by physicians well into the 1930s has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain due to the cns depressant effects of ethyl alcohol a notable example being the american civil war  citation needed however the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today eg morphine codeine as such in general the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today the use of adjuvant analgesics is an important and growing part of the paincontrol field and new discoveries are made practically every year many of these drugs combat the sideeffects of opioid analgesics an added bonus for example antihistamines including orphenadrine combat the release of histamine caused by many opioids stimulants such as methylphenidate caffeine ephedrine dextroamphetamine methamphetamine and cocaine work against heavy sedation and may elevate mood in distressed patients as do the antidepressants  citation needed the use of medicinal cannabis remains a debated issue in patients with chronic or neuropathic pain various other substances may have analgesic properties tricyclic antidepressants especially clomipramine and amitriptyline have been shown to improve pain in what appears to be a central manner  citation needed nefopam is used in europe for pain relief with concurrent opioids the exact mechanism of carbamazepine gabapentin and pregabalin is similarly unclear but these anticonvulsants are used to treat neuropathic pain with differing degrees of success anticonvulsants are most commonly used for neuropathic pain as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation 29flupirtine is a centrally acting k channel opener with weak nmda antagonist properties 30 it is used in europe for moderate to strong pain and migraine and its musclerelaxant properties it has no anticholinergic properties and is believed to be devoid of any activity on dopamine serotonin or histamine receptors it is not addictive and tolerance usually does not develop 31 however tolerance may develop in single cases 32other uses  edittopical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic sideeffects painful joints for example may be treated with an ibuprofen  or diclofenac containing gel the labeling for topical diclofenac has been updated to warn about druginduced hepatotoxicity 33  capsaicin also is used topically lidocaine an anesthetic and steroids may be injected into painful joints for longerterm pain relief lidocaine is also used for painful mouth sores and to numb areas for dental work and minor medical procedures in february 2007 the fda notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the blood stream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision these topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine tetracaine benzocaine and prilocaine in a cream ointment or gel 34list of drugs with comparison  editcomparison of different analgesics generic
