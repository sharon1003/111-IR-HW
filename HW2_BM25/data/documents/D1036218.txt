from the mob there is no waste just use the half quart at the next oil change but i agree it would be nice on anything that has engine oil to be able to dump 3 quarts or 4 in and not have to measure

hard to measure while that is a good idea i purchase polaris oil by the gallon and not by the quart its close to getting the fourth quart free and if you buy the oil change kit it is even cheaper however i would still like to know where the oil overage goes if i over fill the oil sump tank come on guys and gals someone out there has to know thanks cbelkcbelk is offline quote quick replypost 35

track and possibly transfer oil to the air filter ultimately causing the air filter to pass less air i thought that it might be worth the effort to reroute the breather tube up into the highest part of the motor compartment and then down to the bottom of the chassis terminating it with a small style breather filter it might allow for another 12 quart in the oil reservoir which seem to be a

to run extra oil in the tank oil capacity at 35 qt for 900 engine is pretty good and extra oil will probably end up out thru the breather anyway imo milos2015 sandstorm f350 gslr 09 raptor 700 14 rzr

always worthwhile the exhaust gases and other byproducts of combustion end up in the oil the more oil the larger the reservoir for this corrosive stuff to be stored in these corrosive chemicals are not removed by the filter these are the reason that oil needs to be changed while a 12 quart is not much it is still worthwhile the reason for routing the hose high is that the oil and oil vapor traveling up the tube has the opportunity to be recovered into the tank the current routing of the vent hose is directly across from the sump to the intake noise chamber with nothing to restrict oil flow to the noise box oil vapor in the noise chamber will ultimately work its way to the engine air filter and cause premature restriction the small filter at the end of the oil vent tube does not have to deal with high air flow volumes like the air filter does it only has to keep debris from entering the oil sump it doesnt have to deal with constant air flow it only has to deal with the expansion and contraction of the oil as it heats and cools and any crank case gasses that pass the rings i know that all this seems academic but i plan to use my rzr in baja taking long multiday trips
