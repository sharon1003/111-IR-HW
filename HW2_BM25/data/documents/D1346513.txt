the five dangers of peanut butter for dogs and how to avoid them is peanut butter for dogs a healthy treat or a toxic food let me help you make a wise decision for your dogs health if you’re not a label reader those peanut butter ingredients may surprise you i don’t want to be all doom and gloom but it can be a toxic food for dogs and i’ll sleep better at night if you understand the dangers either we forget reading labels is an important part of shopping for family and pets or we do read labels but dont have a clue what the ingredients are or how to pronounce them peanut butter is one of the top dog treats whether given by spoonful or included in cookies biscuits and chews and because a peanut is not a nut at all what the heck is it peanuts are a legume in the bean family but unlike their cousins they grown underground which leads to two of the five dangers of peanut butter for dogs and humans as well peanut butter for dogs whats in this stuff anyway just peanuts right heck no and ill tell you the exact ingredients of an american top seller in a minute first lets talk about whats wrong with peanut butter danger 1 – mold by its very nature it is common for peanuts to have various molds on them mold is a fungus so is yeast dogs don’t need mold added to their bodies and if your dog has ever suffered from dog ear yeast infections it makes matters worse one type of mold in peanuts is called aspergillus flavus which leads us to danger 2  aflatoxins the mold aseprgillus flavus produces a carcinogenic produces cancer substance called aflatoxin you’ve probably heard of that when they do peanut butter recalls what you may not know is this even though the usda is suppose to test every truckload of raw peanuts for aflatoxin and any containing aflatoxin levels of more than 20 parts per billion destroyed it makes me nervous first i dont want any carcinogenic substances in my food and if theyre checking so well why are there peanut butter recalls so often it seems every year or two there is a huge recall of peanut butter reminding me of the bad dog food recalls then there are smaller recalls where you notice in the nut butter section of the grocery store that a brand is completely emptied out as if it sold out instead of taken off the shelf there are no signs no notices and if you bought a jar the day before too bad for you plus peanuts are normally cooked at a high temperature and then hold little nutritional value so why do we bother danger 3 – sugar if you are a fan of skippy or jiff i assure you they are a bad choice of peanut butter for dogs if you want to risk the mold that’s one thing but sugar for dogs is a big nono sugar is food to yeast and the number of dogs with skin problems and ear problems due to yeast is rising enough dogs are getting diabetes as it is and diet has much to do with it see wheat flour the other sugar danger 4 – hydrogenated oil this processed fat is heated to a high temperature then steam distilled to get the rancid smell out of it its used because its cheap and never goes bad of course it already is bad but without the smell we dont know the body knows this trans fat slows the thyroid if soy based accumulates in our cells think heart attack and disease and because its unnatural it cannot be converted to energy in short trans fats are poisons just like arsenic or cyanide plus they make us fatdanger 5  mono and diglycerides did you know that both mono and diglycerides are hydrogenated oils sneaky move by splitting up the amount of this stuff into 2 parts it appears there is less of it heres the peanut butter ingredients list for jiff copied directly from their website made from roasted peanuts and sugar contains 2 or less of molasses fully hydrogenated vegetable oils rapeseed and soybean mono and diglycerides salt it also notes 2 tablespoons of the stuff gives an adult person one quarter of all the fat needed per day and its not all useable fat so it doesnt count yuck please pass up on these ingredients for your entire family side effects of peanut butter for dogs i was coaching a woman with two big dogs who suffered from diarrhea she totally changed their diet yet the diarrhea continued
