wave energy transport and the amplitude of a wave the speed of a wave the wave equation the nature of a wave was discussed in lesson 1 of this unit in that lesson it was mentioned that a wave is created in a slinky by the periodic and repeating vibration of the first coil of the slinky this vibration creates a disturbance that moves through the slinky and transports energy from the first coil to the last coil a single backandforth vibration of the first coil of a slinky introduces a pulse into the slinky but the act of continually vibrating the first coil with a backandforth motion in periodic fashion introduces a wave into the slinky suppose that a hand holding the first coil of a slinky is moved backandforth two complete cycles in one second the rate of the hands motion would be 2 cyclessecond the first coil being attached to the hand in turn would vibrate at a rate of 2 cyclessecond the second coil being attached to the first coil would vibrate at a rate of 2 cyclessecond the third coil being attached to the second coil would vibrate at a rate of 2 cyclessecond in fact every coil of the slinky would vibrate at this rate of 2 cyclessecond this rate of 2 cyclessecond is referred to as the frequency of the wave the frequency of a wave refers to how often the particles of the medium vibrate when a wave passes through the medium frequency is a part of our common everyday language for example it is not uncommon to hear a question like how frequently do you mow the lawn during the summer months of course the question is an inquiry about how often the lawn is mowed and the answer is usually given in the form of 1 time per week in mathematical terms the frequency is the number of complete vibrational cycles of a medium per a given amount of time given this definition it is reasonable that the quantity frequency would have units of cyclessecond wavessecond vibrationssecond or somethingsecond another unit for frequency is the hertz abbreviated hz where 1 hz is equivalent to 1 cyclesecond if a coil of slinky makes 2 vibrational cycles in one second then the frequency is 2 hz if a coil of slinky makes 3 vibrational cycles in one second then the frequency is 3 hz and if a coil makes 8 vibrational cycles in 4 seconds then the frequency is 2 hz 8 cycles4 s  2 cycless the quantity frequency is often confused with the quantity period period refers to the time that it takes to do something when an event occurs repeatedly then we say that the event is periodic and refer to the time for the event to repeat itself as the period the period of a wave is the time for a particle on a medium to make one complete vibrational cycle period being a time is measured in units of time such as seconds hours days or years the period of orbit for the earth around the sun is approximately 365 days it takes 365 days for the earth to complete a cycle the period of a typical class at a high school might be 55 minutes every 55 minutes a class cycle begins 50 minutes for class and 5 minutes for passing time means that a class begins every 55 minutes the period for the minute hand on a clock is 3600 seconds 60 minutes it takes the minute hand 3600 seconds to complete one cycle around the clock frequency and period are distinctly different yet related quantities frequency refers to how often something happens period refers to the time it takes something to happen frequency is a rate quantity period is a time quantity frequency is the cyclessecond period is the secondscycle as an example of the distinction and the relatedness of frequency and period consider a woodpecker that drums upon a tree at a periodic rate if the woodpecker drums upon a tree 2 times in one second then the frequency is 2 hz each drum must endure for onehalf a second so the period is 05 s if the woodpecker drums upon a tree 4 times in one second then the frequency is 4 hz each drum must endure for onefourth a second so the period is 025 s if the woodpecker drums upon a tree 5 times in one second then the frequency is 5 hz each drum must endure for onefifth a second so the period is 02 s do you observe the relationship mathematically the period is the reciprocal of the frequency and vice versa in equation form this is expressed as follows since the symbol f is used for frequency and the symbol t is used for period these equations are also expressed as the quantity frequency is also confused with the quantity speed the speed of an object refers to how fast an object is moving and is usually expressed as the distance traveled per time of travel for a wave the speed is the distance traveled by a given point on the wave such as a crest in a given period of time so while wave frequency refers to the number of cycles occurring per second wave speed refers to the meters traveled per second a wave can vibrate back and forth very frequently yet have a small speed and a wave can vibrate back and forth with a low frequency yet have a high speed frequency and speed are distinctly different quantities wave speed will be discussed in more detail later in this lesson investigatehow do changes in the frequency of a wave affect the wavelength of a wave use the wave plotterwidget below to find out alter the frequency and observe how the pattern changes wave plotter enter a value for amplitude and select a frequency then click the plot the wave

just read about it and when you could be interacting with it interact  thats exactly what you do when you use one of the physics classrooms interactives we would like to suggest that you combine the reading of this page with the use of our slinky lab interactive you can find it in the physics interactives section of our website the slinky lab provides the learner with a simple environment for exploring the movement of a wave along a medium and the factors that affect its speed visit slinky lab interactive check your understanding throughout this unit internalize the meaning of terms such as period frequency and wavelength utilize the meaning of these terms to answer conceptual questions avoid a formula fixation1 a wave is introduced into a thin wire held tight at each end it has an
