effective it can protect against diseases including cancers caused by hpv when given in the recommended age groups see “who should get vaccinated” below cdc recommends 11 to 12 year olds get two doses of hpv vaccine to protect against cancers caused by hpv for more information on the recommendations please see httpswwwcdcgovvaccinesvpdhpvpublicindexhtml get screened for cervical cancer routine screening for women aged 21 to 65 years old can prevent cervical cancer if you are sexually active use latex condoms the right way every time you have sex this can lower your chances of getting hpv but hpv can infect areas not covered by a condom – so condoms may not fully protect against getting hpvbe in a mutually monogamous relationship – or have sex only with someone who only has sex with you who should get vaccinated all boys and girls ages 11 or 12 years should get vaccinated catchup vaccines are recommended for boys and men through age 21 and for girls and women through age 26 if they did not get vaccinated when they were younger the vaccine is also recommended for gay and bisexual men or any man who has sex with a man through age 26 it is also recommended for men and women with compromised immune systems including those living with hivaids through age 26 if they did not get fully vaccinated when they were younger how do i know if i have hpv there is no test to find out a person’s “hpv status” also there is no approved hpv test to find hpv in the mouth or throat there are hpv tests that can be used to screen for cervical cancer these tests are only recommended for screening in women aged 30 years and older hpv tests are not recommended to screen men adolescents or women under the age of 30 years most people with hpv do not know they are infected and never develop symptoms or health problems from it some people find out they have hpv when they get genital warts women may find out they have hpv when they get an abnormal pap test result during cervical cancer screening others may only find out once they’ve developed more serious problems from hpv such as cancers how common is hpv and the health problems caused by hpv hpv the virus about 79 million
