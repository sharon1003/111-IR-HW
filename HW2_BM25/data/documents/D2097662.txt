the fit of your shorts you have two main options – just above the knee or halfway up your thigh you don’t want them falling on your knee and you certainly don’t want them halfway down your shin – it’s not the 90s and no one’s making that look good at the moment if you’re a taller guy with long legs it’s probably best to go for a length that sits just above your knee shorter legs can get away with them finishing halfway up the thigh for an 80’s aesthetic summer shorts photo credit pinterest paul smith – polo shirt £79levi’s – shorts £49spring court – trainers £109men’s jersey  casual shorts jersey shorts are by far the most casual style we’re going to be looking at here these shorts are perfect for the gym lazy days around the house or even a summer’s afternoon of barbecuing with your mates but as ever in this current climate of mixing the smart with the casual you shouldn’t be afraid of pairing them with some slightly more formal pieces for a contemporary finish that’ll take you

with some jersey shorts you need to be thinking about context it’s all well and good blending smart and casual together but if you’re heading to the gym you don’t wanna be rocking a pair or derbies do you for a comfortable and laidback look go for some canvas plimsolls if you’re heading to a workout or you want a street aesthetic you’re gonna need some runners if you do want to try smartening them up why not go for some suede penny loafers or if you’re in much hotter climates you can always try a pair of flipflops or sandals styling them together jersey shorts may look very casual but they’re fairly easy to smarten up take a plain white oxford shirt and wear them both with a pair of club master sunglasses chuck on a pair of canvas plimsolls or plain tennis shoes to finish the look tailored

making them super easy to dress up or down perfect for office wear if your place of work allows it they are also ideal for pairing with smarter shoes you don’t have to stay smart with them though you can add more casual trainers to the look but we’d resist the temptation to pair them with overly street pieces these also come in a range of colours so it’s worth getting men’s smart shorts in light and dark pairs just for versatility in your wardrobe you could even opt for a print such as stripes if you wanted a slightly more individual finish team your chino shorts with a shirt and boat shoes

there’s always room to smarten up some denim shorts denim shorts offer a bit more durability than the other styles we have mentioned and are versatile enough for pairing with almost any casual or smartcasual pieces you can smarten them up a touch with a polo shirt or at a stretch an oxford shirt but in general we’d stick to tshirts checked shirts and sweats the shoes when it comes to shoes the casual footwear world is at your full disposal everything from hightop chuck taylors to vans classics are going to suit these if you’re after a sportier aesthetic don’t be afraid to team them up with your runners either obviously you could pair these with sandalsflipflops if you’re on holiday and the temperatures are high but the two looks are fairly conflicting you really want to stick to a rugged finish styling them together opt for a green checked shirt  layer over a plain white or black tee if you want some lighter blue denim vans or converse chuck taylors and finish off with a bit of attitude for a grunge look johannes huebl and olivia palermo photo credit pinterest converse – trainers £75converse – trainers £64vans – trainers £55tailored these are probably the least commonlyowned pair of shorts in this list but a viable option nonetheless there are obviously ideal for people who need to smarten up at work but can’t get away with the chino option or if you’re really lucky people heading to a wedding in the bahamas you don’t have to be pairing them with other pieces of tailoring though and you can dress them down a little so they better suit a weekend with a printed shirt or knitwear the shoes the footwear you pair with these decidedly formal shorts should be kept presentable and shouldn’t be part of your weekend wardrobe rotation try some streamlined loafers or drivers or even some suede derby shoes if you’re in dire need of some air for your hooves only stick to leather sandals – no flipflops or slidesstyling them together for a summer’s evening team your
