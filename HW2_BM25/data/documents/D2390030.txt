an employee performance appraisal is a process—often combining both written and oral elements—whereby management evaluates and provides feedback on employee job performance including steps to improve or redirect activities as needed documenting performance provides a basis for pay increases and promotions appraisals are also important to help staff members improve their performance and as an avenue by which they can be rewarded or recognized for a job well done in addition they can serve a host of other functions providing a launching point from which companies can clarify and shape responsibilities in accordance with business trends clear lines of managementemployee communication and spur reexaminations of potentially hoary business practices yet joel myers notes in memphis business journal that in many organizations performance appraisals only occur when management is building a case to terminate someone its no wonder that the result is a mutual dread of the performance evaluation session—something to be avoided if at all possible this is no way to manage and motivate people performance appraisal is supposed to be a developmental experience for the employee and a teaching moment for the manager performance appraisal and developmentwhile the term performance appraisal has meaning for most small business owners it might be helpful to consider the goals of an appraisal system they are as follows to improve the companys productivity to make informed personnel decisions regarding promotion job changes and termination to identify what is required to perform a job goals and responsibilities of the jobto assess an employees performance against these goals to work to improve the employees performance by naming specific areas for improvement developing a plan aimed at improving these areas supporting the employees efforts at improvement via feedback and assistance and ensuring the employees involvement and commitment to improving his or her performance all of these goals can be more easily realized if the employer makes an effort to establish the performance appraisal process as a dialogue in which the ultimate purpose is the betterment of all parties to create and maintain this framework employers need to inform workers of their value praise them for their accomplishments establish a track record of fair and honest feedback be consistent in their treatment of all employees and canvass workers for their own insights into the companys processes and operations a small business with few employees or one that is just starting to appraise its staff may choose to use a prepackaged appraisal system consisting of either printed forms or software software packages can be customized either by using a firms existing appraisal methods or by selecting elements from a list of attributes that describe a successful employees work habits such as effective communication timeliness and ability to perform work requested eventually however many companies choose to develop their own appraisal form and system in order to accurately reflect an employees performance in light of the businesss own unique goals and culture in developing an appraisal system for a small business an entrepreneur needs to consider the following size of staff employees on an alternative work schedule goals of company and desired employee behaviors to help achieve goals measuring performancework pay increases and promotions communication of appraisal system and individual performance performance planning size of staff a small business with few employees may choose to use an informal approach with employees this entails meeting with each employee every six months or once a year and discussing an individuals work performance and progress since the last discussion feedback can be provided verbally without developing or using a standard appraisal form but in many cases legal experts counsel employers to maintain written records in order to provide themselves with greater legal protections as a company increases its staff a more formal system using a written appraisal form developed internally or externally should always be used with the results of the appraisal being tied to salary increases or bonuses whether the appraisal is provided verbally or in writing a small business owner needs to provide consistent feedback on a regular basis so that employees can improve their work performance alternative work schedules employees working alternative work schedules—working at home working parttime jobsharing etc—will most likely need to have their performance appraised differently than regular fulltime staffs in order to be fairly evaluated an alternative work schedule may require different duties to perform a job and these new responsibilities should be incorporated into the appraisal a small business owner should also be careful to ensure that these employees are treated fairly with regard to both the appraisal and resulting promotions company goals and desired performance the performance of employees especially in a smaller firm is an essential factor in any companys ability to meet its goals in a oneperson business goalsetting and achieving is a matter of transforming words into action but moving the business towards its goals in a larger firm means that the employer has to figure out each persons role in that success communicate that role to him or her and reward or correct their performance it also means that the appraisal should incorporate factors such as collaborative ability and sense of teamwork not just individual performance measuringassessing performance once a list of tasks and attributes is developed a small business owner or manager needs to determine how to measure an employees performance on these tasks measurement provides another objective element to the appraisal ideally measurement would be taken against previous performance whether of the individual employee the group or the company at large if a company is just developing its appraisal system or does not have a baseline performance to measure against it should develop realistic goals based on business needs or on the similar performance of competitors pay increases and promotions when developing an appraisal system a small business owner needs to consider the connection between the appraisal and pay increases or promotions while performance feedback for developmentimprovement purposes may be given verbally a written summary of the individuals work performance must accompany a pay increase or promotion or demotion or termination it is crucial therefore that a manager or small business owner regularly document an employees job performance the method of pay increases impacts the appraisal as well if a small business uses meritbased increases the appraisal form would include a rating of the employee on certain tasks if skillbased pay is used the appraisal would list skills acquired and level of competency appraisals and resulting salary increases that take into account group or company performance should include the individuals contributions to those goals communicating the system a performance appraisal system is only effective if it is properly communicated and understood by employees when devising an appraisal system for his or her company an entrepreneur may want to consider involving staff in its development supporters contend that this promotes buyin and understanding of the plan as well as ensuring that the appraisal takes into account all tasks at the company if the small business owner is unable to involve her staff she should walk through the system with each employee or manager and have the manager do the same requesting feedback and making adjustments as necessary communicating performance and planning part of the appraisal system is the actual communication of the performance assessment while this assessment may be written it should always be provided verbally as well this provides an opportunity to answer any questions the employee may have on the assessment as well as to provide context or further detail for brief assessments finally the employee and the entrepreneur or manager should make plans to meet again to develop a plan aimed at improving performance and reaching agreedupon goals for the following review period this planning session should relate company andor group goals to the individuals tasks and goals for the review period and provide a basis for the next scheduled review types of appraisals and assessment termstraditional in a traditional appraisal a manager sits down with an employee and discusses performance for the previous performance period usually a single year the discussion is based on the managers observations of the employees abilities and performance of tasks as noted in a job description the performance is rated with the ratings tied to salary percentage increases however as david antonioni notes in compensation  benefits the traditional merit raise process grants even poor performers an automatic cost of living increase thereby creating perceived inequity¦ in addition most traditional performance appraisal forms use too many rating categories and distribute ratings using a forceddistribution format antonioni suggests the appraisal form use just three rating categories—outstanding fully competent and unsatisfactory—as most managers can assess their best and worst employees with the rest falling in between selfappraisal somewhat selfexplanatory the selfappraisal is used in the performance appraisal process to encourage staff members to take responsibility for their own performance by assessing their own achievements or failures and promoting selfmanagement of development goals it also prepares employees to discuss these points with their manager it may be used in conjunction with or as a part of other appraisal processes but does not substitute for an assessment of the employees performance by a manager employeeinitiated reviews in an employeeinitiated review system employees are informed that they can ask for a review from their manager this type of ondemand appraisal is not meant to replace a conventional review process rather it can be used to promote an attitude of selfmanagement among workers adherents to this type of review process contend that it promotes regular communication between staff and managers detractors though note that it is dependent on the employees initiative making it a less than ideal alternative for some workers with quiet retiring personalities or confidence issues360degree feedback360degree feedback in the performance appraisal process refers to feedback on an employees performance being provided by the manager different people or departments an employee interacts with peer evaluation external customers and the employee himself this type of feedback includes employeegenerated feedback on management performance also known as upward appraisals as a company grows in size a small business owner should consider using 360degree feedback to appraise employees communication in a business of ten people varies wildly from that of a company of 100 persons and 360degree feedback ensures that an employees performance is observed by those who work most closely with him small business owners or managers can either include the feedback in the performance review or choose to provide it informally for development purposes legal issuesgiven that the results of a performance appraisal are often used to support a promotion termination salary increase or job change they are looked at very closely in employee discrimination suits besides providing a written summary of the appraisal to the employee a small business owner would be welladvised to ensure the following with regards to the system at large job expectations as well as the appraisal system and its impact on employees work status are adequately communicated to all employees performance measures are related to the job being performed managers or coworkers providing input into the appraisal must be sufficiently trained as to be able to provide objective input employees are given timely feedback on performance and a reasonable amount of time and support in improving their performance assistance in developing a system is available through a variety of sources including consultants periodicals and books and software in addition given the legal implications of appraisals small business owners should have their companies
