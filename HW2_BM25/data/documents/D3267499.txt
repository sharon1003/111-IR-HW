often bizarre film summer of sam is a bigger triumph than its general critical reception would make it seem due to a great ensemble and a strong screenplay matthew samuel mirliani super reviewer i am usually one to dislike spike lees work due to his knack for starting fights and complaining about more talented directors even i can admit however that lee can at times make a good effort although summer of sam is not a great piece of cinema this is much better film than most in spike lees filmography the cast really elevate the material and for what it is this is an engaging thriller from start to finish that will certainly appeal to viewers looking for a well acted movie with effective thrills the film could have been better as well and though lee tries to craft something quite different from his other work he at times feels uncertain on how to really make this a standout feature spike lee has made a good film here and though i hate the guy i quite enjoyed this dramatic thriller if only he would change his outlook and shut his mouth he would be more respected with this film he crafts something compelling and worth seeing this is quite different and even if its not perfect its one of his better films the film is mixed in terms of what it tries to be but its always engaging due to its varied cast and well thought out characters i will be honest i wanted to avoid this film and i thought it wouldnt be good due to the fact that lees films tend to be preachy and packed with racial tension but summer of sam is different and refreshing the cast and plot are compelling and elevate spike lee sometimes lacking direction i did enjoy the film and along with malcolm x is spike lees second best directorial effort even lees haters like me can admit that this is an entertaining film and it works due to well written characters and standout performances you can only imagine how much better the film would have been better if someone else would have helmed the project this is a flawed film but better than what i initial thought alex roy super reviewer½know what i bet that spike lee would make a really brilliant zombie movie he really excels at crafting stories about groups of characters caught in circumstances that bring out the worst in everyone this movie reminds me a lot of do the right thing but its made twelve years after and set ten years before i was surprised though perhaps i shouldnt have been that this movie spent so little time with david berkowitz himself and so much more with all the characters made paranoid and hostile to each other in the wake of his insane and random murders the son of sam murders have fostered an atmosphere of suspicion that leads former friends and people whove grown up together to mistrust each other form vicious little ingroups and turn on other people to make themselves feel more secure not unlike in the walking dead these characters seem really threedimensional and real to me and everyones motivations while sometimes despicable are at the very least understandable i really like the way ruby and ritchie get into the burgeoning cbgbs punk scene and come together and i really liked vinny and dionna as the profoundly unhappily married couple trying to repair their strained relationship are they even compatible i love this movie its so human and so big and spike lee tells the story with a real sense of flair and zeitgeist emily armstrong super reviewer on a scene by scene basis this film is alright but it is a mess when taken as a whole its like the filmmakers came in with twenty ideas and a clumsy script that does not fully develop any of them this leaves confusion as to what message spike lee was trying to convey there are moments of brilliance in this movie accompanied by some good acting the most noteworthy performance is adrien brody yet for every moment of brilliance there are tedious elements that prevent the film from being great the relationship subplot with john leguizamos character feels like a very bad soapopera that is only related to the son of sam killings by sheer coincidence this subplot is a timekiller that doesnt add to the overall story plus there are some characters that are too cartoonish to be taken as real people which counteracts the gritty realism spike lee is trying to achieve if spike lee had taken the time to refine the script and made it less crowded this movie could have been really great as it is it is a mixed bag christopher heim super reviewer view all audience reviews summer of sam quotes there are no approved quotes yet for
