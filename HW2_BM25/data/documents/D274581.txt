deeply disheartening though it may be the practice of labeling women “crazy” is alive and well today and its roots are deep as in it’sbeenhappeningforthousandsofyearsandhasbeenprettywelltoleratedbymostofsociety deep hysteria was the first mental disorder attributed to women and only women — a catchall for symptoms including but by no means limited to nervousness hallucinations emotional outbursts and various urges of the sexual variety more on that below to make clear how far we’ve come in our understanding of women’s mental health and how far we have yet to go here’s a little trip down memory lane — a tour of just seven of the weirdest things socalled “experts” used to believe about female hysteria you know in addition to it being an actual thing that existed1 hysteria was caused by wandering wombs ah those pesky wombs — never staying still always stirring up problems according to a comprehensive history of female hysteria compiled by researchers from the university of cagliari in italy egyptian texts dating as far back as 1900 bc argued that hysterical disorders were caused by women’s wombs moving throughout their bodies the ancient greeks believed it too in the 5th century bc hippocrates ie the founder of western medicine in what may not go down as his greatest achievement first coined the term “hysteria” — from “hystera” or uterus — and also attributed its cause to abnormal movements of the womb in a woman’s body2 and experts believed the condition was incredibly common thomas sydenham was an influential british physician who lived from the mid to late1600s and clearly thought that crazy ladies were wandering around everywhere according to mother jones sydenham once declared that female hysteria — which he attributed to “ irregular motions of the animal spirits ” was the second most common malady of the time just behind fevers3 sexy thoughts were a symptom fainting outbursts nervousness and irritability weren’t the only hallmarks of female hysteria certain core aspects of female sexuality desire and sexual frustration were also on the list as mother jones reports “excessive vaginal lubrication” and “erotic fantasy” were also both considered symptoms of the disease the horror4 it could be cured by pelvic massage  at various points in history the massaging of a woman’s pelvis ie her genitals was embraced by many a health expert as the cure for female hysteria resulting in “hysterical paroxysm” or orgasm though the practice dates back to the renaissance and even before it became a moneymaker for the medical establishment during the victorian era “by the early 19th century physicianassisted paroxysm was firmly entrenched in europe and the u s and proved a financial godsend for many doctors” psychology today explains5  or vibrators  when the vibrator emerged in the late 19th century explains technology historian rachel maines technology historian in her book “the technology of orgasm” explains it was intended as an “electromechanical medical instrument” to provide more reliable and efficient physical therapy to women believed to be suffering from hysteria and it was a welcome advance doctors “sought every opportunity to substitute other devices for their fingers” maines writes6  or a good hosing according to maines’ investigations at various points highpressure showers or hoses were also used to treat hysteria as was clitoridectomies it should be said one french physician writing in the mid 1800s explained that at first this sort of highpowered douching was unpleasant but then “the reaction of the organism to the cold which causes the skin to flush and the reestablishment of equilibrium all create for many persons so agreeable a sensation that it is necessary to take precautions” women weren’t supposed to indulge in this hydrotherapy for more than four to five minutes  or else like so much of the woefully inaccurate nonsense surrounding female hysteria or else what isn’t entirely clear7 and the established medical community held onto these beliefs for a very long time it’s easy to laughoff female hysteria as preposterous and antiquated pseudoscience but the fact is the american psychiatric association didn’t drop the term until the early 1950s and though it had taken on a very different meaning from its early roots “hysterical neurosis” didn’t disappear from the dsm — often referred to as the bible of modern psychiatry — until 1980 sadly we’re still feeling the impact of this highlyentrenched medical diagnosis today the “crazy” and “hysterical” labels are hard ones for women to completely shake
