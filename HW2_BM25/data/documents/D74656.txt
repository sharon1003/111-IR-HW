emphasis on the emerging and innovative vertical barrier technologies it is not intended to be an inclusive report it merely provides an overview of the existing work in the field of underground barriers12 organization each section of this report provides the following information and format 1 a brief description of the technology 2 advantages 3 disadvantagelimitations 4 cost 5 state of the technology and 6 points of contact for several technologies there is such a wealth of knowledge available that additional references are provided13 overview of subsurface containment subsurface contamination poses a continuing risk to human health and the environment liquid contaminants can migrate through the soil matrix and leach into groundwater while solid and semisolid pollutants may be transported and dispersed through the subsurface getf 1996 because cleanup technologies when available for subsurface containment can be costly and time consuming it is necessary to examine other possibly cheaper ways to reduce the risk and protect human health and the environment at contaminated sites according to the 1996 global environment and technology foundation getf market assessment containment technology is poised for significant if not enormous growth underground containment barriers are an important method of limiting andor eliminating the movement of contaminants through the subsurface subsurface barriers can maintain the volume of waste and reduce the potential for migration into the surrounding geologic media or groundwater in the past containment has been used at sites where there was no other efficient and costeffective option however subsurface barriers can be used in any number of situations where it is necessary to prevent the migration of contamination barriers are currently used for the containment of contaminated waste as an interim step while final remediation alternatives are developed or decided and in coordination with treatment technologies in many instances subsurface barriers are able to effectively confine the contaminant for extended time periods and provide a costeffective method of remediation there are many subsurface barrier technologies commercially available and others in various stages of development the purpose and function of the containment system must be determined prior to designing and constructing the barrier site characterization is an essential part of choosing an appropriate barrier rumer et al 1996 suggests some factors that should be considered when designing a subsurface barrier first it is important to establish the barrier geometry—alignment depth and thickness second a stressdeformation analysis should be performed on the surrounding area in order to assess the potential impacts of barrier construction third compatibility testing must be done to select the most effective barrier materials and when necessary appropriate mixture combinations fourth it is necessary to determine the most effective and feasible construction methods finally construction quality assurancequality control along with monitoring is a crucial component of subsurface barrier design construction quality assurance cqa and construction quality control cqc are essential for the successful design implementation and performance of a subsurface barrier rumer et al 1996 epa 1998 the u s environmental protection agency epa defines quality control as the contractor’s observations sampling measuring and testing to establish conformance to plans and specifications 1987 quality assurance as defined by the epa is conducted by or for the project engineer and provides further confirmation that the construction complies with the specifications of the design quality assurance is not mandated by the epa rumer et al 1996 different types of subsurface barriers have different cqc criteria however there are two primary concerns first the installed barrier must have a hydraulic conductivity equal to or less than that specified in the design rumer et al 1995 the second concern is barrier continuity which is difficult to assess the methods available have had varying degrees of success appendix a provides a brief overview of the standard industry practices for slurry walls for additional information on cqacqc see evaluation of subsurface engineered barriers at waste sites epa 542r98005 quality assurance and quality control for waste containment facilities epa 600r93182 construction quality management for remedial action and remedial design waste containment systems epa 540r92073 and construction quality control and postconstruction performance verification for the gilson road hazardous waste site cutoff wall epa 600287065 there is currently no method of guaranteeing the continuity of a subsurface barrier sullivan et al 1998 discontinuities may occur during grout applicationinstallation and joint formation cracking due to curing settling and wetdry cycling may occur over time proper emplacement of a subsurface barrier is critical to ensure overall effectiveness of the containment system once a barrier is installed verification and monitoring are crucial at this time there is no uniform method of monitoring the emplacement longterm performance or integrity of the barrier the department of energy doe has acknowledged this problem and incorporated different monitoring techniques into containment projects20 established technology21 slurry walls slurry walls are the most common type of subsurface wall and are considered baseline barrier technology heiser et al 1997 it is the expert consensus that if properly designed and constructed slurry walls can successfully contain waste at contaminated sites rumer et al 1996 for over 45 years these walls have been used in the construction industry to contain and direct water and as a result the requirements and practices for designing and installing a slurry wall are well established slurry walls have been used for pollution control since 1970 and the technology is accepted and regarded as an effective method of isolating hazardous waste and preventing the migration of pollutants gerber et al 1994 excavation under a slurry filled trench provides stability and prevents the trench from collapsing figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a typical slurry wall keyed into the subsurface figure 1 cross section of a typical keyedin slurry wall source adapted from the department of energy doe website there are different materials and combinations of materials that can be used to construct slurry cutoff walls including soilbentonite cementbentonite and plastic concrete the backfill and composite typically contain a mixture of materials such as cement bentonite fly ash groundblasted furnace slag and clay other types of cutoff walls include mixinplace grout and composite walls for a comparison of cutoff walls see table 1 both organic and inorganic contaminants can have a negative impact on bentonite in the wall andor in the backfill to help reduce this problem additives can be used to alter the characteristics of the slurry wall for example additions of fly ash can potentially reduce the degradation of concrete by an alkalisilica reaction or sulfate attack table 1 comparison of selected cutoff walls type advantages cementbentonite cbstrength low compressibility can be used on steep slopes with unstable soil hydraulic conductivity around 10 6 cms soilbentonite sblower hydraulic conductivities than cbcheaper than cbhydraulic conductivity typically around 10 7 cms but as low as 50 x 10 9 cms soilcementbentonite scbsimilar to cb in strength and sb in hydraulic conductivity plastic concrete pcstiffer and stronger than cementbentonite preferred type of cutoff wall for deep walls clamshell or hydromill is used to excavate the trenchmixinplace soil is not excavated composite slurry improved impermeability and resistance grouting can be used for barrier construction by injecting grout into holes or to seal fractures in impermeable layers source epa 1992211 soilbased slurry walls the application of soilbentonite slurry walls involves excavation to the desired depth and eventual displacement of the slurry by a permanent backfill which forms the hydraulic barrier varying the composition of the backfill can alter the properties of the barrier to obtain the desired strength or permeability for example the addition of plastic fines helps decrease the effect of contaminants on the barrier advantages construction techniques well understood practiced and accepted depths of up to 200 ft installed quickly heiser et al 1997can be used in conjunction with other remediation technologies such as capping disadvantages installation requires excavation produces substantial quantities of spoils that must be disposed of and requires a mixing area difficult to ensure proper emplacement may degrade over time due to contaminants in the soil gerber et al 1994– silica and aluminum in the bentonite andor soil may dissolve in the presence of strong organic and inorganic acids p h  1 and bases p h  11 increasing the porosity of the barrier– inorganic salts and some neutral polar and nonpolar organic compounds result in the shrinkage of bentonite clay particles wetdry cycles and freezethaw cycles can cause deterioration such as cracking limited to vertical

workshop john wiley and sons inc new york epa 1992  engineering bulletin slurry walls epa 540s92008212 cementbased slurry walls a selfhardening slurry trench is a type of slurry wall that uses cementbentonite as the permanent backfill cementbentonite walls are advantageous when there is a lack of suitable soil for backfill insufficient space available for mixing of backfill a steep slope on site or a very strong wall is required shear strength gerber et al 1994 however cementbentonite walls tend to be more permeable than soilbentonite walls permeabilities of cementbentonite walls range from 10 5 – 10 6 cms and the typical permeability required for site remediation is a minimum of 10 7 cms selfhardening slurries typically consist of mixtures of portland cement and bentonite clay the bentonite is blended with water producing a hydrated slurry of approximately 6 bentonite by weight cement is added just prior to pumping the slurry into the trench the cement content is usually 10 – 20 by weight mutch et al 1997 alternative selfhardening slurries incorporate groundblast slag in with the cement to increase impermeabilities to 10 7 – 10 8 cms additions of slag can also increase the chemical resistance and strength of the barrier typically the mixing ratio of portland cement to slag is 31 or 41 mutch et al 1997 advantages installed quickly because construction requirements and practices are well understood heiser et al 1997much stronger than soilbased vertical walls selfhardening slurries do not require backfill so walls can be constructed in limited access areas and at a lower cost little or no slurry displaced disadvantages difficult to ensure panel continuity high permeability of some mixes eg portland cement can adversely affect the swelling of bentonite clayoften difficult to achieve sufficiently low permeability cracking due to shrinkage thermal stress and wetdry cycling heiser et al 1997cost cost ranges from 10 – 20vertical ft 2 for a 2ft wide barrier of

traditional soil or cementbased walls fundamentally the scb wall is a soilbentonite slurry wall with cement added to the backfill less than 10 the benefit of the scb slurry wall is that it is similar to the cementbentonite wall in strength and to the soilbentonite wall in hydraulic conductivity rumer et al 199622 sheet pile walls sheet pile cutoff walls are constructed by driving vertical strips of steel precast concrete aluminum or wood into the soil forming a subsurface barrier wall the sheets are assembled before installation and driven or vibrated into the ground a few feet at a time to the desired depth a continuous wall can be constructed by joining the sheets together the joints between the sheet piles are vulnerable to leakage and a number of patented techniques have evolved to seal them in addition to different types of joints a variety of sealants including grout fly ash and cement have been used to seal joints advantages sheet piling is very strong and successful in containing both soil and water chemical resistance excavation is not required minimum waste to dispose ofinstallation procedures are well established able to construct irregularly shaped barriers in confined area consistent hydraulic conductivity potential for removal and reuse at another site disadvantages joints can leak piling can potentially corrode if used for longterm containment rumer et al 1996 and amount of corrosion depends on the amount of oxygen in the soil expensive compared to alternative types of vertical barriers difficult to install in hard rocky soil depth of penetration of sheet piles is limited to approximately 30 – 45 m depending on soil type and drilling equipment smyth et al 1995noise and vibration associated with drilling state of the technology while the technology is well understood sheet pile walls has had limited use in the united states and the united kingdom private companies such as waterloo barrier inc have successfully adapted the general sheet pile barrier for containment uses waterloo barrier inc has developed a unique method of sealing the joints between the sheet piles to reduce leakiness which has been a problem in the past see

waterloo barrier tmthe waterloo barrier tm is an adaptation of the sheet pile wall that addresses the problem of leaky joints the waterloo barrier tm is specially designed to interlock sealable joints see figure 2 for a schematic of interlocking sealable joints installation involves driving sheet piles into the ground flushing the interlocking joint cavity to remove soil and debris and injecting sealant into the joints depending on site conditions the cavity may be sealed with a variety of materials including claybased cementitious polymer or mechanical sealants video inspection of the joint cavity prior to sealing ensures that the joint can be sealed the waterloo barrier tm can achieve bulk hydraulic conductivities of less than 10 8 cms mutch et al 1997 the barrier can easily be

artificially freezing the soilpore water as the moisture freezes the permeability decreases thereby forming an impermeable barrier once the wall is frozen it remains impermeable and can prevent the migration of contaminants when the barrier is no longer needed the refrigeration system can be turned off allowing the barrier to melt in the past this technology has been used for groundwater control and to strengthen walls at excavation sites the construction of a frozen barrier wall involves installing pipes called thermoprobes into the ground and circulating refrigerant cryogenic through them as the refrigerant moves through the system it removes heat from the soil and freezes the pore water in arid regions water can be injected into the soil to provide the moisture necessary to form the barrier or to repair the frozen wall the thermoprobes can be placed in different configurations depending on the geologic media and the desired shape of the barrier for example if the pipes are installed at a 45 e angle along the sides of the area to be contained and installed vertically on the ends a vshaped barrier will be formed providing complete containment the choice of refrigerant is site and contaminant specific for example if the site is polluted with a low freezing point contaminant like trichloroethylene tce a refrigerant such as liquid nitrogen may be required other possible refrigerants include calcium chloride brine and carbon dioxide alternative refrigerants can have a dramatic effect on the overall cost due to different efficiencies in their refrigeration cycles erv long personal communication in addition friction or thermal resistance within the circulation systems can also reduce the efficiency advantages environmentally safe lower risk and cost– contaminated soil is not excavated– no byproducts arctic foundations websitecontaminants are contained in situ with frozen soil as the containment medium thermoprobes may be installed in different positions to create a wall of almost any shape and size to fully contain contaminants application for longterm containment depends on the half life of the contaminanteg a frozen wall would be a good choice for a

technology on may 12 to october 10 1994 a successful demonstration of the technology occurred at a clean site at oak ridge national laboratory cryocell® rkk ltd installed a vshaped containment system measuring 28 ft the wall was 12 – 15 ft thick in the sandy areas and 5 – 9 ft thick in the clayey areas doe website the volume of frozen soil in the barrier was 35694 ft 3 and the volume of soil contained by the barrier was 8175 ft 3 the integrity of the barrier was assessed using diffusion studies with the tracer rhodamine tracer studies done by los alamos national laboratory lanl the total cost of installation was 481427 the estimated real cost for installation at a nondemonstration site was 332754 maintenance costs were approximately 3322month a large number of pumps were required to circulate the brine through the pipes and additional pipes require more electricity to freeze and maintain the wall electricity costs required to pump the brine used by cryocell® is higher than other refrigerants elizabeth phillips personal communication in 1997 – 1998 a fullscale demonstration occurred at an ornl site contaminated with strontium 90 arctic foundations inc afi installed a frozen barrier using a unique system of hybrid thermosyphons which can be used in either an active or passive mode in warmer climates with ambient air temperature above freezing the active mode is used this mode includes the use of a refrigeration unit the passive mode involves heat removal from the soil without an external power source and therefore without a refrigeration unit the wall was frozen for at least one year during nine months of that time the wall thickness was 12 ft afi used a standard refrigeration unit and standard refrigerants r404a and carbon dioxide that are readily available and less expensive than a supercooling liquid brine scott mc mullin personal communication see table 2 for physical design data the electrical costs are much lower than the wall installed in 1994 because of the choice of refrigerants two refrigerants were necessary at ornl because the ambient air temperature is high in cooler regions with temperature below 32 ° c the system can run passively the epa

smaller quantity of excavation spoils compared to external methods such as slurry walls321 deep soil mixing dsmdeep soil mixing dsm which was originally developed in japan in the early 1960s involves mixing an additive into the soil to produce a hard mass that acts as a barrier the technology uses a special auger with a mixing shaft to simultaneously drill and inject the desired material resulting in a column of soil and material as the augers move through the earth they loosen the soil lift it into the mixing paddles blend it with slurry and inject it back out through the augers mutch et al 1997 possible slurry materials include bentonite cement lime and additives eg fly ash and slag that change the compositiondurability of the material dsm can be used to construct continuous walls by overlapping individual columns walls can be built up to 100 ft in depth advantages in situ technique– minimal disposal costs– reduced worker exposure less danger of collapse because wall is constructed in small sections can be installed in confined areas able to contain any type of waste as long as a chemical or physical reagent is applicable geocon inc websitedisadvantages interconnected short panels– difficult to verify continuity– care must be taken to ensure gaps are not present between panels– verticality is crucial contaminated soil is incorporated into the slurry mixture and into the wall rocks mixed into the slurry can cause construction problems hard ground or large boulders in the subsurface limit drilling ability depth limitations– effective mixing to depths of 40 ft doe website but commercial vendors claim they have reached depths of 100 ft cost the cost varies depending on the soil characteristics and the grout material used for example

the dead sea rumer and mitchell 1996 a composite cutoff wall is formed by inserting a geomembrane liner into the trench of a slurry wall the geomembrane adds reinforcement to the integrity of the wall and increases resistance to chemical attack construction techniques may vary but installation generally involves mounting the geomembrane on an installation frame lowering the frame plus geomembrane into the trench using weights and then withdrawing the frame rumer and ryan 1995 geomembrane panels are typically emplaced using the vibrating beam technology see section 35 for a description of this technology the addition of the geomembrane can decrease the hydraulic conductivity up to five orders of magnitude jessberger 1991 geomembranes are particularly beneficial above the water table where soilbentonite walls are susceptible to cracking due to wetdry cycles geomembranes can be used with other types of walls soilcement cementbentonite or soilcementbentonite to provide added assurance against discontinuities application of this technology needs additional fieldtesting331 geomembrane composite walls geomembranes were first used as vertical barriers in the early 1980s they can be used alone or in conjunction with other containment systems although geomembranes are extremely impermeable when used in a composite wall they can potentially provide an added level of protection the

eight times its original volume when exposed to water belinda burson personal communication the seals are monitored for continuity during panel installation because the interlock is designed to be stronger than the geomembrane the hdpe will stretch under stress burson et al 1997 the barrier can be keyed into clay but if the confining layer is rock keying in will fracture rock and cause leakage for additional protection jet grouting can be used to prevent leakage between the geomembrane and the bedrock the two primary methods of installation are a trencher system and vibratory piledriving trenchless method gci has developed a unique deep trencher that is simultaneously able to cut a narrow trench support the sidewalls and install hdpe walls as the trencher moves through the soil it cuts a narrow trench ranging from 16 – 22 inches in diameter and places hdpe in the trench the special interlock system allows an hdpe wall to be placed using vibratory installation with conventional

the 1980s dwyer 1998 it was developed for use on conventional civil engineering problems such as excavation support methods of jet grouting are based on a water cutting technology that includes a singlerod system injecting grout alone a doublerod system injecting grout and air or a triplerod system injecting grout air and water rumer et al 1995 mutch et al 1997 typically a portland cement grout or cementbentonite grout is used larger diameter columns can be constructed with the triplerod system jet grouting involves injecting a grout mixture at very high pressures up to 5000 – 6000 pounds per square inch and velocities as great as 800 – 1000 fts into the pore spaces of the soil or rock the jetted grout cuts replaces and mixes the soil with cementing material to form a column rotation of the drill rod as it is being removed will form a column a panel is formed by leaving the drill rod in place epa 1998 the soil structure is destroyed as grout and soil are mixed forming a homogeneous mass jet grouting can be used in soil types ranging from gravel to clay but the soil type can alter the diameter of the grout column soil properties also are related to the efficiency for instance jet grouting in clay is less efficient than in sand heiser et al 1997 advantages soil heterogeneity has much less of an impact on wall placement than permeation grouting see section 342 for a

lead to cracking separation or tears may occur as barriers harden potentially large amount of spoils to clean up rumer et al 1995injection pressure and volume must be closely monitored a solution to

compositea closecoupled barrier combines a thin inner lining of polymer grout with a conventional lowcost cementgrout containment barrier the resultant barrier is a cementpolymer composite deriving economic benefits from the cement and performance benefits from the polymer heiser et al 1997 see figure 4 for a diagrammatic representation of a closecoupled subsurface barrier closecoupled subsurface barriers are installed using jet grouting with a dual fluid injection system the dual pump system was devised to avoid problems with rapid gel times the system allows split streams of two different grouting media to be jetted simultaneously polymerization occurs when the two parts are mixed the grouts mix together only after leaving the drill equipment this avoids clogging the drill system mixing occurs normally as a result of the high pressure jetting dual fluid injection is preferred when using thermosetting polymers that gel after about 30 minutes heiser et al 1997 figure 4 crosssection of the closecoupled subsurface barrier source adapted from heiser et al 1997advantages benefits of using cement dwyer personal communication– adequate for the containment of the majority of waste forms– readily available– easy to work with– low cost savings are associated with composite barrier vs all polymer – cement is inexpensive and helps reduce the amount of polymer needed heiser

with visual evaluation hydraulic testing of core samples water flooding and gas tracer verification both perfluorocarbon gas tracers pfts and seatrace tm were used to validate barrier integrity after emplacement repair or seal a breach and assess longterm integrity results from the hanford and bnl projects the use of a dualwall drill pipe to inject two fluid and thermosettingpolymer grouts proved to be safe and reliable heiser et al 1997 jet grouting was used effectively to install a continuous barrier jet grouting did not affect the waste form a barrier integrity verification system was

barrier the thin diaphragm barrier is emplaced using high pressure jet grouting while this grouting technique has been used for years in civil engineering applications it has only recently been considered for environmentalremediation related purposes srt 1997 installation involves drilling a horizontal or angled borehole inserting a rodstring to the desired depth and removing the string at a constant speed as the string is removed grout material is injected through the nozzle at a pressure of approximately 5700 pounds per square inch to facilitate the penetration of grout through the subsurface a cone of air surrounds the grout as it is injected through the nozzle carey johnston personal communication the resultant thin diaphragm barrier is composed of a mixture of grout and parent material excess soil and fluid forced to the surface surrounding the drill rod are contained in a spoils box the drill consists of two injection nozzles positioned 180 e apart this configuration enables the formation of thin panels approximating 4 – 8 inches thick and 10 ft wide see figure 5 for diagrammatic representation of the emplacement of a thin diaphragm barrier

engineering mining and geotechnical fields mutch et al 1997 dwyer 1994 this technique involves the injection of a lowviscosity grout into the soil at low pressure the grout fills the soil voids to achieve low permeabilities without significantly changing the structure or volume of the soil to avoid hydrofracture the grout pressure should not exceed the soil fracture pressure rumer et al 1995 the first step of the process involves grouting the sleeve pipe annulus with a brittle grout material weak prior to injection with the selected grout s once hardened the real grout is injected at a pressure that will fracture the annulus grout thereby directing grout radially into the formation at the designated interval dwyer 1994 injection pressure is lowered as pressure decreases from fracturing of the annulus grout to ensure permeation and avoid hydrofracturing of the formation dwyer 1994 permeation grouting is a feasible method for emplacing a low permeability subsurface barrier in semiarid unconsolidated alluvial soils common in the southwest united states the degree of grout permeation is a function of the grout viscosity grout particle size and the particle size distribution these characteristics are directly correlated with the soil hydraulic conductivity understanding the relationship between these parameters is essential for predicting grout flow characteristics dwyer 1994 a variety of materials can be used in permeation grouting and it is essential to select a grout that is compatible with the soil matrix particulate grouts are applicable when the soil permeability is greater than 10 1 cms karol 1990 chemical grouts can be used with soil permeabilities greater than 10 3 cms karol 1990 for further information on groutability and compatibility see appendix b there are currently two main methods of permeation grouting point injection and sleeve pipe injection tubea’manchette in the point injection method the casing is driven to full depth and grout is injected as the casing is withdrawn rumer et al 1995 overlapping injection holes can be used to form a continuous barrier the tubea’manchette method involves grouting a sleeve pipe in the grout hole and injecting grout through holes in the pipe rumer et al 1995 the holes are covered and placed at 1 ft intervals along the pipe the grout is injected under pressure into the soil the advantage of the tubea’manchette method is that different grouts can be injected into different holes and grout can be reinjected if there is a problem advantages mutch et al 1997 and dwyer 1994in situ technique means lower costs because there is no excavated soil directionally drilled boreholes allow access without disturbing the waste can be used to emplace vertical or horizontal barriers for complete containment shortterm or longterm applications barriers may enhance the effectiveness of in situ remediation while containing the volume of waste applicable to rock disadvantages limited to formations with moderate to high permeabilities hard to ensure continuity difficult to direct the flow of grout in heterogeneous soils because the grout tends to follow the path of least resistance hard to predict grout penetration radius cost the cost is often dominated by directional drilling cost estimates for directional drilling are7 – 17ft 2 rumer and mitchell 1996 these estimates do not include grouting materials waste disposal surface support equipment and other contingencies state of the technology on october 1992 and september 1993 brookhaven national laboratory

seismic tomography this process is able to measure anomalies in the subsurface corresponding to changes in the velocity of seismic wave signals dwyer 1994 verification also included excavation and physical comparison phase ii montan wax and sodium silicatepreliminary ground penetrating radar gpr surveys were of limited value because of interference from the caliche layer dwyer 1994 electromagnetic induction was employed before during and after wall installation neutron probe logging was used before during and after wall installation results the interconnection between soil pore spaces will determine groutability dwyer 1994 permeation grouting can be used with gravels and sands but is only marginally successful for silts and clays dwyer 1994 microfine cementitious grout can be used to grout high hydraulic conductivity soils the penetration radius depends on soil heterogeneity grout viscosity and injection pressure dwyer 1994 nonuniform grout flow was attributed to soil characteristics because viscosity and injection pressures were held constant the grout tended to follow the path of least resistance and flowed primarily along the horizontal plane results of excavation dwyer 1994grout permeated coarse sand and gravel soil but the technology only displaced the fine sand and silty soil cement grouts attained hydraulic conductivities of 10 7 – 10 9 cms which meets epa guidelines requiring liners to have a minimum hydraulic conductivity of 10 7 cms conclusions dwyer 1994permeation grouting is a promising technique for emplacing low permeability barriers in unconsolidated semiarid vadose zone soils additional or new grout can be added at a later date because the tubea’manchette method uses injection piping that is permanent permeation grouting is most effective in relatively homogeneous soils a minimum hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 cms is required for the injection of microfine cements montan wax and sodium silicate grouts in lower hydraulic conductivity soils less permeable grout tends to displace or compact rather than permeate the soil microfine cementbased grouts produce strong durable low permeability barriers crosswell seismic tomography is effective for identifying cementgrout invaded soils but cannot verify barrier continuity borehole measurement of electromagnetic resistivity moisture content and temperature changes can

formulations of colloidal silica cs and poly silo xane psx were designed specifically for the vlb moridis et al august 1996 see section 3431 for more information on cs and psx the new formula cs was designed to resist soil chemistry effects and the new psx has a lower initial viscosity moridis et al september 1998 both of these materials can be injected using standardavailable equipment it is necessary to match the injection fluid to the waste and to soil characteristics the geologic matrix appears to be critical to the application and success of this technology van price personal communication soil permeability affects the gel time moridis et al september 1996 in high permeability soils it is advantageous for the grout to gel quickly so it remains in the desired region in contrast in low permeability soils it is beneficial for the grout to gel slowly so it will have time to invade the desired region prior to setting permeability is also important for determining injection well spacing figure 6 viscous liquid barrier installation source adapted from moridis et al 1996advantages applicable to sandy porous soils with permeabilities greater than 10 2 cms– permeability depends on grout permeability and saturation in the pore space emplacement with minimal or no destruction of soil matrix in situ technique– contamination is not disturbed– cost is reduced

the los banos gravel company which has a subsurface similar to hanford the demonstration site was excavated to a depth of 21 ft both cs and psx gelled and cross linked in the subsurface moridis et al september 1996 in spite of soil heterogeneity both materials produced fairly uniform injections the injection bulbs achieved hydraulic conductivities of 10 5 cms scott mc mullin personal communication the investigators concluded that multiple injections were required to obtain the desired permeability moridis et al september 1996 but grouted soil was two orders of magnitude less permeable than the ungrouted sand fractions the gel time for cs and cross linkage time for psx was 2 – 25 hours moridis et al september 1996 cs performance characteristics grouted and sealed fractures and large pores occurred in the clay in open areas cs did not appear to saturate the voids but appeared to seal access to them cs provided some structural strength to the soil matrix moridis et al september 1996 the initial viscosity was 5 c p which is easy to inject sand with an initial hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 ms achieved hydraulic conductivities of 10 10 ms after grouting moridis et al august 1996 cs is much cheaper than psx but it is possible to use a combination of the two psx performance characteristics psx creates a grout bulb that is almost symmetric it grouted and sealed gravels cobbles sands silts and clays it filled large and small voids the initial viscosity is 10 c p which is easy to inject it imparted structural strength and elasticity to the soil unlike the cs allowing the formation of vertical segments psx has lower hydraulic conductivity than cs sand with an initial hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 ms achieved hydraulic conductivities of 10 12 ms after grouting moridis et al

on the order of 10 5 to 10 6 cms were obtained a piece of the wall was left in place to be developed as a verification test site the following is a chronology of events for this installation doe in coordination with mse is trying to determine why the barrier installed at bnl did not achieve the minimum hydraulic conductivity mse conducted in situ permeability testing and analysis in the laboratory the main question is whether the problem is due to the barrier design the grout material cs or the emplacement scott mc mullin personal communication there are still a lot of unresolved

chemical grouts or a combination of both the most common grouts are particulate grouts including slurry mixtures of cement bentonite and water particulate grouts tend to be more viscous and better adapted to large pore spaces where they can spread through the pores chemical grouts typically contain a chemical base a catalyst and a solvent such as water epa 1998 examples of chemical grouts include montan wax sodium silicate acrylate urethane or ludox ludox is a colloidal silica gel developed by du pont the density and viscosity of ludox are similar to water and the gel time can be controlled from a few hours to thousands of hours laboratory results show a decrease in permeability of four orders of magnitude mutch et al 19973431 montan wax the concept of using montan wax for containment was developed in germany in 1985 by a company called vereinigte mitteldeutsche braunkohlenwerke ag mibrag the injected material is a combination of melted wax surfactant bentonite and water melted wax is injected into water at a temperature of 95 ° – 98 ° c and then a small amount of surfactant is added to the emulsion voss et al 1993 additions of sodium bentonite clay break the emulsion causing the particles of wax to aggregate in the subsurface the particles continue to bind to one another thus filling voids and forming an impermeable barrier the temperature of the wax and water as well as the amount of bentonite can be altered depending on the permeability of the soil montan wax was first mined in 1921 the largest know deposits of montan wax are in the coal fields of former east germany the mining process involves extraction of the wax from coal montan wax used to form subsurface barriers is typically mixed with bentonite the addition of sodium bentonite serves to bind the surfactant causing the wax particles to aggregate properties of montan wax voss et al 1994 it is a fossil plant wax with properties similar to natural plant waxes plants produce it to prevent desiccation the wax is hard it has a high melting point it consists of mixture of waxes resins and asphaltenelike materials it contains c24 to c32 carbon chain esters of longchain acids and alcohols it is typically used for carbon inks emulsions polishes and lubricants permeability is stable and does not change over time kretzschmar et al 1997 laboratory tests show significant reductions in soil permeability from 65 x 10 4 – 36 x 10 2 cms to 37 x 10 8 – 16 x 10 4 cms mutch et al 1997 it is not effective on soils with permeabilities less the 5 x 10 4 cms it is nontoxic to fish kretzschmar et

presence of inorganic bases and glycols voss et al 1994problems with emplacement in the united states limited supply because there are only two mines in the world– montan wax mined in germany is imported and soil in the united states by strohmeyer and arpe inc– northern california expensive however the cost is due to installation not the wax itself golder federal associateshard to install because requires high injection pressures to overcome geologic formations difficult to control the breakdown of the montan wax emulsion thereby increasing the viscosity and making injection virtually impossible wilson 1995limited by how much the rock can be fractured to inject the wax limited to sandy porous soils the following are some potential applications kretzschmer 1997 montan wax may be injected through wells using highpressure jet grouting to create vertical andor horizontal barriers at depths up to 300 m kretzschmer 1997 slit walls with montan wax mud cakes impermeable on the walls and slit filled with mud and montan wax can be made and used at a maximum depth of 100 m kretzschmer 1997 montan wax can be applied onto surfaces as a sealant to prevent infiltration montan wax can be applied in a well filled with coiled tubing state of the technology in 1992 – 1994 a threeyear testing program took place to determine the suitability of montan wax emulsion for containment barriers at doe sites voss et al 1993 phase i consisted of laboratory tests that focused on compatibility and permeability the results demonstrated that montan wax is compatible with methanol xylene aniline cupric sulfate hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide but shows rapid destruction in the presence of glycols the most successful permeability test was on the hanford soil where the hydraulic conductivity was reduced by five orders of magnitude to 4 x 10 8 cms phase ii involved a singleborehole injection test using permeation grouting and performance monitoring the test was done at an uncontaminated site near sbls chemical waste landfill three montan wax formulations were tested and the results were promising for sandy gravelly soils the final phase was a multipleborehole injection test used to construct a horizontal barrier phase iii in 1994 involved field trials at a site near the municipal landfill in richland wa placement of the montan wax using standard permeation grouting methods was not successful burgess 1994 in 1990 – 1997 flow waste conducted 24 applications of montan wax in germany flow tex® and romanta 1997 these applications involved soil stabilization surface

barrier materials that improve performance381 tires scrap tire chips were first added to slurry walls as a method of decreasing the mobility of vocs through engineered containment systems shredded tires were found to significantly improve the ability of slurry walls to contain vocs park et al 1996 has shown that adding ground tires to the soilbentonite slurry backfill can reduce the hydraulic conductivity of the cutoff wall the shredded tires adsorb sorb vocs such as toluene methylene chloride trichloroethylene tce and mxylene from the solution park et al 1996 chose to test these organics because they are commonly present at waste disposal sites tire pieces ranging from 13 – 25 cm effectively sorbed the vocs the necessary thickness of shredded tires depends on the amount of organic compounds to be removed park et al 1996 found that compounds requiring larger quantities of tires for sorption were also more biodegradable so a thickness greater than 30 cm would rarely be necessary differences in sorbance capacity of the ground tires depended on the characteristics of the polymers in the tires kim et al 1997 and sorption was not temperature or p h dependent advantages

perfluorocarbon gas tracers perfluorocarbon gas tracers pftspfcs are involved in a geophysical technique that can be used in the vadose zone to determine the physical properties of a barrier however existing subsurface geophysical techniques are unable to detect small defects less than an inch in a barrier at depths greater than 100 ft pft technology requires the following equipment tracer gases injection equipment samplers and analyzers tracer technology is based on the rate of migration of a tracer from the point of injection to a collection well sullivan et al 1998 gas tracers are injected on the inside of the barrier and concentrations of the gas are measured in geoprobe monitoring wells outside of the barrier a capillary adsorbent tracer sampler cats is usually used to measure the monitoring well concentrations of pfts the concentration of pfts in the external monitoring wells is used to determine if there is a breach in the barrier if concentrations of pfts in the wells are approximately the same the barrier is considered intact on the other hand if a breach occurs the concentration of tracer measured in the monitoring wells will be orders of magnitude greater even for a small hole the quantity type and location of tracer detected on the monitoring side of the barrier indicates the size and location of the breach ie the larger the opening the greater the amount of tracer detected heiser et al 1997 the spectra of the tracers passing through the wall is used to identify the location of the breach relative to the tracer injection points pfts can be used to detect small holes in the wall as well as slight imperfections pfts can definitely detect a problem but there is a question of how precisely they can locate the problem in the field terry sullivan personal communication theoretically pfts should be very precise but realistically field detection is much less precise than in the laboratory the thrust of the current work is to determine how precisely pfts

sensitive nonradioactive tracer can be detected in concentrations as low as 10 parts per quadrillion ppq of airmultitracer technology six pfts can be simultaneously deployed sampled and analyzed with

vadose zone depth of application is site specific and depends on geology and hydrogeology cost the cost of using pfts depends on the size of the subsurface barrier because the size will dictate the

ground penetrating radar gprgpr is a geophysical tool that has been in use since the late 1940s and has been of interest in the environmental field since the 1970s the first applications of gpr occurred in the early 1970s to locate subsurface structures such as mining tunnels and buried waste heiser et al 1997 gpr uses electromagnetic waves to penetrate the surface a radar antennae is passed along a set of grid lines across a site and when the waves come into contact with materials in the subsurface part of the wave energy is reflected back to a receiving station the changes in radar signal reflection or absorption can be used to map the subsurface the quantity of energy reflected depends on the electrical conductivity encountered along the path mse 1996 the amount of energy reflected in addition to the travel time can be used to determine the depth of the obstruction gpr can potentially be used to verify the emplacement location and continuity of a subsurface barrier as well as track a contaminant plume around a containment facility rumer and mitchell 1996 advantages nonintrusive potentially able to identify breach and discontinuity and determine size of both provides a threedimensional image of the structure typically works better than seismic technology above the water table disadvantages susceptible to interference from metallic objects penetration depth is determined by frequency and soil type much harder to penetrate clay lower frequencies can penetrate to a greater depth but lose resolution the electrical conductivity of the containment

verification at this site this site was complicated because the barrier wall surrounded a large metal storage tank which may have altered the radar signals gpr may be a useful tool in other situations in 1995 the oak ridge national laboratory used gpr to map the thickness and continuity of a frozen barrier the technology was considered successful because of the large difference in electrical properties of ice and water in 1997 – 1998 the viscous liquid wall was tested at brookhaven national laboratory ny but no data are available in 1997 – 1998 a thin diaphragm wall was tested at dover de but no data are available44 seismicacoustic methods seismic methods rely on measuring the speed of waves traveling through a specific medium reflection andor refraction of the wave depends on the physical and chemical properties of the media the waves can be detected and measured by special sensors a specific type of seismic technology called crosswell seismic tomography or crosshole seismic imaging places transmitters in one borehole and receivers in another borehole the time it takes the seismic waves to travel between the transmitter and a receiver is inverted into a twodimensional map of velocity and structure rumer et al 1996 seismic wave velocity is proportional to the density of the media seismic methods use velocity to evaluate the integrity of a subsurface barrier by comparing time measurements before and after grouting resolution varies with frequency such that higher frequency waves provide better resolution the technology is similar to gpr except that it uses different energy frequencies and a different energy source mseta unpublished advantages nonintrusive or semiinvasive boreholesapplicable to vertical or horizontal barriers can potentially be used for leak detection applicable to surface borehole or surface to borehole configurations usually works better below the water table in consolidated sediments disadvantages penetration distance should be less than 5 m mseta unpublishedstate of the technology in 1987 at hill air force base ut seismicacoustic methods were used for the detection of a mud slurry trench the technology successfully identified the presence and shape of the barrier but was unable to identify the location mse 1996 in 1995 oak ridge national laboratory and the massachusetts institute of technology used seismicacoustic methods to identify the presence of three cement monoliths sandia national laboratory snl successfully identified the existence and location of grout materials in 1997– 1998 the savannah river site used seismic technology to monitor the emplacement of a viscous liquid barrier and dover air force base de used a seismic technology to monitor the emplacement of a thin diaphragm wall45 electroacoustics or seismoelectricselectroacoustics is a subsurface imaging technology combining electrical and acoustical methods the detection capabilities are better than either electric or acoustic methods alone mse 1996 this imaging technique emits an acoustic pulse that is detected as an electrical signal the acoustic waves interact with the electrical structure of the medium mse 1996 state of the technology in 1995 oak ridge national laboratory conducted a technology demonstration isotron® is developing this technology46 slurry wall monitoring germanyin germany a new geoelectrical technology is being tested for locating heterogeneities andor leakage zones in slurry walls this technology involves the placement of vertical chains within the slurry wall during construction to identify regions of high permeability within the wall deciding where to position individual electrodes vertically and horizontally is based on sitespecific considerations each electrode can measure electrical potential and introduce electrical current advantages high spatial resolution applicable to all kinds of waste no system of this kind currently exists disadvantages must be installed during construction of slurry wall state of the technology in november 1996 electrodes were installed successfully in a slurry wall near mannheimsandhofen germany the monitoring system was installed to a depth of 22 m in july 1998 a hole was drilled in a slurry wall and investigators are in the process of using tracer tests and geoelectrical measurements to locate the hole heike bradl personal communication an offer is being prepared to encapsulate a waste site in vienna austria cost the cost of the geoelectrical system is about 5 of the total cost of the slurry wall heike bradl personal

fuebilbergtonlinede47 monitoring of slurry walls in the united kingdom barrier wall technology is widely accepted in the united kingdom uk and europe cementbentonite walls are the most common types of containment barrier used in the uk according to stephan jefferis there is an assumption that if the wall is constructed or installed as specified it should work thus monitoring is not a primary concern to industry or the regulatory agencies in the uk personal communication the typical method the uk uses for longterm monitoring consists of sampling the slurry and then allowing it to set this method is based on the assumption that the characteristics of the slurry are representative of the wall probes have also been inserted into the slurry wall for longterm monitoring this technique has been tested three times and in each case the technique was unsuccessful stephan jefferis personal communication cementbentonite is very brittle and tends to crack when probes are inserted since soil bentonite is less brittle probes containing this material might not damage the wall test boxes are another type of monitoring technique used occasionally in the uk this technology involves digging a trench the length of the wall and putting a loop in the wall the box is then placed along the line of the wall three or four test boxes have been used in the uk and all tests have been satisfactory stephan jefferis personal communication the first box installed was 2 m by 10 m and the second box was 6 m by 4 m the slurry wall forms one side of the box monitoring wells are placed around and inside the box the box traps the groundwater which can then be tested for contaminants because groundwater flow is slow it takes a long time three months to get enough water to run the tests single or multiple boxes could potentially be used for longterm monitoring in austria boxes were placed between a pair of thin walls forming a continuous row of boxes the main limitation of this technology is the expense the main question with slurry wall emplacement is whether the wall reached full base fully emplaced if problems are suspected good construction records should help identify potentially weak areas of the wall stephan jefferis personal communication the materials can be tested in the laboratory but when monitoring the performance and integrity of the wall it is important to test the entire wall there is a growing interest in the uk in standardizing remedial activities points of contact golder associates uk ltd stephan jefferis5470 moorbridge road maidenhead berkshire sl6 8bn

which is the ability of soil to receive grout depends on the permeability of the soil and the viscosity of the grout soils with permeabilities less then 10 6 cms are not amenable to grout and soils with permeabilities greater than 10 1 cms require suspension grouts or chemical grouts containing filler materials mutch et al 1997 gravels and sands tend to be groutable while soils containing more than 20 silt are not usually receptive to grout montan wax 1995 silts and clays are difficult or impossible to grout voss et al 1994 there is a relationship between viscosity and soil permeability
