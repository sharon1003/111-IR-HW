difference between weighted gpa and unweighted gpa• categorized under career  education  difference between weighted gpa and unweighted gpaweighted gpa vs unweighted gpawhen your professor or school talks about unweighted and weighted gpas what comes to your mind you may come to think that it’s just your ordinary grade average but unfortunately there are some important differences to take note of when describing either knowing such gives you an idea of your school standing or how well you perform academically gpa is your grade point average which averages all of the student’s grades in a particular term or semester gpas now come in two primary forms the weighted and unweighted gpa so how do these two gpas differ from each other first weighted gpas are used for weighted classes these classes are the honortype higherlevel classes also assumed to be more difficult having bigger worth than your regular class subjects unweighted classes although the weighted classes vary from one school to another the common denominator is that these classes give the learner a better potential for getting a higher mark honors english and advanced trigonometry are two common weighted subjects in many institutions the reason why students take these classes is because they need the higher marks to boost their overall gpa because it is a good indicator of your class rank as it shows one’s rigor and thoroughness in selecting certain courses if you take more honors or advanced classes you’ll appear to be at a higher rank than those taking all regular course loads however one shouldn’t be complacent when receiving average marks in a weighted class let’s say a “b” thinking that it is still a big mark ie equal to “b” when compared side by side to its unweighted counterpart the weighted gpa although not implemented in all schools is also based on a weighted scale which may not be the same in all institutions commonly the “a” mark for weighted courses has been allotted 5 points which is 1 point higher compared to the regular “a” for unweighted courses “b” is given 4 points while “c” and “d” are equal to 3 and 2 points respectively the teacher can also bump the grade of the student by adding a plus   or  each of these minor steps is approximately 13 of a point or 033 the same is true with minus  on the other hand unweighted gpas are used by institutions to compare one student to another it is a better barometer in gauging your real school performance than weighted gpas because an “a” mark is really an “a” for unweighted scoring school administrators don’t put a high priority on the weighted gpas which are more often than not artificially padded or inflated it is said that the ordinary unweighted highest gpa score attainable is only 40 because the highest grade for a subject can only reach 40 max or an “a” that’s equivalent to a 40 summary1 unweighted gpa is a traditional grading scale that makes use of 40 as the highest possible grade per subject 2 weighted gpa is said to have a maximum grade of 587 while unweighted gpa has a maximum average mark of 40 flat 3 the south carolina department of education implemented the use of weighted gpa for weighted courses 4 unweighted gpa reflects one’s actual school performance while a weighted gpa reflects one’s rigor in taking more challenging courses search difference betweennet  custom search help us improve rate this postemail this post  if you like this article or our site please spread the word share it with your friendsfamily difference between gpa and weighted gpadifference between cumulative gpa and overall gpadifference between gpa hours and earned hours difference between honors and apdifference between middle school and junior high difference between average and weighted average difference between vs1 and vs2cite julita difference between weighted gpa and unweighted gpa difference betweennet october 9 2011  httpwwwdifferencebetweennetmiscellaneouscareereducationdifferencebetweenweightedgpaandunweightedgpa
