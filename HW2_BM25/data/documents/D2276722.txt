are actually quite a few considerations to keep in mind before making a choice perhaps the single most important factor is the suppression rating which indicates how much power the device protects your electronics from you should also look at other considerations like the number of outlets cord length and other connections for devices or cables the surge protector can help defend noise filtering clamping voltage and additional safety features are all important in protecting your system more completely to prevent damage to your computer or other electronics suppression rating arguably the single most important consideration when looking at a surge protector is its suppression rating which indicates how much power it can protect your system from in case of a surge this rating is expressed in joules a unit for measuring energy with higher values indicating greater protection at the very minimum you should look for a model with a rating of at least about 1000 joules or just a bit over it 2000 to 3000 joules is definitely preferable and if you are really concerned about surges through your power lines then look for a model with a rating over 3000 or even 4000 joules number of outlets while power suppression is incredibly important all the protection possible is meaningless if you do not have enough outlets for all of your devices the best way to determine how many outlets you need is to look at the devices you plan on plugging into the surge protector at that outlet from there you can choose a model with one or two more available outlets this gives you enough connections for all of your devices plus some options for expanding your system or plugging in temporary devices if you’re not sure how many devices you’ll have plugged in together then go for a surge protector with at least seven or eight outlets although a dozen or more is definitely a better choice also be sure to pick a model with at least one preferably two or three outlets specifically for larger plugs this helps you avoid using up two outlets for a single device cord length this may not be a major issue but it’s definitely worth considering the length of the cord on your surge protector can help eliminate excess clutter or make it easier to set up your entire system if all of your devices are close to a wall outlet a shorter cord minimizes the extra cable you have between the wall and your surge protector conversely look for a model with at least six feet of cable if you have a setup where extra reach is necessary this ultimately comes down to your set up so choose the protector with the right cord length for your arrangement additional connections your first priority when choosing a surge protector may be available electrical outlets but you should consider other connections too if your protector will be near a cable modem or other cable cord you will be using then look for a surge protector that includes a cable connection this lets you run your cable signal through the protector protecting your devices from surges that can come in along that line similarly if you have a phone line near the area choose a surge protector that has in and out phone connections so you can protect your telephone equipment other connections like ethernet ports are also beneficial to protect your entire network from potential surges emirfi noise filtering power surges may be your primary concern when choosing a surge protector but many models also include filtering to reduce electromagnetic noise through your system this is especially beneficial if you run networking cables through your surge protector since noise elimination can help improve a networking signals fidelity and clarity look for noise filtering of at least up to 50d b though 75d b is better and helps keep signals clear of a lot of noise clamping voltage the clamping voltage of a surge protector indicates at what point it will divert power away from your devices and protect them from a surge fluctuations of voltage through power cables and from outlets is not uncommon so surge protectors do not immediately go into action at any increase instead there is a value known as the clamping voltage and whenever voltage goes above this level the surge protector steps in to keep your devices safe there are three common voltages 330 v 400 v and 500 v lower values are better since you don’t want a surge protector to ignore too much so 330 v is really ideal but 400 v is also acceptable avoid any surge protectors with a clamping voltage of 500 v safety features detachable cables are a great safety feature you should look for when picking a surge protector this lets you more easily store a protector when not in use and also prevents tripping over cables you should also look for a surge protector that includes outlet covers either ones that slide into place or removable ones by covering unused outlets it reduces the likelihood of accidental insertions from say a curious youngster holding a metal fork such features are really ideal in a household with small children but even in a professional setting they can be valuable manufacturers and warranty as you consider different surge protectors look for well known manufacturers that deliver quality products that are reliable over longterm use companies like belkin cyber power and tripp lite all produce excellent surge protectors that live up to the specifications indicated on the models they make fellowes and apc are also good companies that make a wide range of different surge protectors look for a surge protector with at least a fiveyear warranty though you can find many models with lifetime warranties one thing to keep in mind however is that surge protectors can only handle a certain number of surges after which they function as a power strip but no longer offer protection models with indicator lights let you know if you need to replace it or if it is still working properly by greg wiesen
