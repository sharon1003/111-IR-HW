as his bride for he is not a very young man and is made the kings heir the twelve princesses are put under a curse for as many nights as they danced with the princes background  editthe brothers grimm learned the tale from their friends the haxthausens who had heard the tale in münster other versions were known in hesse and paderborn in the hesse version only one princess is believed to be responsible for wearing out a dozen shoes every night until a young shoemakers apprentice discovers that she is joined by eleven other princesses in the revels the spell is broken and the apprentice marries the princess in the paderborn version it is three princesses who dance nightly this version introduces the ruse of the soldier disposing of the drugged wine and pretending to be asleep 2victorian editors disliked the do or die aspect imposed upon those willing to discover the princesses whereabouts and found ways to avoid it the candidates who failed simply vanished without explanation instead of being sent to their deaths andrew lang s version has the questing princes vanish and it is revealed they have been enchanted and trapped in the underground world the hero of langs version is a cowherd named michael who marries the youngest princess lina not the eldest her sisters each marry one of the contestants once they are freed from the enchantment the garden of trees with gold silver and diamond leaves recalls a similar garden in the sumerian epic of gilgamesh 2strangely enough the princesses in the grimms version are often portrayed as somewhat malicious characters showing no remorse for lying to their father and repeatedly giving their suitors drugged wine to ensure that their mystery remains unsolved despite knowing that those who fail are put to death in some versions of the story variants  editthe tale is not likely to be earlier than the 17th century and many variants are known from different countries 3russia – the danced out shoes from
