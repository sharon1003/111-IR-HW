i would like to point out that there are two types of merchandising visual and product visual merchandisers most often work with window and indoor displays of the store on the other hand a product merchandiser is the person in a fashion company who works directly with retailers regarding store inventory and presentation of the products each company has slightly different duties for this position depending on whether a brand manages its supply for its store locations or if they purchase items from wholesalers if a merchandiser works for a brand like brooks brothers they will communicate with the design and product development teams what they want to see in stores next season based upon sales reports and trend forecasting usually once samples of the items meet the standard they go into mass production and the merchandising team creates a story based on these items which is another term for a presentation to draw customers attention to products in the store j crew does an excellent job of this type of presentation on the other hand if a merchandiser works for a company that does not have its own designs they would work directly with buyers to communicate the same idea i hope this information has helped you tremendously
