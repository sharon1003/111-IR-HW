appendices an appendix or appendices if you have more than one is used to include additional material that is not integral to the body of the disquisition although an appendix contains supplementary material and must be numbered differently from the normal chapters it should be considered similar to the chapters of the disquisition an appendix or appendices is an optional section and is not required citations – if you use or reference material that is not your own use scholarly citation practices that are consistent with the rest of the disquisition and with the style manual of your discipline for more information see referencesworks cited and style manuals font and margins – the font of the paragraph text in the appendix must be the same size and type as the rest of your disquisition the margins must also be the same size as the rest of your disquisition headings – headings in the appendices must use the same formatting style and size as the equivalent headings in the disquisition chapters if headings are numbered in the disquisition chapters then appendix headings must be numbered as well where the letter of the appendix is used instead of the chapter number like b1 for the first firstlevel subheading in the second appendix major headings for each appendix  the first page of each appendix must include the major heading “appendix” and be formatted like other major headings in the disquisition if you have one appendix do not number or letter the appendix if you have multiple appendices each appendix must be labeled with a capital letter see section below about multiple appendices subheadings – subheadings in the appendices must share the same formatting as equivalent subheadings in the disquisition chapters including numbering font size and additional formatting if you use numbered headings in the disquisition then use the letter of the appendix in place of the chapter number for example the first firstlevel subheading in appendix b would be numbered as b1 entries in the table of contents – each appendix must be included in the table of contents as a major heading just like the disquisition chapters if you include chapter subheadings in the table of contents then you must also include the subheadings that appear in the appendices do not identify your appendices in a list that is separate from the table of contents page numbers – page numbers must be consistent with the rest of the disquisition this is considered part of the body of your disquisition and must use arabic numbers 1 2 3 and so on page numbers should be continuous from the preceding chapters do not restart page numbers at the beginning of each appendix spacing – the line spacing and indentation of paragraphs must be consistent with the rest of the disquisition if you have one appendix the appendix must be labeled – the major heading on the first page of the appendix can consist of simply “appendix” or can have an additional title like “appendix supplementary tables” do not include an additional letter for the appendix like “appendix a” – that method is for multiple appendices as mentioned in the next subsection tables figures nontext items – if you include multiple nontext item in the appendix the number of each item must begin with “a” to indicate that it is an appendix item do not continue item numbering from the chapters see the section below you must also include a list of appendix tables figures schemes etc for more information about nontext items in the appendix see the related section below if you have multiple appendices each appendix must be labeled with a capital letter – if you have more than one appendix each appendix must use a different letter in the title “appendix a” “appendix b” and so on if each appendix contains only one type of item such as research compliance forms then you may include that information in the major heading for that appendix like “appendix a research compliance forms” note when you have multiple appendices highly consider adding a title to each appendix that describes the content of that appendix then the corresponding entries in the table of contents provide more information to your reader about your appendix material for more information about labeling and titling multiple appendices refer to the style guide of your discipline tables figures nontext items – if you include multiple nontext item in an appendix the number of each item must begin with the letter of the appendix to indicate which appendix it appears in do not continue item numbering from the chapters see the related section below you must also include a list of appendix tables figures schemes etc for more information about nontext items in the appendix see the related section below tables figures schemes and nontext items in appendix material numbering – nontext items that appear in an appendix must include the letter “a” in the number or if you have multiple appendices use the letter of the appendix in which the item appears numbering must also start from the beginning of each appendix and not be continued from the chapters for example the first table in the first or only appendix would be entitled “table a1” the first table in the second appendix would be labeled as “table b1” and so on for more information about numbering nontext items in appendices see list of appendix tables figures schemes etc appendix contains a single nontext item – if a particular appendix consists of only a single nontext item then you can integrate the title of the item into the major heading for that appendix and the item does not require an additional item title if the style manual of your discipline allows for example if appendix b consists of a single table about crop blight then the appendix heading would read as “appendix b frequency of crop blight in north dakota fields” if an appendix consists of a single nontext item and the item title is integrated into the title of the appendix then the item should not be included in the appropriate list of appendix items list of appendix tables figures schemes etc – if you include tables figures schemes or other nontext items in an appendix or appendices then you must include a list of appendix tables figures schemes etc in the prefatory material after the normal list of tables list of figures list of schemes etc these lists of appendix items must contain information only about the nontext items that appear in the appendices for more information about how to organize the prefatory material see required order of elementsback to format guidelines
