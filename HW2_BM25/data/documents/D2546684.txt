what is parylene parylene is a conformal protective polymer coating material utilized to uniformly protect any component configuration on such diverse substrates as metal glass paper resin plastic ceramic ferrite and silicon because of its unique properties parylene conforms to virtually any shape including sharp edges crevices points or flat and exposed internal surfaces vacuum deposition the parylene is applied at the molecular level by a vacuum deposition process at ambient temperature film coatings from 100 to 76 microns can be easily applied in a single operation no catalysts or solvents are required and no foreign substances are introduced that could degrade the coated surface temperature independent properties parylene exhibits excellent dielectric strength exceptionally high surface and volume resistivities and electrical properties that are essentially independent of temperature it provides a conformal pinholefree coating that is unexcelled for corrosion resistance and dielectric protection parylene deposition parylene is applied at room temperature with specialized vacuum deposition equipment that permits control of coating rate and thickness the deposition process takes place at the molecular level as the chemical in dimer form is converted under vacuum and heat to dimeric gas pyrolized to cleave the dimer and finally deposited as a clear polymer film the material is applied at 0002in per hr coating thicknesses from 100 to 76 microns can be applied in a single operation typical coating thickness for circuit boards is 001in parylene dimer types parylene dimer is produced in three variations each suited to the requirements of a category of applications parylene c the most widely used dimer providing a useful combination of properties plus a very low permeability to moisture chemicals and other corrosive gases parylene n provides high dielectric strength and a dielectric constant that does not vary with changes in frequency best selection where greater coating protection is required parylene d maintains its physical strength and electrical properties at higher temperatures
