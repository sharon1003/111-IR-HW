headlines southern experience13 southern sayings the rest of america wont understand may 19 2014language discrepancies naturally arise in different geographic regions like the raging pop vs soda debate but the south undoubtedly takes the cake conversations south of the masondixon line will befuddle anyone not born there we chose 13 of the most ridiculous southern sayings — and tried to explain them1 “we’re living in high cotton”cotton has long been a key crop to the south’s economy so every harvest farmers pray for tall bushes loaded with white fluffy balls in their fields tall cotton bushes are easier to pick and yield higher returns if you’re living “in high cotton” it means you’re feeling particularly successful or wealthy2 “she was madder than a wet hen”hens sometimes enter a phase of “broodiness” — they’ll stop at nothing to incubate their eggs and get agitated when farmers try to collect them farmers used to dunk hens in cold water to “break” their broodiness you don’t want to be around a hormonal hen after she’s had an ice bath3 “he could eat corn through a picket fence”this describes someone with an unfortunate set of buck teeth they tend to stick up and outward like a horse’s teeth imagine a horse eating a carrot and you’ll get the picture4 “you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear”a pig’s ear may look soft pink and shiny but you’re not fooling anyone by calling it your new marc jacobs bag a southerner might say this about her redneck cousin who likes to decorate his house with deer antlers5 “you look rode hard and put up wet”no this isn’t southern sexual innuendo the phrase refers to a key step in horse grooming — when a horse runs fast it works up a sweat especially under the saddle a good rider knows to walk the horse around so it can dry off before going back to the stable a horse will look sick and tired if you forget this step much like a person who misses sleep or drinks too much6 “he’s as drunk as cooter brown”cooter brown is an infamous character in southern lore legend tells that he lived on the masondixon line — the border between the north and south — during the civil war to avoid the draft on either side cooter decided to stay drunk throughout the entire war making him ineligible for battle inebriated southerners have measured their drunkenness by him ever since7 “she’s as happy as a dead pig in the sunshine”when a pig dies presumably in a sty outside the sun dries out its skin this effect pulls the pig’s lips back to reveal a toothy “grin” making it look happy even though it’s dead this phrase describes a person who’s blissfully ignorant of reality8 “she’s got more nerve than carter’s got liver pills”carters products started as a pillpeddling company in the latter part of the 19th century specifically carters repped its “little liver pills” so hard a southern saying spawned from the omnipresent advertisements alas the federal trade commission forced the druggroup to drop the “liver” portion of the ad claiming it was deceptive carter’s “little liver pills” became carter’s “little pills” in 1951 but the south doesn’t really pay attention to history the phrase stuck9 “i’m finer than frog hair split four ways”southerners mostly use this phrase to answer “how are you” even those below the masondixon know frogs don’t have hair and the irony means to highlight just how dandy you feel the phrase reportedly originated in c davis’ “diary of 1865”10 “he thinks the sun comes up just to hear him crow”on farms not just in the south roosters usually crow when the sun rises their vociferous habit wakes up the house signaling time to work an extremely cocky rooster might think the sun rises simply because he crows similarly an extremely cocky man might think the same when he speaks — and also that everyone should listen to him11 “that’s about as useful as tits on a bull”only female dairy cows produce milk male cows are called bulls and even if you could “milk anything with nipples” bulls tend to be rather ornery good luck with that12 “that thing is all catawampus”catawampus adj askew awry catercornered lexicographers don’t really know how it evolved though they speculate it’s a colloquial perversion of “catercorner” variations include catawampous cattywampus catty wonkus the south isn’t really big on details13 “he’s got enough money to burn a wet mule”in 1929 thengovernor of louisiana huey long nicknamed “the kingfish” tried to enact a fivecent tax on each barrel of refined oil to fund welfare programs naturally standard oil threw a hissy fit and tried to impeach him on some fairly erroneous charges including attending a drunken party with a stripper but long a good ole’ boy fought back he reportedly said the company had offered legislators as much as 25000 for their votes to kick him out of office — what he called “enough money to burn a wet mule”we northerners may not know what that means but at least we know where it comes from bonus bless your heart almost everyone knows southern women drop this phrase constantly but it might not mean what you think it means in reality the phrase has little to do with religion and more to do with a passiveaggressive way to call you an idiot depending on your inflection saying “bless your heart” can sting worse than any insult content courtesy of business insider read more here tags carter
