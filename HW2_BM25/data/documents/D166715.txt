if i get hit in the eye how do i know when its an emergency by tyeese gaines reid d oresident physiciandepartment of emergency medicineyale universityaug 24 2009email question if i get hit in the eye how do i know when its an emergency answer if you get hit in the eye the first thing you should do is go look at your eye in the mirror if where the eyes normally white you see blood or if your eye is so swollen shut that you actually cant see the eyeball  those are two reasons why you should actually go to the emergency room if your visions blurry in the injured eye or if you have a lot of pain when you move that eye around those are other reasons that you should get your eye checked out if you actually have a black eye its probably okay but it could be a sign that there are broken bones underneath so you should probably get that checked out as well whatever you do do not put pressure directly on the eye if youre going to put a patch or bandage over it because that can actually make the injury worse comments add interests customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you to save your interests across all devices log in or sign up Â»
