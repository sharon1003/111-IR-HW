answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top what is the effect of extracellular potassium concentration on heart rate and conduction velocityup vote6down votefavorite1if the extracellular potassium concentration surrounding a myocyte increases then the potassium gradient accross the cell membrane decreases and therefore the resting membrane potential will become more positive similarly if extracellular potassium decreases the resting membrane potential will be more negative with this in mind how does the heart rate change when extracellular potassium concentration

vote2down voteaccepted pathological potassium concentration promotes arrhythmia increased extracellular potassium inactivates channels and opens channels causing the cells to become refractory 1 increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium this depolarization opens some voltagegated sodium channels but also increases the inactivation at the same time since depolarization due to concentration change is slow it never generates an action potential by itself instead it results in accommodation above a certain level of potassium the depolarization inactivates sodium channels opens potassium channels thus the cells become refractory this leads to the impairment of neuromuscular cardiac and gastrointestinal organ systems of most concern is the impairment of cardiac conduction which can result in ventricular fibrillation or asystole decreased extracellular potassium leads to hyperpolarization 2 lower potassium levels in the extracellular space will cause hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential as a result a greater than normal stimulus is required for depolarization of the membrane in order to initiate an action potential in the heart hypokalemia causes hyperpolarization in the myocytes resting membrane potential the more negative membrane potentials in the atrium may cause arrhythmias because of more complete recovery from sodiumchannel inactivation making the triggering of an action potential less likely in addition the reduced extracellular potassium paradoxically inhibits the activity of the potassium current and delays ventricular repolarization this delayed repolarization may promote reentrant arrhythmias
