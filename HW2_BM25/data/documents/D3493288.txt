maybe later sort somatic motor pathways participate in control of movement by providing input to lower motor neurons neurons in 4 distinct but highly interactive neural circuits lower motor neuron lmns cell bodies in the brain stem and spinal cord from the brain stem axons of lmns extend through cranial nerves to innervate skeletal muscles of the face and head from the spinal cord axons of lmns extend through spinal nerves to innervate skeletal muscles of the limbs and trunk only the lmns provide output to skeletal muscles fibers aka final common pathways local circuit neurons input arrives at lmns from nearby interneurons called local circuit neurons located close to lmn cell bodies in the brain stem or spinal cord local circuit neurons receive input from somatic sensory receptors nociceptorsmuscle spindles and higher centers of the brain help coordinate rhythmic activity in specific muscle groups flexion and extension of lower limbs while walkingupper motor neurons both local circuit neurons and lmns receive input from the umns most umns synapse w local circuit neurons which in turn synapse w lmns some synapse directly w lmns umns originate in motor centers of the brain stem red nucleus vestibular nucleus superior colliculus and reticular formation umns from the cerebral cortex are essential for the execution of voluntary movements umns from the brain stem regulate muscle tone control postural muscles and help maintain balance and orientation of the head and body basal nuclei and cerebellum exert influence on umns basal nuclei neurons basal nuclei neurons assist movement by providing input to umns neural circuits interconnect the basal nuclei with motor areas of the cerebral cortex thalamus and the brain stem these neural circuits help initiate and terminate movements suppress unwanted movements and establish normal level of muscle tone cerebellar neurons aid movement by controlling the activity of umns neural circuits interconnect the cerebellum with motor areas of the cerebral cortex thalamus and the brain stem major function of the cerebellum is to monitor differences between intended movements and and movements actually performed then it issues commands to umns to reduce errors in movement and helps maintain normal posture and balance major somatic tracts and pathways direct motor pathways provide input to lmns via axons that extend directly from cerebral cortex nerve impulses for voluntary movements pyramidal pathways consists of axons that descend from pyramidal cells umns w pyramidalshaped cell bodies indirect motor pathwaysextrapyramidal pathways provide input to lmns form motor centers in the basal nuclei cerebellum cerebral cortex all somatic motor tracts except the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts direct pyramidal pathways lateral corticospinal tract anterior corticospinal tract corticobulbar tract lateral corticospinal tract motor cortex to skeletal muscles on opposite side of body for precise voluntary movements of distal parts of limbs axons of umns descend from precentral gyrus of cortex in medulla here 90 decussate and then enter contralateral side of spinal cord to form this tract at the level of termination umns end in anterior gray horn on same side they provide input to lmns which innervate skeletal muscles anterior corticospinal tract motor cortex to skeletal muscles on opposite side of body for movements of the trunk and proximal parts of limbs axons of umns descend from cortex into medulla here the 10 that does not decussate enter spinal cord and from this tract at their level of termination umns decussate and end in anterior gray horn on opposite side of body they provide input to lmns which innervate skeletal muscles corticobulbar tract motor cortex to skeletal muscles of head and neck to coordinate precise voluntary movements axons of umns descend from cortex into brain stem where some decussate and others do not they provide input to lmns in nuclei of cranial nerves iii iv v vi vii ix x xi and xii which control voluntary movements of eyes tongue neck chewing facial expression and speech indirect extrapyramidal pathways rubrospinal red nucleus cerebral cortex and cerebellum  contralateral skeletal muscles that govern precise voluntary movements of distal parts of upper limbs tectospinal superior colliculus  contralateral skeletal muscles that reflexively move head eyes and trunk in response to visual or auditory stimuli vestibulospinal vestibular nucleus head movements from inner ear  to ipsilateral skeletal muscles of trunk and proximal parts of limbs for maintaining posture and balance in response to head movements medial and lateral reticulospinal reticular formation  to ipsilateral skeletal muscles of trunk and proximal parts of limbs for maintaining posture and regulating muscle tone in response to ongoing body movements
