about your itchy scalp and thinning hair to combat the itches i recommend trying a product called top brass i suffer from an itchy scalp as well and it does wonders for me something else you should get into is tea tree oil its a natural essential oil that you can add to a few drops of a carrier oil like olive sunflower etc anything you like really and it works wonders on dry flaky scalps dandruff and psoriasis a great bonus is that you can also dot tea tree oil on acne and it dries it right out in a day or two re the thinning of your hair first you need to figure out if your hair is breaking or if its falling out from the root before you can move forward and decide what kind of treatment you should get the next time you comb your hair take a few strands out of the comb and look at the ends of each if you see a small white bulb at the end that means its falling out from the root if theres no bulb that means your hair is breaking after you do that get back to me and we can figure out something to help your hair grow in some hair lossby anonymous q my hair is falling out from the root what should i do im considering going natural camilles answer if your hair is falling out from the root it sounds as though its severely damaged you can try to repair it by using an intensive treatment like aphogee protein conditioner however if youre really thinking about going natural you could just take the plunge and do a big chop cut everything off and either let your hair grow out like that or use braids for length until your own hair grows out hope this helps itchy thinning hairby glo hello im 44 and my hair is thinning my scalp is very dry it itches  flakes terribly especially around my hairline which is also falling out i dont see the white bulb on the longer strands that fall out i must wash it 23 times a week bc of dry itchy flakes if i use oils to my scalp it itches  flakes worse is there any hope for me i have always had fine thin hair ive used relaxers often in the past now i may use one 12 times a year now i wash  use coconut oil  wear naturally still has the same affect but can hide the thinning camilles answer hi glo have you tried using heavy duty scalp treatments instead of the everyday shampoos and conditioners using products with ingredients like tea tree oil can help a lot because that essential oil has antibacterial properties that can help your scalp heal also you can look for a two products called nizoral and top brass blue tube nizoral is an over the counter prescription strength antidandruff shampoo that controls the flaking scaling and itching associated with dandruff top brass is an excellent scalp dress for itching and flakes if that doesnt work after a few weeks you might have something a little more serious than just dry scalp or dandruff theres a condition called scalp psoriasis thats not dangerous or anything but it does lead to severely itching and flaking scalp help for a guy with a flaky scalpby anonymous hi im a caucasian 21 year old i have thin black hair my hair is thin but i have lots of hair im a guy and in the past year and a half i let my hair grow past shoulder length in the past 23 months my scalp has gotten very itchy and flaky around the hairline im also having a bit of hair loss in the area of my hairline causing it to not be straight and faulty in certain areas i can tell my hairline is moving backwards and when i pull the hair back and look at it i see the skin is dry it itches and then hurts a bit i shared a comb with a friend that has psoriasis and dandruff i know its not contagious but somehow thats when i started having these problems ive tried anti dandruff shampoo selson blue all i feel is burning on my scalp and i think it made things worse because after i use it my scalp burns what can i do camilles answer hi there i dont know what to tell you about the thinning of your hair because more than likely thats hereditary as for your scalp issues it sounds like your scalp is pretty sensitive to the medications in the selsun blue id recommend that you get your hands on some tea tree oil essential oil concentrate and add a few drops to a handful of regular shampoo every time you wash its a natural oil that has antibacterial properties i actually use it to control my itchyflaky scalp as well also just to be on the safe side id stay away from sharing combs with anyone and id also advise you to wash your own combs with hot water once a week until your scalp clears up all the besthair breaking when combingby anonymous please help me im becoming neurotic as my hair is breaking a lot when i comb its also very itchy and its longer at the front short at the back and sides i am considering shaving everything off but am too vain for that i have now resorted to wearing a cap can i weave my hair camilles answer hair breaks and falls out for one of three reasons 1 its weakdamaged 2 its dry 3 a combination of the two to fix your hair you need to figure out which one of these is your problemwhat the root cause of that problem is then address it with the right solution for example if your hair is over processed with relaxers and thats causing the breakage you could do the following things  stretch your relaxers out more to lessen the chance of over processing  use a gentler formulation so the processing goes slower lessening the risk of over processing  condition your hair with protein and moisture before and after your relaxer and regularly in between to keep up the strength of your hair even if you dont completely cut your hair off it sounds like youre going to have to get a major trim to get your hair back on track trying to salvage split broken off uneven hair is like fighting an uphill battle you just wont win see a stylist you trust and get a deep trim and start keeping your hair healthy from there try adding a few drops of tea tree oil to your regular shampoo and also get yourself a tube of top brass hairdress for your itchy scalp the worse things you could do is get a weave all that will do is make you look good but it will do nothing for the health and well being of your hair its best to suck it up visit a stylist you can trust and get your hair cut into a style that you can live with while your hair grows back out healthy itchy scalp and hair breakageby anonymous could you please point me in the right direction of a doctor who specializes in itchy scalp and hair breakageloss ive tried all kinds of shampoos and different relaxers even hair oil hair cuts and root stimulators but all in vain i dont know if this has to do with getting adapted with using american products and water but they cause my hair and scalp to itch so bad once i start scratching my scalp it feels so good that i cant stop myself dut to the itching ive lost a lot of hair especially at the top center of my head in some places its longer than other places and ive cut it even many times but still in some places it doesnt grow back one can hardly hold it when braiding and a day after braiding it the itching is so severe when i relax it it still doesnt grow back at the center of my head im 39 years old and used to have long healthy relaxed hair before i came to america 8 years ago from south africa now when i braid its even worse with the itching which i never used to experience when i was in africa i will pay any amount to have my hair healthy and long again if you could help me thank you camilles answer i am really sorry to hear about your dilemma it does sound like you need to seek the advice of a hair and scalp specialist please let me know where you are so i can locate a few doctors you can call and inquire about until then i want to offer a bit of advice if i were you i would do these two very important things 1 stop relaxing your hair until you control what is going on with your scalp and stop the breakage in your hair relaxers only sever to aggravate your scalp further it is a harsh chemical and if its something that might clear up if you stop relaxing you need to let it take its course 2 if you think that hard water is an issue go to a hardware store and get yourself a shower head with a filter on it water softener they dont cost much and they will take all of the skin and hair drying minerals out of the water please let me know your area asap so i can help you find a good doctor natural girl with scalp fungusby betty boo i recently went to the doctor cause my hair became very dry and brittle and it was shedding really bad the doctor diagnosed me with a scalp fungus which she prescribed an anti biotic and nizoral 2 my hair is looking a lot better but the middle head the hair broke off really bad i alternate between the nizoral and my concoction that i made which is 14 baby shampoo mix with 5 drops of tea tree oil14 olive oil14 distilled water my question is as an african american woman what oil can i use in my hair that will not aggravate my scalp the doctor told me that i couldnt use any type of oil cause that will only worsen the fungusbut im sure i can use some type of natural oil please help thank you in advance camilles answer hi betty boo if i were you i would listen to your doctor heshe would know whats best for the condition having said that if youre stick dead set on using an oil i would use a natural oil and not a hair grease this means oils like 1 jojoba oil 2 castor oil 3 coconut oil 4 grapeseed oil even vitamin e oil is good because it mimics the natural oils in our skin called sebum you could add a few drops of tea tree oil one of these oils and use it sparingly on your scalp once again though if your doctor says no oils i would do no oils until they said it was ok good luckitchy scalp thinning breakage and uneven hairby hopeless i am having many of the issues mentioned already i recently moved from northern california to chicago which is when i began having these issues my hair is very uneven longer in some areas my scalp is very itchy especially in the center and flaky it is thinning falling out from the root and breaking off tea tree oil was recommended before and i have been using it but its not the concentrated oil that you talked about where can i find that i would greatly appreciate any advice you may have for me camilles answer heres where you can find high quality tea tree oil keep in mind that this oil is very concentrated and should be put into some sort of carrier before you use it on your scalp or skin put a few drops in your shampoo and scalp essential oils before you apply it do you relax your hair a lot of the time that is a factor in hair and scalp issues if you do it might be good for you to give the chemicals a break and concentrate on getting your hair and scalp back to heath with regular washing and conditioning treatments if your hair is uneven and breaking the best thing you can do for it is to get a deep trim and cut off all the scraggly split ends yes your hair will be a lot shorter but it will look a million times better and also set the stage for healthier hair growth also make sure you are washing all the conditioner out of your hair after you wash because sometimes that can irritate your scalp hair lossby ihi i have a good length of hair but recently a lot has been coming out from the roots when i comb it which has made it very thin please help
