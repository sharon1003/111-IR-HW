science  mathematics physics how can i prevent an egg from breaking when dropped in my science class we are creating an egg house that will protect the egg from breaking when dropped from an awning we have to use popsicle sticks the cushioning for the inside is what i need help figuring out we are also allowed to place a parachute on it please help best suggestion wins the question show more follow 22 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer well i did this in fifth grade except i got a b cause mine made it to the last round then the 30ft drop broke it i used some panties in a shoe box the panties are tied in an x shape the egg is placed in the middle and you could put cotton all around it use the popsicle sticks to hold up the panties or sumthin i didnt use popsicle sticks though sorry i know im not much help but i tried source smy memorywhich is very faint i kyle · 9 years ago1 1 comment there are a few things that can be done to help keep it from breaking depending on what you can and cant use if you want more detail email me first use a parachute use a flexible material like a force flex trash bag make sure you have a hole in the top to all some air to escape make a 7 point connection from the chute to the box the idea here is to slow the fall not stop it second build the cell for the egg without a top build the base a simple box with small gaps in the floor of the cell make sure the bottom of the cell that is going to hit the ground is level next build the four corners coming out of the base build a box around the top of the corners to add some stability third using cotton balls pad the bottom of the cell that will hit the ground a ball at each corner and in the middle between the corners on the inside use about one inch of cotton to absorb the impact remember keep it light make sure the impact is square to deflect the forceglacier72 · 9 years ago1 0 comment the shell of a raw egg will break when there is sufficient local force aimed against the shell that force will come from the impact of the popsicle package with whatever is below the awning the speed upon impact and without a parachute will be about v  sqrt 2g h where h is the height of the release point from the awning thus from the impulse equation the force on impact is f  vdt where dt is the length of time the egg takes to go from v to zero velocity and there is your solutionyou must make dt as long as you can to reduce f on the egg this by the way is the principle of air bags in cars they cause the dt as you lurch forward to be larger than if you smash directly into the console you clearly cant pack air bags inside the popsicle casing but you can put a nerf ball or similar soft ball inside the package you build they are soft and will absorb the impact and cause the velocity change of the enclosed egg to be transmitted over a longer dt and from f  vdt we know the longer dt will lower the force transmitted to the egg one other thingeggs are strongest when stood updown with the pointy ends vertical aligned with the fall so you want your raw egg placed updown in whatever package you create that way the force from the impact will be transmitted into one end or the other of the egg rather than into its side where it is weakest there is a major issue with the parachute drag which is the force that would slow the package down varies as the square of the velocity of the fall as the height h of the awning is probably not very high that velocity v is likely to be relatively slow which means your parachute will not create much drag and it will not slow the drop down muchif at all i say if at all because a parachute needs time to unfurl so it can catch the air as it falls its not clear the parchute will have sufficient time to do that if h is not very high that is your popsicle package may hit the deck before the parachute has a chance to workoldprof · 9 years ago2 0 comment the best way not to crack an egg is to not hit it anywhere while styrofoam padding and bubble wrap are good ways to reduce shock the egg is still hitting the sides of its container and therefore risks breaking try something that might suspend the egg so that it wont hit anything on the way down but is springy enough that itll absorb some of the shock of the crash then greatly pad around the suspended egg that way if its not perfect and the egg though slowed down still hits the sides of its container at least it will be padded to reduce the risk of breaking make sure to test your idea before bringing it to class hope that helps · 2 years ago0 0 commenti did this project like 5 times in my life n every single one was successful cuz i basicaly used the same strategy mmm well heres how i did it if uld like to copy me i seriously dont mind its not like im gna be sellin it in stores for a thousand bucks later on i basicaly used buble rap on the base like two of em facin each other n 2nd later was a rather thin layer of sponge u can say around 1 inch wide or a bit less n the 3rd and last layer was cotton almost same width as the spone n a bit on the sides of the basket or house wtv u wanna call it incase the egg ends up bumpin the sides after the drop then i pierced 8 wholes into the sides of the house n tied a big enough cloth parachute to it almost the size of like 3 quarters of an a4 paper n it should have a pretty smooth landing jus make sure that u drop it straight n ya i guarantee ya it wont break  worked with me 5 times source smy braini pete · 9 years ago0 0 comment i assume you mean you are only allowed to use popsicle sticks if that is the case are you allowed to break them because you could take a razorblade and get little shavings off a ton of popsicle sticks and make a little nest for the egg if you are allowed to use other materials try getting the bubble wrap with big bubbles and wrapping a ton of that around the egg crumpled up newspaper could also help and packing peanuts and a piece of that foam pad stuff that you put under sleeping bags just use a ton more padding than you think youll need peachy perfect · 9 years ago0 2 comment i did that for a problem solving class in eighth grade my group and i wrapped our egg in stretchy book covers we used three or four of them and our egg survived some other groups from our class tried floam that sticky stuff made from tiny styrofoam balls they found it at walmart their egg didnt do well with just floam but with something else around it it probably wouldve worked hope i helpediheartmusic · 9 years ago0 1 comment uuuu i did this project once for my preap class in 8th grade  what i did i got a cocacola bottle the 3 liter and filled it up with cotton  but with your situation  i think you should make like a box with the popsicle sticks and then fill the inside with a small cloth and then cotton so when it does impact to the floor it will bounce and not break   good luck   lol samo · 9 years ago0 1 comment this may be worthless but chop up the stick and paste it around the egg unboiled and that will make it softer more padding this might not have helped sorry if i didnt i am not a genious but good luck on your project jessid · 9 years ago1 1 commentwhat are popsickle sticks whateverjust place some straw or cotton or some soft material in the place where the egg is supposed to fall bigbang · 9 years ago0 0 comment1 2 3 next maybe you would
