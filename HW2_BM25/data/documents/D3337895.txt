getting tackled in the end zone for a safety in the first quarter and then committing a false start on 4thand2 just before half when the ravens were going to go for it but dixon looked like a different player after the break running with decisiveness and toughness his touchdown came on a wideopen eightyard pass into the right flat dixon appears to have seized control of this backfield
