we believe in the safety of pasteurization and thus pasteurize our milk at 146 deg for a long time to preserve the quality of milk taste our milk is cream line meaning it is not homogenized the cream rises to the top of each bottle just give it a good shake each time you pour for delicious tasting milk milk can be purchased at milky way farm in the farm market building it is for sale during

begin and continue to produce milk for a period of up to 1215 months production peaks about two months after the calving date some 60 to 90 days after calving the cow will be rebred for her next calf the gestation period for a cow is 9 months to maintain the yearly calving interval the cow milks for 7 12 months while she is pregnant with her next calf the newborn calf will weigh approximately 70100 pounds and can walk within an hour of birth what does a cow eat everyday cows require a balanced diet of fiber carbohydrates for energy protein vitamins and minerals half of a cow’s diet may consist of forages such as dry hay made from grasses and legumes and silages made from hay and corn a grain mixture made of ground corn soybean pellets vitamins and minerals provides the other half of a cow’s diet in the late spring summer and early fall grass pasture is a readily available forage cows have 1 stomach that is divided into 4 compartments the largest of which is the rumen the rumen allows the cow to regurgitate forage and rechew it cud for further digestion a cow may spend 8 hours a day consuming food and an additional 10 hours a day chewing her cud a mature cow may consume up to 25 gallons of water daily to allow her body to digest all this food how much milk does the average cow give daily we milk the cows robotically which allows a cow to choose how often typically three times a day she wishes to be milked the average cow produces approximately 54 lbs of milk per day about 7 gallons milk is produced within the udder of the cow in four large mammary glands to produce the 54 lbs of milk the cow’s body pumps over 20000 pounds of blood through blood vessels in the udder milking machines remove the milk from the cow’s teats by suction the milking machine transports milk through sanitized pipes to a filter and into a 1000 gallon refrigerated milk tank this arrangement ensures cleanliness and rapid cooling to preserve a fresh flavor for more information on robotic milking see the site for lely robotic milking machines is the milk processed at the farm yes as detailed above but most of our milk is hauled everyother day by a large tanker truck to a processing plant we sell our milk to land o’ lakes cooperative which sells tanker loads to a number of different processing plants at the processing plant milk is tested for cleanliness and pasteurized milk may
