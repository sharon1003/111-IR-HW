temporomandibular joint dysfunction synonyms temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome temporomandibular disorder others 1temporomandibular joint specialty oral medicine temporomandibular joint dysfunction  tmd tmjd is an umbrella term covering pain and dysfunction of the muscles of mastication the muscles that move the jaw and the temporomandibular joints the joints which connect the mandible to the skull  the most important feature is pain followed by restricted mandibular movement 2 and noises from the temporomandibular joints tmj during jaw movement although tmd is not lifethreatening it can be detrimental to quality of life 3 because the symptoms can become chronic and difficult to manage tmd is a symptom complex rather than a single condition and it is thought to be caused by multiple factors 4 5 however these factors are poorly understood 6 and there is disagreement as to their relative importance there are many treatments available 7 although there is a general lack of evidence for any treatment in tmd and no widely accepted treatment protocol common treatments include provision of occlusal splints psychosocial interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy and pain medication or others most sources agree that no irreversible treatment should be carried out for tmd 8about 20 to 30 of the adult population are affected to some degree 7 usually people affected by tmd are between 20 and 40 years of age 3 and it is more common in females than males 9 tmd is the second most frequent cause of orofacial pain after dental pain ie toothache

symptom complexes in chronic orofacial pain along with burning mouth syndrome atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia 12 tmd has been considered as a type of musculoskeletal 13neuromuscular 14 or rheumatological disorder 13 it has also been called a functional pain syndrome 6 and a psychogenic disorder 15 others consider tmd a central sensitivity syndrome in reference to evidence that tmd might be caused by a centrally mediated sensitivity to pain 16 it is hypothesized that there is a great deal of similarity between tmd and other pain syndromes like fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome interstitial cystitis headache chronic lower back pain and chronic neck pain these disorders have also been theorized to be caused by centrally mediated sensitivity to pain and furthermore they often occur together 16definitions and terminology  editfrequently tmd has been treated as a single syndrome but the prevailing modern view is that tmd is a cluster of related disorders with many common features 13 indeed some have suggested that in the future the term tmd may be discarded as the different causes are fully identified and separated into different conditions 15 sometimes temporomandibular joint dysfunction is described as the most common form of temporomandibular disorder 4 whereas many other sources use the term temporomandibular disorder synonymously or instead of the term temporomandibular joint dysfunction in turn the term temporomandibular disorder is described as a clinical term referring to musculoskeletal disorders affecting the temporomandibular joints and their associated musculature it is a collective term which represents a diverse group of pathologies involving the temporomandibular joint the muscles of mastication or both 2 another definition of temporomandibular disorders is a group of conditions with similar signs and symptoms that affect the temporomandibular joints the muscles of mastication or both 17 temporomandibular disorder is a term that creates confusion since it refers to a group of similarly symptomatic conditions whilst many sources use the term temporomandibular disorders as a vague description rather than a specific syndrome and refer to any condition which may affect the temporomandibular joints see table the temporomandibular joint is susceptible to a huge range of diseases some rarer than others and there is no implication that all of these will cause any symptoms or limitation in function at all the preferred terms in medical publications is to an extent influenced by geographic location eg in the united kingdom the term pain dysfunction syndrome is in common use and in other countries different terms are used 4 in the united states the term temporomandibular disorder is generally favored the american academy of orofacial pain uses temporomandibular disorder whilst the national institute of dental and craniofacial research uses temporomandibular joint disorder 18 a more complete list of synonyms for this topic is extensive with some being more commonly used than others in addition to those already mentioned examples include temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome temporomandibular joint syndrome temporomandibular dysfunction syndrome temporomandibular dysfunction temporomandibular disorder temporomandibular syndrome facial arthromyalgia myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome craniomandibular dysfunction cmd myofacial pain dysfunction masticatory myalgia mandibular dysfunction and costens syndrome the lack of standardization in terms is not restricted to medical papers notable internationally recognized sources vary in both their preferred term and their offered definition eg temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome – aching in the muscles of mastication sometimes with an occasional brief severe pain on chewing often associated with restricted jaw movement and clicking or popping sounds classification of chronic pain international association for the study of pain  19headache or facial pain attributed to temporomandibular joint disorder  international classification of headache disorders 2nd edition ichd2 international headache society  20temporomandibular jointpaindysfunction syndrome listed in turn under temporomandibular joint disorders  international classification of diseases 10th revision world health organization  21in this article the term temporomandibular disorder is taken to mean any disorder that affects the temporomandibular joint and temporomandibular joint dysfunction here also abbreviated to tmd is taken to mean symptomatic eg pain limitation of movement clicking dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint however there is no single globally accepted term or definition 18 concerning this topic by cause and symptoms  editit has been suggested that tmd may develop following physical trauma particularly whiplash injury although the evidence for this is not conclusive this type of tmd is sometimes termed posttraumatic tmd p tmd to distinguish it from tmd of unknown cause sometimes termed  idiopathic tmd i tmd 13 sometimes musclerelated myogenous tmd also termed myogenous tmd or tmd secondary to myofascial pain and dysfunction is distinguished from jointrelated tmd also termed arthogenous tmd or tmd secondary to true articular disease based upon whether the muscles of mastication or the tmjs themselves are predominantly involved this classification which effectively divides tmd into 2 syndromes is followed by the american academy of orofacial pain 18 however since most people with tmd could be placed into both of these groups which makes a single diagnosis difficult when this classification is used the research diagnostic criteria rdctmd allows for multiple diagnoses in an attempt to overcome the problems with other classifications rdctmd considers temporomandibular disorders in 2 axes axis i is the physical aspects and axis ii involves assessment of psychological status mandibular function and tmdrelated psychosocial disability 18 axis i is further divided into 3 general groups group i are muscle disorders group ii are disc displacements and group iii are joint disorders 10 although it is common for people with tmd to fit into more than one of these groups by duration  editsometimes distinction is made between acute tmd where symptoms last for less than 3 months and chronic tmd where symptoms last for more than 3 months 2 not much is known about acute tmd since these individuals do not typically attend in secondary care hospital 2signs and symptoms  editsigns and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder vary in their presentation the symptoms will usually involve more than one of the various components of the masticatory system muscles nerves tendons ligaments bones connective tissue or the teeth 22the three classically described cardinal signs and symptoms of tmd are 10 23pain and tenderness on palpation in the muscles of mastication or of the joint itself preauricular pain – pain felt just in front of the ear pain is the defining feature of tmd and is usually aggravated by manipulation or function 2 such as when chewing clenching 11 or yawning and is often worse upon waking the character of the pain is usually dull or aching poorly localized 6 and intermittent although it can sometimes be constant the pain is more usually unilateral located on one side rather than bilateral 19 it is rarely severe 24limited range of mandibular movement 2 which may cause difficulty eating or even talking there may be locking of the jaw or stiffness in the jaw muscles and the joints especially present upon waking 17 there may also be incoordination asymmetry or deviation of mandibular movement 2noises from the joint during mandibular movement which may be intermittent 4 joint noises may be described as clicking 2 popping 19 or crepitus grating 17other signs and symptoms have also been described although these are less common and less significant than the cardinal signs and symptoms listed above examples include headache possibly 4 eg pain in the occipital region the back of the head or the forehead 11 or other types of facial pain including migraine 22 tension headache 22 or myofascial pain 22pain elsewhere such as the teeth 11 or neck 9diminished auditory acuity hearing loss 22tinnitus occasionally 17dizziness 9sensation of malocclusion feeling that the teeth do not meet together properly 19causes  edittmd is a symptom complex ie a group of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a particular disease which is thought to be caused by multiple poorly understood factors 4 5 6 but the exact etiology is unknown 25 there are factors which appear to predispose to tmd genetic hormonal anatomical factors which may precipitate it trauma occlusal changes parafunction and also factors which may prolong it stress and again parafunction 17 overall two hypotheses have dominated research into the causes of tmd namely a psychosocial model and a theory of occlusal dysharmony 25 interest in occlusal factors as a causative factor in tmd was especially widespread in the past and the theory has since fallen out of favor and become controversial due to lack of evidence disc displacement  editin people with tmd it has been shown that the lower head of lateral pterygoid contracts during mouth closing when it should relax and is often tender to palpation to theorize upon this observation some have suggested that due to a tear in the back of the joint capsule the articular disc may be displaced forwards anterior disc displacement stopping the upper head of lateral pterygoid from acting to stabilize the disc as it would do normally as a biologic compensatory mechanism the lower head tries to fill this role hence the abnormal muscle activity during mouth closure there is some evidence that anterior disc displacement is present in proportion of tmd cases anterior disc displacement with reduction refers to abnormal forward movement of the disc during opening which reduces upon closing anterior disc displacement without reduction refers to an abnormal forward bunchedup position of the articular disc which does not reduce in this latter scenario the disc is not intermediary between the condyle and the articular fossa as it should be and hence the articular surfaces of the bones themselves are exposed to a greater degree of wear which may predispose to osteoarthritis in later life 5degenerative joint disease  editthe general term degenerative joint disease refers to arthritis both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis the term arthrosis may cause confusion since in the specialized tmd literature it means something slightly different from in the wider medical literature in medicine generally arthrosis can be a nonspecific term for a joint any disease of a joint or specifically degenerative joint disease and is also used as a synonym for osteoarthritis 26 in the specialized literature that has evolved around tmd research arthrosis is differentiated from arthritis by the presence of low and no inflammation respectively 6 both are however equally degenerative 6 the tmjs are sometimes described as one of the most used joints in the body over time either with normal use or with parafunctional use of the joint wear and degeneration can occur termed osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis an autoimmune joint disease can also affect the tmjs degenerative joint diseases may lead to defects in the shape of the tissues of the joint limitation of function eg restricted mandibular movements and joint pain 6psychosocial factors  editemotional stress anxiety depression anger may increase pain by causing autonomic visceral and skeletal activity and by reduced inhibition via the descending pathways of the limbic system the interactions of these biological systems have been described as a vicious anxietypaintension cycle which is thought to be frequently involved in tmd put simply stress and anxiety cause grinding of teeth and sustained muscular contraction in the face this produces pain which causes further anxiety which in turn causes prolonged muscular spasm at trigger points vasoconstriction ischemia and release of pain mediators the pain discourages use of the masticatory system a similar phenomenon in other chronic pain conditions is termed fear avoidance behavior which leads to reduced muscle flexibility tone strength and endurance this manifests as limited mouth opening and a sensation that the teeth are not fitting properly 12persons with tmd have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders than people without tmd 27 people with tmd have been shown to have higher levels of anxiety depression somatization and sleep deprivation and these could be considered important risk factors for the development of tmd 5 27 in the 6 months before the onset 50–70 of people with tmd report experiencing stressful life events eg involving work money health or relationship loss it has been postulated that such events induce anxiety and cause increased jaw muscle activity muscular hyperactivity has also been shown in people with tmd whilst taking examinations or watching horror films 5others argue that a link between muscular hyperactivity and tmd has not been convincingly demonstrated and that emotional distress may be more of a consequence of pain rather than a cause 25bruxism  editmain article bruxism bruxism is an oral parafunctional activity where there is excessive clenching and grinding of the teeth it can occur during sleep or whilst awake the cause of bruxism itself is not completely understood but psychosocial factors appear to be implicated in awake bruxism and dopaminergic dysfunction and other central nervous system mechanisms may be involved in sleep bruxism if tmd pain and limitation of mandibular movement are greatest upon waking and then slowly resolve throughout the day this may indicate sleep bruxism conversely awake bruxism tends to cause symptoms that slowly get worse throughout the day and there may be no pain at all upon waking the relationship of bruxism with tmd is debated many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in tmd 5 25 28 29 indeed the symptoms of tmd overlap with those of bruxism 30 others suggest that there is no strong association between tmd and bruxism 24 a systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when selfreported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism there is a positive association with tmd pain and when more strict diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used the association with tmd symptoms is much lower 31 selfreported bruxism is probably a poor method of identifying bruxism 29 there are also very many people who grind their teeth and who do not develop tmd 17 bruxism and other parafunctional activities may play a role in perpetuating symptoms in some cases 32other parafunctional habits such as pen chewing lip and cheek biting which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum or linea alba  are also suggested to contribute to the development of tmd 5 other parafunctional activities might include jaw thrusting excessive gum chewing nail biting and eating very hard foods trauma  edittrauma both micro and macrotrauma is sometimes identified as a possible cause of tmd however the evidence for this is not strong 24 prolonged mouth opening hyperextension is also suggested as a possible cause it is thought that this leads to microtrauma and subsequent muscular hyperactivity this may occur during dental treatment with oral intubation whilst under a general anesthetic during singing or wind instrument practice really these can be thought of as parafunctional activities 5 damage may be incurred during violent yawning laughing road traffic accidents sports injuries interpersonal violence or during dental treatment 24 such as tooth extraction  5it has been proposed that a link exists between whiplash injuries sudden neck hyperextension usually occurring in road traffic accidents and the development of tmd this has been termed posttraumatic tmd to separate it from  idiopathic tmd 13 despite multiple studies having been performed over the years the cumulative evidence has been described as conflicting with moderate evidence that tmd can occasionally follow whiplash injury 13 the research that suggests a link appears to demonstrate a low to moderate incidence of tmd following whiplash injury and that p tmd has a poorer response to treatment than tmd which has not developed in relation to trauma 13occlusal factors  editocclusal factors as an etiologic factor in tmd is a controversial topic 5 abnormalities of occlusion problems with the bite are often blamed for tmd but there is no evidence that these factors are involved 24 occlusal abnormalities are incredibly common and most people with occlusal abnormalities do not have tmd 33 although occlusal features may affect observed electrical activity in masticatory muscles 34 there are no statistically significant differences in the number of occlusal abnormalities in people with tmd and in people without tmd 5 there is also no evidence for a causal link between orthodontic treatment and tmd 5 the modern mainstream view is that the vast majority of people with tmd occlusal factors are not related 17 theories of occlusal factors in tmd are largely of historical interest a causal relationship between occlusal factors and tmd was championed by ramfjord in the 1960s 15 a small minority of dentists continue to prescribe occlusal adjustments in the belief that this will prevent or treat tmd despite the existence of systematic reviews of the subject which state that there is no evidence for such practices 35 and the vast majority of opinion being that no irreversible treatment should be carried out in tmd see occlusal adjustment  genetic factors  edittmd does not obviously run in families like a genetic disease it has been suggested that a genetic predisposition for developing tmd and chronic pain syndromes generally could exist this has been postulated to be explained by variations of the gene which codes for the enzyme catecholomethyl transferase comt which may produce 3 different phenotypes with regards pain sensitivity comt together with monoamine oxidase is involved in breaking down catecholamines eg dopamine epinephrine and norepinephrine  the variation of the comt gene which produces less of this enzyme is associated with a high sensitivity to pain females with this variation are at 2–3 times greater risk of developing tmd than females without this variant however this theory is controversial since there is conflicting evidence 6hormonal factors  editsince females are more often affected by tmd than males the female sex hormone estrogen has been suggested to be involved 6 the results of one study suggested that the periods of highest pain in tmd can be correlated with rapid periods of change in the circulating estrogen level low estrogen was also correlated to higher pain 15 in the menstrual cycle estrogen levels fluctuate rapidly during ovulation and also rapidly increases just before menstruation and rapidly decreases during menstruation postmenopausal females who are treated with hormone replacement therapy are more likely to develop tmd or may experience an exacerbation if they already had tmd several possible mechanisms by which estrogen might be involved in tmd symptoms have been proposed estrogen may play a role in modulating joint inflammation nociceptive neurons in the trigeminal nerve muscle reflexes to pain and μopioid receptors 6possible associations  edittmd has been suggested to be associated with other conditions or factors with varying degrees evidence and some more commonly than others eg it has been shown that 75 of people with tmd could also be diagnosed with fibromyalgia since they met the diagnostic criteria and that conversely 18 of people with fibromyalgia met diagnostic criteria for tmd 16 a possible link between many of these chronic pain conditions has been hypothesized to be due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms and they have been collectively termed central sensitivity syndromes 16 although other apparent associations cannot be explained in this manner recently a plethora of research has substantiated a causal relationship between tmd and obstructive sleep apnea osa severe tmd restricts oral airway opening and can result in a retrognathic posture that results in glossal blockage of the oropharynx as the tongue relaxes in sleep this mechanism is exacerbated by alcohol consumption as well as other chemicals that result in reduced myotonic status of the oropharynx obstructive sleep apnea 36 37rheumatoid arthritis 17systemic joint laxity

medial view showing sphenomandibular and stylomandibular ligaments sagittal tmj crosssection showing articular eminence articular disc and upper and lower joint spaces anatomy and physiology  edittemporomandibular joints  editmain article temporomandibular joint the temporomandibular joints are the dual articulation of the mandible with the skull each tmj is classed as a ginglymoarthrodial joint since it is both a ginglymus hinging joint and an arthrodial sliding joint 39 and involves the condylar process of the mandible below and the articular fossa or glenoid fossa of the temporal bone above between these articular surfaces is the articular disc or meniscus which is a biconcave transversely oval disc composed of dense fibrous connective tissue each tmj is covered by a fibrous capsule there are tight fibers connecting the mandible to the disc and loose fibers which connect the disc to the temporal bone meaning there are in effect 2 joint capsules creating an upper joint space and a lower joint space with the articular disc in between the synovial membrane of the tmj lines the inside of the fibrous capsule apart from the articular surfaces and the disc this membrane secretes synovial fluid which is both a lubricant to fill the joint spaces and a means to convey nutrients to the tissues inside the joint behind the disc is loose vascular tissue termed the bilaminar region which serves as a posterior attachment for the disc and also fills with blood to fill the space created when the head of the condyle translates down the articular eminence 40 due to its concave shape sometimes the articular disc is described as having an anterior band intermediate zone and a posterior band 41 when the mouth is opened the initial movement of the mandibular condyle is rotational and this involves mainly the lower joint space and when the mouth is opened further the movement of the condyle is translational involving mainly the upper joint space 42 this translation movement is achieved by the condylar head sliding down the articular eminence which constitutes the front border of the articular fossa 33 the function of the articular eminence is to limit the forwards movement of the condyle 33 the ligament directly associated with the tmj is the temporomandibular ligament also termed the lateral ligament which really is a thickening of the lateral aspect of the fibrous capsule 33 the stylomandibular ligament and the sphenomandibular ligament are not directly associated with the joint capsule together these ligaments act to restrict the extreme movements of the joint 43muscles of mastication  editmain article muscles of mastication the muscles of mastication are paired on each side and work together to produce the movements of the mandible the main muscles involved are the masseter temporalis and medial and lateral pterygoid muscles left medial and lateral pterygoid muscles left temporalis muscle left masseter muscle red highlightthey can be thought of in terms of the directions they move the mandible with most being involved in more than one type of movement due to the variation in the orientation of muscle fibers within some of these muscles protrusion – lateral and medial pterygoid retraction – posterior fibers of temporalis and the digastric and geniohyoid muscles to a lesser extent elevation – anterior and middle fibers of temporalis the superficial and deep fibers of masseter and the medial pterygoid 40lateral movements – medial and lateral pterygoid the ipsilateral temporalis and the pterygoid muscles of the contralateral side pull the mandible to the ipsilateral side 33each lateral pterygoid muscle is composed of 2 heads the upper or superior head and the lower or inferior head the lower head originates from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts at a depression on the neck of mandibular condyle just below the articular surface termed the pterygoid fovea the upper head originates from the infratemporal surface and the infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone the upper head also inserts at the fovea but a part may be attached directly to the joint capsule and to the anterior and medial borders of the articular disc 40 the 2 parts of lateral pterygoid have different actions the lower head contracts during mouth opening and the upper head contracts during mouth closing the function of the lower head is to steady the articular disc as it moves back with the condyle into the articular fossa it is relaxed during mouth closure 5mechanisms of main signs and symptoms  editjoint noises  editnoises from the tmjs are a symptom of dysfunction of these joints the sounds commonly produced by tmd are usually described as a click or a pop when a single sound is heard and as crepitation or crepitus when there are multiple grating rough sounds most joint sounds are due to internal derangement of the joint which is a term used to describe instability or abnormal position of the articular disc 44 clicking often accompanies either jaw opening or closing and usually occurs towards the end of the movement the noise indicates that the articular disc has suddenly moved to and from a temporarily displaced position disk displacement with reduction to allow completion of a phase of movement of the mandible 5 25 if the disc displaces and does not reduce move back into position this may be associated with locking clicking alone is not diagnostic of tmd since it is present in high proportion of the general population mostly in people who have no pain 5 crepitus often indicates arthritic changes in the joint and may occur at any time during mandibular movement especially lateral movements 5 perforation of the disc may also cause crepitus 33 due to the proximity of the tmj to the ear canal joint noises are perceived to be much louder to the individual than to others often people with tmd are surprised that what sounds to them like very loud noises cannot be heard at all by others next to them however it is occasionally possible for loud joint noises to be easily heard by others in some cases and this can be a source of embarrassment eg when eating in company pain  editpain symptoms in tmd can be thought of as originating from the joint arthralgia or from the muscles myofascial or both there is a poor correlation between tmd pain severity and evidence of tissue pathology 6arthralgia  editgenerally degenerative joint changes are associated with greater pain myofascial pain  editpain originating from the muscles of mastication as a result of abnormal muscular function or hyperactivity the muscular pain is frequently but not always associated with daytime clenching or nocturnal bruxism 45referred tmd pain  editsometimes tmd pain can radiate or be referred from its cause ie the tmj or the muscles of mastication and be felt as headaches earache or toothache 11due to the proximity of the ear to the temporomandibular joint tmj pain can often be confused with ear pain 22 the pain may be referred in around half of all patients and experienced as otalgia earache 46 conversely tmd is an important possible cause of secondary otalgia treatment of tmd may then significantly reduce symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus as well as atypical facial pain 47 despite some of these findings some researchers question whether tmjd therapy can reduce symptoms in the ear and there is currently an ongoing debate to settle the controversy 22limitation of mandibular movement  editthe jaw deviates to the affected side during opening 19 and restricted mouth opening usually signifies that both tmjs are involved but severe trismus rarely occurs if the greatest reduction in movement occurs upon waking then this may indicate that there is concomitant sleep bruxism in other cases the limitation in movement gets worse throughout the day 5the jaw may lock entirely 5limitation of mandibular movement itself may lead to further problems involving the tmjs and the muscles of mastication changes in the synovial membrane may lead to a reduction in lubrication of the joint and contribute to degenerative joint changes 48 the muscles become weak and fibrosis may occur all these factors may lead to a further limitation of jaw movement and increase in pain 48degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis or organic degeneration of the articular surfaces recurrent fibrous or bony ankylosis developmental abnormality or pathologic lesions within the tmj myofascial pain syndrome  medical

clicks of the joint may also be palpated over the joint itself in the preauricular region or via a finger inserted in the external acoustic meatus 17 which lies directly behind the tmj the differential diagnosis is with degenerative joint disease eg osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis temporal arteritis otitis media parotitis mandibular osteomyelitis eagle syndrome trigeminal neuralgia  medical citation neededoromandibular dystonia  medical citation needed deafferentation pains and psychogenic pain 19diagnostic criteria  editvarious diagnostic systems have been described some consider the research diagnostic criteria method the gold standard 17 abbreviated to rdctmd this was first introduced in 1992 by dworkin and le resche in an attempt to classify temporomandibular disorders by etiology and apply universal standards for research into tmd 50 this method involves 2 diagnostic axes namely axis i the physical diagnosis and axis ii the psychologic diagnosis 17 axis i contains 3 different groups which can occur in combinations of 2 or all 3 groups 17 see table mc neill 1997 described tmd diagnostic criteria as follows 2pain in muscles of mastication the tmj or the periauricular area around the ear which is usually made worse by manipulation or function asymmetric mandibular movement with or without clicking limitation of mandibular movements pain present for a minimum of 3 months the international headache societys diagnostic criteria for headache or facial pain attributed to temporomandibular joint disorder is similar to the above 20a recurrent pain in one or more regions of the head or face fulfilling criteria c and db xray mri or bone scintigraphy demonstrate tmj disorder c evidence that pain can be attributed to the tmj disorder based on at least one of the followingpain is precipitated by jaw movements or chewing of hard or tough foodreduced range of or irregular jaw openingnoise from one or both tmjs during jaw movementstenderness of the joint capsule s of one or both tmjs d headache resolves within 3 months and does not recur after successful treatment of the tmj disorder management  edittmd can be difficult to manage and since the disorder transcends the boundaries between several healthcare disciplines — in particular dentistry and neurology the treatment may often involve multiple approaches and be multidisciplinary 43 most who are involved in treating and researching tmd now agree that any treatment carried out should not permanently alter the jaw or teeth and should be reversible 8 14 to avoid permanent change overthecounter or prescription pain medications may be prescribed 51psychosocial and behavioral interventions  editgiven the important role that psychosocial factors appear to play in tmd psychosocial interventions could be viewed to be central to management of the condition 27 there is a suggestion that treatment of factors that modulate pain sensitivity such as mood disorders anxiety and fatigue may be important in the treatment of tmd which often tends to attempt to address the pain directly 27cognitive behavioral therapy cbt has been used in tmd and has been shown to be efficacious by meta analyses 52hypnosis is suggested by some to be appropriate for tmd studies have suggested that it may even be more beneficial than occlusal splint therapy and has comparable effects to relaxation techniques 27relaxation techniques include progressive muscle relaxation yoga and meditation 27 it has been suggested that tmd involves increased sensitivity to external stimuli leading to an increased sympathetic fight or flight response with cardiovascular and respiratory alterations 27 relaxation techniques cause reduced sympathetic activity including muscle relaxation and reducing sensitivity to external stimuli and provoke a general sense of well being and reduced anxiety 27devices  edita lower full coverage occlusal splint an upper full coverage occlusal splint occlusal splints also termed bite plates or intraoral appliances are often used by dentists to treat tmd they are usually made of acrylic and can be hard or soft they can be designed to fit onto the upper teeth or the lower teeth they may cover all the teeth in one arch full coverage splint or only some partial coverage splint splints are also termed according to their intended mechanism such as the anterior positioning splint or the stabilization splint 17 although occlusal splints are generally considered a reversible treatment 48 sometimes partial coverage splints lead to pathologic tooth migration changes in the position of teeth normally splints are only worn during sleep and therefore probably do nothing for people who engage in parafunctional activities during wakefulness rather than during sleep there is slightly more evidence for the use of occlusal splints in sleep bruxism than in tmd a splint can also have a diagnostic role if it demonstrates excessive occlusal wear after a period of wearing it each night this may confirm the presence of sleep bruxism if it was in doubt soft splints are occasionally reported to worsen discomfort related to tmd 17 specific types of occlusal splint are discussed below a stabilization splint is a hard acrylic splint that forces the teeth to meet in an ideal relationship for the muscles of mastication and the tmjs it is claimed that this technique reduces abnormal muscular activity and promotes neuromuscular balance a stabilization splint is only intended to be used for about 2–3 months 4 it is more complicated to construct than other types of splint since a face bow record is required and significantly more skill on the part of the dental technician this kind of splint should be properly fitted to avoid exacerbating the problem and used for brief periods of time the use of the splint should be discontinued if it is painful or increases existing pain 51 a systematic review of all the scientific studies investigating the efficacy of stabilization splints concluded the followingon the basis of our analysis we conclude that the literature seems to suggest that there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilization splint therapy over other active interventions for the treatment of tmd however there is weak evidence to suggest that the use of stabilization splints for the treatment of tmd may be beneficial for reducing pain severity at rest and on palpation when compared to no treatment 4partial coverage splints are recommended by some experts but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements which can occasionally be severe the mechanism of this tooth movement is that the splint effectively holds some teeth out of contact and puts all the force of the bite onto the teeth which the splint covers this can cause the covered teeth to be intruded and those that are not covered to overerupted ie a partial coverage splint can act as a dahl appliance examples of partial coverage splints include the ntitss nociceptive trigeminal inhibitor tension suppression system which covers the upper front teeth only due to the risks involved with long term use some discourage the use of any type of partial coverage splint 17an anterior positioning splint is a splint that designed to promote an anteriorly displaced disc it is rarely used 17 a 2010 review of all the scientific studies carried out to investigate the use of occlusal splints in tmd concludedhard stabilization appliances when adjusted properly have good evidence of modest efficacy in the treatment of tmd pain compared to nonoccluding appliances and no treatment other types of appliances including soft stabilization appliances anterior positioning appliances and anterior bite appliances have some rct evidence of efficacy in reducing tmd pain however the potential for adverse events with these appliances is higher and suggests the need for close monitoring in their use 53ear canal inserts are also available but no published peerreviewed clinical trials have shown them to be useful medication  editmedication is the main method of managing pain in tmd mostly because there is little if any evidence of the effectiveness of surgical or dental interventions many drugs have been used to treat tmd pain such as analgesics pain killers benzodiazepines eg clonazepam prazepam diazepam  anticonvulsants eg gabapentin  muscle relaxants eg cyclobenzaprine  and others analgesics that have been studied in tmd include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs eg piroxicam diclofenac naproxen and cyclooxygenase2 inhibitors eg celecoxib  topical methyl salicylate and topical capsaicin have also been used other drugs that have been described for use in tmd include glucosamine hydrochloride  chondroitin sulphate and propranolol despite many randomized control trials being conducted on these commonly used medications for tmd a systematic review carried out in 2010 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support or not to support the use of these drugs in tmd 2 lowdoses of antimuscarinic tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline 54 or nortriptyline have also been described 55 in a subset of people with tmd who are not helped by either noninvasive and invasive treatments long term use of opiate analgesics has been suggested although these drugs carry a risk of drug dependence and other side effects 56 examples include morphine fentanyl oxycodone tramadol hydrocodone and methadone 56botulinum toxin solution botox is sometimes used to treat tmd 57 injection of botox into the lateral pterygoid muscle has been investigated in multiple randomized control trials and there is evidence that it is of benefit in tmd 58 it is theorized that spasm of lateral pterygoid causes anterior disc displacement botulinum toxin causes temporary muscular paralysis by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction 25 the effects usually last for a period of months before they wear off complications include the creation of a fixed expression due to diffusion of the solution and subsequent involvement of the muscles of facial expression 58 which lasts until the effects of the botox wear off injections of local anesthetic sometimes combined with steroids into the muscles eg the temoralis muscle or its tendon are also sometimes used local anesthetics may provide temporary pain relief and steroids inhibit proinflammatory cytokines 48 steroids and other medications are sometimes injected directly into the joint see intraarticular injections  physiotherapy biofeedback and similar noninvasive measures  editphysiotherapy physical therapy is sometimes used as an adjuvant to other methods of treatment in tmd 59 there are many different approaches described but exercises aiming to increase the range of mandibular movements are commonly involved 48 jaw exercises aim to directly oppose the negative effects of disuse that may occur in tmd due to pain discouraging people from moving their jaw after initial instruction people are able to perform a physical therapy regimen at home the most simple method is by regular stretching within pain tolerance using the thumb and a finger in a scissor maneuver gentle force is applied until pain of resistance is felt and then the position is held for several seconds commercial devices have been developed to carry out this stretching exercise eg the therabite appliance over time the amount of mouth opening possible without pain can be gradually increased a baseline record of the distance at the start of physical therapy eg the number of fingers that can be placed vertically between the upper and lower incisors can chart any improvement over time 48it has been suggested that massage therapy for tmd improves both the subjective and objective health status 60 friction massage uses surface pressure to causes temporary ischemia and subsequent hyperemia in the muscles and this is hypothesized to inactivate trigger points and disrupt small fibrous adhesions within the muscle that have formed following surgery or muscular shortening due to restricted movement 48occasionally physiotherapy for tmd may include the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tens which may override pain by stimulation of superficial nerve fibers and lead to pain reduction which extends after the time where the tens is being actually being applied possibly due to release of endorphins others recommend the use of ultrasound theorized to produce tissue heating alter blood flow and metabolic activity at a level that is deeper than possible with surface heat applications 48 there is tentative evidence that low level laser therapy may help with pain 61there is some evidence that some people who use nighttime biofeedback to reduce nighttime clenching experience a reduction in tmd 62occlusal adjustment  editthis is the adjustment or reorganizing of the existing occlusion carried out in the belief that this will redistribute forces evenly across the dental arches or achieve a more favorable position of the condyles in the fossae which is purported to lessen tooth wear bruxism and tmd but this is controversial these techniques are sometimes termed occlusal rehabilitation or occlusal equilibration 29 at its simplest occlusal adjustment involves selective grinding with a dental drill of the enamel of the occlusal surfaces of teeth with the aim of allowing the upper teeth to fit with the lower teeth in a more harmonious way 15 however there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved including the indications and the exact goals occlusal adjustment can also be very complex involving orthodontics restorative dentistry or even orthognathic surgery some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism 29 a middle ground view of these techniques is that occlusal adjustment in most cases of tmd is neither desirable nor helpful as a first line treatment and furthermore with few exceptions any adjustments should be reversible 17 however most dentists consider this unnecessary overtreatment 17 with no evidence of benefit 33 specifically orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are not considered by most to be appropriate treatments for tmd 33 a systematic review investigating all the scientific studies carried out on occlusal adjustments in tmd concluded the followingthere is an absence of evidence of effectiveness for occlusal adjustment based on these data occlusal adjustment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of tmd 35these conclusions were based largely on the fact that despite many different scientific studies investigating this measure as a therapy overall no statistically significant differences can be demonstrated between treatment with occlusal adjustment and treatment with placebo the reviewers also stated that there are ethical implications if occlusal adjustment was found to be ineffective in preventing tmd 35orthodontic treatment as described earlier is sometimes listed as a possible predisposing factor in the development of tmd on the other hand orthodontic treatment is also often carried out in the belief that it may treat or prevent tmd another systematic review investigating the relationship between orthodontics and tmd concluded the followingthere is no evidence to support or refute the use of orthodontic treatment for the treatment of tmd in addition there are no data which identify a link between active orthodontic intervention and the causation of tmd based on the lack of data orthodontic treatment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of tmd 15a common scenario where a newly placed dental restoration eg a crown or a filling is incorrectly contoured and creates a premature contact in the bite this may localize all the force of the bite onto one tooth and cause inflammation of the periodontal ligament and reversible increase in tooth mobility the tooth may become tender to bite on here the occlusal adjustment has already taken place inadvertently and the adjustment aims to return to the preexisting occlusion this should be distinguished from attempts to deliberately reorganize the native occlusion surgery  editmain article surgery for temporomandibular joint dysfunction attempts in the last decade to develop surgical treatments based on mri and cat scans now receive less attention these techniques are reserved for the most difficult cases where other therapeutic modalities have failed the american society of maxillofacial surgeons recommends a conservativenonsurgical approach first only 20 of patients need to proceed to surgery examples of surgical procedures that are used in tmd some more commonly than others include arthrocentesis arthroscopy meniscectomy disc repositioning condylotomy or joint replacement invasive surgical procedures in tmd may cause symptoms to worsen 7 meniscectomy also termed discectomy refers to surgical removal of the articular disc this is rarely carried out in tmd it may have some benefits for pain but dysfunction may persist and overall it leads to degeneration or remodeling of the tmj 63alternative medicine  editacupuncture  editacupuncture is sometimes used for tmd 43 there is limited evidence that acupuncture is an effective symptomatic treatment for tmd 64 65 66 a short term reduction in muscular pain of muscular origin can usually be observed after acupuncture in tmd 66 and this is more than is seen with placebo 67 there are no reported adverse events of acupuncture when used for tmd 67 and some suggest that acupuncture is best employed as an adjuvent to other treatments in tmd 66 however some suggest that acupuncture may be no more effective than sham acupuncture 68 that many of the studies investigating acupuncture and tmd suffer from significant risk of bias 66 and that the long term efficacy of acupuncture for tmd is unknown 66 67chiropractic  editchiropractic adjustments also termed manipulations or mobilizations are sometimes used in the belief that this will treat tmd 69 related conditions that are also claimed to be treatable by chiropractic include tension headaches and neck pain some sources suggest that there is some evidence of efficacy of chiropractic treatment in tmd 69 but the sources cited for these statements were case reports and a case series of only 9 participants one review concluded inconclusive evidence in a favorable direction regarding mobilization and massage for tmd 70 overall although there is general agreement that chiropractic may be of comparable benefit to other manual therapies for lower back pain there is no credible evidence of efficacy in other conditions including tmd 71 however there is some evidence of possible adverse effects from cervical neck vertebral manipulation which sometimes may be serious 71prognosis  editit has been suggested that the natural history of tmd is benign and selflimiting 24 with symptoms slowly improving and resolving over time 14 the prognosis is therefore good 18 however the persistent pain symptoms psychological discomfort physical disability and functional limitations may detriment quality of life 72 it has been suggested that tmd does not cause permanent damage and does not progress to arthritis in later life 24 174–175 however degenerative disorders of the tmj such as osteoarthritis are included within the spectrum of tmds in some classifications epidemiology  edittmd mostly affects people in the 20 – 40 age group 7 and the average age is 339 years 9 people with tmd tend to be younger adults 18 who are otherwise healthy within the catchall umbrella of tmd there are peaks for disc displacements at age 30 and for inflammatorydegenerative joint disorders at age 50 10about 75 of the general population may have at least one abnormal sign associated with the tmj eg clicking and about 33 have at least one symptom of tmd 23 however only in 36–7 will this be of sufficient severity to trigger the individual to seek medical advice 23for unknown reasons females are more likely to be affected than males in a ratio of about 21 9 although others report this ratio to be as high as 91 23 females are more likely to request treatment for tmd and their symptoms are less likely to resolve 23 females with tmd are more likely to be nulliparous than females without tmd 5 it has also been reported that female caucasians are more likely to be affected by tmd and at an earlier age than female african americans 18according to the most recent analyses of epidemiologic data using the rdctmd diagnostic criteria of all tmd cases group i muscle disorders accounts for 453 group ii disc displacements 411 and group iii joint disorders 301 individuals may have diagnoses from more than one group 10 using the rdctmd criteria tmd has a prevelence in the general population of 97 for group i 114 for group iia and 26 for group iiia 10history  edittemporomandibular disorders were described as early as ancient egypt 23 an older name for the condition is costens syndrome eponymously referring to james b costen 73 74 costen was an otolaryngologist 75 and although he was not the first physician to describe tmd he wrote extensively on the topic starting in 1934 and was the first to approach the disorder in an integrated and systematic way 76 costen hypothesized that malocclusion caused tmd and placed emphasis on ear symptoms such as tinnitus otaglia impaired hearing and even dizziness 76 specifically costen believed that the cause of tmd was mandibular overclosure 75 recommending a treatment revolving around building up the bite 75 the eponym costen syndrome became commonly used shortly after his initial work 76 but in modern times it has been dropped partially because occlusal factors are now thought to play little if any role in the development of tmd 18 and also because ear problems are now thought to be less associated with tmd other historically important terms that were used for tmd include tmj disease or tmj syndrome which are now rarely used 18references  edit tmj disorders national
