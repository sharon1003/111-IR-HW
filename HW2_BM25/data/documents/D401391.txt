weber’s bureaucracy definition features benefits disadvantages and problems article shared by  advertisements weber’s bureaucracy definition features benefits disadvantages and problemsit was max webber who propounded the bureaucratic theory of organisation and management advertisements the term ‘bureaucracy’ has been widely used with invidious connotations directed at government and business bureaucracy is an administrative system designed to accomplish largescale administrative tasks by systematically coordinating the work of many individuals weber has observed three types of power in organisations traditional charismatic and rationallegal or bureaucratic he has emphasised that bureaucratic type of power is the ideal one features characteristics of weber’s bureaucracy weber has given a number of features of bureaucracy accordingly following features suggest the characteristics of bureaucratic organisations1 administrative class bureaucratic organisations generally have administrative class responsible for maintaining coordinative activities of the members advertisements main features of his class are as follows i people are paid and are whole time employees ii they receive salary and other perquisites normally based on their positions iii their tenure in the organisation is determined by the rules and regulations of the organisation iv they do not have any proprietary interest in the organisation v they are selected for the purpose of employment based on their competence2 hierarchy the basic feature of bureaucratic organisation is that there is hierarchy of positions in the organisation hierarchy is a system of ranking various positions in descending scale from top to bottom of the organisation in bureaucratic organisation offices also follow the principle of hierarchy that is each lower office is subject to control and supervision by higher office thus no office is left uncontrolled in the organisation this is the fundamental concept of hierarchy in bureaucratic organisation this hierarchy serves as lines of communication and delegation of authority it implies that communication coming down or going up must pass through each position advertisements similarly a subordinate will get authority from his immediate superior however this hierarchy is net unitary but subpyramids of officials within the large organisation corresponding etc functional divisions exist thus there are offices with the same amount of authority but with different kinds of functions operating in different areas of competence for example the government organisations we can observe separate offices looking after particular functions this happens in business organisations too3 division of work work of the organisation is divided on the basis of specialisation to take the advantages of division of labour each office in the bureaucratic organisation has specific sphere of competence this involves i a sphere of obligations to perform functions which has been marked off as part of a systematic division of labour ii the provision of the incumbent with necessary authority to carry out these functions and iii the necessary means of compulsion are clearly defined and their use is subject to definite conditions thus division of labour try to ensure that each office has a clearlydefined area of competence within the organisation and each official knows the areas in which he operates and the areas in which he must abstain from action so that he does not overstep the boundary between his role and those of others further division of labour also tries to ensure that no work is left uncovered4 official rules a basic and most emphasised feature of bureaucratic organisation is that administrative process is continuous and governed by official rules bureaucratic organisation is the antithesis of ad hoc temporary and temporary and unstable relations a rational approach to organisation calls for a system of maintaining rules to ensure twin requirements of uniformity and coordination of efforts by individual members in the organisation these rules are more or less stable and more or less exhaustive when there is no rule on any aspect of organisational operation the matter is referred upward for decision which subsequently becomes precedent for future decision on the similar matter rules provide the benefits of stability continuity and predictability and each official knows precisely the outcome of his behaviour in a particular matter5 impersonal relationships a notable feature of bureaucracy is that relationships among individuals are governed through the system of official authority and rules official positions are free from personal involvement emotions and sentiments thus decisions are governed by rational factors rather than personal factors this impersonality concept is used in dealing with organisational relations as well as relations between the organisation and outsiders6 official record bureaucratic organisation is characterised by maintenance of proper official records the decisions and activities of the organisation are formally recorded and preserved for future reference this is made possible by extensive use of filling system in the organisation an official record is almost regarded as encyclopedia of various activities performed by the people in the organisation benefits of bureaucracy the following are the advantages of bureaucracy1 the rules and procedures are decided for every work it leads to consistency in employee behaviour since employees are bound to follow the rules etc the management process becomes easy2 the duties and responsibilities of each job are clearly defined there is no question of overlapping or conflicting job duties3 the selection process and promotion procedures are based on merit and expertise it assists in putting right persons on right jobs there is optimum utilisation of human resources4 the division of labour assists workers in becoming experts in their jobs the performance of employees improves considerably5 the enterprise does not suffer when some persons leave it if one person leaves then some other occupies that place and the work does not suffer disadvantages of bureaucracy the following are the disadvantages of bureaucracy1 this system suffers from too much of red tape and paper work2 the employees do not develop belongingness to the organisation3 the excessive reliance on rules and regulations and adherence to these policies inhibit initiative and growth of the employees they are treated like machines and not like individuals there is neglect of human factor4 the employees become so used to the system they resist to any change and introduction of new techniques of operations evaluation weber’s model will be performed in those enterprises where change is not anticipated big business houses and government departments use this type of organisation weber is credited for attempting to develop bureaucratic model for the first time weber’s model has some drawbacks it has rigidity impersonality excessive cost of control excessive dependence on superiors tendency to ignore organisational goals inspite of these limitations this model is very useful in large enterprises problems in bureaucracy bureaucracy organisation has been considered once superior than ad hoc or temporary structure it has been termed as rational and ideal leading to efficiency the efficiency in bureaucratic organisation comes through rationality and predictability of behaviour because everyone knows the consequence of his action become actually the action is undertaken however bureaucracy has been criticised because of its inefficiency and has been termed as a symbol of inefficiency there are many disfunctional aspects of bureaucracy which is referred to as bureau pathology looking into the needs of modern organisations bureaucracy has many shortcomings and is therefore not suitable the major problems of bureaucracy are because of the following factors invalidity of bureaucracy assumptions goal displacement united consequences in human and closerssystem perspective invalidity of bureaucratic assumptions in fact the source of bureau pathology lies in the invalidity of various assumptions of ideal bureaucracy many authors have questioned the validity of bureaucracy in most of these cases either the conditions are not found in practice or even if found may not result in efficiency specially the following aspects of bureaucracy work against efficiency of the organisation though they are supposed to contribute to efficiency1 rules are normally provided for guidelines but often they become source of inefficiency because of too much emphasis on rules their misuse and people’s apathy from rules2 rigid organisational hierarchy works against efficiency it overemphasizes superior subordinate relationships unnecessarily which is detrimental to congenial organisational climate3 in dealing with people total impersonal approach cannot be adopted because people have feelings emotions and sentiments which affect decision thus people cannot work totally according to rules and prescriptions related articles max weber’s ideal bureaucracy with salient features
