retts disorder follow citydatacom founder on our forum or lech mazur photo by joanna zielinska definition retts disorder which is also known as retts syndrome or rs belongs to a group of childhood disorders known as pervasive developmental disorders pdds or autistic spectrum disorders it is classified by the mental health professionals handbook the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders or the dsmivtr  as a developmental disorder of childhood retts disorder is characterized by an earlyonset slowing of the infants head growth and a reduction in brain size as much as 30 description rs was first described by an austrian physician andreas rett in 1966 prior to 1983 however little was known about the syndrome because its occurrence is quite rare although rs was thought at first to result from the destruction or degeneration of brain tissue genetic research has indicated that it is caused by the failure of the infants brain to develop normally this developmental failure is in turn caused by a genetic mutation affecting production of a key protein that regulates brain development retts disorder has a distinctive onset and course the child— almost always a girl— develops normally during the first five months of life after the fifth month head growth slows down and the child loses whatever purposeful hand movements she had developed during her first five months after 30 months the child frequently develops repetitive handwashing or handwringing gestures 50–80 of children with the disorder will eventually develop epilepsy retts disorder is also associated with severe or profound mental retardation  causes and symptoms causes the cause of retts disorder is a genetic mutation on the long arm of the x chromosome xq28 at a locus known as mecp2 the gene was discovered in 1999 and it produces a protein known as me cp2 which is essential to life and crucial to the normal development of the human brain the mutation that causes retts disorder allows other genes to become or remain active at inappropriate points in the brains development these activated genes interfere with the normal pattern of development and maturation of the brains functions although retts disorder was previously thought to result from degeneration or deterioration of brain tissue the discovery of the retts gene provides evidence that the disorder may be due to a failure of normal brain development the sensory motor and emotional functions of the brain are not integrated in retts patients as they are in persons without the mutation certain regions of the brain in retts patients essentially remain at an infantile stage of development rs is classified by geneticists as an xlinked dominant disorder with a high rate of new mutations most of these mutations 995 occur while the fetus is developing in the mothers womb only 05 of cases of retts disorder are recurrences within families one of the most important aspects of the discovery of the rett gene is that rs is the first disorder in humans to be traced to defects in a protein me cp2 that controls the expression of other genes through its interaction with methylated dna the discovery uncovered a new class of genetic disease that might extend far beyond rs in its applications to other disorders related to developmental failures of the nervous system symptoms the symptoms of retts disorder have been described in terms of four stages in the childs development stage one earlyonset six–18 months of age the early symptoms of rs are not always noticeable in stage 1 the infant may not make eye contact with family members and may not show much interest in toys she may be considered a good baby because she is so calm and quiet on the other hand there may be noticeable handwringing and slowing of head growth stage two rapid deterioration one–four years this stage may be either rapid or gradual in onset the child loses her ability to speak and to make purposeful hand movements handtomouth movements may appear as well as handwringing or handclapping gestures these movements may be nearly constant while the child is awake but disappear during sleep there may be noticeable episodes of breath holding and hyperventilating rapid shallow breathing the child may have trouble sleeping and may become irritable if she is able to walk she will start to look unsteady on her feet and may have periods of trembling or shaking slowed growth of the head is usually most noticeable during this stage stage three plateau two–10 years motor problems and seizures often appear during this stage the childs behavior however often shows some improvement with less irritability and crying she may show greater interest in her surroundings and her attention span and communication skills often improve many patients with rs remain in stage 3 for most of their lives stage four late deterioration of motor skills usually after 10 years of age in stage 4 patients with rs gradually lose their mobility some stop walking while others have never learned to walk there is however no loss of cognitive or communication skills and the repetitive hand movements may decrease the spine begins to develop an abnormal sideways curvature scoliosis and the patient may develop muscle rigidity puberty begins at the same age as in most girls demographics rs is less common than the other pdds recent estimates of its prevalence range between 110000 births and 115000 births as of 2002 little is known about its prevalence across different racial and ethnic groups until 2000 retts disorder was thought to occur only in girls but at least two cases have been reported in boys as well since rs is caused by a mutation on the x chromosome that affects the production of a protein essential to life and the y chromosome that determines male sex cannot compensate for a damaged x chromosome a male fetus with a defective x chromosome does not usually survive the two known cases of rs in boys involve one child who has two x chromosomes as well as a y and a child whose x chromosome is faulty in some of the cells in his body but not all this condition is known as mosaicism diagnosis the diagnosis of retts disorder is made on the basis of observation of the child—usually over a period of several hours or days—and interviews with the parents there are no laboratory or diagnostic imaging tests for rs the diagnosis can be made by a pediatrician or primary care physician but should be confirmed by a pediatric neurologist specialist in disorders of the nervous system in children or developmental pediatrician after the examiner has excluded the possibility of other developmental disorders there are six criteria that must be met for a diagnosis of retts disorder and a secondary group of supportive criteria that are frequently observed in rs patients but are not necessary to make the diagnosis diagnostic criteria the diagnostic criteria for rs include the followinga period of apparently normal development before six–18 months of agea normalsized head at birth followed by slowing of head growth between five months and four yearssevere impairment in the use of language and loss of purposeful hand motionrepetitive hand movements that include one or more of the following hand washing hand wringing or hand clappingshaking of the chest or torso particularly when the child is agitated or upsetin children able to walk an unsteady stifflegged widebased gait supportive criteria supportive criteria are criteria that are not essential to the diagnosis of a particular disorder because some people with the disorder do not have them supportive criteria are nonetheless strong evidence that a person who exhibits these criteria does in fact have the disorder supportive criteria for retts disorder includedysfunctional breathing which may include hyperventilation breath holding and air swallowingabnormal electroencephalogram eeg patternsseizuresdifficulties in chewing and swallowingconstipationmuscle rigidity and contracting of the joints that increase with agescoliosis curvature of the spine from side to sideteeth grindingsmall feet in relation to overall heightslow overall growthloss of body fat and muscle massabnormal sleeping patterns combined with irritability or agitationpoor circulation in the feet and legs these supportive criteria do not always appear in young children with rs but are often observed as the child grows older treatments there is no single treatment regimen that is applicable to all patients with retts disorder some patients benefit from medications for muscular rigidity or for specific mood or behavioral problems such as anxiety or irritability a child psychiatrist should be consulted in regard to medications the degree of mental retardation associated with rs means that patients with this disorder will not benefit from psychotherapy  parents of children with rs however are often helped by supportive therapy groups for parents of children with pdds another type of program that is helpful for parents is learning skills for coping with the behaviors of rs children these programs are usually led by a behavioral psychologist  the u s national institute of mental health nimh is presently conducting research studies of psychosocial approaches to treatment of retts and other pdds as well as studies of medications given for these disorders readers who would like more information about this research may contact nimh public inquiries at 6001 executive boulevard rm

derived from treatments given to patients in the 1970s or 1980s as knowledge of effective treatments continues to accumulate children with rs are receiving treatment earlier than they did two decades ago it is likely that future prognoses for the disorder will reflect these improvements as of 2002 the prognosis for rs patients is poor in most cases there is a steady loss of cognition movementrelated social and behavioral skills throughout the patients lifetime some patients however make modest developmental gains in adolescence the average life expectancy of patients with rs has not yet been determined although some are presently middleaged prevention as of 2002 there are no effective strategies for preventing retts disorder since most cases result from new mutations of the mecp2 gene rather than transmission of a defective gene from the parents resources booksamerican psychiatric association diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4th edition text revised
