started by violetspike july 15 200710 posts in this topicvioletspike gold member gold member61699 posts location usaposted july 15 2007 edited · report post advertisement hi all when i can see a doc i will ask about this but also want to ask you all here what you think this morning my husband noticed that in a large area on my upper back just below my neck there is a big swelling or some kind of lump forming we both know it is due to muscle tension from stress pain in my neck shoulders and back and sometimes jaw is almost unbearable at times and is always there to some degree even with attempts to help it with relaxing practices upper body exercises stretches applying heat and deep massages has anyone had this lump thing happen before do you think it is muscles swelling up what have you done that has helped for this thanks peepsps if it starts to seem i would get more responses by posting in another area please feel free to let me know or to move this elsewhere thanks edited july

not but i had one on one side of my lower backit came up suddenly and was reddish  hot  it turned out to be a cyst that had to be drained and i needed antibiotics for the infection i also had upper back neck shoulder arm pain due to a bone spur in my upper back that will push on nerves when i allow the area to get inflamed needless to say stress makes it all worse  i had even got to the point that i had muscle spasms going down my arms all the time and numbness in my fingertips i never had any visible swelling from any of itvioletspike gold member gold member61699 posts location usaposted july 16 2007 · report post thanks slw for your reply this is different than a cyst the bone spur sounds closer but i dont know what exactly one is so ill research that one but from what youve said about it i dont think this is it either i bet my muscles are so tightened and becoming like raised knots hmmm ive had it bad enough that an area will get stiff like i cant move my neck but never this amount of swelling i think ill look on the web for some hints i bet it will go away with destressing so i hope that you have found relief for your bone spur and all that it caused take care jkm member

at allvioletspike gold member gold member61699 posts location usaposted july 16 2007 · report post jkm thanks for your reply it helped me to be quick on getting an appointment so am back from the appointment already it is nothing serious doc thinks it does have to do with muscle tension but calls it a fatty pad or fat deposit or something says no need to do a mri or anything like that until after the baby is born im 24 weeks if even neccessary he gave me a safe muscle relaxant to take for 5 days areen silver member silver member1781 posts location malaysia posted july 17 2007 · report

hear that there is nothing serious there violet you take carevioletspike  here is some more info on my bone spur if it turns out you have anything like thatwhen the area gets inflamed it presses against a nervethe rest of the area tries to compensate and stop it from happening which causes muscle spasms etc in my neck  down my armsmy fix so far is to make sure it doesnt get inflamed  i started with prescription antiinflammatories but now i use allievephysical therapy also helped me to strengthen the supporting muscles which helped enormouslyso if i do everything that im supposed to  im finefunny things will happen while youre pregnant sometimes  hope everything is as the doc says jkm member platinum member338610 posts location ohio posted july 17 2007 · report post i didnt know
