drop in cbot corn prices is the sort of short term scare that the corn market is famous for note how often prices subsequently reverse and undo the damage moreover manitoba corn continues to trade cheap to chicago and this basis is wide enough to absorb some temporary uncertainty without necessarily damaging local prices however manitoba corn prices do face challenges first although manitoba corn is trading at bargain levels well below its 5 and 8 year avg prices the typical seasonal tendency suggests ongoing price slippage from now until canadian thanksgiving on top of that despite the recent disconnect between manitoba prices and chicago probably caused by the combination of logistical problems and inadequate local demand manitoba growers seem to have pushed ahead with aggressive plantings thus a test of long term support around cdn320bu can not be ruled out in the months ahead at present wheat prices continue to drop like they have for the last 8 weeks but the end of this painful selloff and an upward reversal could be close at hand since late may we have been highlighting the prospect of an correction and this has just about run its course so spring wheat is looking oversold at the same time in recent years the typical seasonal tendency has seen mgex wheat futures tack on about us1bu between canada day and the september labour day long weekend given that spring wheat did not behave this way last year many may have forgotten this underlying behaviour turning to saskatchewan cwrs average delivered elevator prices the prospects for improvement are even more dramatic the basis has barely improved over the past 5 months and it is important to remember that current basis levels near cdn235bu are a steep bargain compared to –cdn089bu at this time last year that adds extra recovery potential the recent collapse in corn futures prices expressed in canadian dollars has not yet been reflected in canadian feed grain prices but a sympathetic downward move could unfold soon at present the comparative value ratios for feed peas divided by corn and feed barley divided by corn are at high levels only experienced a few times in the last 5 years this suggests that current prairie feed grain prices may not be competitive and could be vulnerable to imported corn or byproducts like ddgs the past month’s slow improvement in alberta feed barley prices implies that underlying momentum is faltering alberta barley may have been undercut by lower priced saskatchewan supplies or it could be less competitive compared to north dakota barley and corn see feed grain comment dated july 17 th  looking forward the seasonal tendency typically turns lower from now until october1 st so average delivered elevator prices could slip lower in the long term alberta feed barley seems to be slowly sorting itself out within bands of support and resistance remarkably similar to its 20082010 experience if so near term weakness could test the 3bu level p

underlines how well they are supported just below current price levels cbot nearby oat futures expressed in canadian dollars have broken their downtrend and momentum is rolling sideways clearly the oats market is slowly returning to normal the manitoba oats basis now at –cdn054 is close to its 5 year average at –cdn032 though the saskatchewan basis at –cdn141 is lagging its average of –cdn075 given that sk oats are already super “cheap” to both mb and futures the typical seasonal pressure expected over the next two months could be minor durum’s big breakout above both horizontal overhead resistance and the long term downtrend generated a typical opening surge however at this point it is normal for young bulls to stop and pause for breath before continuing on their way again given durum’s typical seasonal tendency such a pullback would hardly be surprising moreover despite canadian durum’s comparative giveaway pricing it is trading at a large premium to cwrs and this might induce some farmer selling too longer term canadian durum prices continue to enjoy generous catchup potential to us durum prices while both sides of the border establish the pace of a new bull market the cwrs minus mgex basis has just broken above overhead resistance that is an important development which suggests that the global marketplace has finally spotted our bargain pricing expect the bid side of the canadian wheat market to improve and prices to start trending upwards in terms of leadership mgex nearby futures expressed in canadian dollars are testing this winter’s support level thereby holding out the possibility of some sort of double bottom combined with the prospect of more basis improvement saskatchewan average delivered elevator prices for cwrs have a nearmedium term series of recovery targets starting at 510bu followed by 570 then 625 looking at a close competitor average elevator prices for north dakota dark northern spring are much higher and typically begin to stabilize at this time of year saskatchewan cwrs prices should converge upon them this change of tone should benefit all classes of canadian wheat malting barley price weakness may continue a little longer but the seeds of a reversal are already sprouting certainly the typical seasonal tendency suggests that malting barley prices could remain under pressure for another six weeks or so but prices near their 9 year average are not going to hold buyers back price leadership often comes from the us yet north dakota and saskatchewan feed barley prices are headed in opposite directions given the importance of feed barley to finishing cattle in this period of high meat prices saskatchewan feed barley’s recent rally makes a point because rising feed values always pose a risk to supplies of malting sure corn is cheap and its knockon importance to malting barley can not be understated but the spread between european matif malting barley and north dakotamontana is the largest since the 2010 bull market clearly the global malting market is not panicking this bear may not have much more to run cwrs charts and commentary available to subscribers only durum charts and commentary
