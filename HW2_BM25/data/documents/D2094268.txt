science news from research organizations in cleaning up misfolded proteins cell powerhouses can break down date march 1 2017source johns hopkins medicine summary working with yeast and human cells researchers say they have discovered an unexpected route for cells to eliminate protein clumps that may sometimes be the molecular equivalent of throwing too much or the wrong trash into the garbage disposal share full storythis is mitochondria red that have imported misfolded proteins green credit erli jin and linhao ruanjohns hopkins medicine working with yeast and human cells researchers at johns hopkins say they have discovered an unexpected route for cells to eliminate protein clumps that may sometimes be the molecular equivalent of throwing too much or the wrong trash into the garbage disposal their finding they say could help explain part of what goes awry in the progression of such neurodegenerative diseases as parkinsons and alzheimers proteins in the cell that are damaged or folded incorrectly tend to form clumps or aggregates which have been thought to dissolve gradually in a cells cytoplasm or nucleus thanks to an enzyme complex called the proteasome or in a digestive organelle called the lysosome but in experiments on yeast which has many structures similar to those in human cells the johns hopkins scientists unexpectedly found that many of those protein clumps break down in the cells energyproducing powerhouses called mitochondria they also found that too many misfolded proteins can clog up and damage this vital structure the teams findings described march 1 in nature could help explain why protein clumping and mitochondrial deterioration are both hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases rong li ph d professor of cell biology biomedical engineering and oncology at the johns hopkins university school of medicine and a member of the johns hopkins kimmel cancer center who led the study likens the disposal system to the interplay between a households trash and a garbage disposal in the kitchen sink the disposal is handy and helps keep the house free of food scraps but the danger is that with too much trash especially toughtogrind garbage the system could get clogged up or break down in a previous study li and her team found protein aggregates which form abundantly under stressful conditions such as intense heat stuck to the outer surface of mitochondria in this study they found the aggregates bind to proteins that form the pores mitochondria normally use to import proteins needed to build this organelle if these pores are damaged by mutations then aggregates cannot be dissolved the researchers report these observations led the team to hypothesize that misfolded proteins in the aggregates are pulled into mitochondria for disposal much like food scraps dropped into the garbage disposal testing this hypothesis was tricky li says because most of the misfolded proteins started out in the cytoplasm and most of those that enter mitochondria quickly get ground up as a consequence li and her team used a technique in which a fluorescent protein was split into two parts then they put one part inside the mitochondria and linked the other part with a misfolded and clumping protein in the cytoplasm if the misfolded protein entered the mitochondria the two parts of the fluorescent protein could come together and light up the mitochondria this was indeed what happened with any experiment li says you have a hypothesis but in your head you may be skeptical so seeing the bright mitochondria was an enlightening moment to see what might happen in a diseased system the team then put into yeast cells a protein implicated in the neurodegenerative disease known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als or lou gehrigs disease after a heat treatment that caused the als protein to misfold it also wound up in the mitochondria the researchers then did an experiment in which a lot of proteins in the cytoplasm were made to misfold and found that when too much of these proteins entered mitochondria they started to break down the team wanted to make sure that the phenomenon it had observed in the yeast cells could also happen in human cells so the scientists used the same splitfluorescent protein method to observe misfolded proteins to enter the mitochondria of labgrown human retinal pigmented epithelial cells as observed in yeast misfolded proteins but not those that were properly folded entered and lit up mitochondria biological systems are in general quite robust but there are also some achilles heels that may be disease prone li says and relying on the mitochondrial system to help with cleanup may be one such example while young and healthy mitochondria may be fully up to the task aged mitochondria or those overwhelmed by too much cleanup in troubled cells may suffer damage which could then impair many of their other vital functions story source materials provided by johns hopkins medicine note content
