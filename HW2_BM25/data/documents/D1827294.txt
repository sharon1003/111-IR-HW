microwaving baconposted in breakfast and brunch meat poultry and seafood by kathy maisterprevious  next sir francis bacon who some people think wrote all of shakespeare’s plays said that “friendship doubles joys and cuts grief in half” i think that’s true of bacon itself it’s a fun food that served in a wide variety of ways does indeed double joy and cut grief in half for many it is an occasional indulgence only eaten at restaurantsbacon has a unique smoky salty and sometimes sweet flavor all rolled into one strip the high fat content makes it very crispy when you cook it it can be eaten on its own or crumbled up and used as a garnish on lots of different types of savory dishes you can cook bacon in the oven in a fry pan or in the microwave i recommend the microwave approach because it’s quick and easy and there’s virtually no clean up to cook bacon in the microwave you will need a microwave safe dish and three paper towels it will usually say on the back of the plate in really small print if you can use it in a microwave so here we golay 2 paper towels on the plate spread the bacon out in a single layer not overlapping on the dish now lay another paper towel over the top depending on your microwave this amount of bacon should take about 46 minutes to get nice and crispy using pot holders very carefully remove the dish from the microwave be careful the dish itself will be very hot the paper towels will have absorbed all the bacon fat with some tongs put the bacon on a serving dish now just throw away the paper towels it’s just that simple your bacon is nice and crispy and there is very little cleanupif you have uncooked bacon left over the remaining package can be wrapped in plastic wrap and stored for up to one week in the refrigerator i like to divide the remaining bacon into two packets and wrap it in plastic then you can freeze it be sure to date the package it should be used within two months remember food doesn’t last forever in the freezer if later on you only want one serving of bacon you can take the packet out of the freezer and zap it in the microwave for about one minute then remove it from its packaging and cook it as described above bacon can be used as a topping to salads and baked potatoes or as a perfect side dish to any breakfast or brunch menu enjoyif you are new to startcooking or are a regular visitor here please consider

clearly leaving food in there longer than it wants thank youclaire said when i tried to cook bacon on a plate it didn’t cook correctly so i just use the paper towels also my mom has always told me to cook it for 1 minute per piece i guess that could be valuable if you only want to cook 12 pieces imagine cooking one piece for 4 minuteskathy maister said wow talk about crispy bacon thanks claire for bringing up timing you are right about 1 minutestrip but each microwave is different so that number is a bit different depending on how powerful your microwave is stephen said my wife and i don’t have kids and i hate stale bacon since there’s only two of us i had to be a little creative when it comes to food storage here’s a tip i learned about storing bacon when you open your package of bacon roll each slice individually place all of your individual bacon rolls onto a piece of wax or parchment paper on a cookie sheet when it is frozen place your bacon rolls into a ziploc bag just pull a couple of bacon rolls out of the freezer into a small baggie the night before you want fried bacon and leave them in the refrigerator overnight if you get an urgent bacon craving or forget to thaw your bacon throw a couple of rolls in the microwave for a few seconds until you can unroll them then fry and enjoykathy maister said thanks stephen for the great tip freezing individual slices makes a lot of sense if you want just a small amount for garnish or a breakfast splurge this is surly the way to godanielle said my granddad showed me another great way to store bacon in the freezer first he lines a rectangular storage container with plastic wrap then he alternates layers of bacon strips sidebyside and not touching and plastic wrap until all the bacon is in the container this way he can take the flat bacon strips straight from the freezer to the pan the layers of plastic wrap between the bacon layers keep the bacon from sticking together this works with sausage patties and premade pancakes tookathy maister said hi danielle thanks for sharing your granddad’s great tip i’ll bet he was a wonderful cookkgwagner said i’ve never been a big fan of microwaved bacon but i’ve done a lot of it to satisfy my exwife’s addiction to the stuff between her and the cats they could lay waste to a pound of the stuff to me it was always a little too tough cooked that way on the plus side as you’ve pointed out it’s fast and there’s little cleanup i don’t eat bacon too often anymore but when i decide i have to have some i’ll go through the trouble of frying up a whole pound and stashing the unused strips in a rubbermaidtype container in the fridge for later use heating it up for breakfast only takes seconds and you can also use it for garnishes and sandwiches doing it that way means there’s only one mess to clean up yet you get to have bacon a number of times for no trouble at all kathy maister said cooked bacon also freezes beautifullyrobert said i haven’t had much luck cooking bacon with paper towel i find the towel is saturated with fat and it makes a mess of the carousel i am wondering if it’s better to cook bacon on one of those bacon dishes you buy at the store they elevate the bacon so the fat drips off actually i’m going to try one tomorrow and do a few tests what do you think btw i enjoy this site stumbled up it i believe kathy maister said hi robert when i use a microwavesafe dinner plate with two paper towels on the bottom and one on the top it leaves the carousel dish without a single drop of bacon fat are you cooking the bacon directly on top of the carousel if so i can understand why that would leave a big mess to clean up plus most manufacturers do not recommend cooking directly on the carousel when i make bacon i generally use a ridged bacon dish with one paper towel on top so the microwave does not get splattered and yes the fat just drips right off it works perfectly but i usually do not like to recommend buying single use kitchen items for the beginner cook please do let me know how your bacon test turns out who is going to eat all that bacon after it’s cooked elizabeth said no one says how to cook pork fresh side bacon please send a rescipe thanks kgwagner said i’ve never heard of “side” bacon and in searching around i’m not finding any recipes for it either pig sides are mostly ribs until you get to the loins brisket etc maybe you’re thinking of back bacon or as we call it in the us canadian bacon or really bad ham if you’re thinking of back bacon i think most people fry it but it’s a pretty tough cut of meat and frying doesn’t do much for it other than get it hot it has a good flavor but the texture leaves a lot to be desired i did find a recipe for “fresh” bacon but it’s from the belly i suspect it would work well for back bacon too as it calls for braising and that’s a good way to cook tougher grades you can check that out here sorry i couldn’t be of more help kathy maister said kgw you are the best i can’t thank you enough for all the valuable information you share with us here at startcookingcom your comments are always well researched and spot on the entire team here at startcookingcom values your knowledge and your friendship cheers kathy tay said kmarie chan said i think i am so naive as i just learned right now through this post that you can actually cook microwave in the bacon i do it the traditional way since my kids love bacon for breakfast i will try to cook bacon this way tomorrow…thanks for this info this is huge for me sindri said hi i just tried this with 3 strips of bacon fairly large pieces lean meat not a lot of fat no really big distinctive “thick line” of fat i tried three minutes but when i took the bacon out of the microwave the paper towels were stuck or actually more like embedded in the bacon impossible to remove so i had to throw it away what went wrong could it be because the bacon didn’t have enough fat and the paper towels were too absorbent i would really like to use this technique because it saves time when i am in a hurry i don’t have 1520 minutes to fry it in a pan most of the timestartcooking said hi sindri the sticking does indeed have to do with the fat content of the bacon once the bacon is cooked using a pair of tongs as shown in the video  remove the bacon from the paper towel immediately do not allow it to cool or it will totally stick to the paper towel given you are using extremely lean bacon try putting the bacon directly on the plate with just one paper towel on the top of the bacon good luck kathy anonymous said talia said this is the best thing ever for a college studentstartcooking said thanks taliasindri said hi it’s me again i tried this again a week back but instead of using paper towels i just used some baking sheet to cover the bacon used the same extremely lean type and it worked great also you can use the baking sheet many times if you are cooking more bacon than will fit on one plate haven’t tried it with the layering technique yet so if you are trying to microwave really lean bacon using baking paper could be a better option also on the issue of paper towels i think the best type to use is the stronger and less absorbing type a “puffy” paper towel made from recycled paper is probably more likely to end up being one with the bacon than a more fibrous “papery” typestartcooking said hmmmm given baking sheets are usually made of metal i’m amazed that you did not have sparks flying as wellcovering the bacon helps to cook the bacon and also avoid serious splattering plastic wrap would not work as it would then steam the bacon and make it very chewy instead of crispy – hence the paper towels i agree with you about not using too puffy paper towels which the bacon might end up sticking to i still can’t figure out what kind of baking sheet you might be referring tok sindri said hello kthe “sheets” i used were not made out of aluminum that would have sparked and caught fire for sure i’m sorry if i wasn’t clear what i used is called “parchment paper”  httpenwikipediaorgwikiparchmentpaper baking  it is not wax paper it’s often used when baking small pieces of pastry in a conventional oven i’m thinking i confused you by using the word “sheets” anyways…as long as vapor can escape the bacon should not turn too chewy the bacon was very crispy on my first try a little too crispy actually i only recommend this method if you are having trouble with the paper towel methodstartcooking said hi sindri thanks for the clarification parchment paper is a must for every kitchen thanks for the tip cheers kathy
