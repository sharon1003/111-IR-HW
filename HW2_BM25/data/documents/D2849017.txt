arts introduces us to the la veys a wealthy successful black family wrestling with unresolved issues of class race and check audio the play and called steak fly id like to welcome my guest first of all playwright lydia diamond she joins us by phone from boston good morning lydia diamond oh good morning cavanaugh and with me in studio starla lewis professor of black studies at san diegos mesa college good morning starla lewis good morning cavanaugh were gonna have a reading from the play a little bit later and we will be joined by a couple of actors at that time lydia tell us about the le vays the family at the center of stick fly diamond well the le vays are a fictional family when i wrote the play i knew that i wanted to write a play that sort of in a light handed way even funny way sort of explored the things that all of my work does which is my own continued confusion and disbelief around how difficult it is for us to talk about race and even harder than to navigate a class so i had these characters in my head for a long time and i knew that the presence needed to be on a place where affluent black families had a legitimate history so that was marthas vineyard i thought for a bit about hilton head which could have worked to but marthas vineyard has such a specific and long history with african americans so the le vays are  the patriarch of the family is a neurosurgeon one of the few black neurosurgeons in america he has two sons of theyre having their summer vacation one of the sons the younger son is bringing his fiance home to meet the family thats tailor and another son is bringing home a girlfriend to meet the family and i guess its not giving it away if i say that shes white cause its on all the posters theres a white girl and also in the house is the familys  the daughter of the familys live in maid her name is cheryl her mother is sick and unavailable for the summer and so cheryl has stepped in to fulfill her mothers duties cavanaugh and is it a comedy drama of manners and of various identities is that fair to say diamond i think thats fair to say but it might even imply a bit more  a certain stodginess that it doesnt have it is a comedy of manners in that i endeavor to write a well structured quote well made play so its like the comfort food of plays in that it takes place in a bifurcated house and in the kitchen in the living room and over a certain amount of time over the course of a weekend and while the subject matter can be serious the fun is actually watching the family dynamics and the way these people dance around each other theres a little love triangle kind of thing happening and those subtle sort of human dynamics are the things i think that makes the play pop cavanaugh i want to ask you do you think our society generally thinks of the black experience in this country in a limited way diamond i do think that theres a sort of monolith and i think also that we do it to ourselves too i know that as a person an african american woman i remember particularly in junior high school and high school and even college sort of prove  having to do this dance of proving my blackness and what it means to be black and from a small town in the midwest and what it means to be black and from a mostly white town in amherst massachusetts or to be the black girl in the theatre department and so yes there is certainly this sort of monolithic kind of notion that there is a black america but i think whats interesting is that though we all know that were diverse we do have the same societal challenges and yes cavanaugh and plus diamond yes thank you thats what i was trying to say cavanaugh im speaking with playwright lydia diamond she is the author of the black stick fly which is opening tonight the moolelo production of it is opening at the 10th avenue theater downtown in san diego and also here starla lewis professor of black studies here at san diegos mesa college now doctor lewis what are some of the characteristics of the black bourgeois see that you see in this play lewis well i think that the black bourgeois see like the white bourgeoisie is just taking on the very system of the society that they live in acquisition of wealth acquisition of material possessions status through education status through money status through who you know and particularly the black bourgeoisie looking at your ancestral heritage were your people free were they slaves when were they free were they connected to the master and the plantation were they not etc etc cavanaugh now you have said that there is something of a shock factor that a black family might go through being wealthy being in that upper strata of income tell us about that of lewis a shock factor cavanaugh uhhuh lewis well i think its more of an emulation factor you look and you see what is portrayed in society as successful and you want that and so sometimes it distances you from even your immediate relatives so that can be kind of shocking but i think most of all its about trying to find who you are in a society that doesnt prepare you to know who you are through the educational system or any other major institution cavanaugh lydia what inspired you to write this play diamond i was working with another play i was working on a play called voyeur de venus that was a really tragic and really emotionally trying process and i decided to sort of give myself a break and write a play while i was writing this other one that i could really enjoy writing and actually have some belly laughs as i was writing it cavanaugh thats very interesting diamond i cavanaugh and yet youre exploring such really delicate territory here diamond absolutely and i wanted to add to something that the doctor just said which is about that sort of notion of  oh how did you put it of us sort of appropriating the ideas of the popular cultures cavanaugh emulating diamond emulating for wealth i think whats also interesting with stick fly is because this family has had generations of feeling comfortable within their own elitism theres also a sort of added kind of not even identifying with upper class new bourgeoisie who are trying to find their footing in that way but actually functioning in a world that doesnt know that these people exist cavanaugh so basically what youre saying to us lydia is that this family has to deal with just about all the things that a white bourgeoisie family wealthy bourgeoisie family would have to deal with plus  plus these other elements that come from their own particular experience in america diamond i think thatd be fair to say yes cavanaugh okay tell you what were gonna have a reading from this play so lets leave it there and go into one of our pledge drive breaks and when we return well continue talking about stick fly which is opening tonight at the moolelo production at the tenth avenue theatre in downtown san diego youre listening to these days on kpbs cavanaugh im maureen cavanaugh and youre listening to these days on kpbs and we continue our discussion now about a play opening moolelos production of stick fly it begins tonight at the 10th avenue theatre and joining me are playwright lydia diamond starla lewis  is professor of black studies at mesa college she is not the playwright and joining us now two new guests actor lorene chesley she is playing the role of tailor and hassan elamin is playing the role of joe le vay well be hearing them in just a few minutes but i do wanna talk  i want to ask you dr lewis were talking about this play and were talking about the black bourgeoisie and were talking about the fact that this aspect of black life black culture in america is rarely seen in any kind of mass media situation and i  and i know that you study race and class and do you see a lot of denial among black americans who reach a certain level of wealth can you talk a little bit about that lewis well actually i think its because black people like white people are bombarded with stereotypes and a lot of african american people accept those stereotypes as true in the same way that european american people accept those stereotypes as true and so to talk about the black bourgeoisie is to have to first acknowledge their existence so yes there is the denial because if we dont see it we dont really know its there in the same way that often the black bourgeoisie denies the existence of other black people cavanaugh i see so in the way its sort of like lets see mainstream white culture would like to look at all black people in one way even in black culture theres a certain sense of denial that theres different stratas economic stratas and different levels of wealth and accomplishment within the black community lewis well are my favorite example would be the sitcom rose an rarely did you ever see white middle america working class you always saw the white bourgeoisie women in pearls you know with people vacuuming their houses and so that type exists for white people in the same way that the low income welfare project family exists as a stereotype for black people cavanaugh what did the cosby show though introduce the whole concept of the wealthy middle class black family lewis i think it brought a dimension that was so important a dimension of realism you know my doctor has five kids hes married to a lawyer so for me i was able to embrace it immediately but as i heard european americans say thats really not a typical black family i also heard african americans say well black people dont really live like that so we dont even know the diversity that exists within all the stratums of our society cavanaugh now lydia within the play stick fly your play as people converse during the course of the play the idea of race and navigating the world around this race course of race that we have in this society it permeates almost every discussion this family has how  this is a mechanism of your play more than an actual aspect of reality or am i wrong in that diamond no i dont think youre wrong obviously youre not wrong but i actually think that when you write a play youre actually only showing certain bits of conversations that happened over a longer period of time so i dont think that the play is intended to create the illusion that all these people do is walk around the house and talk about class and race it does however remind me of thanksgiving dinner christmas holidays spent with family where the topic of politics and identity and race come up because we are so happy to be with each other and be able to sort of deconstruct the lives that we live in where we dont always have people like us and when i say people like us i dont come from the black bourgeoisie i come from working class upper middle class people to sort of have a safe harbor to have those conversations and work through that i think its interesting that because weve been thirsting for stories that have  that show a different part of african american life we kind of latch onto that black bourgeoisie aspect of the play but theres a lot about relationships thats so much about father son relationships familial relationships femalemale dynamics and personal identity around work so i get the  im just nervous because i dont want it to sound as though this is a family that just walks around deconstructing race all the time cavanaugh i think you put it very well diamond okay cavanaugh were about to hear a scene from the play but before we do lorraine chesley youre playing the role of taylor in this fly of stick fly tell us a little bit about your character chesley taylor is the fiancee of spoon kent and she actually comes form her father is dr james bradley scott and hes a famous intellectual but he did not give her any of the financial  he didnt have any of the financial  any of that kind of part of him and he wasnt really emotionally there so she feels really abandoned of so she comes from a place like that she was raised by a single parent and so shes got a lot going on shes got a lot of issues in terms of you know feeling like being deserted and so she kinda goes through this and shes got a lot of issues with white people and white women taking what she feels is owed to her and not feeling seen or being heard and just trying to find her place so we kind of see her journey throughout cavanaugh okay and hassan elamin the patriarch of the family right joe le vay elamin yes absolutely joe le vay cavanaugh tell us about him elamin well hes a very intellectual individual a loving strong handed kind of father you know has been there provides for his family hes one of that two percent of african americans who have made it as far as being a neurosurgeon is concerned he enjoys life the finer things enjoys his family so hes kind of that strong father figure cavanaugh well are the two of you are gonna be gracious enough to do a reading from the play for us right now so ill let you did do that this is a reading from stick fly reading from scriptchesley does the idea of your family getting diluted piss you off a little elamin diluted chesley yeah elamin clearly theres a little cream in your coffee sweetie if it wasnt for all that dilution you think my wise people would have this house dont you know that most of the black folks got something now got it cause somewhere along the way somebody got raped in a kitchen dont look at me like that yeah we brought all the good stuff spirituality fortitude knowledge your dad wrote about that from the inner passage to the inner city chesley yeah yeah yeah dad wrote about it whatever when i try to point out the inequities im told that im too angry or crazy or it just isnt there elamin but you know its there so chesley its so perfectly set up to make us feel inferior elamin youre letting people mess with your mind little girl dont give anybody that much power nobody can make you feel inferior ive been the heard of this house coming to this island for the past 40 years ive put in hundreds of thousands of dollars of renovation but therell never be a sign out front that reads le vay this will always be the whitcomb house and ill always be the guy lucky enough to marry into the whitcomb dynasty which for a long time was a dynasty built on very little liquid money chesley then you do understand elamin i understand that you can be angry and not crazy just be a little more constructive chesley i just wish people would see it like i do am elamin your daddy saw it chesley so what he tells the white people you aint crap they give him an award you have still aint crap another award meanwhile what changes elamin are you as hard on your self as you are on your dad chesley probably elamin your dad officered you chesley im not sure of that can i see your book read this elamin james bradley scott lives in cambridge mass where hes a professor of chesley no this elamin with his wife his two kids their dog munchy two turtles and a gold fish chesley isnt that cute its on all of his books now read this elamin dedicated to shandi jackson and briana we dont need to chesley finish it elamin my heart my pride my purpose chesley i dont know what to do with that elamin that doesnt mean that he didnt love you chesley please in his funeral program i was almost acknowledged doctor james bradley scott is survived by his wife briana daughter shandi son jackson and a child from a previous marriage elamin but you know he didnt write that chesley he set the tone elamin he loved you were programmed to love our children breakfast cavanaugh that was a scene from stick fly performed by our two actors in studio hassan elamin and lorene chesley thank you so much for that elamin thank you chesley thank you cavanaugh lydia were pushing up against the clock here and i just wonder what kinds of discussion would you like to see come out of this play lydia are you with us diamond oh yes i accidentally talked offer you and good that you have mechanisms for me not to do that i just wanted to tell the actors that i so enjoyed thirds requirement reading im looking forward to meeting you

diamond i never try to put that on an audience i hope very much that they enjoy it that theyre entertained maybe shaken up enough to kind of question some of their own thing and that they talk about it on the ride home and over breakfast the next morning but mostly i just want people to have a satisfying evening in the theatre and you know listening to these actors obviously they will cavanaugh
