blaydes shipyard in hull yorkshire in england the royal navy purchased her for £ 1950 on 23 may 1787 equivalent to £209000 in 2016 refit and renamed her bounty 2 the ship was relatively small at 215 tons but had three masts and was fullrigged after conversion for the breadfruit expedition she was equipped with four 4pounder 18 kg 5 cannon and ten swivel guns1787 breadfruit expedition  editmain article mutiny on the bounty preparations  editthe ship had been purchased by the royal navy for a single mission in support of an experiment the acquisition of breadfruit plants from tahiti and the transportation of those plants to the west indies in the hope that they would grow well there and become a cheap source of food for slaves the experiment was proposed by sir joseph banks who recommended william bligh as commander who in turn was promoted through a prize offered by the royal society of arts in june 1787 the bounty was refitted at deptford the great cabin was converted to house the potted breadfruit plants and gratings were fitted to the upper deck william bligh was appointed commanding lieutenant of the bounty on 16 august 1787 at the age of 33 after a career that included a tour as sailing master of james cook s resolution during cooks third and final voyage 1776–80 the ships complement was 46 men a single commissioned officer bligh 43 other royal navy personnel and two civilian botanists voyage out  editon 23 december 1787 the bounty sailed from spithead for tahiti for a full month the crew attempted to take the ship around cape horn but adverse weather prevented this bligh then proceeded east rounding the southern tip of africa  cape agulhas and crossing the width of the indian ocean during the outward voyage bligh demoted sailing master john fryer replacing him with fletcher christian this act seriously damaged the relationship between bligh and fryer and fryer later claimed that blighs act was entirely personal bligh is commonly portrayed as the epitome of abusive sailing captains but this portrayal has recently come into dispute caroline alexander points out in her 2003 book the bounty that bligh was relatively lenient compared with other british naval officers 6 bligh enjoyed the patronage of sir joseph banks a wealthy botanist and influential figure in britain at the time that together with his experience sailing with cook familiarity with navigation in the area and local customs were probably important factors in his appointment 7the bounty reached tahiti on 26 october 1788 after ten months at sea bligh and his crew spent five months in tahiti then called otaheite collecting and preparing 1015 breadfruit plants to be transported bligh allowed the crew to live ashore and care for the potted breadfruit plants and they became socialized to the customs and culture of the tahitians many of the seamen and some of the young gentlemen had themselves tattooed in native fashion masters mate and acting lieutenant fletcher christian married maimiti a tahitian woman others of the bounty  s warrant officers and seamen were also said to have formed connections with native women after five months in tahiti the bounty set sail with her breadfruit cargo on 4 april 1789 mutiny and destruction of the ship  editmutineers turning bligh and crew adrift by rober dodd 1790some 1300 miles 2100 km west of tahiti near tonga mutiny broke out on 28 april 1789 despite strong words and threats heard on both sides the ship was taken bloodlessly and apparently without struggle by any of the loyalists except bligh himself of the 42 men on board aside from bligh and christian 22 joined christian in mutiny two were passive and 18 remained loyal to bligh the mutineers ordered bligh two midshipmen the surgeons mate ledward and the ships clerk into the ships boat several more men voluntarily joined bligh rather than remain aboard bligh and his men sailed the open boat 30 nautical miles 56 km to tofua in search of supplies but were forced to flee after attacks by hostile natives resulted in the death of one of the men bligh then undertook an arduous journey to the dutch settlement of coupang located over 3500 nautical miles 6500 km from tofua he safely landed there 47 days later having lost no men during the voyage except the one killed on tofua 8the mutineers sailed for the island of tubuai where they tried to settle after three months of bloody conflict with the natives however they returned to tahiti sixteen of the mutineers – including the four loyalists who had been unable to accompany bligh – remained there taking their chances that the royal navy would find them and bring them to justice hms pandora was sent out by the admiralty in november 1790 in pursuit of the bounty to capture the mutineers and bring them back to england to face a court martial she arrived in march 1791 and captured fourteen men within two weeks they were locked away in a makeshift wooden prison on the pandora  s quarterdeck the men called their cell pandoras box they remained in their prison until 29 august 1791 when the pandora was wrecked on the great barrier reef with the loss of 35 lives four of them stewart sumner skinner and hildebrand were mutineers immediately after setting the sixteen men ashore in tahiti in september 1789 fletcher christian eight other crewmen six tahitian men and 11 women one with a baby set sail in the bounty hoping to elude the royal navy according to a journal kept by one of christians followers the tahitians were actually kidnapped when christian set sail without warning them the purpose of this being to acquire the women the mutineers passed through the fiji and cook islands but feared that they would be found there continuing their quest for a safe haven on 15 january 1790 they rediscovered pitcairn island which had been misplaced on the royal navys charts after the decision was made to settle on pitcairn livestock and other provisions were removed from the bounty to prevent the ships detection and anyones possible escape the ship was burned on 23 january 1790 in what is now called bounty bay bounty bay where the bounty was crashed and burnt the mutineers remained undetected on pitcairn until february 1808 when sole remaining mutineer john adams and the surviving tahitian women and their children were discovered by the boston sealer topaz commanded by captain mayhew folger of nantucket massachusetts seventeen years later in 1825 hms blossom on a voyage of exploration under captain frederick william beechey arrived on christmas day off pitcairn and spent 19 days there captain beechey later recorded this in his 1831 published account of the voyage as did one of his crew john bechervaise in his 1839 thirtysix years of a seafaring life by an old quarter master beechey wrote a detailed account of the mutiny as recounted to him by the last survivor adams bechervaise who described the life of the islanders says he found the remains of the bounty and took some pieces of wood from it which were turned into souvenirs such as snuff boxes mission details  editmap showing the bounty  s movements in the pacific ocean

of the voyage of hmav bounty are very well documented largely due to the effort of bligh to maintain an accurate log before during and after the actual mutiny bounty  s crew list is also well chronicled down to and including the names of every seaman on board something which larger ships in the rating system only occasionally were capable of due to crews in the hundreds whereas the bounty carried fewer than fifty personnel blighs original log remained intact throughout his ordeal and was used as a major piece of evidence in his own trial for the loss of the bounty as well as the subsequent trial of captured mutineers the original log is presently maintained at a museum in new south wales with available transcripts in both print and electronic format 9mission log  edit178716

arrived portsmouth harbour crew list  editpage one of blighs list of mutineers – starting with fletcher christian in the 18th century royal navy rank and position on board ship were defined by a mix of two hierarchies—an official hierarchy of ranks  commissioned officers warrant officers petty officers and seamen and a conventionally recognized social division between gentlemen and nongentlemen royal navy uniforms were often used to denote rank and position on board ships however uniforms were not worn daily on board while bounty was underway due to the lengthy and isolated voyage at the top of the official rank hierarchy were the commissioned officers on a larger warship the commissioned officers included the captain several lieutenants to command watches and the officers commanding the royal marines on board the ship the bounty however carried no marines and no commissioned officers other than lieutenant bligh himself who served as master and commander of the ship he was the ships captain and he occupied a private cabin next below the commissioned officers came the warrant officers such as the sailing master surgeon boatswain purser and gunner who were as likely to be considered skilled tradesmen as gentlemen as the senior warrant officer the sailing master and his mates were entitled to berth with the lieutenants in the wardroom though in this case there were no lieutenants there other warrant officers berthed in the gunroom like commissioned officers warrant officers had the right of access to the quarterdeck and were immune from punishment by flogging they held their warrants directly from the navy and the captain could not alter their rank roman catholics were allowed to serve as warrant officers but not as commissioned officers below the warrant officers came the petty officers the petty officers included two separate groups young gentlemen training to be future commissioned officers often serving as midshipmen or masters mates and tradesmen working as skilled assistants to the warrant officers the young gentlemen technically were ratings holding a rank below warrant officers at the mercy of the captain but as aspiring future commissioned officers they were considered socially superior and were often given a watch with authority over some warrant officers or a minor command finally at the bottom of the hierarchical tree were the seamen divided into able seamen and ordinary seamen aboard some vessels an even lower grade existed called landsmen who were seamenintraining with very little or no naval skill the only seamen mustered into the crew of the bounty were able seamen the ship did not carry any ordinary seamen or landsmen due to the vessels long and fairly important mission note however that the young gentlemen might also be rated as seamen rather than midshipmen on the ships books though they were still considered the social superiors of the seamen petty officers excluding other young gentlemen and most warrant officers and could be given authority over them in the immediate wake of the mutiny all but four of the loyal crew joined captain bligh in the long boat for the voyage to timor and eventually made it safely back to england unless otherwise noted in the table below four were detained against their will on the bounty for their needed skills and for lack of space on the long boat the mutineers first returned to tahiti where most of the survivors were later captured by the pandora and taken to england for trial nine mutineers continued their flight from the law and eventually settled pitcairn

discovered the remains of the bounty in january 1957 after spotting remains of the rudder 11 which had been found in 1933 by parkin christian and is still displayed in the fiji museum in suva he persuaded his editors and writers to let him dive off pitcairn island where the rudder had been found despite the warnings of one islander – man you gwen be dead as a hatchet 12 – marden dived for several days in the dangerous swells near the island and found the remains of the ship a rudder pin nails a ships boat oarlock fittings and a bounty anchor that he raised 11 15 he subsequently met with marlon brando to counsel him on his role as fletcher christian in the 1962 film mutiny on the bounty later in life marden wore cuff links made of nails from the bounty marden also dived on the wreck of hms pandora and left a bounty nail with pandora some of the bounty  s remains such as the ballast stones are still partially visible in the waters of bounty bay the last of bounty  s four 4pounder cannon was recovered in 1998 by an archaeological team from james cook university and was sent to the queensland museum in townsville to be stabilised through lengthy conservation treatment ie nearly 40 months of electrolysis the gun was subsequently returned to pitcairn island where it has been placed on display in a new community hall modern bounty reconstructions  editus coast guard
