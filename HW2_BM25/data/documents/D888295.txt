loading the player what is a liabilitya liability is a companys financial debt or obligations that arise during the course of its business operations liabilities are settled over time through the transfer of economic benefits including money goods or services recorded on the right side of the balance sheet liabilities include loans accounts payable mortgages deferred revenues and accrued expenses liabilities are a vital aspect of a company because they are used to finance operations and pay for large expansions they can also make transactions between businesses more efficient for example in most cases if a wine supplier sells a case of wine to a restaurant it does not demand payment when it delivers the goods rather it invoices the restaurant for the purchase to streamline the dropoff and make paying easier for the restaurant the outstanding money that the restaurant owes to its wine supplier is considered a liability in contrast the wine supplier considers the money it is owed to be an asset other definitions of liability generally liability refers to the state of being responsible for something and this term can refer to any money or service owed to another party tax liability for example can refer to the property taxes that a homeowner owes to the municipal government or the income tax he owes to the federal government liability may also refer to the legal liability of a business or individual for example many businesses take out liability insurance in case a customer or employee sues them for negligence current versus longterm liabilities businesses sort their liabilities into two categories current and longterm current liabilities are debts payable within one year while longterm liabilities are debts payable over a longer period for example if a business takes out a mortgage payable over a 15year period that is a longterm liability however the mortgage payments that are due during the current year are considered the current portion of longterm debt and are recorded in the shortterm liabilities section of the balance sheet ideally analysts want to see that a company can pay current liabilities which are due within a year with cash some examples of shortterm liabilities include payroll expenses and accounts payable which includes money owed to vendors monthly utilities and similar expenses in contrast analysts want to see that longterm liabilities can be paid with assets derived from future earnings or financing transactions debt is not the only longterm liability companies incur items like rent deferred taxes payroll and pension obligations can also be listed under longterm liabilities the relationship between liabilities and assets assets are the things a company owns and they include tangible items such as buildings machinery and equipment as well as intangible items such as accounts receivable patents or intellectual property if a business subtracts its liabilities from its assets the difference is its owners or stockholders equity this relationship can be expressed as assets  liabilities  owners equity however in most cases this equation is commonly presented as liabilities  equity  assets what is the difference between an expense and a liability an expense is the cost of operations that a company incurs to generate revenue unlike assets and liabilities expenses are related to revenue and both are listed on a companys income statement in short expenses are used to calculate net income the equation to calculate net income is revenues minus expenses for example if a company has more expenses than revenues for the past three years it may signal weak financial stability because it has been losing money for those years expenses and liabilities should not be confused with each other one is listed on a companys balance sheet and the other is listed on the companys income statement expenses are the costs of a companys operation while liabilities are the obligations and debts a company owes next up current liabilities other longterm liabilities adjusted liabilities unlimited liability breaking down liability
