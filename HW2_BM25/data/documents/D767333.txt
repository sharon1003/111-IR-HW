english language west germanic language of the indoeuropean language family that is closely related to frisian german and dutch in belgium called flemish languages english originated in england and is the dominant language of the united states the united kingdom canada australia ireland new zealand and various island nations in the caribbean sea and the pacific ocean it is also an official language of india the philippines singapore and many countries in subsaharan africa including south africa english is the first choice of foreign language in most other countries of the world and it is that status that has given it the position of a global lingua franca it is estimated that about a third of the world’s population some two billion persons now use englishglobal use of the english language map showing the use of english as a first language as an important second language and as an official language in countries around the world english language map showing the use of the english language as a national primary or widely spoken language in countries around the world encyclopædia britannica inc origins and basic characteristics english belongs to the indoeuropean family of languages and is therefore related to most other languages spoken in europe and western asia from iceland to india the parent tongue called protoindoeuropean was spoken about 5000 years ago by nomads believed to have roamed the southeast european plains germanic one of the language groups descended from this ancestral speech is usually divided by scholars into three regional groups east burgundian vandal and gothic all extinct north  icelandic faroese norwegian swedish and danish  and west  german dutch and flemish frisian and english though closely related to english german remains far more conservative than english in its retention of a fairly elaborate system of inflections frisian spoken by the inhabitants of the dutch province of friesland and the islands off the west coast of schleswig is the language most nearly related to modern english icelandic which has changed little over the last thousand years is the living language most nearly resembling old english in grammatical structure approximate locations of indoeuropean languages in contemporary eurasia encyclopædia britannica inc modern english is analytic ie relatively uninflected whereas protoindoeuropean the ancestral tongue of most of the modern european languages eg german french russian greek was synthetic or inflected during the course of thousands of years english words have been slowly simplified from the inflected variable forms found in sanskrit greek latin russian and german toward invariable forms as in chinese and vietnamese the german and chinese words for the noun man are exemplary german has five forms mann mannes manne männer männern chinese has one form ren english stands in between with four forms man man’s men men’s in english only nouns pronouns as in he him his  adjectives as in big bigger biggest  and verbs are inflected english is the only european language to employ uninflected adjectives eg the tall man the tall woman compared to spanish el hombre alto and la mujer alta as for verbs if the modern english word ride is compared with the corresponding words in old english and modern german it will be found that english now has only 5 forms  ride rides rode riding ridden  whereas old english ridan had 13 and modern german reiten has 16 in addition to the simplicity of inflections english has two other basic characteristics flexibility of function and openness of vocabulary flexibility of function has grown over the last five centuries as a consequence of the loss of inflections words formerly distinguished as nouns or verbs by differences in their forms are now often used as both nouns and verbs one can speak for example of planning a table or tabling a plan booking a place or placing a book lifting a thumb or thumbing a lift in the other indoeuropean languages apart from rare exceptions in scandinavian languages nouns and verbs are never identical because of the necessity of separate noun and verb endings in english forms for traditional pronouns adjectives and adverbs can also function as nouns adjectives and adverbs as verbs and nouns pronouns and adverbs as adjectives one speaks in english of the frankfurt book fair but in german one must add the suffix er to the placename and put attributive and noun together as a compound frankfurter buchmesse in french one has no choice but to construct a phrase involving the use of two prepositions foire du livre de francfort in english it is now possible to employ a plural noun as adjunct modifier as in wages board and sports editor or even a conjunctional group as in prices and incomes policy and parks and gardens committee any word class may alter its function in this way the ins and outs prepositions becoming nouns no buts conjunction becoming noun openness of vocabulary implies both free admission of words from other languages and the ready creation of compounds and derivatives english adopts without change or adapts with slight change any word really needed to name some new object or to denote some new process words from more than 350 languages have entered english in this way like french spanish and russian english frequently forms scientific terms from classical greek word elements although a germanic language in its sounds and grammar the bulk of english vocabulary is in fact romance or classical in origin english possesses a system of orthography that does not always accurately reflect the pronunciation of words see below orthography characteristics of modern english phonology british received pronunciation rp traditionally defined as the standard speech used in london and southeastern england is one of many forms or accents of standard speech throughout the englishspeaking world other pronunciations although not standard are often heard in the public domain a very small percentage of the population of england is estimated to use “pure” rp although the actual percentage is as unknown as what constitutes “pure” rp it is considered the prestige accent in such institutions as the civil service and the bbc and as such has fraught associations with wealth and privilege in britain shakespeare william elizabethan english pronunciation hear the original pronunciation of elizabethan english as demonstrated and explained by british linguist david crystal and his actor son ben crystal actors at the rebuilt globe theatre london have used this pronunciation in performances of william shakespeares plays© open university the chief differences between rp as defined above and a variety of american english such as inland northern the speech form of western new england and its derivatives often popularly referred to as general american are in the pronunciation of certain individual vowels and diphthongs inland northern american vowels sometimes have semiconsonantal final glides ie sounds resembling initial w for example or initial y  aside from the final glides that american accent shows four divergences from british english 1 the words cod box dock hot and not are pronounced with a short or halflong low front sound as in british bard shortened the terms front back low and high refer to the position of the tongue 2 words such as bud but cut and rung are pronounced with a central vowel as in the unstressed final syllable of sofa 3 before the fricative sounds s f and θ the last of these is the th sound in thin the long low back vowel a as in british bath is pronounced as a short front vowel a as in british bad 4 high back vowels following the alveolar sounds t and d and the nasal sound n in words such as tulips dew and news are pronounced without a glide as in british english indeed the words sound like the british two lips do and nooze in snooze in several american accents however these glides do occur the 24 consonant sounds comprise six stops plosives p b t d k g the fricatives f v θ as in thin  ð eth as in then  s z ∫ esh as in ship  ʒ as in pleasure  and h two affricatives t∫ as in church and d ʒ as the j in jam  the nasals m n ŋ the sound that occurs at the end of words such as young  the lateral l the postalveolar or retroflex r and the semivowels j often spelled y and w these remain fairly stable but inland northern american differs from rp in two respects 1 r following vowels is preserved in words such as door flower and harmony whereas it is lost in rp 2 t between vowels is voiced so that metal and matter sound very much like british medal and madder although the pronunciation of this t is softer and less aspirated or breathy than the d of british english like russian english is a strongly stressed language four degrees of accentuation may be differentiated primary secondary tertiary and weak which may be indicated respectively by acute ´ circumflex ˆ and grave ˋ accent marks and by the breve ˘ thus “têll mè thĕ trúth” the whole truth and nothing but the truth may be contrasted with “têll mé thĕ trûth” whatever you may tell other people “bláck bîrd” any bird black in colour may be contrasted with “bláckbìrd” that particular bird turdus merula  the verbs permít and recórd henceforth only primary stresses are marked may be contrasted with their corresponding nouns pérmit and récord a feeling for antepenultimate third syllable from the end primary stress revealed in such fivesyllable words as equanímity longitúdinal notoríety opportúnity parsimónious pertinácity and vegetárian causes stress to shift when extra syllables are added as in histórical a derivative of hístory and theatricálity a derivative of theátrical vowel qualities are also changed here and in such word groups as périod periódical periodícity phótograph photógraphy photográphable french stress may be sustained in many borrowed words eg bizárre critíque duréss hotél prestíge and techníque pitch or musical tone determined chiefly by the rate of vibration of the vocal cords may be level falling rising or falling–rising in counting one two three four one naturally gives level pitch to each of these cardinal numerals but if people say i want two not one they naturally give two a falling tone and one a falling–rising tone in the question one rising pitch is used word tone is called accent and sentence tone is referred to as intonation the endofsentence cadence is important for expressing differences in meaning several endofsentence intonations are possible but three are especially common falling rising and falling–rising falling intonation is used in completed statements direct commands and sometimes in general questions unanswerable by yes or no eg i have nothing to add keep to the right who told you that  rising intonation is frequently used in openended statements made with some reservation in polite requests and in particular questions answerable by yes or no eg i have nothing more to say at the moment let me know how you get on are you sure  the third type of endofsentence intonation first falling and then rising pitch is used in sentences that imply concessions or contrasts eg some people do like them but others do not don’t say i didn’t warn you because that is just what i’m now doing intonation is on the whole less singsong in american than in british english and there is a narrower range of pitch everywhere english is spoken regional accents display distinctive patterns of intonation morphology inflection modern english nouns pronouns adjectives and verbs are inflected adverbs prepositions conjunctions and interjections are invariable most english nouns have plural inflection in  e s but that form shows variations in pronunciation in the words cats with a final s sound dogs with a final z sound and horses with a final iz sound as also in the 3rd person singular presenttense forms of verbs cuts  s  jogs  z  and forces  iz  seven nouns have mutated umlauted plurals man men woman women tooth teeth foot feet goose geese mouse mice louse lice three have plurals in en ox oxen child children brother brethren some remain unchanged eg deer sheep moose grouse  five of the seven personal pronouns have distinctive forms for subject and object eg hehim sheher  adjectives have distinctive endings for comparison eg comparative bigger superlative biggest  with several irregular forms eg good better best  the forms of verbs are not complex only the substantive verb  to be has eight forms be am is are was were being been strong verbs have five forms ride rides rode riding ridden regular or weak verbs customarily have four walk walks walked walking some that end in t or d have three forms only cut cuts cutting in addition to the above inflections english employs two other main morphological structural processes—affixation and composition—and two subsidiary ones—backformation and blend affixation affixes word elements attached to words may either precede as prefixes  do undo way subway  or follow as suffixes  do doer way wayward  they may be native  overdo waywardness  greek  hyperbole thesis  or latin  supersede pediment  modern technologists greatly favour the neohellenic prefixes macro “long large” micro “small” para “alongside” poly “many” and the latin mini “small” with its antonym maxi the early internet era popularized cyber “of computers or computer networks” and mega “vast” greek and latin affixes have become so fully acclimatized that they can occur together in one and the same word as indeed in acclimatized just used consisting of a latin prefix plus a greek stem plus a greek suffix plus an english inflection suffixes are bound more closely than prefixes to the stems or root elements of words consider for instance the wide variety of agent suffixes in the nouns act or artis an dot ard engin eer financ ier hire ling magistr ate merch ant scient ist secret ary song ster stud ent and work er suffixes may come to be attached to stems quite fortuitously but once attached they are likely to be permanent at the same time one suffix can perform many functions the suffix er denotes the doer of the action in the words worker driver and hunter the instrument in chopper harvester and roller and the dweller in icelander londoner and trobriander it refers to things or actions associated with the basic concept in the words breather “pause to take breath” diner “dining car on a train” and fiver “fivepound note” in the terms disclaimer misnomer and rejoinder all from french the suffix denotes one single instance of the action expressed by the verb usage may prove capricious whereas a writer is a person a typewriter is a machine for some time a computer was both but now the word is no longer used of persons composition composition or compounding is concerned with free forms the primary compounds cloverleaf gentleman and less obviously because of the spelling already show the collocation of two free forms they differ from word groups or phrases in stress juncture or vowel quality or by a combination of these thus already differs from all ready in stress and juncture cloverleaf from clover leaf in stress and gentleman from gentle man in vowel quality stress and juncture in describing the structure of compound words it is necessary to take into account the relation of components to each other and the relation of the whole compound to its components these relations diverge widely in for example the words cloverleaf icebreaker breakwater blackbird peaceloving and paperback in cloverleaf the first component noun is attributive and modifies the second as also in the terms aircraft beehive landmark lifeline network and vineyard icebreaker however is a compound made up of noun object plus agent noun itself consisting of verb plus agent suffix as also in the words bridgebuilder landowner metalworker minelayer and timekeeper the next type consists of verb plus object it is rare in english dutch and german but frequent in french spanish and italian the english pastime may be compared for example with the french passetemps the spanish pasatiempo and the italian passatempo from french comes passport meaning “pass ie enter harbour” from italian comes portfolio meaning “carry leaf” other words of this type are daredevil scapegrace and scarecrow as for the blackbird type consisting of attributive adjective plus noun it occurs frequently as in the terms bluebell grandson shorthand and wildfire the next type composed of object noun and a present participle as in the terms factfinding heartrending german herzzerreissend  lifegiving german lebenspendend  painstaking and timeconsuming occurs rarely the last type is seen in barefoot bluebeard hunchback leatherneck redbreast and scatterbrain backformations blends and other types of wordformation backformations and blends are widespread backformation is the reverse of affixation being the analogical creation of a new word from an existing word falsely assumed to be its derivative for example the verb to edit has been formed from the noun editor on the reverse analogy of the noun actor from to act and similarly the verbs automate bulldoze commute escalate liaise loaf sightsee and televise are backformed from the nouns automation bulldozer commuter escalation liaison loafer sightseer and television from the single noun procession are backformed two verbs with different stresses and meanings procéss “to walk in procession” and prócess “to subject food and other material to a special operation”blends fall into two groups 1 coalescences such as bash from bang and smash and 2 telescoped forms called portmanteau words such as motorcade from motor cavalcade in the first group are the words clash from clack and crash and geep offspring of goat and sheep to the second group belong dormobiles or dormitory automobiles and slurbs or slum suburbs a travel monologue becomes a travelogue and a telegram sent by cable a cablegram aviation electronics becomes avionics biology electronics bionics and nuclear electronics nucleonics in cablese a question mark is a quark in computerese a binary unit is a bit in astrophysics a quasistellar source of radio energy becomes a quasar and a pulsating star becomes a pulsar simple shortenings such as ad for advertisement that some time ago might have been sneered at by some are now in common use they are listed in dictionaries side by side with their full forms among such abbreviations are exam gym lab lib op spec sub tech veg and vet compound shortenings after the pattern of russian agitprop for agitatsiya propaganda are also used initial syllables are joined as in the words linocut  lino leum cut and fortran  for mula tran slation these shortenings are not uncommon in and often become the names of corporations and other organizations fed ex  fed eral ex press intelsat  in ternational tel ecommunications sat ellite organization syntax sentences can be classified as follows a simple containing one clause and predication jane knows this country b multiple or compound containing two or more coordinate clauses jane has been here before and she knows this country c complex containing one or more main clauses and one or more subordinate clauses jane who has been here before knows this country or because she has been here before jane knows this country simple declarative affirmative sentences have two main patterns with five subsidiary patterns within each verb and complement together form the predicate “complement” is used here to cover both the complement and the object of traditional grammarians the table listing sentences 1 through 5 provides examples of the first main pattern the sentences of the first pattern consist of three parts subject verb and complement in jane knows this country 1 the complement is the direct object of a transitive verb in science is organized knowledge 2 it is a predicative nominal group forming the second component of an equation linked to the first part by the meaningless copula is in elizabeth becomes queen 3 it is a predicative noun linked with the subject by the meaningful copula becomes in the captain falls sick 4 it is a predicative adjective and in nothing passes unobserved 5 it is a predicative past participle simple sentences—first patternsubject verb complement1 jane knows this country2 science is organized knowledge3 elizabeth becomes queen4 the captain falls sick5 nothing passes unobserved the table listing sentences 6 through 10 shows the second pattern in the second main pattern each sentence contains four components subject verb and two complements first and second or inner and outer in john gives mary a ring 6 inner and outer complements consist of indirect object without preposition followed by direct object in the sailors make john captain 7 these complements are direct object and appositive noun in you have kept your record clean 8 direct object and predicative adjective in the driver finds the road flooded 9 direct object and predicative past participle and in we want you to know 10 direct object and predicative infinitive simple sentences—second patternsubject verb inner complement outer complement6 john gives mary a ring7 the sailors make john captain8 you have kept your record clean9 the driver finds the road flooded10 we want you to know one can seldom change the word order in these 10 sentences without doing something else—adding or subtracting a word changing the meaning there is no better way of appreciating the importance of word position than by scrutinizing the 10 frames illustrated if for instance in 6 one reverses inner and outer complements one adds to and says john gives a ring to mary one does not say john gives a ring mary some verbs such as explain and say never omit the preposition to before the indirect object john’s mother explained the details to her son if in 10 the inner and outer complements are reversed eg we want to know you  the meaning is changed as well as the structure apart from these fundamental rules of word order the principles governing the positions of adjectives adverbs and prepositions call for brief comment for attributive adjectives the rule is simple single words regularly precede the noun and word groups follow—eg an unforgettable experience but an experience never to be forgotten it is also possible however to abandon this principle and switch groups to front position a never to be forgotten experience in the ordering of multiple epithets on the other hand some tendencies can be seen attributes denoting permanent qualities stand nearest their head nouns long white beard sixlane elevated freeway the order in multiple attribution tends to be as follows determiner quantifier adjective of quality adjective of size shape or texture adjective of colour or material noun adjunct if any head noun examples include that one solid round oak dining table these many fine large black racehorses those countless memorable long bright summer evenings adverbs are more mobile than adjectives nevertheless some principles seem to be at work adverbs of frequency tend to come immediately after the substantive verb  you are often late  before other verbs  you never know  and between auxiliaries and full verbs  you can never tell  in this last instance however american differs from british usage most americans would place the adverb before the auxiliary and say you never can tell in the title of his play of that name first performed in 1899 george bernard shaw avowedly followed american usage adverbs of time usually occur at the beginning or end of a sentence seldom in the middle particular expressions normally precede more general ones the bridge opened at 9 o’clock in the morning on october 23 of last year an adverb of place or direction follows a verb with which it is semantically bound we arrived home after dark other adverbs normally take end positions in the order of manner place and time the bird flew suddenly manner from the tree place a few minutes ago time in spite of its etymology latin praepositio “before placing” a preposition may sometimes follow the noun it governs as in all the world over slept the clock round and the whole place through this seems a good place to live in seems more natural to most speakers than this seems a good place in which to live have you anything to open this can with is more common than have you anything with which to open this can the above are principles rather than rules and such structural flexibility makes it easy to find ambiguity in isolated sentences when walking snipe always approach up wind a shooting manual directs the writer intends the reader to understand “when you are walking to flush snipe always approach them up against the wind” john kept the car in the garage can mean either 1 “john retained that car you see in the garage and sold his other one” or 2 “john housed the car in the garage and not elsewhere” flying planes can be dangerous is ambiguous because it may mean either 1 “planes that fly can be dangerous” or 2 “it is dangerous to fly planes” on the other hand such “ambiguities” almost always disappear when the sentences are seen in context two ways in which john gives mary a ring can be stated in the passive are 1 a ring is given to mary by john and 2 mary is given a ring by john concerning this same action four types of questions can be formulated 1 who gives mary a ring the information sought is the identity of the giver 2 does john give mary a ring the question may be answered by yes or no 3 john gives mary a ring doesn’t he confirmation is sought of the questioner’s belief that john does in fact give mary a ring 4 john gives mary a ring this form differing from the declarative statement only by the question mark in writing or by rising intonation in speech calls like sentences 2 and 3 for a yes or no answer but suggests doubt on the part of the questioner that the action is taking place vocabulary the vocabulary of modern english is approximately a quarter germanic old english scandinavian dutch german and twothirds italic or romance especially latin french spanish italian with copious and increasing importations from greek in science and technology and with considerable borrowings from more than 300 other languages names of many basic concepts and things come from old english or anglosaxon heaven and earth love and hate life and death beginning and end day and night month and year heat and cold way and path meadow and stream cardinal numerals come from old english as do all the ordinal numerals except second old english other which still retains its older meaning in “every other day” second comes from latin secundus “following” through french second related to latin sequi “to follow” as in english sequence from old english come all the personal pronouns except they their and them which are from scandinavian the auxiliary verbs except the marginal used which is from french most simple prepositions and all conjunctions numerous nouns would be identical whether they came from old english or scandinavian father mother brother but not sister  man wife ground land tree grass summer winter cliff dale many verbs would also be identical especially monosyllabic verbs— bring come get hear meet see set sit spin stand think the same is true of the adjectives full and wise the colour names gray  grey  green and white the possessives mine and thine but not ours and yours  the terms north and west but not south and east  and the prepositions over and under just a few english and scandinavian doublets coexist in current speech no and nay yea and ay from and fro rear ie “to bring up” and raise shirt and skirt both related to the adjective short  less and loose from scandinavian law was borrowed early whence bylaw

french so too are duke marquis viscount and baron but king queen lord lady earl and knight are english city village court palace manor mansion residence and domicile are french but town borough hall house bower room and home are english comparison between the many pairs of english and french synonyms shows that the former are more human and concrete the latter more intellectual and abstract eg the terms freedom and liberty friendship and amity hatred and enmity love and affection likelihood and probability truth and veracity lying and mendacity the superiority of french cooking is duly recognized by the adoption of such culinary terms as boil broil fry grill roast souse and toast breakfast is english but dinner and supper are french hunt is english but chase quarry scent and track

draper haberdasher joiner mason painter plumber and tailor many terms relating to dress and fashion cuisine and viniculture politics and diplomacy drama and literature art and ballet come from french in the spheres of science and technology many terms come from classical greek through french or directly from greek pioneers in research and development now regard greek as a kind of inexhaustible quarry from which they can draw linguistic material at will by prefixing the greek adverb tēle “far away distant” to the existing compound photography “light writing” they create the precise though today rarely used term telephotography to denote the photographing of distant objects by means of a special lens known as a telephoto lens by inserting the prefix micro “small” into this same compound they make the new term photomicrography denoting the electronic photographing of bacteria and viruses such neohellenic derivatives would probably have been unintelligible to plato and aristotle many

transformation in mythology metamorphosis signifies a magical shape changing in nature it denotes a postembryonic development such as that of a tadpole into a frog a cocoon into a silkworm or a chrysalis into a butterfly transformation on the other hand means any kind of change from one state to another ever since the 12th century when merchants from the netherlands made homes in east anglia dutch words have infiltrated into midland speech for centuries a form of low german was used by seafaring men in north sea ports old nautical terms still in use include buoy deck dock freebooter hoist leak pump skipper and yacht the dutch in new amsterdam later new york and adjacent settlements gave the words boss cookie dope snoop and waffle to american speech the dutch in cape province gave the terms apartheid commandeer commando spoor and trek to south african speech the contribution of high german has been on a different level in the 18th and 19th centuries it lay in technicalities of geology and mineralogy and in abstractions relating to literature philosophy and psychology in the 20th century this contribution was sometimes indirect unclear and meaningful echoed german unklar and

added k for use in abbreviations and y and z in words transcribed from greek after its adoption by the english this 23letter alphabet developed w as a ligatured doubling of u and later j and v as consonantal variants of i and u the resultant alphabet of 26 letters has both uppercase or capital and lowercase or small letters english spelling is based for the most part on that of the 15th century but pronunciation has changed considerably since then especially that of long vowels and diphthongs the extensive change in the pronunciation of vowels known as the great vowel shift affected all of geoffrey chaucer ’s seven long vowels and for centuries spelling remained untidy if the meaning of the message was clear the spelling of individual words seemed unimportant in the 17th century compositors began to adopt fixed spellings for practical reasons and in the orderloving 18th century uniformity became more and more fashionable since samuel johnson ’s dictionary of the english language 1755 orthography has remained fairly stable numerous changes such as music for musick  c 1880 and fantasy for phantasy  c 1920 have been accepted but spelling has nevertheless continued to be in part unphonetic attempts have been made at reform indeed every century has had its reformers since the 13th when an augustinian canon named orm devised his own method of differentiating short vowels from long by doubling the succeeding consonants or when this was not feasible by marking short vowels with a superimposed breve mark ˘ william caxton who set up his wooden printing press at westminster in 1476 was much concerned with spelling problems throughout his working life noah webster produced his spelling book in 1783 as a precursor to the first edition 1828 of his american dictionary of the english language the 20th century produced many zealous reformers three systems supplementary to traditional spelling were proposed for different purposes 1 the initial teaching augmented roman alphabet  ita of 44 letters used by some educationists in the 1970s and ’80s in the teaching of children under age seven 2 the shaw alphabet of 48 letters designed in the implementation of the will of george bernard shaw and 3 the international phonetic alphabet ipa constructed on the basis of one symbol for one individual sound and used by many trained linguists countless other systems have been worked out from time to time such as r e zachrisson’s “anglic” 1930 and axel wijk’s regularized english 1959 international phonetic alphabet the international phonetic alphabet chart international phonetic association department of linguistics university of victoria victoria british columbia canada drastic reform remains impracticable undesirable and unlikely this is because there is no longer one criterion of correct pronunciation but several standards throughout the world regional standards are themselves not static but changing with each new
