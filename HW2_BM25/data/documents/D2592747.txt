physically resides and the daytoday care the child receives such as bathing meal preparation and transportation“legal custody” concerns the right of a parent to make important decisions in a child’s life such as decisions about the child’s education religious and cultural upbringing and health and wellness what does it mean if custody is “sole” or “joint” in indiana the distinction between sole and joint custody is very important a “joint” custody award means the parties will share custody to some degree but a “sole” custody award means that one parent is given all or most rights if i don’t agree with how my child is being raised do i have to go to court in indiana it’s not necessary to go to court to resolve a custody dispute many parents are able to work out a mutually satisfying settlement of their custody issues other parents are able to settle custodial disputes through alternative measures such as mediation however when parents absolutely can’t agree about what’s best for their child they go to court in the state of indiana custody cases are tried before a judge who decides the case without a jury and issues a written order or “decree” that contains the final decision judges sometimes get help when they’re making custody decisions they can request reports from neutral outside entities like private evaluators courtappointed guardians and social service agencies they also have the power to order counseling for kids who are having trouble coping how does a judge decide who should get physical custody when indiana judges face disputes about custody the law requires them to apply a list of eight factors to decide what’s in the child’s “best interests” neither parent enjoys a “presumption” an assumption that they are superior to the other parent the factors arethe age and sex of the childthe parents’ wishesthe child’s wishes with more consideration given to the wishes of a child that is at least 14 years of age judges sometimes meet with children privately to ask about thisthe interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parent s siblings and any other person who may significantly affect the child’s best intereststhe child’s adjustment to home school and communitythe mental and physical health of all individuals involvedevidence of a pattern of domestic or family violence by either parent andevidence that the child has been cared for by a “ de facto custodian” ie someone who is providing care but doesn’t have legal rights to the child if there is clear and convincing evidence very strong proof that a child has been cared for by a de facto custodian the court must examine an additional four factors as set forth in indiana code 3117285 b 1 through 4 how do courts decide if legal custody should be sole or joint a judge will award joint legal custody only if it’s in the child’s best interests if parents want joint legal custody it’s very important that they show they’re able to get along with one another to decide whether to award legal custody to one or both parents the court will look at some additional factors includingeach parents fitness and suitabilitywhether the parents are willing and able to communicate and cooperate in advancing the child’s welfarethe child’s wishes with more consideration given if the child is at least 14 years oldwhether the child has established a close and beneficial relationship with both parentswhether the parents live in close proximity to each other and plan to continue to do so andthe nature of the physical and emotional environment in each parent’s home it’s important to know that just because a court awards two parents joint legal custody it does mean they will be awarded equal physical custody indiana law is very specific on this point and it’s common for one parent to have sole physical custody while sharing joint legal custody with the other parent what is parenting time in indiana“parenting time” also known as visitation in other states is the time that parents without physical custody spend with their children in indiana a parent who doesn’t have physical custody of a child is still entitled to reasonable parenting time with the child unless the court holds a hearing and decides that parenting time would endanger the child’s physical health or “significantly impair” cause major harm to his or her emotional development what is supervised parenting time in indiana if parenting time would endanger the child’s physical health or significantly impair emotional development a judge may order “supervised parenting time” until the situation improves which means that all visitation must be supervised by a third party the court may order a social service agency juvenile court staff the local probation department or a private agency to be present during parenting time to ensure that it’s safe and healthy it’s also common for the parties to agree to have parenting time supervised by a trusted individual like a grandparent the court can also order parenting time to occur at a secure neutral location is it possible to change custody or parenting time yes if you want to make changes to a current custody or parenting time order you’ll need to file a motion to modify change custody or parenting time and prove to a judge that there has been a change of circumstances which warrants changing the existing arrangements if you have
