abraham lincoln did lack of security lead to his death february 8 2013abraham lincoln who was assassinated in april of 1865 was the first american president to be killed in office in some ways his murder came as no surprise there was no secret service at the time and he’d been receiving death threats since he was first elected and the nation was at war with itself the one man assigned to protect the president at ford’s theatre that fateful night john frederick parker was not at his post during the show he spent some of his time watching the show from a different part of the theatre and spent the intermission at the saloon next door which is where he was found when the president was shot unfortunately this wasn’t unexpected presidential security was at the time scattered at best and hampered by lincoln himself there were elaborate security precautions at the inauguration but they were quickly dropped for lincoln’s first term—at his insistence republican inaugural visitor from iowa charles aldrich wrote about the march 4 1861 event i went across the street… the area in front of this northeast corner of the capitol was filled with spectators to the number of many thousands just before the appearance of mr lincoln a file of soldiers doubtless regulars came into the area and marched along in front of the platform slowly making their way through the crowd from where i stood i could see their bayonets above the heads of the people there was at that time serious apprehension that the president might be shot when he appeared to make his address but this small company of men was all that was in sight in the way of defense it was quietly understood however that several hundred men were scattered through the crowd armed with revolvers but shortly thereafter even the mounted and foot guards posted at the white house gates were dismissed in late 1862 two companies were assigned to protect the president — the union light guard of cavalry from ohio and the 150th pennsylvania regiment of infantry at the insistence of various military leaders the special cavalry division the “bucktails” were assigned to escort lincoln who was prone to riding alone their efforts were met with marginal success lincoln rode particularly often between the white house and the “soldier’s home” an area in the northeast part of the city that was countrylike and where the lincolns had a small cottage it was approximately a threemile ride he also changed his travel schedule at will lincoln also frequently walked from the white house to the war department—where the staff was under strict orders to make sure that he was escorted home in august of 1864 while lincoln was riding to soldier’s home he was fired upon the shot startled his horse which bolted causing lincoln to lose his hat it also forced lincoln to take security more seriously and allow for both a police guard and to accept the cavalry escorts it wasn’t until november 1864 that the police force in washington d c created a four man team to act as private body guards to the president john frederick parker was one of those men and his actions that fateful day in april let down a man and a nation struggling for securityphoto credit chrismar via photopin cc posted in uncategorized and tagged abraham lincoln charles aldrich fords theatre john frederick parker pennsylvania regiment of infantry presidential security secret service security the union light guard on february 8 2013 by gettysburg battlefield tours related articles thank you for a great 2017become a licensed battlefield guide100 nights of taps thursday june 1monday september 4 2017sunset audio double decker bus tour october 8 at 430 pm the 52nd annual apple harvest festivaloctober 1 2  8 9friday august 12saturday august 13 annual civil war music muster tournews7th annual smithsonian museum day next
