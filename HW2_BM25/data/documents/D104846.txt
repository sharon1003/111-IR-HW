reduce watering by dry farming tomatoes posted on july 6 2009 by admin in growing tomatoes  1 comment tweet about a year ago i was speaking with a friend of mine and he mentioned dry farming my first reaction to this was “dry wha…” he began to explain what dry farming was and the methodology behind it to be honest i was very skeptical and really thought he was pulling my leg i jumped on the internet and did a little research come to find out dry farming tomatoes is a real practice mostly used in the southwest part of the country i guess they have no real choice but to dry farm if they don’t get much rain huh it appears that dry farming has been around for a very long time and might be spreading to other parts of the country what is dry farming dry farming tomatoes is a very simple process where you plant and water your tomatoes just as you normally would until the plant begins setting fruit once the fruit appears on the tomato plant you cease to water it basically dry farming is growing crops without any irrigation to supplement rainfall this does not mean your tomatoes will not be watered just that you are not irrigating them yourself with drip irrigation or other watering methods the plants are water only by rainfall only of course in extreme drought conditions you will need to water the tomato plants a little to keep them alive under normal weather conditions dry farming is used what is the advantage of dry farming tomatoes tomatoes that are overwatered tend to taste bland and watery dry farming creates a more flavorful tomato because the tomato plant will concentrate its sugars into the fruit and can also help the tomato ripen much quicker of course there are obvious advantages in regards to water conservation and a reduction in water costs if you are using city supplied water for your tomatoes what are some disadvantages of dry farming tomatoes although dry farming tomatoes has shown to improve the overall flavor of the tomato there are issues with this method of growing tomatoes dry farming increases the chances of blossom end rot due to the fluctuations in watering this can also cause some cracking or splitting of the tomatoes if water fluctuations are drastic dry farming can also reduce yield sizes and can promote smaller tomatoes tomato plants may also look straggly and foliage changes could occur if the plant begins to severely wilt you may need to irrigate moderately uc santa cruz is studying the effects of dry farming tomatoes aziz baamuer of the uc small farm program and jim leap farm manager are studying the effects of dry farming tomatoes here is what they say study of reduced water inputs on tomatoes underway we all know the scenario—a red juicy tomato that looks great but offers little in the way of flavor in a study now taking place at the casfs farm on the ucsc campus aziz baameur of the uc small farm program and farm manager jim leap are assessing ways to improve tomato flavor and nutrition while decreasing water use“excess nitrogen and more than adequate water application to tomato plants among other input culprits result in less than optimal flavor in tomato fruit despite genetic potential for good taste” says baameur who notes that “this lack of flavor is not limited to conventional or organically grown fruit”“stressing” tomato plants by withholding water—a technique used to produce dryland or dryfarmed tomatoes— is a known way to improve flavor however as baameur points out cutting back on water inputs can also result in undesirable consequences such as yield decline especially economic yield reduced fruit size and increased occurrence of the condition known as blossom endrot which can develop when irrigation fluctuates resulting in calcium not being translocated to young tomato fruit tissue to identify an optimum water management strategy for tomatoes baameur and leap established four replicates each of five irrigation treatments 100 75 50 25 and 0 of water requirements based on california irrigation management information cimis recommendations each replicate consists of a 40foot row of ‘early girl’ variety tomatoes irrigated with drip tape the water stress treatments began after the plants were established soil water moisture sensors a type of tensiometer are being used to quantify water depletion at the root level plants in each treatment will be assessed for fruit yield percent of blossom end rot culls as well as plants’ overall reaction to water stress baameur and leap will collaborate with maria giovanni uc cooperative extension advisor to assess fruit visual and sensory quality as determined by both tasting panels and lab analysis they will also assess antioxidant levels as a proxy measure of nutrition levels the researchers plan to correlate fruit quality with water stress and soil water sensor readings in order to identify an optimal irrigation level the results of the current project will form the basis for future studies to investigate the link between irrigation practices and flavor of several popular tomato varieties under different climatic conditions “we hope to provide smallscale growers with information on water saving techniques that also yield favorable flavor results” says baameur leap believes this trial’s design could have broader applications noting that the tendency of most garden and farm managers is to overapply water leap says “i would like to do this trial for a number of other crops i think nitrogen and water are the two most overused and little understood inputs and i am certain we can get by with much less of both”— from the cultivar a publication produced by the center for argoecology  sustainable food systems at the university of california santa cruz – springsummer 2008 vol 26 no 1dry farming is a very interesting technique for growing tomatoes i have never tried dry farming – most gardeners i have talked to think not watering your tomatoes is almost gardening suicide – but may experiment with it on a few tomato plants next season maybe you can give it a shot as well who knows it may produce the best tomatoes you have ever hadif anyone practices dry farming for their tomatoes please feel free to give your take on it grow awesome tomatoes discuss in our forums
