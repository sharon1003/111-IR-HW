home »chemistry factors affecting the boiling point by alan osborne updated january 30 2018the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which it turns to vapor liquids turn to vapor when their vapor pressure equals the pressure of the surrounding air a liquid’s vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a liquid when its liquid and gaseous states have reached equilibrium pressure the biggest determinant of a liquid’s boiling point is the surrounding pressure in an open system the outside pressure is most likely the earth’s atmosphere water for example reaches the standard atmospheric pressure at 100 degrees celsius this measure is taken at sea level where the full weight of the earth’s atmosphere presses down upon the water as elevation increases water can boil at a lower temperature at the top of mount everest water boils at around 72 degrees celsius intermolecular bonds when we consider other liquids more factors help to determine the boiling point chief among them is the strength of the bonds between molecules ethyl alcohol for example has a boiling point of 785 degrees celsius at sea level it is a liquid at room temperature and the bonds between its molecules are comparatively strong by contrast methyl ether has a “boiling” point of 25 degrees celsius at room temperature and sea level methyl ether is a gas solutes solvents and solutions an effective way of raising the boiling point of a liquid is to add another ingredient while water at sea level has a boiling point of 100 degrees celsius its boiling point can be raised by adding a solute such as salt a solvent is any substance into which another is dissolved the substance being dissolved is called the solute when a solute is dissolved into a solvent a solution is created a solution usually boils at a higher point than the pure solvent conclusions the simplest way to change the boiling point of a liquid is to change the surrounding pressure using a closed system to artificially increase that pressure will raise the boiling point of a liquid lowering the surrounding pressure either by increasing altitude or artificially creating a vacuum will lower the same liquid’s boiling point boiling point is dependent upon the strength of the bonds between its molecules for this reason adding a solute to the liquid will create stronger bonds between molecules raising the solution’s boiling point without increasing pressure references georgia state university boiling point variationperdue university boiling about the author this article was written by the sciencing team copy edited and fact checked through a multipoint auditing system in efforts to ensure our readers only receive the best information to submit your questions or ideas or to simply learn more about sciencing contact us here more articles why does styrofoam dissolve in turpentine science project the effects of temperature on liquids what are the properties of ionic crystals ice cubes melting process how to calculate a distillation system what causes a lower freezing point cite this article choose citation style mlaapachicago bosborne alan factors affecting the boiling point sciencing httpsciencingcomfactorsaffectingboilingpoint8566896html 30 january 2018 osborne alan 2018 january 30 factors affecting the boiling point sciencing retrieved from httpsciencingcomfactorsaffectingboilingpoint8566896html osborne alan factors affecting the boiling point last modified january 30 2018 httpsciencingcomfactorsaffectingboilingpoint8566896html copy citation note depending on which text editor youre pasting into you might have to add the italics to the site name
