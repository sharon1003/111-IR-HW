fridrich method is one of the most commonly used methods in speedsolving a rubiks cube this method is the cross to start this methodfirst developed by a group of cubers and popularized by jessica fridrich it works on a layer by layer method first solving a cross on the bottom cross continuing to solve the first two layers f2l orienting the last layer oll and finally permuting the last layer algorithms pll this method is commonly referred to as cfop contents  showbasic rules edit the notation that will be used here is as follows layers edit r  right face l  left face u  up face d  down face f  front face b  back face m  slice between r and l middlee  slice between u and d equator equatorials  slice between f and b sidex  whole cube in direction of ry  whole cube in direction of uz  whole cube in direction of fturns edit no suffix  clockwise  opposite ex x is turn the whole cube to the left2  half turn180째 turnw or lowercase letter  double layer quarterturn90째 clockwisew or lowercase letter  double layer quarterturn90째 counterclockwisew2 or lowercase letter  double layer halfturn180째 turn cross edit solving the cross is the first step in solving the rubiks cube using cfop this involves solving the four edge pieces on one side the cross can be solved on any side although many people solve it on the white the method that is preferred by most is solving on the bottom the method explained here will solve the cross on the bottom when solving the cross you do not have to worry about matching the edges to the individual sides you must only make sure that the pieces are correctly positioned in relation to all the other cross pieces you can turn the bottom face to match the pieces after the cross is done this is usually the simplest step and takes expert speed cubers 23 seconds first 2 layers edit the first two layers or f2l is the next step in solving the rubiks cube using cfop it involves placing the bottom corners and middle edges in one step there are 41 algorithms to learn for solving this step and seven or eight others that are useful to know some speedcubers recommend figuring this step out on your own so that you can understand exactly why this step works as well as it does this is the longest step in cfop due to the fact that you must perform four algorithms one for each corneredge pair or ce pair orienting the last layer edit the orientation of the last layer or oll is the second to the last step to solving a rubiks cube using cfop it is when you get all the yellow parts or the opposite of where you started of the individual cubies on the top this step involves manipulating the top layer so that the top is a solid color even if the pieces are not in the right places this step involves learning the most algorithms 57 of any step due to the fact that there are so many different combinations of the top layer permuting the last layer edit this section is a stub please feel free to help by adding in any information to expand it permuting the last layer or pll finishes the cube by permutating the last layer all of the last layer pieces are moved to their proper locations this uses algorithms called perms which perm ute the pieces in the needed way categories stubs methods add category
