overview the birds and the bees talk is one that parents often put off as long as possible but learning about sexuality is a normal part of child development and answering your childs questions in an honest ageappropriate way is the best strategy read on for tips on what to say and when what kids can understand age by age ages 2 to 3 the right words for private body parts such as penis and vaginaages 3 to 4 where a baby comes from but they wont understand all the details of reproduction—so a simple mom has a uterus inside her tummy where you lived until you were big enough to be born is fine ages 4 to 5 how a baby is born stick with the literal response when you were ready to be born the uterus pushed you out through mommys vagina ages 5 to 6 a general idea of how babies are made mom and dad made you or if your child demands more details a tiny cell inside dad called a sperm joined together with a tiny cell inside mom called an egg ages 6 to 7 a basic understanding of intercourse you can say nature or god created male and female bodies to fit together like puzzle pieces when the penis and the vagina fit together sperm like tadpoles swim through the penis and up to the egg explain what you think about sex and relationships for instance sex is one of the ways people show love for each other ages 8 to 9 that sex is important which your child has probably picked up from the media and her peers a child this age can handle a basic explanation on just about any topic including rape remember when we talked about sex being part of a loving relationship rape is when someone forces another person to have sex and thats wrong ages 9 to 11 which changes happen during puberty also be ready to discuss sexrelated topics your child sees in the news age 12 by now kids are formulating their own values so check in every so often to provide a better context for the information your childs getting but avoid overkill or youll be tuned out handling specific questions your childs questions about sex dont always come up at convenient times or in predictable ways some common scenarios that can catch you off guard and how to respond your 3yearold is fascinated by her baby brothers diaper changes whats that she asks pointing to his penis how to respond you may be tempted to change the subject quickly and fasten that diaper even faster but that can give kids the idea that talking about private parts is taboo instead be matteroffact and say thats how you can tell the difference between a girl and a boy its called a penis you have a vagina dont be surprised if the question comes up again and again while your child sorts it all out youre in line at the grocery store when your preschooler looks up and asks why is my penis getting hard how to respond if a question arises at an inopportune moment its okay to give an incomplete answer along with a promise to fill in the rest later on in this case you can say quietly oh that happens sometimes it will get soft again soon or if the question requires a more involved answer you can reply with thats a really great question we can talk more about it in the car if you want but its important to come back to it later and answer any questions your child has hoping to demystify the potty for your toddler you let her watch you pee she asks why do you have hair down there how to respond just say that its natural for grownups to have hair in places that children dont especially under their arms between their legs and for men on their faces you can also add that when she gets to be a big girl like her mother and her aunts shell have hair covering her private parts too your child tells you his classmate has two mommies how can that be he asks how to respond homosexuality may be a confusing subject—especially for kids who havent even gotten the concept of heterosexuality down yet but your explanation doesnt have to be complicated say in ginnys family her two mommies love each other the way daddy and i do so they live together and both take care of ginny if your child has heard a homosexual slur—say a classmate calls someone else gay and he wants to know what that means—you can explain that sometimes boys fall in love with boys and girls fall in love with girls but that the boy at school probably didnt really understand what he was talking about then remind your child that calling people names isnt nice and might hurt someones feelings you catch your child touching or rubbing her private parts how to respond kids start to explore their bodies including their genitals at a very early age babies will touch themselves during diaper changes and toddlers will sometimes stick their hands down their pants they do this for comfort not to achieve an orgasm you might say i know that touching your vulva or penis feels good but its something to be done in private dont act as though masturbation should be avoided taking her hands away with a swift lets go color is like saying what youre doing is so awful that im going to pretend i didnt see it youve explained that when a mommys egg and a daddys sperm combine a baby begins to grow now your 6yearold asks how does the sperm get to the egg anyway how to respond your explanation doesnt have to be a big deal you might start by saying daddies have to be close enough to mommies so the sperm can come out of their bodies and get into the mommies the sperm comes out of the daddys penis and goes right into the vagina a special place in the mommys body made for keeping the sperm safe and helping it get to the egg if your child asks additional questions offer a slightly more detailed explanation a penis is made to fit into a vagina sort of like an arm fits into a sleeve if you want to introduce a moral framework you might say god had a great plan for mommies and daddies to make babies he designed them differently so they fit together like a puzzle the sperm comes out of a daddys penis and swims inside the mommys body till it reaches the egg your preschooler has been content so far with vague information like babies grow inside mommies but now he wants to know what happens next how does the baby get out of there how to respond accurate but uncomplicated answers are best try most babies come out through the mommys vagina you can add the vagina is like a tube inside the mommy it stretches really wide so the baby can get outside your gradeschoolers friend tells him how to get to an xrated website you walk into the family room later and find him staring at a naked woman on the screen how to respond try not to get angry your sons interest is only natural still you need to make it clear that such material isnt appropriate for kids condemn the pornography without judging him calmly say thats a website for adults you need to stick to sites for kids then bookmark the sites youve approved—and be sure to download some parental controls for the family computer additional resources storybooks can help get across the concept of sex to your child or further explain what youve already discussed check your local library set aside time to sit and read together then offer to answer any questions dont just send your child off to read in a room by herself though being involved from the getgo will show her that she can come to you when she has more complicated or sensitive questions as she gets older
