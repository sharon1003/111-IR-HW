typically composed of three to six battalions plus supporting elements it is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment two or more brigades may constitute a division brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades in addition to combat units they may include combat support units or subunits such as artillery and engineers and logistic units or subunits historically such brigades have sometimes been called brigadegroups on operations a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements including some temporarily attached for a specific task brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch for example cavalry mechanized armored artillery air defence aviation engineers signals or logistic some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure the typical nato standard brigade consists of approximately 3200 to 5500 troops however in switzerland and austria the numbers could go as high as 11000 troops the soviet union its forerunners and successors mostly use regiment instead of brigade and this was common in much of europe until after world war ii a brigades commander is commonly a major general 1 brigadier general brigadier or colonel in some armies the commander is rated as a general officer the brigade commander has a selfcontained headquarters and staff the principal staff officer usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel may be designated chief of staff although until the late 20th century british and similar armies called the position brigademajor some brigades may also have a deputy commander the headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support clerks assistants and drivers that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade on operations additional specialist elements may be attached the headquarters will usually have its own communications

century when the british army and militia developed a unit to control more than one infantry regiment or cavalry squadron 2 previously each regiment battalion cavalry squadron or artillery battery operated somewhat independently with its own field officer ie colonel lieutenant colonel or major or battery commander usually a captain reporting directly to the field force or army commander as such a field army became larger the number of subordinate commanders became unmanageable for the officer in general command of said army usually a major general to effectively command in order to streamline command relationships as well as effect some modicum of tactical control especially in regard to combined arms operations ie those involving a coordination of infantry with cavalry andor artillery forces an intermediate level of command became evident the terms origin is found in two french roots which together meant roughly those who fight  3 another theory for derivation of the term brigade derives from italian brigata as used for example in the introduction to the decameron where it refers only to a group of ten or old french brigare meaning company of an undefined size which in turn derives from a celtic root briga which means strife  citation needed the socalled brigada was a wellmixed unit comprising infantry cavalry and normally also artillery designated for a special task the size of such brigada ranged from a reinforced company of up to two regiments the brigada was the forerunner of the modern  battalion task force  battle group or brigade the brigade was improved as a tactical unit by the swedish king gustavus adolphus who introduced it in 1631 during a reorganization of the swedish army during the thirty years war the creation of the brigade overcame the lack of coordination inherent in the traditional army structure consisting of independent regiments of infantry and units of supporting arms viz cavalry and artillery acting separately under their individual commanding officers gustavus accomplished this battlefield coordination by combining battalions of infantry with cavalry troops and artillery batteries into a battle group viz brigada or brigade commanded by a senior colonel or lieutenant colonel appointed as a brigadiergeneral the brigade organization was copied in france by maréchal turenne who made it a permanent standing unit requiring the creation in 1667 of a permanent rank of brigadier des armées du roi literally translating to brigadier of the armies of the king unlike the swedish brigades french brigades at that time were composed of two to five regiments of the same branch  brigade de cavalerie brigade dinfanterie etc the rank intermediate between colonel and maréchal de camp disappeared in 1788 and should not be confused with that of général de brigade which is equivalent to a brigadier general a modern général de brigade is sometimes referred to occasionally as brigadier  individual armies  editaustralia  editin the australian army the brigade has always been the smallest tactical formation since regiments are either administrative groupings of battalions in the infantry or battalionsized units in the cavalry  a typical brigade may consist of approximately 5500 personnel between two mechanised infantry battalions an armored regiment an armored artillery regiment and other logistic and engineering units the brigade is usually commanded by an officer holding the rank of brigadier who is referred to as the brigade commander pakistan  edita brigade is under the command of a brigadier and comprises three or more battalions of different units depending on its functionality an independent brigade would be one that primarily consists of an artillery unit an infantry unit an armour unit and logistics to support its actions such a brigade is not part of any division and is under direct command of a corps there are seven independent armoured brigades seven engineering brigades and eight air defense brigades independent armoured and infantry brigades are capable of extended operations without necessarily being reliant on a higher hq for shortterm logistic or intimate support they can be used in counterattack exploitation of an advance or rapid movement to reinforce formations under pressure three independent brigades are at malir pano and aqil hyderabad and are operating under v corps karachi 4france  editfrance replaced its divisions with brigades in 1999 so for example the 2nd armored division became the 2nd armored brigade it was decided in 2016 to again form two divisions  1st and 3rd made up of four and three brigades for a total of seven brigades two armored two intermediate two light brigades alpine and parachute and the francogerman brigade there is also an airmobile brigade subordinated to the army aviation command in peacetime brigades serve primarily as force providers the units deployed battlegroups and taskforces are battalionsize units provided by the regiments composing the brigades united kingdom  editbrigades with a field not a regional administrative role have usually been of a named type and numbered since the 19th century eg cavalry brigade or infantry brigade from after world war ii brigade numbers have been unique and not by type brigades in divisions do not usually command their combat support and combat service support units these remain under divisional command although they may be permanently affiliated with a particular brigade as a brigade group historically infantry or cavalryarmored brigades have usually comprised three or four combatarm battalions but currently larger brigades are normal made larger still when their affiliated artillery and engineer regiments are added until 1918 the chief of staff of a brigade was known as a brigade major before 1922 british army brigades were normally commanded by general officers holding the onestar rank of brigadiergeneral after that date the appointment became that of brigadier usually held by a field officer with the substantive rank of colonel from 1859 to 1938 brigade brigadedivision 1885–1903 was also the term used for a battalionsized unit of the royal artillery this was because unlike infantry battalions and cavalry regiments which were organic artillery units consisted of individually numbered batteries that were brigaded together the commanding officer of such a brigade was a lieutenant colonel in 1938 the royal artillery adopted the term regiment for this size of unit and brigade became used in its normal sense particularly for groups of antiaircraft artillery regiments commanded by a brigadier 5in the second world war a tank brigade comprised three tank regiments and was equipped with infantry tanks for supporting the infantry divisions armored brigades were equipped with cruiser tanks or us lendlease medium tanks and a motorised infantry battalion the armored divisions included one or more armored brigades canada  editthe
