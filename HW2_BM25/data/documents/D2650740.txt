what is the right time for preemergents should i be applying preemergent weedkiller granules now with the warm weather i see lots of weeds everywhere some of them have little purple flowers starting to formno those weeds that you’re seeing now are coolseason weeds they germinated back in the fall preemergent weedkillers do just what their name says they kill weeds before they ever emerge which means germinate if you see weeds now you should have applied your preemergent weedkiller last fall here is the schedule i’m going to tailor it for dfw and the i20 corridor as my default read carefully are you way south of i20 move the spring dates one week earlier for each 100 miles you are south of i20 move the fall dates later for each 100 miles you are south of i20 are you way north of i20 move the spring dates one week later for each 100 miles you are north of i20 move the fall dates one week earlier for each 100 miles you are north of i20 remember that your goal is always to apply the preemergent before you can see the weeds — before their seeds sprout if you can see the weeds growing you’ve blown it spring application primarily for crabgrass and grassburs march 5 — 15 halts or dimension second spring application due to long growing season and possibility that crabgrass and grassburs could still germinate june 5 — 15 there is no point in making this application if you did not make the first one halts or dimension fall application primarily for coolseason grassy weeds such as annual bluegrass rescuegrass and rye september 1 — 10 halts or dimension fall application primarily for broadleafed weeds such as henbit dandelions clover and chickweed september 1 — 10 gallery this treatment can be made the same day as the application for grassy weed prevention but do them sequentially do not try to mix granules in your spreader any time you intend to apply preemergent weedkillers and fertilizers at roughly the same time apply the fertilizer first water it into the soil deeply wait a couple of days then apply the preemergent granules and water lightly posted by neil sperry
