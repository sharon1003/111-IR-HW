pharmacologypharmacokinetics precautions use in the elderly precautions impaired hepatic function elderly hepatic impairmentmax clinical studies analysis of the data from controlled studies shows that cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride produces clinical improvement whether or not sedation occurs valium® diazepam rochesurveillance program a postmarketing surveillance program was carried out in 7607 patients with acute musculoskeletal disorders and included 297 patients treated with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 10 mg for 30 days or longer the overall effectiveness of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride was similar to that observed in the doubleblind controlled studies the overall incidence of adverse effects was less see adverse reactions  indications and usagecyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used only for short periods up to two or three weeks because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use is not available and because muscle spasm associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions is generally of short duration and specific therapy for longer periods is seldom warranted contraindicationshypersensitivity to any component of this product concomitant use of monoamine oxidase mao inhibitors or within 14 days after their discontinuation hyperpyretic crisis seizures and deaths have occurred in patients receiving cyclobenzaprine or structurally similar tricyclic antidepressants concomitantly with mao inhibitor drugs acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction and patients with arrhythmias heart block or conduction disturbances or congestive heart failure hyperthyroidism warningscyclobenzaprine is closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants eg amitriptyline and imipramine in short term studies for indications other than muscle spasm associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions and usually at doses somewhat greater than those recommended for skeletal muscle spasm some of the more serious central nervous system reactions noted with the tricyclic antidepressants have occurred see warnings below and adverse reactions  tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce arrhythmias sinus tachycardia prolongation of the conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may enhance the effects of alcohol barbiturates and other cns depressants precautionsgeneral because of its atropinelike action cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention angleclosure glaucoma increased intraocular pressure and in patients taking anticholinergic medication impaired hepatic function the plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is increased in patients with hepatic impairment see clinical pharmacology pharmacokinetics hepatic impairment  these patients are generally more susceptible to drugs with potentially sedating effects including cyclobenzaprine cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used with caution in subjects with mild hepatic impairment starting with a 5 mg dose and titrating slowly upward due to the lack of data in subjects with more severe hepatic insufficiency the use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in subjects with moderate to severe impairment is not recommended information for patients cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride especially when used with alcohol or other cns depressants may impair mental andor physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle in the elderly the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the use of cyclobenzaprine with or without concomitant medications is increased in elderly patients cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be initiated with a 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward drug interactions cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may have lifethreatening interactions with mao inhibitors see contraindications  cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride may enhance the effects of alcohol barbiturates and other cns depressants tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds tricyclic antidepressants may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking tramadol††ultram® tramadol hcl tablets orthomc neil pharmaceuticalultracet® tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets orthomc neil pharmaceuticalcarcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility pregnancy pregnancy category b reproduction studies have been performed in rats mice and rabbits at doses up to 20 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride there are however no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed nursing mothers it is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk because cyclobenzaprine is closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants some of which are known to be excreted in human milk caution should be exercised when cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman pediatric use safety and effectiveness of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in pediatric patients below 15 years of age have not been established use in the elderly the plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is increased in the elderly see clinical pharmacology pharmacokinetics elderly the elderly may also be more at risk for cns adverse events such as hallucinations and confusion cardiac events resulting in falls or other sequelae drugdrug and drugdisease interactions for these reasons in the elderly cyclobenzaprine should be used only if clearly needed in such patients cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be initiated with a 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward adverse reactions‡5 mg studies incidence of  3 on cyclobenzaprine
