allocation of ip addresses than the old class a b and c address scheme why do we need cidr with a new network being connected to the internet every 30 minutes the internet was faced with two critical problems running out of ip addresses running out of capacity in the global routing tables running out of ip addresses there is a maximum number of networks and hosts that can be assigned unique addresses using the internets 32bit long addresses traditionally the internet assigned classes of addresses class a class b and class c were the most common each address had two parts one part to identify a unique network and the second part to identify a unique host in that network another way the old class a b and c addresses were identified was by looking at the first 8 bits of the address and converting it to its decimal equivalent address class  network bits  hosts bits decimal address range class a 8 bits 24 bits 1126class b 16 bits 16 bits 128191class c 24 bits 8 bits 192223using the old class a b and c addressing scheme the internet could support the following126 class a networks that could include up to 16777214 hosts each plus 65000 class b networks that could include up to 65534 hosts each plus over 2 million class c networks that could include up to 254 hosts each some addresses are reserved for broadcast messages etc because internet addresses were generally only assigned in these three sizes there was a lot of wasted addresses for example if you needed 100 addresses you would be assigned the smallest address class c but that still meant 154 unused addresses the overall result was that while the internet was running out of unassigned addresses only 3 of the assigned addresses were actually being used cidr was developed to be a much more efficient method of assigning addresses global routing tables at capacity a related problem was the sheer size of the internet global routing tables as the number of networks on the internet increased so did the number of routes a few years back it was forecasted that the global backbone internet routers were fast approaching their limit on the number of routes they could support even using the latest router technology the maximum theoretical routing table size is approximately 60000 routing table entries if nothing was done the global routing tables would have reached capacity by mid1994 and all internet growth would be halted how were these problems solved two solutions were developed and adopted by the global internet community restructuring ip address assignments to increase efficiency hierarchical routing aggregation to minimize route table entries restructuring ip address assignments classless interdomain routing cidr is a replacement for the old process of assigning class a b and c addresses with a generalized network prefix instead of being limited to network identifiers or prefixes of 8 16 or 24 bits cidr currently uses prefixes anywhere from 13 to 27 bits thus blocks of addresses can be assigned to networks as small as 32 hosts or to those with over 500000 hosts this allows for address assignments that much more closely fit an organizations specific needs a cidr address includes the standard 32bit ip address and also information on how many bits are used for the network prefix for example in the cidr address 20613014825 the 25 indicates the first 25 bits are used to identify the unique network leaving the remaining bits to identify the specific host cidr block prefix  equivalent class c  of host addresses27 18th of a class c 32 hosts26 14th of a class c 64 hosts25 12 of a

cidr addressing scheme also enables route aggregation in which a single highlevel route entry can represent many lowerlevel routes in the global routing tables the scheme is similar to the telephone network where the network is setup in a hierarchical structure a high level backbone network node only looks at the area code information and then routes the call to the specific backbone node responsible for that area code the receiving node then looks at the phone number prefix and routes the call to its subtending network node responsible for that prefix and so on the backbone network nodes only need routing table entries for area codes each representing huge blocks of individual telephone numbers not for every unique telephone number currently big blocks of addresses are assigned to the large internet service providers isps who then reallocate portions of their address blocks to their customers for example pacific bell internet has been assigned a cidr address block with a prefix of 15 equivalent to 512 class c addresses or 131072 host addresses and typically assigns its customers cidr addresses with prefixes ranging from 27 to 19 these customers who may be smaller isps themselves in turn reallocate portions of their address block to their users andor customers however in the global routing tables all these different networks and hosts can be represented by the single pacific bell internet route entry in this way the growth in the number of routing table entries at each level in the network hierarchy has been significantly reduced currently the global routing tables have approximately 35000 entries user impacts the internet is currently a mixture of both cidrized addresses and old class a b and c addresses almost all new routers support cidr and the internet authorities strongly encourage all users to implement the cidr addressing scheme we recommend that any new router you purchase should support cidr the conversion to the cidr addressing scheme and route aggregation has two major user impacts justifying ip address assignments where to get address assignments justifying ip address assignments even with the introduction of cidr the internet is growing so fast that address assignments must continue to be treated as a scarce resource as such customers will be required to document in detail their projected needs users may be required from time to time to document their internal address assignments particularly when requesting additional addresses the current internet guideline is to assign addresses based on an organizations projected three month requirement with additional addresses assigned as needed where to get address assignments in the past you would get a class a b or c address assignments directly from the appropriate internet registry ie the inter nic under this scenario you owned the address and could take it with you even if you changed internet service providers isps with the introduction of cidr address assignments and route aggregation with a few exceptions the recommended source for address assignments is your isp under this scenario you are only renting the address and if you change isps it is strongly recommended that you get a new address from your new isp and renumber all of your network devices while this can be a timeconsuming task it is critical for your address to be aggregated into your isps larger address block and routed under their network address there are still significant global routing table issues and the smaller your network is the greater your risk of being dropped from the global routing tables in fact networks smaller than 8192 devices will very likely be dropped neither the inter nic nor other isps have control over an individual isps decisions on how to manage their routing tables as an option to physically renumbering each network device some organizations are using proxy servers to translate old network addresses to their new addresses users should be cautioned to carefully consider all the potential impacts before using this type of solution need more information for more detailed technical information on cidr go to
