kannada ಠಕ್ಕ thakka bengali ঠগি ṭhogī refers to the acts of thugs an organised gang of professional robbers and murderers thugs travelled in groups across the indian subcontinent for six hundred years 1 although the thugs traced their origin to seven muslim tribes hindus appear to have been associated with them at an early period the earliest authenticated mention of thugs appears in ziyāuddīn baranī s history of fīrūz shāh dated around 1356 2 thuggee was a secret cult whose members both muslims and hindus worshipped mother kali the goddess of destruction they operated as gangs of highway robbers tricking and later strangling their victims 3to take advantage of their victims the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence this would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose they would then rob and bury their victims this led to the thugs being called phansigar english using a noose   a term more commonly used in southern india 4 during the 1830s the thugs were targeted for eradication by governorgeneral of india william bentinck and his chief captain william henry sleeman the english language word thug traces its roots to this from the hindi ठग  ṭhag  which means swindler or deceiver related words are the verb thugna to deceive from the sanskrit स्थग  sthaga  cunning sly fraudulent  and स्थगति  sthagati he conceals 5

fraternity rather than ordinary thieves is found in ziaud din barnis history of firoz shah written about 1356 in the reign of that sultan about 1290 some thugs were taken in delhi and a man belonging to that fraternity was the means of about a thousand being captured but not one of these did the sultan have killed he gave orders for them to be put into boats and to be conveyed into the lower country to the neighbourhood of lakhnauti where they were to be set free the thugs would thus have to dwell about lakhnauti and would not trouble the neighbourhood of delhi any more— sir hm elliot

criminal underclass the leadership of established thug groups tended to be hereditary as the group evolved into a criminal tribe other men would become acquainted with a thug band and hope to be recruited as thugs were respected by the criminal community and had a camaraderie of numbers and shared experience robbery became less a question of solving problems associated with poverty and more a profession sometimes young children of travellers would be spared and groomed to become thugs themselves since children would help allay suspicion a fourth way of becoming a thug was by training with a guru similar to an apprenticeship for a guild or profession during which the candidate could be assessed for reliability courage discretion and discipline 6modus operandi  editwatercolour by unknown early19thcentury artist of three thugs strangling a traveller one holds his feet another his hands and a third tightens the ligature around his neck sketch by the same artist of a group of thugs stabbing the eyes of murdered travellers before throwing the bodies into a well the thugs modus operandi was to join a caravan as fellow travellers delaying their attack until the other travellers lost their initial wariness of the newcomers depending on the size of the target group it might take hundreds of miles to reach a suitable place and time there were variations on this method when tackling a large group a thuggee band might disperse along a route and join a group in stages concealing their acquaintanceship and eventually outnumbering their intended victims in small nonthreatening increments if the travellers doubted any one party they might confide their worries to another party of the thuggee band the trusted band would be best placed to deal with those members of the caravan at the appropriate time or advise their colleagues to modify their behaviour to allay suspicion the killing place needed to be remote from local observers with no escape for example a riverbank thugs had favoured places of execution known as beles and knew their geography better than their victims did attacks were conducted at night or during a rest break when travellers would be busy with chores and background noises would mask any sounds of alarm a quick quiet method leaving no stains and requiring no specialised weapon was strangulation this method associated with thuggee led to the thugs being called phansigars nooseoperators or stranglers by british troops usually two or three thugs would strangle one traveller they then needed to dispose of the bodies either burying them or throwing them into a well 6 the leader of a thugee gang was known as a jemadar  citation neededin 1884 seven men wellarmed with swords and matchlocks bearing a treasure worth 4500 rupees passed by a hidden encampment of two hundred thugs 7 8 the thugs followed them unobserved for 7 miles then rushed upon them and killed them all while the thugs were doing so a tanner approached and to prevent him giving the alarm they put him to death also and made off with the treasure leaving the bodies unburied 8the garrote is often depicted as a weapon of the thuggee 9 10 it is sometimes described as a rumāl head covering or kerchief translated as yellow scarf yellow in this case may refer to a natural cream or khaki colour rather than bright yellow death toll  editestimates of the total number of victims vary widely since no reliable source confirms the length of the thugs existence according to the guinness book of records the thuggee cult was responsible for approximately two million deaths british historian mike dash said that they killed a total of 50000 people over an estimated 150 years political scientist david c rapoport estimated that 500000 people were killed by the thugs 11 according to other estimates they murdered one million people 12british suppression  editsee also thuggee and dacoity suppression acts 1836–1848william henry sleeman superintendent of the thuggee and dacoity department the thugs were suppressed by the british rulers of india during the 1830s 6 the initiative was due largely to the efforts of civil servant william henry sleeman who captured feringhea also known as syeed amir ali on whom the novel confessions of a thug is based and persuaded him to turn kings evidence feringhea brought sleeman to a grave with a hundred bodies told him the circumstances of the murders and named the thugs who had committed them 13after initial investigations confirmed what feringhea had said sleeman began an extensive campaign using profiling and intelligence the government of india established the thuggee and dacoity department in 1835 with sleeman its first superintendent thousands of men were imprisoned executed or expelled from british india 6the campaign relied on captured thugs who became informants these informants were offered protection on the condition that they told everything that they knew by the 1870s the thug cult was extinct but the history of thuggee led to the criminal tribes act cta of 1871 although the cta was repealed at indian independence tribes considered criminal still exist in india 14 15 the thuggee and dacoity department remained in existence until 1904 when it was replaced by the central criminal intelligence department cid aftermath  editthe thugs spurred passage of the criminal tribes act in following the equator mark twain wrote about an 1839 government report by william henry sleeman 13there is one very striking thing which i wish to call attention to you have surmised from the listed callings followed by the victims of the thugs that nobody could travel the indian roads unprotected and live to get through that the thugs respected no quality no vocation no religion nobody that they killed every unarmed man that came in their way that is wholly true — with one reservation in all the long file of thug confessions an english traveler is mentioned but once—and this is what the thug says of the circumstance he was on his way from mhow to bombay we studiously avoided him he proceeded next morning with a number of travellers who had sought his protection and they took the road to baroda  we do not know who he was he flits across the page of this rusty old book and disappears in the obscurity beyond but he is an impressive figure moving through that valley of death serene and unafraid clothed in the might of the english name we have now followed the big official book through and we understand what thuggee was what a bloody terror it was what a desolating scourge it was in 1830 the english found this cancerous organisation embedded in the vitals of the empire doing its devastating work in secrecy and assisted protected sheltered and hidden by innumerable confederates —big and little native chiefs customs officers village officials and native police all ready to lie for it and the mass of the people through fear persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings and this condition of things had existed for generations and was formidable with the sanctions of age and old custom if ever there was an unpromising task if ever there was a hopeless task in the world surely it was offered here—the task of conquering thuggee but that little handful of english officials in india set their sturdy and confident grip upon it and ripped it out root and branch how modest do captain vallanceys words sound now when we read them again knowing what we know the day that sees this farspread evil completely eradicated from india and known only in name will greatly tend to immortalise british rule in the east  it would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that for this most noble work — chapter xlvi conclusion thug view  editthe thugs worshipping kalee around 1850 16although thugs trace their origin to the battle of kali against raktabija their foundation myth departs from brahminical versions of the puranas thugs considered themselves children of kali a hindu goddess created from her sweat 17 however many of the thugs who were captured and convicted by the british were muslims 18thug behram who was responsible for 931 deaths according to colonial sources thugs believed they had a positive role in saving human lives without the thugs sacred service kali might destroy all humankindit is god who kills but bhowanee has a name for it god is all in all for good and evil god has appointed blood for bhowanees food saying khoon tum khao feed thou upon blood in my opinion it is very bad but what can she do being ordered to subsist upon blood bhowanee is happy and more so in proportion to the blood that is shed 19according to mike dash the thugs had no religious motive to kill and the colonial sources were inaccurate in that respect 621stcentury views  editmartine van woerkens has suggested that evidence for a thug cult in the 19th century was partly the product of colonial imaginings arising from british fear of the littleknown interior of india as well as limited understanding of the religious and social practices of its inhabitants 20 mike dash however has pulled the debate the other way as in krishna duttas review of his book thug the true story of indias murderous cultin recent years the revisionist view that thuggee was a british invention a means to tighten their hold in the country has been given credence in india france and the us but this wellresearched book objectively questions that assertion 21in his book dash rejects scepticism about the existence of a secret network of groups with a modus operandi different from highwaymen he cites excavated corpses in graves whose locations were revealed to sleemans team by thug informants dash examines sleemans extensive thorough documentation rejecting the colonial emphasis on a religious motivation for banditry and asserting that monetary gain was the primary motivation for thuggee and men became thugs due to extreme poverty according to dash the thugs were highly superstitious although they worshipped the hindu goddess kali their faith was little different from that of contemporary nonthugs however he notes that the thugs had groupspecific superstitions and rituals 6english language  editthe thugs were popularised by books such as philip meadows taylor s 1839 novel confessions of a thug which introduced the word thug to the english language ameer ali the protagonist of confessions of a thug was said to be based on syeed amir ali a bollywood film is being made based on the novel it is titled thugs of hindostan and
