bone growth when the foetus in the womb initially starts to develop it has no bone only cartilage at 67 weeks the ossification process starts when the baby is born it has over 300 bones but as the baby grows up many bones fuse together and a fully grown adult has just 206 bones when ossification occurs cartilage is replaced with bone by laying down calcium this process is known as calcification during the growth phase the bone grows from the growth plates epiphyseal plates which are situated at the end of the bone just before the epiphysis see the xray of a childs epiphyseal plates to the right at the end of growth between the ages of about 16  21 these epiphyseal plates turn to bone two types of cell involved in bone growth are osteoblasts and osteoclasts osteoblasts lay down new bone whilst osteoclasts clear away the old bone growth occurs when the cells in the cartilage divide and push the older cartilage cells down towards the bone the diaphysis ossifies first followed by the epiphyses what affects bone growth sufficient calcium sufficient phosphorus vitamins especially vitamin d which is involved in the absorption of calcium the correct hormone balance specifically growth hormone from the pituitary gland calcitonin from the thyroid gland calcitonin metabolises calcium and phosphorus parathormone  from the parathyroid gland  almost works in opposition to calcitonin to balance it out the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen the aging process women start to lose calcium from their bones at around the age of 40 and in men at around the age of 60 perhaps eventually leading to brittle bone disease  osteoporosis other causes of osteoporosis include prolonged treatment with cortisone steroids anorexia nervosa and an inadequate diet especially during pregnancy and breast feeding however it is possible to increase bone density by performing weight bearing exercise taking calcium supplements where the diet does not contain sufficient calcium and in women oestrogen replacement therapy protein formation in bone decreases with age which can make bones more liable to fracture
