shameless season 7 episode 6 review the defenestration of frank paul dailly at november 6 2016 1000 pm  8 comments hold the front doordid shameless season 7 episode 6 serve as carl gallaghers swan song when you leave the city on a greyhound bus it kind of begs the question about whether your character is off the show throughout shameless season 7 carl has matured a lot and thats part of why doms dad helped him get the place in military school working on a show for seven years is a huge commitment especially for a young actor going to military school was the best way for carls storyline to actually progress it would have felt like a wrong move to stay in the south side with dom dom is not worth the trouble at this stage she abused carls trust several times during their relationship shes really not a nice girl and carl can do a lot better it must have been difficult for luther to let carl witness dom with another dude but it was the kick in the right direction carl needed theres absolutely no way dom had any intention of being exclusive with carl  never mind anyone else its sad but carl had to move on from her and the best way to do that was to leave town and start a new life its crazy to think about how much carl has changed over the course of the series he has done so many questionable things that he was poised to fail and turn into his father frank morning chief would my apache brother like toast or does he only eat maize fiona permalink morning chief would my apache brother like toast or does he only eat maize if the show does come to a close soon it would be great to have a callback to shameless season 1 with the school principal if you recall he told fiona steve and lip that there was no way carl would ever succeed in life he said something about a lobotomy being the best course of action for him before carls journey is really over i want to see him go back to that darn principal and show that hes developed into a great young man who can succeed just as well as anyone else theres going to be a severe change on the show if carl just disappears im all about embracing change but i just cant fathom what will become of the gallagher family without him theres been a lot of change for every single character this year but i just dont give a damn about frank anymore hes always going to be looking for some sort of scheme in order to get ahead when he refused to let debbie get married to neil i almost choked on my coffee because i thought he actually had a paternal bone in his body this is the guy who ditched his kids and happily became a father to karen jackson hes the master at playing happy families but its just a shame he cant actually do good things for his own flesh and blood he does not deserve any more chances with his kids they despise him and its clear just how unhappy he makes all of them without fiona they would have been split up and put in foster homes yes they did get split up a few years ago but fiona fought tooth and nail to get them back17 times shameless proved it was the funniest show on tvstart gallery now fionas main concern is herself and how well she does in life however i dont agree with her using the gallagher home as collateral she needs to think about the bigger picture of taking on the laundromat its an investment but investments can go wrong pretty easily if it did actually go south what would happen to her family members legally the house is hers but she didnt pay all the money for it lip has historically been very critical of fionas choices it has been tiring witnessing him bringing her down every time she does something but i think he had every right to on this occasion an opportunity came up and fiona leapt into it like there was no tomorrow the way fiona went about it was also pretty unethical etta clearly did not remember the previous conversation and that should have been a big red flag you could tell she was wondering whether to proceed with getting etta to sign the place over to her this will probably come back to bite her in the ass when the place inevitably becomes a success and some random family member of ettas emerges from the woodwork i really hope im wrong and it goes smoothly for her but it probably wont lip is not getting off the hook either he seems to think hes above everyone on the south side because he went to college its almost like hes forgotten all about his meltdown that got him kicked out of school fiona bringing that up when he was trashing her idea was one of the most perfect moments in tv history that entitled look was instantly wiped from his face and it was great maybe hell think about how other people feel before opening his mouth in future its time for him to grow up and stop acting like he can achieve anything if his idea of making some money is scamming people out of money then hes more like his father than he would like us to believe the company was making a lot of money from the transactions but theres absolutely no way they wouldnt have noticed some of the money disappearing now that the storyline has concluded i sincerely hope lip thinks about what he wants out of life because theres a good chance hes going end up in jail or become and old drunk like frank the defenestration of frank was a decent episode of this showtime drama all of the characters are making some big decisions about their lives and its making for good tv stray thoughts frank being thrown from the window of the homeless shelter was one of the better moments of the hour theres only so long people can put up with him he has a very short shelf life his fake family never had a brain cell between them they seemed to think frank was some sort of messiah that could do anything debbie getting engaged and fiona approving of the union was quite the shock debbie went to her as a last resort because she knew if frank was out of the equation there was no other way hopefully this paves the way for these sisters to get back on good terms its getting pretty tiring witnessing them sparring constantly sierras apprehension about debbie being with neil was completely right debbie was open about only being with neil so that she could keep frannie yes she helps neil but shes not with him for the right reasons it was obvious mariana was going to die but it completely destroyed ian running to trevor was pretty predictable but this relationship wont last long trevor is just a placeholder until noel fisher returns as mickey then gallovich will be back and stronger than ever it did not surprise me in the slightest that svetlana was sleeping with yvon it did however floor me when i found out that yvon wasnt even her father svetlana is an opportunist and i love learning more about her shes definitely one of the best
