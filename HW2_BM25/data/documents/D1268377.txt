description handbook state law governs workers compensation except for the federal workers’ comp system which covers employees of the u s government each states system differs in the details but the overall structure and operation of workers’ comp is very similar from state to state from the employer’s perspective the main differences are the procedural rules that they must follow to find out the

tool on the u s department of labor’s website which employers need to carry workers’ comp insurance every state but texas requires the vast majority of employers to carry workers’ compensation insurance in most states any employer with even one employee has to have coverage in other states the minimum may range from two to five employees a few states exempt certain agricultural or construction businesses charities may also be allowed to opt out of the system although private employers in texas don’t have to carry workers’ comp coverage they’re subject to reporting and notification requirements if they choose not to do so very large employers may insure themselves but they must apply with the state and meet stringent selfinsurance requirements businesses don’t have to provide coverage for all kinds of workers for example workers’ comp generally doesn’t cover independent contractors domestic workers in private homes and volunteers some states also exclude casual or seasonal workers when the work they do isn’t part of the employer’s regular business or profession even if they aren’t required to buy workers’ comp insurance many employers choose to do so states generally allow exempt employers to opt into the workers’ comp system which then affords them the same liability protections what happens if employers don’t have workers’ comp insurance if a business lacks workers’ comp insurance coverage an injured employee may sue the employer in civil court more on that below some states have special funds to provide workers’ comp benefits for injured employees of illegally uninsured employers the funds may then go after the employers to seek reimbursement for the cost of those benefits employers who don’t have legally required insurance may also face criminal charges and steep fines what injuries and illness are covered by workers’ comp workers compensation laws cover only injuries or illnesses that are related to the employee’s job—or in legalese “arising out of employment and occurring during the course of employment” aoecoe an injury doesn’t necessarily have to happen at the workplace to be considered aoecoe for example workers’ comp usually covers injuries that happen while employees are traveling on business running an office errand or attending a businessrelated social function learn more about the rules on whether injuries or illnesses are workrelated  along with sudden accidents like falling off scaffolding on the job injuries and illnesses covered by workers’ comp may also includecumulative trauma such as repetitive strain or stress injuries that develop over time from performing the same physical tasks over and over andoccupational diseases that result from workplace conditions such as lung disease or cancer from exposure to toxic chemicals or in some states heart disease or digestive problems related to onthejob stress however workers’ comp generally won’t cover injuries that were caused by the employee’s intoxication or use of illegal drugs many states also deny coverage in other situations involving misconduct including injuries thatwere selfinflictedresulted from a fight the injured employee started orhappened when the employee was committing a felony or serious crime in some states injuries may not be covered if they happened while the employees were violating company policy or engaging in ‘horseplay” that is fooling around but courts may still decide those injures are workrelated if the employer condoned the behavior or it was an accepted or common part of the working environment state laws often have special rules for workers’ comp claims that are filed after the employee is fired or laid off related ads when can employees sue employers in court for injuries workers’ comp laws don’t protect employers from all employee lawsuits related to injuries there are limited exceptions that allow employees to sue their employers when they’ve been hurt but those exceptions vary from state to state when employees are injured because of their employers’ intentional or reckless actions some states allow those employees to bypass the workers’ comp system and sue the employer in court for a full range of money damages including punitive damages intended to punish the employer and pain and suffering the mental anguish physical discomfort or overall loss of enjoyment of life caused by the injuries the same is usually true if the employer didn’t obtain required workers’ compensation insurance employees may also be able to file lawsuits outside workers’ comp against third parties such as the manufacturers of defective products or the other driver in a workrelated car accident what are employers’ responsibilities under workers compensation in addition to carrying insurance to cover workrelated injuries employers have a number of other obligations under state workers compensation laws post notices and advise employees of their legal rights employers must post required notices in a convenient location frequented by employees during working hours the notices or posters mustinclude important information about employees right including the right to receive medical treatmentgive details about available workers’ compensation benefits andprovide the name of the companys workers compensation carrier or the fact that the employer is selfinsured as well as who is responsible for adjusting claims employers must also provide the same notice to new hires provide claim forms to injured employers typically employers must provide injured employees with a workers compensation claim form within 24 hours after the employee has given notice of an onthejob injury or workrelated illness even if the employee hasn’t given this notice the employer may still be obligated to provide the forms if it knew about the injury employers must also supply the employee with written information usually a pamphlet about the employees rights under the workers comp system the written material should provide details about available benefits and how to file a claim for more information about employee health and safety laws as well as other human resources
