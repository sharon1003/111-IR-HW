from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search the plea bargain also plea agreement plea deal copping a plea or plea in mitigation is any agreement in a criminal case between the prosecutor and defendant whereby the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a particular charge in return for some concession from the prosecutor this may mean that the defendant will plead guilty to a less serious charge or to one of the several charges in return for the dismissal of other charges or it may mean that the defendant will plead guilty to the original criminal charge in return for a more lenient sentence 1a plea bargain allows both parties to avoid a lengthy criminal trial and may allow criminal defendants to avoid the risk of conviction at trial on a more serious charge for example in the u s legal system a criminal defendant charged with a felony theft charge the conviction of which would require imprisonment in state prison may be offered the opportunity to plead guilty to a misdemeanor theft charge which may not carry a custodial sentence in cases such as an automobile collision when there is a potential for civil liability against the defendant the defendant may agree to plead no contest or guilty with a civil reservation which essentially is a guilty plea without admitting civil liability plea bargaining can present a dilemma to defense attorneys in that they must choose between vigorously seeking a good deal for their present client or maintaining a good relationship with the prosecutor for the sake of helping future clients 2 however defense attorneys are required by the ethics of the bar to defend the present clients interests over the interests of others violation of this rule may result in disciplinary sanctions being imposed against the defense attorney by the appropriate states bar association 3in charge bargaining defendants plead guilty to a less serious crime than the original charge in count bargaining they plead guilty to a subset of multiple original charges in sentence bargaining they plead guilty agreeing in advance what sentence will be given however this sentence can still be denied by the judge in fact bargaining defendants plead guilty but the prosecutor agrees to stipulate ie to affirm or concede certain facts that will affect how the defendant is punished under the sentencing guidelines contents  hide 1 advantages2

bargaining has been defended as a voluntary exchange that leaves both parties better off in that defendants have many procedural and substantive rights but by pleading guilty defendants sell these rights to the prosecutor for a defendant who believes that conviction is almost certain a discount to the sentence is more useful than an unlikely chance of acquittal 4 for the prosecutor it means that a conviction is guaranteed 5  clarification needed by allowing a quicker trial it saves money and resources for the courts and prosecutors 6 it also means that victims and witnesses do not have to testify at the trial which in some cases can be traumatic 6disadvantages and issues  editscope for coercive manipulation  editplea bargaining is criticized particularly outside the united states on the grounds that its close relationship with rewards threats and coercion potentially endanger the correct legal outcome 7author martin yant discusses the use of coercion in plea bargaining even when the charges are more serious prosecutors often can still bluff defense attorneys and their clients into pleading guilty to a lesser offense as a result people who might have been acquitted because of lack of evidence but also who are in fact truly innocent will often plead guilty to the charge why in a word fear and the more numerous and serious the charges studies have shown the greater the fear that explains why prosecutors sometimes seem to file every charge imaginable against defendants 8this tactic is prohibited in some other countries—for example in the united kingdom the prosecutors code states prosecutors should never go ahead with more charges than are necessary just to encourage a defendant to plead guilty to a few in the same way they should never go ahead with a more serious charge just to encourage a defendant to plead guilty to a less serious one 9although it adds that in some kinds of complex cases such as major fraud trials the overriding duty of the prosecutor is  to see that justice is done the procedures must command public and judicial confidence many defendants in serious and complex fraud cases are represented by solicitors experienced in commercial litigation including negotiation this means that the defendant is usually protected from being put under improper pressure to plead the main danger to be guarded against in these cases is that the prosecutor is persuaded to agree to a plea or a basis that is not in the public interest and interests of justice because it does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending  any plea agreement must reflect the seriousness and extent of the offending and give the court adequate sentencing powers it must consider the impact of an agreement on victims and also the wider public whilst respecting the rights of defendants 10john h langbein argues that the modern american system of plea bargaining is comparable to the medieval european system of torture there is of course a difference between having your limbs crushed if you refuse to confess or suffering some extra years of imprisonment if you refuse to confess but the difference is of degree not kind plea bargaining like torture is coercive like the medieval europeans the americans are now operating a procedural system that engages in condemnation without adjudication 11consequences for innocent accused  edittheoretical work based on the prisoners dilemma is one reason that in many countries plea bargaining is forbidden often precisely the prisoners dilemma scenario applies it is in the interest of both suspects to confess and testify against the other suspect irrespective of the innocence of the accused arguably the worst case is when only one party is guilty here the innocent one has no incentive to confess while the guilty one has a strong incentive to confess and give testimony including false testimony against the innocent  citation neededa 2009 study by the european association of law and economics observed that innocent defendants are consistently more likely than guilty defendants to reject otherwisefavorable pleas proposals even when theoretically disadvantageous to do so because of perceived unfairness and would do so even if the expected sanction would be worse if they proceeded to trial the study concluded that  this somewhat counterintuitive cost of innocence where the preferences of innocents lead them collectively to fare worse than their guilty counterparts is further increased by the practice of imposing much harsher sentences at trial on defendants who contest the charges this trial penalty seeks to facilitate guilty pleas by guilty defendants and ironically disproportionately collectively penalizes innocents who reject on fairness grounds some offers their guilty counterparts accept 12the extent to which innocent people will accept a plea bargain and plead guilty is contentious and has been subjected to considerable research much research has focused on the relatively few actual cases where innocence was subsequently proven such as successful appeals for murder and rape based upon dna evidence which tend to be atypical of trials as a whole being by their nature only the most serious kinds of crime other studies have focused on presenting hypothetical situations to subjects and asking what choice they would make more recently some studies have attempted to examine actual reactions of innocent persons generally when faced with actual plea bargain decisions a study by dervan and edkins 2013 attempted to recreate a reallife controlled plea bargain situation rather than merely asking theoretical responses to a theoretical situation—a common approach in previous research 13 it placed subjects in a situation where an accusation of academic fraud cheating could be made of which some subjects were in fact by design actually guilty and knew this and some were innocent but faced seemingly strong evidence of guilt and no verifiable proof of innocence each subject was presented with the evidence of guilt and offered a choice between facing an academic ethics board and potentially a heavy penalty in terms of extra courses and other forfeits or admitting guilt and accepting a lighter sentence the study found that as expected from court statistics around 90 of accused subjects who were actually guilty chose to take the pleabargain and plead guilty it also found that around 56 of subjects who were actually innocent and privately knew it also to take the pleabargain and plead guilty for reasons including avoiding formal quasilegal processes uncertainty possibility of greater harm to personal future plans or deprivation of home environment due to remedial courses the authors stated 13previous research has argued that the innocence problem is minimal because defendants are riskprone and willing to defend themselves before a tribunal our research however demonstrates that when study participants are placed in real rather than hypothetical bargaining situations and are presented with accurate information regarding their statistical probability of success just as they might be so informed by their attorney or the government during a criminal plea negotiation innocent defendants are highly riskaverse more pressure to plea bargain may be applied in weak cases where there is less certainty of both guilt and jury conviction than strong cases prosecutors tend to be strongly motivated by conviction rates and there are many indications that prosecutors are willing to go a long way to avoid losing cases and that when prosecutors decide to proceed with such weak cases they are often willing to go a long way to assure that a plea bargain is struck 14 prosecutors often have great power to procure a desired level of incentive as they select the charges to be presented for this reason 14 plea bargains are just as likely in strong and weak cases prosecutors only need to adjust the offer to the probability of conviction in order to reach an agreement thus weaker cases result in more lenient plea bargains and stronger ones in relative harshness but both result in an agreement  when the case is weak the parties must rely on charge bargaining  but charge bargaining is hardly an obstacle charge bargaining in weak cases is not the exception it is the norm all around the country thus even if the evidence against innocent defendants is on average weaker the likelihood of plea bargains is not dependent on guilt another situation in which an innocent defendant may plead guilty is in the case of a defendant who cannot raise bail and who is being held in custody in a jail or detention facility because it may take months or even years for criminal cases to come to trial or even indictment in some jurisdictions an innocent defendant who is offered a plea bargain that includes a sentence of less time than he would otherwise spend in jail awaiting an indictment or a trial may choose to accept the plea arrangement and plead guilty 15misalignment of prosecutor goals and incentives  editagency problems sometimes arise in plea bargaining in that although the prosecutor represents the people and the defense attorney represents the defendant these agents goals may be far from congruent with those of their principals moreover prosecutors and defense attorneys often view each other as colleagues and generally wish to maintain good relations with one another a defense attorney often receives a flat fee or in any event will not receive enough additional money if he goes to trial to cover the costs of doing so this can create an incentive to plea bargain even at the expense of the defense attorneys clients interests on the other hand the prosecutor may wish to maintain a high conviction rate and avoid losing highprofile trials thus settling a case by plea bargain may further his interests even if the resulting sentence would not effectively deter crime 16 as many crimes have very narrow sentencing bands a prosecutor often has scope to propose whatever degree of discounted charges or substitution of misdemeanor rather than felony charges to whatever extent they believe would incentivise a defendant to make a guilty plea and accept a speedy conviction regardless of actual guilt issues related to cost of justice  editanother argument against plea bargaining is that it may not actually reduce the costs of administering justice for example if a prosecutor has only a 25 chance of winning his case and sending the defendant away to prison for 10 years he may make a plea agreement for a sentence of one year but if plea bargaining is unavailable a prosecutor may drop the case completely 17usage in common law countries  editunited states  editmain article plea bargaining in the united states plea bargaining is a significant part of the criminal justice system in the united states the vast majority roughly 90 18 of criminal cases in the united states are settled by plea bargain rather than by a jury trial 19 plea bargains are subject to the approval of the court and different states and jurisdictions have different rules the federal sentencing guidelines are followed in federal cases and have been created to ensure a standard of uniformity in all cases decided in the federal courts a two or threelevel offense level reduction is usually available for those who accept responsibility by not holding the prosecution to the burden of proving its case this usually amounts to a complete sentence reduction had they gone to trial and lost 20the federal rules of criminal procedure provide for two main types of plea agreements an 11 c 1 b agreement does not bind the court the prosecutors recommendation is merely advisory and the defendant cannot withdraw his plea if the court decides to impose a sentence other than what was stipulated in the agreement an 11 c 1 c agreement however binds the court once the court accepts the agreement when such an agreement is proposed the court can reject it if it disagrees with the proposed sentence in which case the defendant has an opportunity to withdraw his plea 21plea bargains are so common in the superior courts of california the general trial courts that the judicial council of california has published an optional sevenpage form containing all mandatory advisements required by federal and state law to help prosecutors and defense attorneys reduce such bargains into written plea agreements 22certain aspects of the american justice system serve to promote plea bargaining for example the adversarial nature of the u s criminal justice system puts judges in a passive role in which they have no independent access to information with which to assess the strength of the case against the defendant the prosecutor and defense may thus control the outcome of a case through plea bargaining the court must approve a plea bargain as being within the interests of justice 23the lack of compulsory prosecution also gives prosecutors greater discretion as well as the inability of crime victims to mount a private prosecution and their limited ability to influence plea agreements 24 defendants who are held in custody—who either do not have the right to bail or cannot afford bail or who do not qualify for release on their own recognizance—may get out of jail immediately following the judge’s acceptance of a plea 25generally once a plea bargain is made and accepted by the courts the matter is final and cannot be appealed however a defendant may withdraw his plea for certain legal reasons 26 and a defendant may agree to a conditional plea bargain whereby she pleads guilty and accepts a sentence but reserves the right to appeal a specific matter such as violation of a constitutional right if the defendant does not win on appeal the agreement is carried out if the defendant is successful on appeal the bargain is terminated the defendant in doggett v united states made such a bargain reserving the right to appeal solely on the grounds that he was not given a speedy trial as required by the united states constitution doggetts claim was upheld by the united states supreme court and he was freed canada  editin canada the courts always have the final say with regard to sentencing nevertheless plea bargaining has become an accepted part of the criminal justice system although judges and crown attorneys are often reluctant to refer to it as such in most canadian criminal proceedings the crown has the ability to recommend a lighter sentence than it would seek following a guilty verdict in exchange for a guilty plea 27like other common law jurisdictions the crown can also agree to withdraw some charges against the defendant in exchange for a guilty plea this has become standard procedure for certain offences such as impaired driving note that in the case of hybrid offences the crown must make a binding decision as to whether to proceed summarily or by indictment prior to the defendant making his or her plea if the crown elects to proceed summarily and the defendant then pleads not guilty the crown cannot change its election therefore the crown is not in a position to offer to proceed summarily in exchange for a guilty plea canadian judges are not bound by the crowns sentencing recommendations and could impose harsher or more lenient penalties therefore the crown and the defence will often make a joint submission with respect to sentencing while a joint submission can entail both the crown and defence recommending exactly the same disposition of a case this is not common except in cases that are sufficiently minor that the crown is willing to recommend a discharge in more serious cases a joint submission normally call for a sentence within relatively narrow range with the crown arguing for a sentence at the upper end of the range and the defence arguing for a sentence at the lower end so as to maintain the visibility of the judges ability to exercise discretion 28judges are not bound to impose a sentence within the range of a joint submission and a judges disregard for a joint submission is not in itself grounds for the sentence to be altered on appeal however if a judge routinely disregards joint submissions that judge would compromise the ability of the crown to offer meaningful incentives for defendants to plead guilty defence lawyers would become reluctant to enter into joint submissions if they were thought to be of little value with a particular judge which would thus result in otherwise avoidable trials for these reasons canadian judges will normally impose a sentence within the range of any joint submission 29following a supreme court of canada ruling that imposes strict time limits on the resolution of criminal cases eighteen months for cases in provincial court and thirty months for cases in superior court several provinces have initiated andor intensified measures intended to maximize the number of minor criminal cases resolved by a plea bargain largely unique to the canadian justice system is that further negotiations concerning the final disposition of a criminal case may also arise even after a sentence has been passed this is because in canada the crown has by common law standards a very broad right to appeal acquittals  citation needed and also a right to appeal for harsher sentences except in cases where the sentence imposed was maximum allowed therefore in canada after sentencing the defence sometimes has an incentive to try and persuade the crown to not appeal a case in exchange for the defence also declining to appeal while strictly speaking this is not plea bargaining it is done for largely the same reasons england and wales  editplea bargaining is permitted in the legal system of england and wales guidelines by the sentencing council state that the earlier the guilty plea is entered the greater the discount to the sentence the maximum discount permitted is one third for a plea entered at the earliest stage there is no minimum discount a guilty plea entered on the first proper day of the trial would be expected provide a discount of one tenth the discount can sometimes involve changing the type of punishment such as substituting a prison sentence for community service the guidelines do not permit any factors other than the timing of the plea to affect the discount 6plea bargaining 30 in magistrates court trials is permitted only to the extent that the prosecutors and the defence can agree that the defendant will plead guilty to some charges and the prosecutor will drop the remainder  citation needed however although this is not conducting a plea bargain in cases before the crown court the defence can request an indication from the judge of the likely maximum sentence that would be imposed should the defendant decide to plead guilty 31 32in the case of hybrid offences in england and wales the decision whether to deal with a case in magistrates court or crown court is not made by magistrates until after a plea has been entered a defendant is thus unable to plead guilty in exchange for having a case dealt with in magistrates court which has lesser sentencing powers india  editplea bargaining was introduced in india by the criminal law amendment act 2005 which amended the code of criminal procedure and introduced a new chapter xxi a in the code enforceable from july 5 2006 33 34 it allows plea bargaining for cases in which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for 7 years however offenses affecting the socioeconomic condition of the country and offenses committed against a woman or a child below 14 are excluded 33in 2007 sakharam bandekar case became the first such case in india where the accused sakharam bandekar requested lesser punishment in return for confessing to his crime using plea bargaining however the court rejected his plea and accepted cbi s argument that the accused was facing serious charges of corruption 35 finally the court convicted bandekar and sentenced him to 3 years imprisonment 36pakistan  editplea bargain as a formal legal provision was introduced in pakistan by the national accountability ordinance 1999 an anticorruption law a special feature of this plea bargain is that the accused applies for it accepting guilt and offers to return the proceeds of corruption as determined by investigatorsprosecutors after an endorsement by the chairman national accountability bureau the request is presented before the court which decides whether it should be accepted or not if the request for plea bargain is accepted by the court the accused stands convicted but neither is sentenced if in trial nor undergoes any sentence previously pronounced by a lower court if in appeal the accused is disqualified to take part in elections hold any public office or obtain a loan from any bank the accused is also dismissed from service if a government official in other cases formal plea bargains in pakistan are limited but the prosecutor has the authority to drop a case or a charge in a case and in practice often does so in return for a defendant pleading guilty on some lesser charge no bargaining takes place over the penalty which is the courts sole privilege 37other common law jurisdictions  editin some common law jurisdictions such as singapore and the australian state of victoria plea bargaining is practiced only to the extent that the prosecution and the defense can agree that the defendant will plead guilty to some charges andor to reduced charges in exchange for the prosecutor withdrawing the remaining andor more serious charges in new south wales a 1025 discount on the sentence is customarily given in exchange for an early guilty plea but this concession is expected to be granted by the judge as a way of recognizing the utilitarian value of an early guilty plea to the justice system  it is never negotiated with a prosecutor 38 the courts in these jurisdictions have made it plain that they will always decide what the appropriate penalty is to be no bargaining takes place between the

civil law this is because unlike common law systems civil law systems have no concept of plea —if the defendant confesses a confession is entered into evidence but the prosecution is not absolved of the duty to present a full case a court may decide that a defendant is innocent even though they presented a full confession also unlike common law systems prosecutors in civil law countries may have limited or no power to drop or reduce charges after a case has been filed and in some countries their power to drop or reduce charges before a case has been filed is limited making plea bargaining

about whether witness testimony originating from a plea deal in the united states was admissible in a danish criminal trial 2972008 h the supreme court of denmark  danish højesteret unanimously ruled that plea bargains are prima facie not legal under danish law 44 but that the witnesses in the particular case would be allowed to testify regardless with the caveat that the lower court consider the possibility that the testimony was untrue or at least influenced by the benefits of the plea bargain 44 the supreme court did however point out that danish law contains mechanisms similar to plea bargains such as §8210 of the danish penal code  danish straffeloven which states that a sentence may be reduced if the perpetrator of a crime provides information that helps solve a crime perpetrated by others 45 44 or §23a of the danish competition law  danish konkurrenceloven which states that someone can apply to avoid being fined or prosecuted for participating in a cartel if they provide

limited form of plea bargaining  comparution sur reconnaissance préalable de culpabilité or crpc often summarized as plaider coupable in 2004 was highly controversial in france in this system the public prosecutor could propose to suspects of relatively minor crimes a penalty not exceeding one year in prison the deal if accepted had to be accepted by a judge opponents usually lawyers and leftist political parties argued that plea bargaining would greatly infringe on the rights of defense the longstanding constitutional right of presumption of innocence the rights of suspects in police custody and the right to a fair trial for instance robert badinter argued that plea bargaining would give too much power to the public prosecutor and would encourage defendants to accept a sentence only to avoid the risk of a bigger sentence in a trial even if they did not really deserve it only a minority of criminal cases are settled by that method in 2009 77500 out of the 673700 or 115 of the

that has a technical name of penalty application under request of the parts in fact the bargaining is not about the charges but about the penalty applied in sentence reduced up to 52 one third when the defendant deems that the punishment that would concretely be handed down is less than a fiveyear imprisonment or that it would just be a fine the defendant may request to plea bargain with the prosecutor the defendant is rewarded with a reduction on the sentence and has other advantages such as that the defendant does not pay the fees on the proceeding the defendant must accept the penalty for the charges even if the pleabargained sentence has some particular matters in further compensation proceedings no matter how serious the charges are sometimes the prosecutor agrees to reduce a charge or to drop some of multiple charges in exchange for the defendants acceptance of the penalty defendant in the request could argue with the penalty and aggravating and extenuating circumstancing with the prosecutor that can accept or refuse the request could also be made by the prosecutor the plea bargaining could be granted if the penalty that could be concretely applied is after the reduction of one third inferior to fiveyear imprisonment so called patteggiamento allargato wide bargaining when the penalty applied after the reduction of one third is inferior of two years imprisonment or is only a fine so called patteggiamento ristretto limited bargaining the defendant can have other advantages like sentence suspended and the effacement of the crime if in five year of the sentence the defendant doesnt commit a similar crime in the request when it could be applied the conditional suspension of the penalty according to the article 163 and following of italian penal code the defendant could subordinate the request to the grant of the suspension if the judge rejects the suspension the bargaining is refused when both the prosecutor and the defendant have come to an agreement the proposal is submitted to the judge who can refuse or accept the plea bargaining according to italian law a bargain doesnt need a guilty plea in italy there is no plea declaration for this reason a bargaining sentence is only an acceptance of the penalty in exchange with the stop of investigation and trial and has no binding cogency in other trials especially in civil trials in
