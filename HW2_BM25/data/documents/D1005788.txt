some astounding scenery its very beautiful indeed the mountains are majestic and wonderous a great backdrop for radium hot springs the parking is plentiful and we had no issues with finding a spot we arrived midafternoon hoping that the springs wouldnt be as busy but it was the change rooms were plentiful and didnt have a problem finding one there are those however do not feel it necessary to use one and walked around buck naked back and forth an assault to the senses let me tell ya i had to divery my eyes several times lol shoes are to be left outside the changeroom area and bring your own towels or youll be charged a minimal fee for the use of theirs lockers require a looney 1 that is nonrefundable their are showers in the changeroom area when you are ready to leave with soap pumps to use if you choose theres a cool and hot pool we choose the hot and then my son wanted to make use of the cooler one so off we went definately cooler after being submerged in the hot one for about a half hour the cooler pool had a few slides for the kids and a diving board this is the pool that kids can fool around and have fun in the hot pool was very crowded parents were allowing there kids to get rowdy but the lifeguards put a quick halt to any shenanigans  which was terrific it was quite warm the day we went but while there we experienced a short downpour of rainvery nice everyone was enjoying it i noticed many french bonjour people and asian english speaking the hot springs are located within parks canada so both english and french languages apply here as canada is officially a biligual country most of the population speak english only knowing a bit of broken french areas of the hot springs are surrounded by rock and is quite stunning picturesque dont forget your camera  youll want to have pics for sure pleasant experience but as earlier stated  busy enjoy ask heatrav about radium hot springs2 thank heatrav this review is the subjective opinion of a trip advisor

thoughtful aspects of the place especially that shoes are taken off before entering the change rooms therefore keeping the place clean for bare feet the pools though clorinated are a delight for their proximity to the hills the only thing that got me out was the dizziness from being in too long worth the stop ask auntydaff about radium hot springs1 thank auntydaff this review is the subjective
