from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search werner syndrome progeriawerner syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance specialty endocrinology werner syndrome ws also known as adult progeria  1 is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 2 which is characterized by the appearance of premature aging 3werner syndrome is named after the german scientist otto werner 4 he identified the syndrome in four siblings observed with premature aging which he explored as the subject of his dissertation of 1904 5it has a global incidence rate of less than 1 in 100000 live births 6 although incidence in japan and sardinia is higher affecting 1 in 20000–40000 and 1 in 50000 respectively 7 8 1300 cases had been reported as of 2006 9 affected individuals typically grow and develop normally until puberty the mean age of diagnosis is twentyfour often realized when the adolescent growth spurt is not observed 10 the youngest person diagnosed was six years old 11 the median and mean ages of death are 47–48 and 54 years respectively 12 the main cause of death is cardiovascular disease or cancer 9 10contents  hide 1 characteristics11 gene expression12 dna methylation13 diagnosis and

osteoporosis loss of bone mass telangiectasia and malignancies 6 9 the prevalence of rare cancers such as meningiomas are increased in individuals with werner syndrome 13gene expression  editgene transcription changes found in ws cells are strikingly similar to those observed in normal aging 14 at the level of gene expression wrn protein deficiency causes changes in the pattern of gene expression that markedly resemble those of normal old age 15dna methylation  editthe blood of ws patients exhibits accelerated dna methylation changes that are similar to those observed in normal aging according to a molecular biomarker of aging known as epigenetic clock  16diagnosis and clinical symptoms  editthe mutation in the wrn gene that causes werner syndrome is autosomal and recessive meaning that sufferers must inherit a copy of the gene from each parent patients display rapid premature aging beginning in young adulthood usually in their early twenties 17 diagnosis is based on six cardinal symptoms premature graying of the hair or hair loss presence of bilateral cataracts atrophied or tight skin soft tissue calcification sharp facial features and an abnormal highpitched voice 18 patients are also generally shortstatured due to absence of the adolescent growth spurt patients also display decreased fertility 19 the most common symptom of the six is premature graying and loss of hair this is also generally the earliest observed symptom with hair loss occurring first on the scalp and the eyebrows 19werner syndrome patients often have skin that appears shiny and tight and may also be thin or hardened 17 19 this is due to atrophy of the subcutaneous tissue and dermal fibrosis 19 over time facial features may be more apparent due to these skin conditions other associated skin conditions include ulcers 19 which are very difficult to treat in werner syndrome patients and are caused in part by decreased potential of skin cells for replication 20ws cataracts are distinctly different from those of normal aging they are associated with problems in the lens posterior cortex and subcapsular regions these cataracts are generally treatable with cataract surgery which should restore normal vision 19symptoms become apparent in the late teens and early twenties and continue to progress most patients live to about fifty years of age the most common causes of death for people are associated diseases and complications especially atherosclerosis and cancer 17associated diseases  editwerner syndrome patients are at increased risk for several other diseases many associated with aging atherosclerosis the thickening of artery walls due to cholesterol buildup is one common complication 18 while normal atherosclerosis generally involves the major arteries smaller arterioles are more likely to be affected 21 it is possible nervous system disorders are associated brain atrophy is present in 40 of patients 20 18 osteoporosis the loss of bone mineral density common in postmenopausal women is another common symptom in contrast with the normal population the rate of osteoporosis is especially high for male patients 20 diabetes mellitus is another common accompaniment 18 skin ulcers occur in about 75 of patients – and can be difficult to treat if skin ulcers become badly infected or develop gangrene they often require amputation unlike most other related diseases and complications these ulcers are not associated with normal aging 20patients are also at an increased risk of cancer especially malignant melanoma 20 softtissue sarcomas are the most common cancer types 19 other types of skin cancer other epithelial cancers such as thyroid and liver cancers mds  myelodysplastic syndrome  and mfh  malignant fibrous histiocytoma are also prevalent among 20 mutations in the wrn gene especially singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps are associated with many of the cancers and other associated diseases wrn snps correlate with cancers such as sarcomas and nonhodgkin lymphomas as well as diabetes and cardiovascular problems including atherosclerosis 22causes  editapproximately 90 of individuals presenting werner syndrome have any of a range of mutations in the gene wrn the only gene currently attributed to cause werner syndrome 11 12 wrn which lies on chromosome 8 in humans 23 encodes the wrnp protein a 1432 amino acid protein with a central domain resembling members of the rec q helicases rec q helicases are a special type of helicase that function at unique times during dna repair of doubled stranded breaks which are a form of dna damage that results in a break of both strands of dna thus rec q helicases are important for maintaining dna stability and loss of function of these helicases has important implications in the development of werner syndrome 24 in addition to the central domain there are three exonuclease domains at the nterminus and a helicase and ribonuclease d cterminal hrdc domain at the cterminus 25when functioning normally the wrn gene and associated protein are important for maintaining genome stability 21 wrnp is active in unwinding dna a step necessary in dna repair and dna replication 3 7 specifically the wrn protein has an important role in responding to replication malfunctions particularly doublestranded breaks and stalled replication machinery 21 wrn may reactivate replication by preventing unwanted recombination processes from occurring or by promoting recombination depending on the type of dna damage in addition the wrn protein physically interacts with or binds to several other proteins that are involved in processing dna 26 for example the wrn protein binds to rpa which stimulates wrnps helicase activity wrnp also physically interacts with p53 a tumor suppressor gene that stops the formation of tumors and the progression of cancers 27 which inhibits the exonuclease activity of the wrnp 28 since wrnps function depends on dna it is only functional when localized to the nucleus dna repair processes  editthe finding that wrn protein interacts with dnapkcs and the ku protein complex combined with evidence that wrn deficient cells produce extensive deletions at sites of joining of nonhomologous dna ends suggests a role for wrn protein in the dna repair process of nonhomologous end joining nhej 29 wrn protein also physically interacts with the major nhej factor x4l4  xrcc4  dna ligase 4 complex 30 x4l4 stimulates wrn exonuclease activity that likely facilitates dna end processing prior to final ligation by x4l4 30wrn protein appears to play a role in resolving recombination intermediate structures during homologous recombinational repair hrr of dna doublestrand breaks 29wrn protein participates in a complex with rad51 rad54 rad54b and atr proteins in carrying out the recombination step during interstrand dna crosslink repair 31evidence was presented that wrn protein plays a direct role in the repair of methylation induced dna damage this process likely involves the helicase and exonuclease activities of wrn protein that operate together with dna polymerase beta in long patch base excision repair 32effects on cell structure  function  editmutations which cause werner syndrome all occur at the regions of the gene which encode for protein and not at noncoding regions 33 there are 35 different known mutations of wrn which correspond to stop codons insertions or deletions that result in a frameshift mutation 28 these mutations can have a range of effects they may decrease the stability of the transcribed messenger rna m rna which increases the rate at which they are degraded with less m rna less is available to be translated into the wrnp protein mutations may also lead to the truncation shortening of the wrnp protein leading to the loss of its nuclear localization signal sequence thus it is no longer transported into the nucleus where it interacts with the dna this leads to a reduction in dna repair 33 furthermore mutated proteins are more likely to be degraded than normal wrnp 7 apart from causing defects in dna repair its aberrant association with p53 downregulates the function of p53 leading to a reduction in p53dependent apoptosis and increasing the survival of these dysfunctional cells 34 cells of affected individuals also have reduced lifespan in culture 35 have more chromosome breaks and translocations 36 and have extensive deletions 37patients with werner syndrome lose the rec q helicase activity in the wrn protein because of the loss of its cterminus region but the mechanism by which this happens is unclear the loss of the helicase activity can have farreaching consequences in terms of cell stability and mutation one instance of these consequences involves telomeres it is thought that the wrn helicase activity is important not only for dna repair and recombination but also for maintaining telomere length and stability thus wrn helicase is important for preventing catastrophic telomere loss during dna replication 38 in a normal cell the telomeres the ends of chromosomes undergo repeated shortening during the cell cycle which can prevent the cell from dividing and multiplying this event can be counteracted by telomerase an enzyme that extends the ends of the chromosomes by copying the telomeres and synthesizing an identical but new end that can be added to the existing chromosome 39 however patients with werner syndrome often exhibit accelerated telomere shortening indicating that there may be a connection between the loss of the wrn helicase activity and telomere and cell instability while evidence shows that telomere dysfunction is consistent with the premature aging in ws it has yet to be determined if it is the actual cause of the genomic instability observed in cells and the high rate of cancer in ws patients 38without the wrn protein the interwoven pathways of dna repair and telomere maintenance fail to suppress cancer and the aging symptoms seen in patients with ws events such as rapid telomere shortening cause werner syndrome cells to exhibit low responses to overall cellular stress in addition to telomere dysfunction overexpression of oncogenes and oxidation can induce this type of response high stress causes a synergistic effect where ws cells become even more sensitive to agents that increase cell stress and agents that damage dna as a result ws cells show a drastic reduction in replicative lifespan and enter into a stage of aging prematurely the accumulation of these damaged cells due to telomere shortening over many years may be indicative of why werner syndrome symptoms only appear after an individual is about twenty years old 40protection of dna against oxidative damage  editwrn protein was found to have a specific role in preventing or repairing dna damages resulting from chronic oxidative stress particularly in slowly replicating cells 41 this finding suggested that wrn may be important in dealing with oxidative dna damages that underlie normal aging 41 see dna damage theory of aging  diagnosis  editthis section is empty you can help by adding to it august 2017treatment  edita cure for werner syndrome has not yet been discovered it is often treated by managing the associated diseases and relieving symptoms to improve quality of life the skin ulcers that accompany ws can be treated in several ways depending on the severity topical treatments can be used for minor ulcers but are not effective in preventing new ulcers from occurring in the most severe cases surgery may be required to implant a skin graft or amputate a limb if necessary diseases commonly associated with werner syndrome such as diabetes and cancer are treated in generally the same ways as they would be for a nonwerner syndrome individual a change in diet  exercise can help prevent and control arteriosclerosis and regular cancer screenings can allow for early detection of cancer 42there is recent evidence that suggests that the cytokine suppressive antiinflammatory drug sb203580 may be a possible therapeutic option for patients with werners syndrome this drug targets the p38 signaling pathway which may become activated as a result of genomic instability and stalled replication forks that are characteristic mutations in ws this activation of p38 may play a role in the onset of premature cell aging skin aging cataracts and graying of the hair the p38 pathway has also been implicated in the antiinflammatory response that causes atherosclerosis diabetes and osteoporosis all of which are associated with werners syndrome this drug has shown to revert the aged characteristics of young ws cells to those seen in normal young cells and improve the lifespan of ws cells in vitro sb203580 is still in the clinical trial stages and the same results have not yet been seen in vivo 43in 2010 vitamin c supplementation was found to reverse the premature aging and several tissue dysfunctions in a genetically modified mouse model of the disease vitamin c supplementation also appeared to normalize several agerelated molecular markers such as the increased levels of the transcription factor nfκb in addition it decreases activity of genes activated in human werner syndrome and increases gene activity involved in tissue repair supplementation of vitamin c is suspected to be beneficial in the treatment of human werner syndrome although there was no evidence of antiaging activity in nonmutant mice 44 in general treatments are available for only the symptoms or complications and not for the disease itself 45background and history  editotto werner was the first to observe werner syndrome in 1904 as a part of his dissertation research as a german ophthalmologist werner described several progerialike features and juvenile cataracts in many of his patients he noticed these symptoms particularly in a family with four sequential children who all showed the characteristics of the syndrome at around the same age he assumed the cause to be genetic though most of his evidence was clinical between 1934 and 1941 two internists from new york oppenheimer and kugel coined the term werner syndrome igniting a wave of interest and research on the disease 20 during that time agatson and gartner suggested a possible link between werners syndrome and cancer however it was not until 1966 that there was a general consensus on the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the syndrome by 1981 geneticists had located the wrn gene on chromosome 8 leading to its cloning in 1996 this cloning of the wrn was significant because it revealed the predicted wrn protein was made from a family of dna helicases 20 prior to 1996 werner syndrome was thought to be a model for accelerated aging since the discovery of the gene it has become clear that the premature aging displayed in werner syndrome is not the same on a cellular level as normal aging the role of wrn in dna repair and its exonuclease and helicase activities have been the subject of many studies in recent years 21since the initial discovery in 1904 several other cases of werner syndrome have been recorded many of these cases have occurred in japan where a founder effect has caused a higher incidence rate than in other populations the incidence rate of werner syndrome in japan is approximately 1 case per 100 thousand people 1100000 a large contrast with the rate of incidence for the rest of the world which is between 11000000 and 110000000 a founder effect is also apparent in sardinia where there have been 18 recorded cases of werner syndrome 18popular culture  editon the episode stargazer in a puddle from the television series bones the victim has werner syndrome the team discovering in the course of the investigation that her mother killed her daughter because she was dying of another disease and worried that her daughter would have nobody to look after her afterwards with the tragic twist that the mother began to recover from her disease after her daughters death werner syndrome is featured in the film jack starring robin williams in which his character ages four times faster than normal in an early cutscene from the game metal gear solid 4 otacon cites classic werner syndrome as the most likely cause of solid snake s premature aging though he goes on to say that testing had been inconclusive it is however later said that solid snakes body created as a genetically engineered clone had been designed to break down quickly in season 3 episode 9  the ballad of kevin and tess
