shared errors in the dna of humans and apes david a plaisted it has been claimed that there are shared errors in the dna between humans and apes and that this shows that humans and apes must have a common ancestor because the lord would not have inserted common errors in their dna these errors are generally in the form of pseudogenes which are genes that have lost their function for some reason often because control sequences around them are not present here are some thoughts about these shared errors in dna the following material has extensively been modified since edward maxs first response to it1 at first glance this appears to be a strong argument for evolution indeed i found it troubling for a while2 however we are still learning and it is hard to know when a part of the dna is beneficial or harmful how do we know for sure what is an error even the socalled junk nonfunctional dna may have a function that we do not yet understand for example an article in science 4 april 1997 page 39 suggests that satellite dna which some researchers regard as nonfunctional may have a function see also science 1994 feb 4 pp 608610 this whole area is sufficiently new that it is best to wait a little longer we should also look at shared properties of the dna between many species and see if they can consistently be placed in an evolutionary tree if not then this calls into question the humanape connection3 mutations are not completely random its possible that the same kinds of mutations tend to occur in the same way for example where the dna folds or whatever dan hughes also suggests that dna might tend to adopt a low energy state this could explain many common errors note that mutations in a population can be expected to obey more regularities than those among individuals because of the similarities in survival benefits and the laws of large numbers4 maybe the lord inserted those similarities for a reason we do not understand they could even have been inserted as tests of our faith the lord does not force any to believe but gives opportunity to doubt for those who are seeking it5 another possibility is that the lord when he cursed adam and eve after the fall also cursed all life by introducing errors into the dna one could expect that similar species were cursed in a similar way out of fairness6 edward maxs argument is based on the fact that these shared sequences are really errors that is mistakes it seems strange to call something an error when it occurs in a nonfunctional part of the dna since that part of the dna is nonfunctional it doesnt matter what occurs there so there is no justification for calling some of the sequences errors7 something has to appear in the nonfunctional part of the dna why should it be one thing rather than another just by chance accident there are likely to be sequences that resemble genes but this says nothing about their origin do we expect that the lord would have deliberately avoided common subsequences at common locations just so that we would not think there was common descent8 let us consider humans and apes since they are so similar one would expect that they had many similar genes at the creation in similar locations in the genetic material also with the change in environment since then one would expect that some of these genes would no longer be necessary such as the gene for synthesizing vitamin c and that there would be a few such genes in common between apes and men now point mutations arise all the time and if they are fatal or harmful they will disappear from the population have a small frequency if they are neutral they can be passed on so it is reasonable that point mutations inactivating the vitamin c synthesizing genes would occur in both humans and apes and be preserved in both since these genes have little benefit now thus we would get a pseudogene in the same location in humans and apes it could have been present in the individuals on the ark for example this probably would occur for a few other genes as well for organisms that are less similar this still could happen but less often so we would expect to find a pattern of common pseudogenes that reflects the similarity between organisms but not as an evidence of common descent actually the lgglo pseudogene an inactivated vitamin c synthesis gene has been found in one human so far and no apes according to edward max but in his essay he predicts that it should be found in apes too in fact given the similarity in the dna of humans and apes that is a reasonable prediction there are other examples of common pseudogenes that he says have been found in humans and apes but i do not know yet if they occur in exactly the same form in humans and apes or in how many individuals they have been found or how many base pairs they have even if they do occur in the same form this would be a problem for evolutionary theory i think because neutral mutations tend to be eliminated from populations according to the talkorigins archive and one would not expect a neutral mutation to persist for so long some neutral mutations can spread to the whole population but this generally takes a very long time and has a low probability the chance that this will happen is proportional to the frequency of a neutral mutation in the population by seeing how much variation exists between copies of the mutated region in different organisms one could estimate its time of origin and in this way check evolutionary timetables since nonfunctional dna probably mutates at constant rates one would not expect to find a large number of shared neutral mutations among all humans and apes in any event also one would expect to find neutral mutations that had only spread to half or a fourth of the population too since they spread so slowly when they do spread furthermore one would expect a gene to be inactivated in many different ways so that exactly the same form should not be found today in all individuals this would seem to imply a very severe population bottleneck at some time in the past9 it is even possible that the lack of ability to synthesize vitamin c could be an advantage in certain situations although this appears unlikely it could be that individuals without this ability would be forced to move to a different location and this new location could turn out to be a more favorable habitat the same could be true for the loss of some other genes10 before being created life was an idea in the mind of god the relationship between the created life forms reveals something about how ideas develop in the divine mind we cannot say in advance how these ideas develop which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about how the various life forms were interrelated at the creation by the way concerning the junk dna it should also be mentioned that this dna helps to concentrate certain kinds of mutations crossovers recombinations at certain places in a protein molecule and this can be a valuable function the recombinations are likely to occur between the pieces of a gene and not in the midst of it this could have a useful function however this should only be dependent on the length of the junk sequence and not its content the talkorigins site about this subject is carefully reasoned and does a fairly good job of presenting the creationist side by the way although it becomes somewhat biased and sarcastic at the end in my opinion i wanted to comment in more depth about the effects of the curse one of the purposes of the creation is to illustrate spiritual truth before the entrance of sin a perfect creation could faithfully represent spiritual reality after the fall of man this was no longer so now it would be necessary for the plants to bear thorns and thistles to teach spiritual lessons and for the soil to be difficult to work jesus in his parables often referred to the things of nature as illustrations of the workings of good and evil it is sad that the innocent animals had to bear the effects of sin which they had not caused but their sufferings do help to bring to the mind of man the terrible effects of evil and lead him back to god shared errors and rates of evolution it is interesting that the existence of shared errors in dna allows us to estimate rates of evolution because it permits us to put a rough bound on the population size we will make some calculations on this basis of course there are many assumptions so these calculations are not conclusive but they may be of some general interest anyway the key observation is that according to population genetics if a neutral mutation spreads to a population of size n it takes an average of 4n generations to do it so if we see a number of neutral mutations spread to the whole population in m generations this suggests that the average population size since the neutral mutations was at most about m4 now lets consider the time since the cambrian explosion about 570 million years ago and consider the assumed evolutionary ancestors of man during this time this is about 5  10 8 years we can estimate an average generation time of at least half a year even if organisms can reproduce faster a typical individual will be born after more than one reproductive cycle this gives about 10 9 generations suppose that we find shared pseudogenes going back all the way to the beginning of the cambrian explosion but not much farther these would have spread to the whole population in 10 9 generations implying an average population size of about 25  10 8 now we can also assume that shared pseudogenes will be found from later periods which would have had to spread correspondingly faster this implies that the average population size was decreasing with time so we can say that about 125  10 8 is a reasonable value which we round to 10 8 humans have about 3  10 9 base pairs in the genetic material which has been increasing in length thus its average length would probably be less than 2  10 9 thus there would be about 2  10 17 base pairs per generation the rate of mutation is estimated to be one in 10 10 to one in 10 12 base pairs per generation lets use one in 10 11 this means 210 6 mutations per generation we distinguish between major and minor mutations as explained in a theory of small evolution a major mutation is one that changes the shape of a protein this would include increasing its length now of 210 6 mutations per generation maybe 910 would occur in the nonfunctional region leaving 210 5 in the functional region per generation of these probably half would be minor mutations or have no effect at all and the other half would change the shape of a coded protein giving 10 5 major mutations per generation now we estimate the probability that a protein with a changed shape will have a beneficial function in the organism in reality this appears to be vanishingly small but we will be very generous in the immune system it generally takes about 100000 antibodies before one is found that binds to an invading organism antigen this is a highly specialized system and a protein generally has to do more than just bind to something in order to be beneficial so we will say one in 10 6 major mutations is beneficial from 10 5 major mutations in all this implies that about 110 per generation are beneficial even most beneficial mutations do not fix reach a frequency near one in the population so we will assume that 1100 of these fix leading to 11000 per generation that fix in 10 9 generations this leads to 10 6 beneficial major mutations that fix actually the one in 10 6 figure is much too high because antibodies all have the same shape roughly speaking proteins have many different shapes and these also must match precisely for the proteins to interact it takes a lot of information to specify a threedimensional shape so we can say that the probability is one in 10 6 that the shape will be right for an interaction the protein also has to be able to unstick from its partner at the right time this requires a carefully constructed system and we will say another probability of one in 10 6 for this this leads to a probability of one in 10 18 so far to interact with one other protein generally a protein has to interact with at least 2 others so we can square this to obtain one in 10 36 now even if a protein interacts in all probability this will be a harmful interaction so we can say that the chance of a beneficial interaction is much less than one in a thousand leading to a probability of one in 10 40 overall this agrees with the fact that the smallest genes typically have about 150 base pairs and 4 150 is about 10 90 if this admittedly approximate one in 10 40 figure is anywhere correct then the probability of a single beneficial major mutation in the history of human evolution is essentially nil let us consider in more detail the mutations that add a base pair to a gene if this is added in the middle it will probably change the shape of the gene significantly especially will several such mutations in the middle have this effect now a mutation at the end might just tack on a new amino acid to the polypeptide sequence but not change its shape each gene is composed of pieces an average of three pieces each typically in length from 50 to 1000 amino acids that is 150 to 3000 base pairs lets use 1000 as a typical value an addition of a base pair in the middle of a piece will mess up the 3base pair codons terribly and produce a completely new protein with a new shape the chance that a mutation will occur at the end of this sequence is about one in 1000 among those mutations that add a base pair three such mutations will add an amino acid i dont know what fewer than three will do but they and the third one could be neutral harmful or beneficial the first two kinds neutral and harmful will tend to be eliminated and not fix in the population even if the mutation is beneficial after a few amino acids are added on the end the shape of the protein will probably change due to forces involved in protein folding thus we will need about as many changes of shape as their are amino acids added to within a small constant factor if the shape does not change then the function will probably not change much either which would mean that not much change in the organism would occur when we have a protein with a new shape the old function will no longer be performed this will probably be harmful to the organism so in order to allow this we will have to first copy the gene by a mutation this copy will be neutral and probably eliminated too if not it will be beneficial so when the shape changes the mutation is probably harmful and will be eliminated even if not we will end up generating a sequence of genes each differing by only a small length from the preceding members this whole scenario is becoming ridiculous another possibility is to imagine that pieces of existing genes got shuffled around to produce new genes with beneficial functions in the cell a problem with this is that it by definition involves huge changes in protein shape not compatible with evolutions gradual change philosophy also such large changes in structure are very unlikely to produce anything useful finally such shuffling of genetic material is likely to be fatal so it cant happen very often anyway how many of these lengthincreasing mutations can be beneficial note that only about 1 in 1000 of mutations can add an amino acid on the end many mutations will be point mutations and some will delete an amino acid even of those that add an amino acid some will be neutral and some harmful so if we assume that 1 in 1000 of the length increasing mutations at the end of a gene are beneficial it seems a plausible estimate and leads to the same rate of evolution as mentioned earlier if anyone has better figures i would be happy to have them the question is now whether this is an adequate number for this we will use the one in 10 6 probability estimate that a major mutation will be beneficial of course this is undoubtedly much too generous and one in 10 40 or less is more likely the human genome has 310 9 base pairs and maybe 310 8 are functional to create this amount of genetic material we have to increase the length of a gene about this many times to within a factor of 2 at least and each such increase would involve a change in shape of the coded protein this can be avoided by copying genes and mutating the copies but i dont think that this will reduce the number by very much now minor mutations those that do not change the shape of the protein probably dont have much effect on the organism anyway so we would expect that most of the change to the genome was due to major mutations thus we only have 10 6 beneficial major mutations to account for 310 8 functional base pairs or maybe half this number we see that this number is entirely inadequate to get around this we need to increase the population by a factor of at least 10 2 this would mean that we probably would not see many probably not any shared pseudogenes or other shared neutral mutations between different species depending on how the population size varied with time furthermore there should at least be some species according to accepted evolutionary theory that have persisted relatively unchanged for hundreds of millions of years with huge populations these should have few if any shared pseudogenes and considerable variation in their nonfunctional dna what should nonfunctional dna look like we now raise some other questions concerning shared pseudogenes if the nonfunctional dna really has a function then edward maxs argument again disappears lets assume that this dna really has no function then we would expect it to be random that is in each individual the nonfunctional dna would be a random sequence of base pairs and for two different individuals we would not expect their nonfunctional dna to agree any more than would be expected on the basis of chance so two unrelated human beings should have about 25 percent agreement in their base pairs in the nonfunctional dna it would not matter if humans originated 10 million years ago because they would have inherited nonfunctional dna from ancestors who would have inherited it from still more distant ancestors in the billions of years of evolution random mutation should have removed all trace of order in the nonfunctional dna there certainly should not be any long recognizable patterns in it i would be interested to know if this is so if the nonfunctional dna is virtually identical in all individuals this means that either this dna has a function or that the origin of man is very recent and all humans started out with the same nonfunctional dna edward max tells me that human dna sequences differ between individuals by about one in every 200 base pairs which seems to imply that even the nonfunctional dna is virtually identical in all humans we now give justification for the statement that the nonfunctional dna should be randomized by mutations since this is not obvious for the sake of illustration suppose that there is one point mutation per base pair for every 200 million years this figure is obtained from the following quotation from introduction to evolutionary biology from the talkorigins archive li and graur in their molecular evolution text give the rates of evolution for silent vs replacement rates the rates were estimated from sequence comparisons of 30 genes from humans and rodents which diverged about 80 million years ago silent sites evolved at an average rate of 461 nucleotide substitution per 10 9 years replacement sites evolved much slower at an average rate of 085 nucleotide substitutions per 10 9 years nonfunctional dna behaves much like silent sites with respect to mutations a rate of 461 substitutions per billion years means about one per 200 million years suppose we consider half this many years so about half of the base pairs will have mutated during this time this would be at most 100 million generations probably lets also suppose that the population is large enough significantly larger than 25 million so that probably none of these mutations will have spread very far relative to the whole population lets assume that at the beginning all the nonfunctional dna in the population is identical we compare two random individuals after 100 million years each will have about half of the nonfunctional dna mutated in this time period considering only point mutations actually somewhat less thus onefourth of the base pairs will be mutated in neither individual onefourth in both individuals and onehalf in one but not the other the first onefourth of base pairs will agree between the two the next onefourth will probably disagree about half of the time if each mutation spreads to only half the population on the average the other half will disagree so we get about 916 disagreement in the nonfunctional dna as time passes this figure will get larger and approach 34 since their initial dna will differ as well according to population genetics if a mutation does spread to the whole population it takes on the average about 4n generations to do so where the population size is n however due to the existence of partially isolated subpopulations in reality this should take much longer than 4n generations in order to get a significant amount of disagreement we argued above that the population must be significantly larger than 25 million since point mutations that do spread to the whole population will probably then take significantly longer than 100 million generations to do it however in fact a population significantly under 25 million should still suffice for this argument this is a reasonable population size for generation times of say 10 per year the population would have to be 10 times larger now suppose enough time passes for 110 of the dna to be subject to a point mutation this would be 20 million years or about 20 million generations then we would expect to get about 210 disagreement in nonfunctional dna even if the population started off with identical dna for this the population would have to be somewhat larger than 5 million in fact a much smaller population size would probably suffice this is still a much larger disagreement than is observed for humans since the generation time would probably be at least 10 years humans would only need a population of about a million or more to reach this much disagreement in 20 million years this seems to be an evolutionary puzzle because the observed difference between humans seems to be about 1 in 200 we could assume that population bottlenecks occurred during which the genetic material became uniform but if this happened the functional dna would also become uniform in the population except for beneficial traits that were heterozygous it is my impression that such homogeniety is not observed as a rule today it is difficult to recover genetic variety in the functional dna since it is tremendously expensive evolutionarily to construct alleles coding for proteins with new shapes this is evidence that such extended bottlenecks did not occur the same computations apply to silent positions in the coding part of the dna a silent position is a base pair that can be changed without changing the amino acid coded by the gene since such positions have little or no effect on the organism they behave much like nonfunctional dna suppose a gene has k silent positions and suppose the population is large enough so that no mutation is likely to spread to the whole population in 100 million years then in 100 million years we should expect about half of these positions to have mutated assuming the population is large enough each silent position will have about half of its dna without a mutation and half of the dna with a mutation after 100 million years i estimate that at least 16 of the base pairs in a typical gene would be silent positions and maybe as many as 13 thus we should expect at least a 112 disagreement in the base pairs between alleles of two random individuals in the population after 100 million years not even counting mutations that change an amino acid a smaller average disagreement would indicate a recent origin of life or a severe extended population bottleneck but the latter is unlikely to have occurred in all species in the traditional evolutionary scenario the observed value of one difference in 200 base pairs among humans is significantly under the 112 value the actual amount of difference between humans is less than one in 200 base pairs as the following quotation showstwo genomes chosen from the human population are about 998 percent identical affirming our common heritage as a species but the 02 percent variation translates into some six million sequence differences this quotation is taken from mapping heredity using probabilistic models and algorithms to map genes and genomes part i by eric s lander notices of the ams july 1995 in fact the average difference appears to be less than this can dna typing uniquely identify the source of a sample because any two human genomes differ at about 3 million sites no two persons barring identical twins have the same dna sequence unique identification with dna typing is therefore possible provided that enough sites of variation are examined this is taken from chapter 3 dna typing statistical basis for interpretation however we will use the six million figure to be conservative in order to get this amount of difference we only need one mutation per thousand base pairs since the origin of the human race using the above rate of mutation and recalling that most of the dna is thought to be nonfunctional it should only require about 200000 years for this amount of difference to arise this gives an age estimate of 200000 years for the human race however the figure really must be significantly smaller than this because there was undoubtedly some variation at the start and because the actual rate of mutation is arguably faster than one per 200 million years in addition some mutations alter many base pairs at the same time we now estimate how large the human population must be in order for this 200000 year estimate to be valid a population geneticist sent me the following information about the propogation of neutral mutations there is a roughly 1n chance of a new neutral mutation being fixed there is a 2n chance of it getting half way and it will do so in roughly half the time 4n2 half of these will get the whole way and they will take another 4n2 generations better than that requires a more detailed calculation now in 200000 years there would be less than 20000 generations a neutral mutation will spread to the whole population in an average of 20000 generations if the population size n is about 5000 but if the population size is about 10000 or larger neutral mutations will on the average spread to only half of the population which is sufficient for our age estimage to be valid the value 10000 for the human population is quite small and it is reasonable to assume that the human population was generally much larger than this implying that our young age estimate is correct we suspect that a similar young age estimate is valid for other species as well which i find difficult to reconcile with the accepted view of earths history for example dogs and wolves also seem to have about the same or less genetic diversity as compared to humans there is another mechanism that can reduce this genetic variation and this is the following when a beneficial mutation spreads to the whole population it will tend to carry along nearby base pairs thereby reducing genetic diversity in its neighborhood the size of the neighborhood is related to how fast it spreads if it spreads to the whole population in about 1000 generations then the size of this neighborhood is about 100000 base pairs since crossovers generally occur once in 100 million base pairs and there would be a thousandfold multiplication of them in this time thus 30000 such mutations could essentially eliminate all the genetic diversity in the dna if they were evenly spaced throughout the dna and spread rapidly enough they would have to spread in a total of about 400000 years to produce the observed low genetic diversity however the fact that humans still have considerable genetic diversity in blood types for example suggests that this mechanism has not been operating also having 30000 such mutations each with a fitness advantage of about 01 seems to be a large increase in fitness for a short in evolutionary terms time interval in fact 001 seems to be a more typical value for the selective advantage according to simpson quoted in spetner not by chance page 102 which would require 300000 such beneficial mutations fixing in 400000 years a rather high rate of evolution in reality there would probably have to be many more than this to guarantee that the whole genome would be covered due to their probable irregular distribution if we assume one mutation fixing per year and 10 percent functional dna this leads to a rate of mutation of about one substitution per base pair per 300 million years if we assume one percent functional dna this leads to a mutation rate of about one substitution per base pair per 30 million years both are much faster than assumed by evolutionists for functional genes especially the latter rate this makes such rates of evolution implausible and strengthens the case that the human race and probably all other species are young furthermore many species persist for long apparent time periods in the fossil record with little change these species do not appear to be evolving much so we cannot use this mechanism of beneficial mutation spread to explain a low genetic diversity in them only a rapidly evolving species can reduce its genetic diversity in this way if we try to escape from the dilemma by assuming that the rate of mutation is very small explaining the small diversity then the assumed evolution of species could not have occurred within the assumed time spans the only plausible mechanism that can account for the data is that the human race experienced a severe population bottleneck recently which reduced the genetic diversity or else was recently created essentially uniform i suspect that the same reasoning applies to all other species too which seems to be a puzzle if one is not a creationist in fact this conclusion appears to flatly contradict the fossil record which shows some species persisting with large populations for many millions of years this is another problem for the standard theory and suggests that the fossil record was laid down recently and quickly we also note that there is a tremendous difference between the kind of genetic diversity one would expect due to recent mutations and that which is observed if the existing genetic diversity among humans arose from recent mutations then we should expect about 998 of 1000 humans to agree in a given base pair and only about 2 in 1000 to differ this should be true for all base pairs the real situation is much different for many alleles there are several or many for some species alleles that are quite common in the population this is true for blood type hair color eye color and so on this seems to be proof positive that the human species did not reduce its genetic diversity by rapid evolution nor did it generate it by recent mutations all of these alleles would have had to originate recently and had a high selective advantage to become common in the population yet none had a high enough selective advantage to eliminate the others it must be the case then that the human race is young or else there would be more diversity and that the observed genetic diversity existed from the beginning in fact a very reasonable alternative hypothesis is that beneficial mutations are very rare and have only an insignificant effect on evolution in most cases even over large time periods the observed changes are then almost all due to changes in frequencies of existing genetic material of course this implies creationism now we discuss the fate of a mutation in the nonfunctional region of dna this part of the dna is subject to recombinations crossovers which occur about once per 10 8 base pairs per meiosis this means about 30 per generation for humans these will tend to chop the genetic material up into pieces about 10 8 base pairs long with each generation the number of pieces per chromosome will increase linearly if we have one crossover per chromosome per generation then after one generation there will be two pieces after two generations there will be three pieces and so on after a million generations the pieces will be 10 8  10 6 or 10 2 base pairs long on the average each piece inherited by a different path if man and ape separated 10 million years ago then a million generations is a reasonable estimate so we should not expect to see any piece of a pseudogene that has more than about 100 base pairs in it recall also that each pseudogene has only a small chance of fixing in the population so that we should only see at most one piece of the pseudogene altogether the lgglo pseudogene has 3364 base pairs according to edward max thus if it arose all at once in some individual unlikely we would not expect to find more than about 130 of it in any human this would not agree with the appearance of the whole pseudogene in one individual which i believe was reported it is more realistic to assume that this was initially a functional gene in all humans which would be consistent with its common appearance however for insertions of new neutral material this would not be so the farther back one goes the smaller the pieces should be for a 20 million generations the pieces of a pseudogene would be at most a few base pairs long on the average this would correspond to possibly 50 million years not a long period of time by evolutionary standards we would never expect to find any common sequence having a hundred thousand base pairs even for fairly recent events unless such sequences were present in all individuals at some time in the remote past this only pushes the problem back further in time unless this material was beneficial to the organism at some time then it must have become beneficial to inactivate this genetic material for some reason since neutral mutations will not spread as a rule otherwise it must be that life originated recently or that there is a function for the junk dna it is also possible that a small population could lead to uniformity of the dna if any evolutionist has answers to these points i would most appreciate hearing from him or her for example one individual writes that single stretches of nonfunctional dna will likely spread to the whole population eventually and in this way make all the nonfunctional dna nearly identical he feels that crossovers will not have much of an effect because the two chromosomes that are crossed over are already almost identical id be interested to learn if others agree with this here are some initial comments on this reply it is true that according to population genetics nonfunctional traits and nonfunctional dna will eventually spread to the whole population the expected time for this is 4n generations when it happens where n is the population size but in reality it should take much longer and may even be impossible because one has subpopulations that tend to interbreed and are to some extent isolated from one another by geographic and social factors and while this spread is taking place the dna is subject to being broken up by crossing over recombinations the respondent notes that it is estimated that all humans have a common paternal ancestor of about 40000 years this would be about 4000 generations at most this would correspond to a population size of about 1000 but as i said in reality this is probably not possible also even if there were a population this small due to the superior fitness of humans it would quickly increase making such a spread of the y chromosome unlikely however it is conceivable that a favorable mutation to the y chromosome could rapidly spread to a larger population one could then call the bearer of this mutation the first true human male the common female ancestor is estimated at 200000 years which would correspond to 20000 generations at most and a population size of at most about 5000 but probably much less as argued above it is difficult to see how a favorable mutation could lead to a more rapid spread of common female ancestry but it is possible that a mutation to the mitochondrial dna could accomplish this another plausible explanation is that at one time the only humans on earth were a man and a woman and their children in the not too distant past of course we note that for evolution to proceed one needs a large population size in order to have enough beneficial mutations to spread to the whole population so one must have had populations in the millions or billions most of the time implying a much slower rate of spread of neutral traits to the whole population and much more time for mutations and recombinations to enter in while this was happening we also note that some apparently nonfunctional traits such as being able to curl ones tongue and maybe blood type and eye color still show much variability within the human population despite the tendency of genetic variability to reduce according to population genetics so why should the nonfunctional dna be any different why should we not see similar variability in the nonfunctional dna the respondent points out that there is actually more variability in the nonfunctional dna than in the functional dna though still not much and if these traits such as eye color are not neutral the most beneficial ones should have won out even faster in addition it is a very strong statement to assert that all the dna of all humans is very similar in the nonfunctional portion by statistical arguments we would expect some of the dna to spread more slowly and some not to spread to all the population to have all of the nonfunctional dna in the whole population essentially identical is really extreme and a statistical impossibility unless there was a dramatic population bottleneck as mentioned above since humans are probably not unique in this one would have to assume similar bottlenecks for other species too of course this is not a problem for the creationist viewpoint the other possibility is that this nonfunctional dna really has a function back to home page
