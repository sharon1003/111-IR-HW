well bayer’s essure contraceptive implant now with a warning by roni caryn rabin nov 21 2016111kim myers 53 in the stable at her home in wesson miss even after her two essure implants were surgically removed her sharp pains didn’t subside until she had a hysterectomy edmund d fountain for the new york times kim myers used to compete in rodeostyle barrel horse races but after being sterilized with an implantable device called essure the pain was so intense that she had to stop the device’s small metal and polyester coils had pierced her fallopian tubes her doctor found so the two implants were removed but the sharp laborlike pains didn’t really subside until three years later when ms myers had a hysterectomy then her surgeon discovered the cause a piece of metal coil was still embedded in her uterus“doctors kept saying there was nothing wrong with me” said ms myers 53 of wesson miss “i knew with every fiber of my being there was still something there”ms myers was among a parade of women who testified before the food and drug administration 14 months ago saying they’d been injured by essure and urging officials to pull the device from the market recent comments passion for peaches november 27 2016how little are women valued in this society when a device that purposely causes pervasive and tissuekilling injury to the fallopian tubes anne november 27 2016so let me get this straight as its a little confounding to me women are undergoing a dangerous medical procedure to prevent pregnancy caffeinated yogini november 27 2016this is interesting because ive had an essure for the last 6 plus years with zero problems i was recently in for an annual exam where my see all comments write a comment essure comprises two small coils made of a nickel alloy and a polyesterlike fiber placed in the fallopian tubes through the vagina the coils are designed to provoke an inflammatory response that causes scar tissue to form and block the tubes a process that can take three months f d a officials declined to withdraw the device saying that essure was safe and effective for many women although some experienced “very serious and sometimes debilitating problems” but last week the agency ordered that a socalled black box warning be placed on the device’s packaging saying it could cause the kinds of injuries ms myers sustained the implant may puncture the fallopian tubes and uterus and travel into the abdomen and pelvic cavity the warning notes causing persistent pain and requiring surgical removal the essure birth control implant bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc officials at bayer which makes and sells essure say poor surgical skills are to blame for complications like ms myers’s and insist there is no proof the device causes other reported side effects like chronic pain and autoimmune disorders“these are so common to women” said dr edio zampaglione bayer’s vice president for united states medical affairs the f d a also took the unorthodox step of guiding bayer in the development of a new checklist of risks for doctors to review with patients before implanting the device the threepage checklist is broken into five sections each followed by a spot for the patient’s initials and is to be signed by both doctor and patient the checklist is not mandatory and critics say it does not mention many common side effects linked to essure like heavy painful menstrual bleeding some doctors complain that the checklist is intrusive and burdensome may dissuade physicians from using the implants and is based on anecdotes rather than scientific clinical trial data some providers including planned parenthood have said they will inform patients of the risks and benefits but not ask them to sign the document“there’s no question there are complications but there are risks and benefits to everything we do in medicine and we don’t have good data to establish the magnitude of the problem” said dr christopher m zahn the vice president of practice for the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists“decisions like these should be made based on data that’s appropriately vetted not a series of anecdotal reports” dr zahn said

zampaglione of bayer noted that some studies had shown that other methods of permanent sterilization not just essure have caused serious longterm adverse events as well the f d a approved the implant in 2002 after a fasttrack review process that prioritized the device because it was the first sterilization procedure for women that could be done in a doctor’s office without an incision and without general anesthesia it offered an option to tubal ligation commonly known as having one’s “tubes tied”pain and other serious side effects emerged in the clinical trials of essure the device could not always be implanted and failed to block the tubes in a significant percentage of patients according to the new checklist nearly one in 10 women who try essure cannot rely on it to prevent pregnancy the f d a approved essure after trials lasting a year or two even though the implant was meant to last for life by the end of last year the agency had received nearly 10000 reports of injuries and pregnancies related to the device as well as reports of a very small number of fatalities many doctors who insert the implant do not know how to remove it the new warnings say nor is the best method of removal entirely clear the true complication rate also remains uncertain bayer would not provide united states sales numbers which also would not reflect the actual number of women who have received implants because no one knows how many of the devices have been implanted in the united states the original clinical trials did not include control groups for comparison so it has never been clear whether complications like back pain or heavy bleeding are higher in essure users compared with women sterilized surgically or who relied on other birth control methods by contrast drug trials are required to have a comparison group of participants who are given a placebo earlier this year bayer agreed to begin tracking 1400 women who have the device implanted over the next five or six years the study is supposed to report final results in 2023 and its first report is due in march 2017 this study has a comparison group of sorts it will also follow 1400 women who choose a more traditional form of sterilization using laparoscopic surgery111comments the women will be followed for three years after the sterilization procedures to see how many in each group develop complications like chronic pelvic pain heavy bleeding and autoimmune disorders as well as how often each intervention fails leading to pregnancy researchers will also track how many women with essure develop such severe complications that they have to undergo surgery to remove the implants correction december 1 2016 an article on nov 22 about essure a sterilization implant device from bayer referred incorrectly to a study the company is running to track 1400 women implanted with the device the company has submitted the study plan to the food and drug administration and the first sixmonth report is due in march 2017 it is not the case that it is “already behind schedule”a version of this article appears in print on november 22 2016 on page d6 of the new york edition with the headline
