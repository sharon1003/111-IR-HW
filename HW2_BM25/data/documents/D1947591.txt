guest over a year ago i would like to know what is the difference between vicodin and lortab thanks in advanceguest over a year ago i think there is no difference both are hydrocodone it is a mix of synthetic codeine and acetaminophen vicodin or lortab these are most abused prescription drugs in usa they are both painkiller and i think it is just difference in name brand vicodin percocet lortab or lorcet reply guest over a year ago that is not true vicodin and lortab both contain acetaminophen tylenol and hydrocodone they simply have different strengths of each however they are both schedule iii drugs which are not the most addictive nor regulated percocet however is a blend of oxycodone and acetaminophen percocet is a schedule ii drug because it is one of the most addictive and regulated prescription pain medications because of the oxycodone hope this helped  janessa cph t certified pharmacy technicianreply guest over a year agowhat about stomach bleeding taking 10500 mg lortab for 5 days one pill a day at night for painbut on saturday like the 4th day i had a couple of drinksand today tuesday i bled moving bowelsand it wasnt hemorroids cuz when i wipe no blood on paper after 2nd wipe replyjakum34825 over a year agofirst off lortab is a highly regulated drug because it falls into the narcotics categorie and is more abused in the u s because percocet and other stronger pain meds arent prescribed as often thus harder to get unless you have a quack doctor reply guest over a year agofirst off jakum i get what you are saying about the metabolism rate of the methadone etc vs hydrocodone and do agree that is why it is less addictive but ive had to be seen my many many specialtist in pain  for treatment etc and for you to say the only way to get those certain prescriptions are from quack doctors has to be the rudest degrading to ones self  self explainitory personality of ones self that could be made you make it sound as if you are not happy because you cant find a quack doctor for your drugs for pain if you even have any when the person was asking a simple question but there is no need to refer to a doctor that actually helps by prescribing and monitoring the use of these much stronger drugs methadone for one is only a few steps down from morphine itselfand as far as getting addicted to them this is for the person with the original question you will get dependant on them theres a diff between addicted and dependant addicted is when you take then when you no longer need them in anyway bependancy is when you need it to make your way of life tolerable and wehre you are in more control  if you find the right doctor heshe will explain this to you and help you thru thishere is a sight i really really think you should try again to the person with the question that needs help not jakum tru this websight where real doctors pas  and real nurses help you and you post to not some crack pot saying quack doctors bla blareply guest over a year ago lortab is hydrocodone hydrochloride vicodin is hydrocodone bitartrate im not sure exactly what that difference means but im sure it involves something to do with the formula and how its broken down in your body both typically contain either 5 75 or 10 mg of hydrocodone along with 500mg of tylenol i think that the formulations of hydrocodone with 650mg of tylenol are things like lorcet while hydrocodone with 325mg of tylenol is norco there are formulas of hydrocodone which contain ibuprofen instead of tylenol but im not sure what those are called replyjohnny879677818 over a year agoi have been taking vicodin for a year and ahalf is that bad i mean like 7 a day replyaskmeanything77854 over a year ago guest wrotewhat about stomach bleeding taking 10500 mg lortab for 5 days one pill a day at night for painbut on saturday like the 4th day i had a couple of drinksand today tuesday i bled moving bowelsand it wasnt hemorroids cuz when i wipe no blood on paper after 2nd wipeyou do know that you are taking an acetaminophen correct the combination of this type of drug with alcohol results in stomach bleeding the reason is the drug taken almost weakens the mucus lining in the stomach and is thus absorbed greater however this leaves that organ very susceptible to becoming sore when you drink alcohol which is actually a toxin to your body it tries to absorb and then filter this out of your system however your stomach lining is now weakened from the acetaminophen so now when your body absorbs the alcohol instead of a mucus lining preventing over absorption or any sort of thing like that it was been fully absorbed and the harsh chemical makeup of alcohol causes your stomach to bleed 3 drinks will cause it to bleed but with normal healing without a doctor your fine however if you drink more than that and become completely hammered or bleed more continuously see a doctor reply guest over a year ago hydrocodone and ibuprofen are called vicuprofen spelling im not sure of reply guest over a year agoi dont know what the differences are but there are some although drs and pharmacy will tell you there isnt i can take lorcet and norco just finelortab and vicodin make me itch like crazy though i can still take them just not as comfortablythe amount of tylenol in them can affect your kidneys if taken long term reply guest over a year agoboth are the same as in the way they affect you you may feel as if one helps more than the other but it is a physiological thing i know because i have taken both lortab and vicodin and i personally can not tell any difference both will help most kinds of pain if taken right if you take it jus to get high then in the long run you are only building a tolerance an when you really need one a normal dosage will not help reply guest over

vicoprofen 75 of hydcodone and 400 of ibprofen reply guest over a year ago vicuprophen is great for relieving moderate to even some severe pain involving a possible muscle spasm  which causes pain vicoprophen is commonly also doses at 5mg 75 and 10mg of hydrocodonehydrochloride and finally yes youre right about the diff between vicodin and hydrocodoneapap apap means tylenol or equivalent or lortab although it seems that usually vicodin is precribed in only the 5mg500apap doses while lortab is in 5 75 and 10mg500apap the nice thing about one ofthe oxycodoneapap combos is the fact one has just 325mg of tylenol and thats very helpful bc it wil lead to far less potential overdose on tylenol which btw is the 2nd leading cause of er visits guest wrote lortab is hydrocodone hydrochloride

year doctors in my area give it out more that vicsand tabs since those are easier abused and easily sold on the street here than vicoprofen and it kicks butt for pain management also less addictive than oxycodone reply
