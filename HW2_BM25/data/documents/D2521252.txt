by trevor mc arthur • 4 years ago gender and violence through a hegemonic masculinity lens a reflection from south africa i have often asked myself “why do boysmen fight and why are they so violent when compared to women”  “why do boysmen have to rape women” and “how does society reinforce and maintain notions of boymanhood” critical men’s studies fundamentally argues that there is no essence of masculinity and femininity which makes men and women behave in very different ways rather it assumes that masculinities and femininities are constructed in relation to each other even when there are no gendered ‘others’ around this position further challenges the tendency in patriarchal cultures that take males for granted as universal subjects and construct woman as the gendered others instead it focus on men as gendered beings and explore gendered power dynamics addressing masculinities and femininities as relational opposites enacted and performed through every forms of interaction imbued with power masculinities are complex and multifaceted in attempting to understand gender – and in particular masculinities – and how it relates to violence and crime i have come across a variety of theories and found raewyn connell’s notion of various forms of masculinities – particularly ‘hegemonic masculiniies’ most useful for this purpose raewyn connell work on hegemonic masculinities and how it plays out in society albeit western centric argues that masculinities are socialised dynamic ie it changes over time and influenced by social groups and friendship circles  masculinity and masculinities are shaped by various social institutions such as the family religion communities education institutions ie schools and universities the work place hegemonic masculinity is believed to be the emphasis on dominance leadershipcontrol rooted in power and authority hegemonic masculinity brings to the fore the flaunting of sexual prowess homophobia misogyny and gender policing compulsory heterosexuality antiauthoritarian and testing out behaviour emphasising physical strength ie muscles and assertiveness it is argued that hegemonic masculinities is what is evident and promoted in society contending that ‘softer’ masculinities marginalised and condemned – even leading to social exclusion at the heart of this argument is the fact that in a typical patriarchal society men do not only exercise power control and dominance ‘over’ woman but weaker men can also be subjected to this form of subordination control andor authority status may be linked to age size class and affiliation with social clubsgangs etc hegemonic males may victimise and stigmatise or and even exclude those males perceived to be weak er perceived weakness may include ones inability to have and control a girlfriendpartner to smoke cigarettes and consume alcohol or in other contexts not engaging in antisocial and deviant behaviour such as fighting and swearing when looking at gender based violence through this lens it becomes evident that men – in typical patriarchal societies – are of the view that they own women and that sexual intimacy with their partners are owed to them in many instances this leads to domestic violence and even rape this ‘authority over’ could also manifest itself through mentomen interaction in the form of subordinating other men who are perceived weaker usually leading to violence and at times murder interestingly violence has become synonymous with men and boys it is obviously not without reason that this has become the order the of day so much so that female offenders and generally woman who commit crime were believed to be until recently a strange phenomenon this could most possibly be due to how patriarchal societies have constructed woman – as pure and clean the mother of our mens children and ‘godfearing’ i would go as far as to suggest that woman’s sexuality has been politicised to the extant that if woman were known to behave other than what i have just described such would threatened their good reputation and possibly fertility men on the other hand plays by a different set of rules it is constructed as being manly to consume alcohol go to bars to curse and to fight if the need arose in fact men were praised when they fought and if they won would received a standing ovation – or a drink ‘on the house’ this behaviour however should not be viewed in isolation men are groomed from when they are children to ‘fight back‘ when they are bullied and when they face opposition of concern to me is when this behaviour becomes destructive and when it becomes a pandemic in many countries the alpha male’s the hegemonic masculinity – desire to dominate and fight has led to war following famine and societies in political crisis south africa for example is regarded as one of the world most violent countries im of the opinion that our history of colonisation and apartheid which lasted for more than 400 years permeates our new dispensation even though the first democratically elected president of the black majority party the african national congress anc nelson mandela preached reconciliation and forgiveness after spending a combined 27 years in prison south african continues to be unsafe particularly in poorer urban such as townships and rural communities of particular concern has been the nature of violent and interpersonal crimes which includes homicide and rape woman and children remain at high risk of becoming victims of either sexual violence andor abuse a south police service saps report leased in september 2011 suggested that in south africa on average 7 woman were murdered a day between march 2010 and march 2011 further suggesting that at least half of those reported could be have perpetrated by intimate partners the rates of gender based violence gbv and the general abuse and sexual harassment of woman in the domestic space by their partners are particularly alarming it is widely established that rape is mostly perpetrated by people known to the victims in south africa for example between 2008 and 2011 there has been a steady increase of reported rape cases from just over 54 000 to just over 56 000 rape cases reported respectively why then i ask is rape and violent crime in general this high well many have attempted to answer this question and no simple answer exist i would propose that we look at how men are constructed and how patriarchal society reinforces violent forms of masculinities only then i believe would we be able to understand why men abuse rape and subordinate others both men and women what we should also consider is that men do not only subordinate woman – as popular feminism has it – but they also subordinate other men constructed as lesser men weaker through misogynic and homophobic tendencies this debate is in no way concluded this post merely opens the discussion disclaimer this post was written by a feministing community user
