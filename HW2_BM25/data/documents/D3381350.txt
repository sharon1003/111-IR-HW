amcap 921 build 1563pros will capture most connected video devices cons would have gotten 5 stars if it could do time lapse still captures and capture more than one device at a time reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value tight efficient windowsfriendly utilityignatiusreilly october 20 2012  version amcap 921 build 1563pros interface closely adheres to ibmmicrosoft windows conventions so that it is extremely intuitive for windows users  windows can be sized and dragged exactly as expected  quick setup quick program start quick video acquisition  can run multiple program instances to monitor multiple video streams  videos can easily be run full screen with no windows borders cons imo there is absolutely nothing wrong with this software although i recognize that many people are dissatisfied because they assume that it is something more than it is it might be regarded as more of a utility than a fullfeatured program summary i have only run amcap on windows 7 where it has performed flawlessly i have had great difficulties with more elaborate programs i considered just using the software from my hardware manufacturer a leading vendor of webcams mice keyboards and such i was amazed that their software allows only a smallish window in which to view their 1080p webcam image and with the vendor software there is no way to view the output of more than one webcam at a time amcap beautifully overcame both these limitations but it is not the solution for advanced features such as launching an unattended recording session based on movement within the image yes i feel that the rocksolid basic features of amcap should be standard from the hardware vendor and the base upon which more sophisticated programs are built unfortunately amcap is the only package i have found that even does these basic things really well reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value worked butmdeland january 06 2012  version amcap 920

value used for webcam full screen application onlyaoaby august 24 2011  version amcap 920 build 1322pros worked perfectly for its full screen application cons none for this application summary5 stars reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value fastest way to test a webcam otherwise useless bubbagump april 01 2011  version amcap 920 build 1322pros a tiny free program that requires no installation that can quickly confirm whether or not your webcam is functional cons no other programs userequire this software and other than the mediocre builtin capture functions it basically has no other use maximum supported resolution appears to be 640x480 regardless of your cameras capabilities summary unless you purchased a 5 webcam from china off e bay that came with no software or found an old one where the software is no longer available you probably wont have much use for this program after the initial installation to test to see if your camera is working but since it doesnt record until you tell it to it can be handy if you get creative i sometimes use it to check to see what my pets are doing behind my back wo turning around reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value didnt work couldnt fully delete petepal55february 27 2011  version amcap 920 build 1322pros never found any cons error on second run had to reload it in order to delete its shortcuts and folder it locked up windows explorer if you didnt delete them before removing the program summary maybe itll work on your machine but i wont even think about it again i hate sloppy programming reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value this product is pretty greatjotts june 26 2007  version amcap 911 build 1094pros i have 8 something version which came with my webcam on the cd but i have checked this out too it has 18 filters great options can write up to 1200x somethingnot sure at least for my webcam and this version allows to actually configure still image options this comes for a good price about the price of an average webcam and its features make it a good deal overall this is more customizable and more configurable and its worth an upgrade from versions 8 includes 8 and down since this fixes loads of bugs and for a good price if this came on the drivers cd for your webcam then check the version and update if its under 8 includes 8 because its worth it trust me5 stars product must try reply to this review was this review helpful 101101results 1â€“7 of 71add your review login or create an account
