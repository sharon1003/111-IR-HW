250 years and since naming a number of them have gone extinct the nominate subspecies is canis lupus lupus canis lupus is assessed as least concern by the iucn as its relatively widespread range and stable population trend mean that the species at global level does not meet or nearly meet any of the criteria for the threatened categories however some local populations are classified as endangered

with the latin classification translating into the english words dog wolf a subspecies is the taxonomic rank below species 3 when geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable phenotypic differences biologists may identify these as separate subspecies a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species 4 the thirtyeight subspecies of canis lupus are listed in mammal species of the world third edition that was published in 2005 5 6 and in the catalogue of life 7 the nominate subspecies is the eurasian wolf  canis lupus lupus  6 also known as the common wolf 8 the subspecies includes the domestic dog dingo eastern wolf and red wolf 5 however the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged for eurasia in 1995 mammalogist robert nowak recognized five subspecies based on skull morphology these being c l lupus c l albus c l pallipes c l cubanensis and c l communis 9 in 2003 nowak also recognized the

raymond hall proposed that there had been 24 subspecies of lupus in north america 15 in 1970 l david mech proposed that there was probably far too many sub specific designationsin use as most did not exhibit enough points of differentiation to be classified as a separate subspecies 16 the 24 subspecies were accepted by many authorities in 1981 and these were based on morphological or geographical differences or a unique history 17 in 1995 the american mammologist robert m nowak analyzed data on the skull morphology of wolf specimens from around the world for north america he proposed that there were only five subspecies of gray wolf these include a large toothed arctic wolf named c l arctos a large wolf from alaska and western canada named c l occidentalis a small wolf from southeast canada named c l lycaon a small wolf from the southwest named c l baileyi and a moderatesized wolf that was originally found from texas to hudson bay and from oregon to new foundland named c l nubilus

reginald innes pocock who synonymised c l italicus with c l lupus 101 in 2002 the noted paleontologist r m nowak reaffirmed the morphological distinctiveness of the italian wolf and recommended the recognition of canis lupus italicus 101 a number of dna studies have found the italian wolf to be genetically distinct 102 103 in 2004 the genetic distinction of the italian wolf subspecies was supported by analysis which consistently assigned all the wolf genotypes of a sample in italy to a single group this population also showed a unique mitochondrial dna controlregion haplotype the absence of private alleles and lower heterozygosity at microsatellite loci as compared to other wolf populations 104 in 2010 a genetic analysis indicated that a single wolf haplotype w22 unique to the apennine peninsula and one of the two haplotypes w24 w25 unique to the iberian peninsula belonged to the same haplogroup as the prehistoric wolves of europe another haplotype w10 was found to be common to the iberian peninsula and the balkans these three populations with geographic isolation exhibited a near lack of gene flow and spatially correspond to three glacial refugia 105the taxonomic

wolf  editthe eastern wolf has two proposals over its origin one is that the eastern wolf is a distinct species  c lycaon that evolved in north america as opposed to the gray wolf that evolved in the old world and is related to the red wolf the other is that it is derived from admixture between gray wolves which inhabited the great lakes area and coyotes forming a hybrid that was classified as a

editthe red wolf is an enigmatic taxon of which there are two proposals over its origin one is that the red wolf was a distinct species  c rufus that has undergone humaninfluenced admixture with
