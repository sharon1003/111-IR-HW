pitchby sheldon pearce contributing writer rap november 7 2017brockhampton the selfproclaimed boy band and creative collective formed in texas is becoming one of the more interesting hiphop acts to watch the 14member crew comprised of rappers singers producers songwriters and visual artists originating everywhere from ireland and grenada to jacksonville and connecticut is forging its own space on the fringes by putting a weirdo rap stamp on pop iconography starting with de facto leader kevin abstract they’ve released quite a bit of music both as a group and independently building a healthy buzz over the last several years in 2017 brockhampton are more visible than ever releasing two installments of their saturation mixtape series appearing in the viceland docuseries “ american boyband ” and growing a young devout following in recent months they received a cosign from their diy progenitor tyler the creator and performed at his camp flog gnaw carnival it’s easy but also lazy to draw the very basic parallels between brockhampton and odd future for starters the best rapper in brockhampton isn’t even as skilled as hodgy and the groups as a whole have entirely different motives the brockhampton approach is more business by committee they cover one another’s weaknesses and build upon individual strengths through teamwork as a collective brockhampton seem to be on the cusp of perfecting their formula and it’s exciting to watch them tinker with the process but with so much material scattered across so many members it can be difficult to find the right entry point into the brockhampton catalog with saturation iii supposedly around the corner here are 10 highlights across their individual and collective releases that showcase what brockhampton’s all about brockhampton “cotton hollow”producers misc friend jabari manwa  dom mc lennon cotton hollowbrockhampton413allamerican trash brockhampton’s first project as a collective set the precedent for what the group could be a freeform project seeking an indefinable sound “cotton hollow” is emblematic of this concept tinkering with unorthodox verse formats and oddball beats with shiny attachments the song’s understated production changes several times coming undone brockhampton “boys”producer jabari manwa boysbrockhampton438identity is important to the members of brockhampton they each make a point of telling their stories whether black brown or white queer or straight rapper singer producer visual artist or web designer maybe that’s why they feel so strongly about being referred to as an allamerican boy band rebranding the teen heartthrob as all of the things it historically hasn’t been on saturation ’s “boys” they dig deeper into their characterizations as member ameer vann puts it plainly “me and all my niggas southside one direction”brockhampton “home”producer bearface homebrockhampton502unsurprisingly brockhampton dislike being called a rap collective it’s a term with limiting connotations but it’s also not entirely accurate to what they do “home” a highlight from belfastbred singerproducer bearface that appears on allamerican trash is one of several brockhampton tracks that avoids rap altogether it’s soft intimate rb—a dramatic change of pace from their typically busy compositions brockhampton “star”producer jabari manwa star  brockhamptonyour browser does not currently recognize

this point they’re boys they’re in a band and most of them rap in some capacity some are even competent rappers and have proven themselves as capable soloists “star” which features the crew’s three strongest rappers  kevin abstract ameer vann and dom mc lennon shows what brockhampton is capable of when running on all cylinders each verse building on the last “i’m the only pop star with no moneycan’t drive so i’m still running” abstract raps finding his niche brockhampton “trip”producer romil hemnani tripbrockhampton322the collective’s more experimental tendencies manifest in songs like the misshapen multitoned “trip” which toys with pitching reverb and other distortions the song plays out like a series of warped flashbacks to smalltown nightmares as a group of dreamers and outsiders dare to be themselves this strong sense of self carries over into their best solo work kevin abstract “save”producer romil hemnani save kevin abstract331abstract the 20yearold rapper singer and founder of brockhampton was the first member to break through nationally when he released mtv1987 in 2014 “save” the tape’s standout told his story by establishing kid cudi as his forebear and tracing his group’s origins in corpus christi “the crib we had on brockhampton made all us feel enormous” he sings it’s a song about being young and lost a theme that has become a part of the brockhampton manifesto over time over a slowed down sample of king krule’s “the krockadile” a teenaged abstract longed to find meaning in existence “you think it’s wrong for me to dieshit i’ve been dead my whole lifei’m still searching for what’s right” his search continues to this daybearface  “no one like u” ft no romeproducers bearface  romil hemnani ciaran ruaridh mc donald aka bearface is one of brockhampton’s secret weapons within the group he is a beatmaker first but a handful of solo tracks floating around online suggest he might be the collective’s most versatile threat despite being overlooked by brockhampton’s cult following the plunging rb balladry on “no one like u” is more polished than many of the group’s most popular cuts surrounded by submerged synths mc donald’s shimmering voice rises to the surface of his mixes his longing and regret lingering in each note ameer vann “black snake moan”producer albert gordon ameer vann black snake moan download share cookie policy houston rapper ameer vann went to high school with abstract and was one of the earliest members of brockhampton what he lacks in technicality and flow he makes up for with cutting and deeply personal lyrics selfdiagnosing his depression or condemning an abusive father the growling guitarsoaked “black snake moan” is a balance of both that pairs deadeyed delivery with his most effective writing “got a father down below and a father up in heavenand i still ain’t never met him” abstract is easily the crew’s most talented member but vann is often its most gripping one joba “sad saturdays”producers joba  romil hemnani jobasad saturdays share cookie policy joba aka russell boring worked at number 6 productions in houston and his experience there led abstract vann and other local members to hold prebrockhampton recording sessions at his home studio eventually joba fell in with the crew mixing mastering and producing music for other members but he’s more than just brockhampton’s sound guru as proven by the rattling desirefilled “sad saturdays” joba’s pristine airy vocals call out for someone in the shadows but he’s chasing something real “i dare you to let me in” he tells a lover who’s no longer listening brockhampton “dirt”producers jabari manwa kiko merley joba bearface  romil hemnani dirt brockhampton446brockhampton’s collective strength is captured by the contorted keyboard jam “dirt” the group’s ultimate posse cut championing southern roots produced by just about the entire inhouse team q3 joba bearface and romil hemnani and featuring verses from abstract vann mc lennon matt champion and merlyn wood “dirt” underscores the brockhampton promise four beat fragments are stitched together some with slight modifications and others as fullon alterations each member makes the most of their time no one performance outshining the other brockhampton songs function best this way—the whole being greater that the sum of the parts collaboration compensating for individual flaws that might otherwise be glaring simply put they’re better united
