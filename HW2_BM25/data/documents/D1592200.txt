mean what does it have to do with identity by descentstate what does it have to do if anything with snps also how is the concept useful in geneticsevolution ive tried reading these up on various websites but im not satisfied with my understanding yetgenetics snp alleleshare improve this questionasked jun 17 14 at 653user6417add a comment1 answer active oldest votesup vote8down vote snplets start with the definition that has nothing to do with the rest of the question  a singlenucleotidepolymorphism snp is a kind of genetic variation that you find in population this genetic variation is defined as a variation caused by only one single nucleotide as its name indicates it for example if you have in the populations the two following variants at the same locus agccgt and agctgt then you have a snp at the position of the c and t this type of variation is very common we estimate that there are about 10 millions snps in the human genome we often use these snps as genetic markers ancestral vs derived alleles an ancestral allele or an ancestral trait depending on whether you look at the phenotype or a t the genotype is the traitallele that was carried by the common ancestor of the taxon you consider for example as you may know the taxon reptilia includes lizards snakes turtles birds mammals and some other lineages in the taxon reptilia the scales is the ancestral state still exist in lizards for example and the hairs and feathers are derived states usually the ancestral state is the one that carried by the most basal lineages identity by state ibs and identity by descent ibdif two sequences are exactly identical then we say that they are identical by state ibs such identity can occur either through convergent evolution or through common ancestry to understand the concept of identical by descent ibd it is important to understand the concept of coalescence a coalescent event is when looking backward in time an event where two sequences were actually the same sequence often ibd is defined relatively to a given threshold in time if the coalescent event occurs after this event then the two sequences are not ibd if the two sequences coalesce before this time threshold and that the two sequences are still ibs then the two sequences are ibdbridging everything together so if you look at sequences in a given group of lineages and see that they are all exactly the same then they are identical by state if you know that all these sequences come from a common ancestor and even they all coalesce to a single individual in the common ancestor then all sequences are identical by descent but some mutations may have occurred since the last common ancestor resulting in some snps then all the sequences are not ibs anymore and therefore not ibd either you can use such sequence variance in order to create a phylogeny for example hope that helpsshare improve this answeredited jun 17 14 at 1850answered jun 17 14 at 826remib495k 6 94 1662according to you identity by descent does not imply identity by state but according to wikipedia enwikipediaorgwikiidenticalbydescent its the other way round i realize wikipedia could be wrong in a lot of cases but could you read what it has to say my initial confusion arose from this article – user6417 jun 17 14 at 9201venkat youre right it sounds wiki and i dont totally agree to my understanding ibd does not imply ibs because of recombination i ignored this point in my answer above for the moment and mutations i dont mean that ibs implies ibd either ibs without ibd may occur due to convergent evolution i havent read the wiki article but indeed this citation from the wiki article dna segments that are ibd are ibs per definition sounds wrong to me id appreciate to have the opinion of some other people to confirm or invalidate my point of view – remib jun 17 14 at 10572i believe i have seen both ways of defining ibd before but i guess it makes sense to require alleles to be indentical ie ibs in order to be indentical by decent this is also the definition john wakeley uses in his coalescent theory book – paul staab jun 17 14 at 11001is it really what john wakeleys says in his book ill check this out tomorrow as soon as im back home to my library if indeed some or all authors defines ibd such that it implies ibs i will modify or remove my answer – remib jun 17 14 at 11032on page 11 it says the concept of identity by decent  posits that two or more gene copies are descented from a common ancestor without mutation that is their identity is a direct reflection of their common ancestry as opposed to the more general case of identity by state  – paul staab jun 17 14 at 1109show 1 more comment your answer sign up or log in sign up using google sign up using facebook sign up using email
