speed networking vs round tables there are a number of options when it comes to structuring a networking event but its often difficult to decide which format is right for your audience in order to determine what type of networking event is right for your organization you must ask yourself what is my objective once you determine the goals and objectives that youd like to achieve at the event you can determine what event structure works best for you weve put together a small list that compares speed networkingcom events with round table networking events or traditional networking events targeted speed networking – our proprietary matching software takes information from all participants and determines the best possible matches for the event we take the idea of a round table discussion but eliminate the people from your table who may not be relevant to your objectives round table – a round table event randomly assigns participants to tables and often times after rotating you sit at a table with people you have already met you may meet a greater number of people but it can often times become inefficient topical vs meaningful speed networking – our event is designed to engage two likeminded individuals who have a strong mutual interest in connecting with one another and allow them to dive into conversations beyond their title and company this is a big reason we include conversation starters on the schedules participants dont have to wait for an opportunity to speak about a relevant topic to them and can engage in a highly targeted conversation round tables – round tables are great for topical discussions especially if each table is led by an industry expert it allows for open discourse amongst a group of peers but networking is often times a secondary objective at these events in our findings round table discussions that do not include a moderator or specific instructions tend to be overwhelming and produce minimal results specifically with regards to networking it can be overwhelming to meet and remember a large number of people in such a short period of time unless they plan on taking notes about each person at the table this also distracts from the ability to have a freeflowing conversation introvert exclusion speed networking – oneonone conversations allow individuals who tend to be more introverted the opportunity to connect in a comfortable setting they feel at ease and can share their wealth of knowledge with their conversation partner rather than worrying about when to speak up round tables – they often times alienate individuals that are introverts as the discussions are typically dominated by a few primary individuals at the table introverts shy away from speaking in larger groups yet they have valuable information to offer and its often missed matching data speed networking – we provide matching data that allows you to see the quality of each meeting that takes place based on the customized matching parameters you also have the ability to see how many people represent each matching category and the interests levels of your participants in meeting with each of these categories you can use this information in the future to help implement sessions that are directed towards the interests of your participants round tables – matching data is not provided and it is difficult to gauge the quality of matches as participants likely will not remember each individual that they met speed networking data speed networkingcom vs traditional networking events – below is a comparison of our events to traditional networking events request a demo simplify your life and enhance your events with our customizable plugandplay program free demotestimonials dont take our word for it see what others are saying about speed networking read our testimonials ambassador program are you an independent event planner join our ambassador program to increase your income and improve your events learn more referral program love speed networking refer a friend and both get 10 off your next event learn more there is no wrong answer when it comes to networking as long as you are providing an opportunity for your audience to connect with one another some ways may produce better results but it truly depends on your goals and what youre looking to achieve
