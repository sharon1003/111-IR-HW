full answer the chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll which absorbs the suns light two other required ingredients for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide and water the combination of these three substances fuels the process of photosynthesis which produces glucose oxygen and water photosynthesis occurs primarily in the leaves of the plants which contain the highest concentration of chloroplasts tiny pores or stomata are also located on the plants leaves and absorb carbon dioxide from the surrounding air protists bacteria and bluegreen algae are other organisms that photosynthesize for nourishment additionally many organisms form symbiotic bonds with photosynthetic organisms most commonly corals sea anemones and sponges some mollusks even store chloroplasts in their bodies so that they can survive on sunlight alone for several months in 2010 the oriental hornet was the first animal discovered to use photosynthesis the wasp converts sunlight into electrical energy the efficiency of the conversion from sunlight into chemical energy is approximately 3 to 6 percent with the unconverted energy being released as heat globally it is estimated that photosynthesis captures about 130 terawatts of energy each year which is six times larger than human energy consumption learn more about botany sources biologyaboutcom enwikipediaorg enwikipediaorg
