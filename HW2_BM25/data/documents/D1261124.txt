construction a debate in the deep end industry experts weigh the wire mesh grid vs singlewire approach to suppressing stray voltage around pools tom zind  nov 23 2010when the gavel came down on the 2011 national electrical code vote in august it might as well have been 2007 for the losing side in a long and acrimonious debate over swimming pool bonding requirements three years at least two studies hours of debate and pages of correspondence later wording in the 2008 nec remained standing and unchanged what’s new though are some fresh and pointed questions specifically was the cause of electrical safety sacrificed on the altar of expediency the cold calculus of costbenefit analysis and an overarching “lessismore” approach to regulations and mandates or did the outcome merely offer proof that the nec revisions system works as intended at issue was code language in sec 68026 b 2 relating to equipotential bonding around the decks of many inground pools in 2007 during the final months of the 2008 nec revision cycle wording in the 2005 code that mandated an equipotential copper wire mesh grid to suppress stray voltage around pools built without traditional concreterebar decks was supplemented with an alternate means language specifying a new alternate method of bonding — a single no 8 solid wire installed around the perimeter of such pools — was inserted no sooner was the ink dry on the 2008 nec than critics of the reversal began mobilizing a loose affiliation of parties that had voiced concern about the adequacy of the single wire as a means of preventing shocks and how the change was made soon coalesced embarking on an ultimately fruitless threeyear battle to restore the 2005 wording their efforts hit a dead end in august however when the national fire protection association’s nfpa standards council voted to deny an appeal of an nec code making panel’s nearunanimous recommendation to retain the 2008 singlewire provision — overriding support for the 2005 wording expressed by other nfpa bodies — grid backers had lost defining risk now the critics warn pool owners remain at greater risk than ever of electric shock — and for no legitimate reason despite study findings and testimony that point to the single wire’s deficiencies grid proponents say the code making panel that took up the issue either bent to pressure from pool industry interests concerned about costs or failed to appreciate the weight of the evidence whatever the reason critics claim it passed up a chance to give pool owners a better margin of safety“this was a setback for those of us who wanted to see safer pool construction” says charles de nardo chief engineer with we energies a milwaukeebased electric utility and an expert on stray and contact voltage who lobbied the panel “there had been a code requirement for a wire mesh grid and it was removed based on my own experience i know that a grid is a safer equipotential bonding solution than a single wire”but singlewire supporters see it differently their case rested largely on realworld evidence lacking sufficient documentation of actual highvoltage electrical shock incidents traceable to improper pool bonding — and charged with recommending changes only when there’s compelling evidence an unsafe condition exits — code making panel 17 they argue made the logical decision“the panel is made up of many technical experts and they reviewed all of the information that was presented” says jennifer hatfield government affairs associate for the association of pool  spa professionals apsp a group that wanted the code’s singlewire language retained “they saw no substantive information that a grid was necessary they agreed with us that a single wire is sufficient and provides the level of protection that’s needed”studies assess options grid advocates however argue the scientific evidence was on their side their first volley came in august 2008 in the final days of the 2008 nec revision process in the form of a study conducted by georgia tech’s national electric energy testing research and applications center neetrac forest park ga commissioned by a pool bonding and grounding equipment supplier the study would become grid supporters’ star witness in a test pool made of fiberglass with a fibercrete lip surrounded by stone pavers neetrac set up two scenarios an equipotential copper bonding grid encircling the pool 3 ft out from the side bonded to a pool light pool water and pool equipment and a no 8 awg solid copper wire buried 6 ft deep and 24 in from the pool’s edge similarly bonded applying 95v between the pool ground and a current return rod watertodeck and step voltages were measured in each setup the grid was found to reduce waterdeck voltages between 70 to 93 compared to voltages measured with the ground ring the grid also reduced step voltages in a range of 57 to 97 compared to the ring in a carefully worded conclusion in the study writeup neetrac came down on the side of the grid saying the data “proves unequivocally” that a grid “can and will effectively mitigate” the voltages tested and “provide adequate protection to the swimmer and person walking on the deck” as for the ground ring neetrac hedged somewhat saying the study found it “may not provide adequate protection”their case also was bolstered by a later study done by the electric power research institute palo alto calif an independent nonprofit company performing research development and demonstration in the electricity sector the utility industryfunded group compared various pool bonding options and possible fixes for existing pools where stray voltage problems have surfaced although it was more multifaceted and nuanced than neetrac’s study epri’s research did suggest that some sort of a bonding grid configuration offered the highest margin of safety says douglas dorr epri senior project manager epri concluded that a wire mesh embedded in a concrete deck properly bonded was the best way to maintain “near equipotential” between the pool deck and pool water lacking that double or triple ground rings tied to a ground rod provide a method of reducing voltage differential but a single ground ring embedded in concrete within 30 in of the pool water it cautioned may only provide reasonable neutraltoearth voltage mitigation “where nearby distribution faults are not a concern”panel holds firm from the outset however the research failed to sway the code making panel questioning methodologies and the significance of conclusions in light of a lack of demonstrable realworld safety issues the panel consistently voted down motions to restore the grid provision in deliberations on both the 2008 and 2011 nec with a 6to3 vote in 2008 it rejected a temporary interim amendment tia request that would have restored the grid provision in the 2008 code as an emergency fix throughout 2011 code deliberations when it was again introduced the panel’s votes were nearly unanimous even after neetrac reiterated its findings stating in a letter to the panel in march 2010 that “we are not aware of any tests of a single wire or data that would prove it to be safe…the single wire was never intended to stand alone without ground rods attached as the 2008 version allows” and in spite of an nfpa membership general session and nfpa electrical section vote in favor of restoring the grid language at nfpa’s annual conference in june the panel stood firm following nec revisions protocol that gives deference to code making panels’ deliberations and votes nfpa’s standards council overturned the nfpa floor vote sending the amendment down to final defeat one member of the panel while opposed to the singlewire provision himself nonetheless said its decision is defensible in the context of its duties and responsibilities based on the facts presented and its charge to recommend code changes based on clear safety considerations the panel says bruce hirsch management consultant with baltimore gas  electric and the electric utility industry’s official liaison to the panel arguably made the right call“proponents of the grid made good points but they didn’t show us that the existing methodology didn’t work” hirsch says “i don’t think anyone on the panel will say that the single wire is better than the grid but they weren’t convinced the single wire doesn’t provide the level of basic sufficient protection that’s needed solutions in the nec aren’t necessarily the best in every case but they’re considered to be safe”while they may have justifiably seen it coming some grid backers said they were left feeling dazed after the decision supporters like wayne robinson a former chief electrical inspector who took the point on an appeal of the panel’s votes were left feeling frustrated he pins most of the blame on coordinated pool industry opposition that helped slip the original change in and pressed the issue as it took up the 2011 nec“i stood up in boston during the nfpa’s nec 2008 meeting and told them they didn’t have the documentation to support a single wire and i brought that up again in las vegas site of the nfpa national convention this year” robinson says “they claimed to have had some tests done on the single wire but we never saw the data in 45 years of working in the electrical industry i had never seen the nec lower the level of safety without documentation”the panel’s chairman don jhonson declined to comment on the panel’s decision on one occasion he also did not return a later followup call for comment weighing the evidence pool industry technical experts and professionals maintain the single wire and the grid have been tested — over time and under realworld conditions carvin di giovanni apsp senior director technical and standards says because pool installers have used both methods with the same realworld results the single wire is a proveneffective option a grid may also work and some installers may choose it he adds but the industry’s chief concern was losing access to options“we’re saying that the single wire has been shown to work for our industry and we want that option preserved” he says “our technical guys did look at the neetrac study but they determined it didn’t provide definitive overwhelming information in support of a grid as the only solution”comfortable with the single wire pool industry players were concerned that needlessly returning to a grid mandate would add costs and reduce flexibility di giovanni says requiring larger quantities of increasingly expensive copper and the added labor needed to lay a grid this group worried that a new cost burden could hurt an already strained industry some took issue with grid supporters’ claims that a grid would add just a couple of hundred dollars to the cost of a pool with the current price of copper sold in rolls pool builder john garner owner of pools by john garner jacksonville fla and president of the northeast chapter of the florida swimming pool association which has been actively engaged in the bonding debate guessed materials alone for a typical pool grid might exceed 1000 david pruette an electrical contractor in orange park fla who works with installers like garner says having to pay extra for something of questionable utility doesn’t make sense“it’s not an easy thing to circle a pool with a grid of wire and while i could see where a grid might conceivably be safer as far as i know no one can point to a case where someone has been hurt because a single wire was used” he says “it’s kind of like choosing to drive a tank down i95 you’re safer than driving a vw but is it necessary”conditions might be right for more pool shocks the only shocks pool owners have typically had to worry much about are the ones that grab your breath with the first dip in the water now however genuine electric shocks are an emerging concern as customer and electric utility neutral conductors carry more current and cases of highimpedance faults linked to compromised insulation on buried cable multiply outdoor pools are among the environments growing more susceptible to perceptible neutraltoearth and contact exposure voltage it’s against that backdrop along with the emergence of pools made from new materials that the debate over the best methods of creating a safer pool environment using equipotential bonding techniques has played out in recent years“stray voltage can come from house wiring or from electric utility distribution systems and the incidence of exposures is increasing in part because more pools are made of prefabricated nonconcrete materials” says charles de nardo chief engineer with we energies a milwaukeebased electric utility and chair of an ieee working group on voltages at publicly and privately accessible locations “the difference in voltage between the water and the earth will be less with concrete and rebar and more with materials like plastic and other nonconductible materials”users of improperly bonded pools are at risk of shock when they simultaneously contact two points in the vicinity of the pool that have different voltage levels often the result of a fault that occurs on either the electric utility or the customer side of the meter douglas dorr senior project manager for the electric power research institute who coordinated a study comparing pool bonding techniques says the voltage levels can far exceed those of nuisance tingles“in a typical voltage drop you may get three or four volts if the bonding is not good” he says “but if you have a fault where the current is going through the return path and you get a voltage drop that’s where the problem lies that’s a safety issue that has to be addressed by getting everything around the pool to float at the same voltage potential”how best to achieve that with bonding of course is the pressing question — not only for existing pool owners but also for installers who will build the pools of the future grid advocates unequivocally say “yes” high and potentially dangerous levels of stray voltage in residential areas is a growing problem see conditions might be right for more pool shocks  outdoor pools that aren’t properly bonded are increasingly risky environments installers should use bonding techniques that demonstrate the highest levels of safety — not those presumed to work based on past performance as judged by documented demonstrable shock events they say looking backward and forward with the 2011 nec in place both sides appear to have retreated to their corners for many in the pool industry there’s relief that the freedom to bond pools with a single wire has been protected — and a sense that the nec revisions process worked aided by commonsense arguments made by industry interests“we haven’t had a huge lobby like other industries but we’ve gotten more proactive on issues like this” garner says “we have some very knowledgeable people in place now in our industry associations who can intercept issues like this and say ‘hey wait a minute why are we doing this’ this was something that could have ended up raising costs to the consumer for no logical reason”on the losing side grid advocates remain convinced that pool safety has been compromised while they blame pool industry interests for mounting opposition they’re equally critical of the nec revisions process when one body — a code making panel represented by industry interests — effectively wields the power to overrule decisions other equally competent nfpa bodies make based largely on hard evidence the system may be broken they suggest robinson complains he was asked to jump through hoops to file appeals and argue his case multiple times only to have procedural rules invoked allowing the code making panel’s earlier vote to trump everything it leaves him wondering if the outcome wasn’t preordained“my interest all along in this was that the nec lowered the level of safety in the 2008 code and that restoring the grid was a way to lower the risk” he says “both neetrac and epri say the single wire doesn’t work but the panel continued to believe it wasn’t an issue i felt the change was going to happen after we submitted more documents but it didn’t seem to sway them it leaves me feeling that the nfpa process may be flawed”but there’s still talk of regrouping robinson says he’s mulled doing an end run around the nec and seeing if the issue could be addressed in the international residential code others like epri’s dorr who in october completed another round of testing he says bolsters the case against the single wire talks of inviting pool industry interests to witness live testing as a basis for further discussion even apsp’s di giovanni leaves the door ajar suggesting more comparative tests research and hard data might be needed to resolve the issue to everyone’s satisfaction meanwhile even with each side heavily invested in its position there’s a palpable sense of the fear both feel more documented pool shock incidents“one person getting shocked is a problem as far as i’m concerned” says de nardo zind is a freelance
