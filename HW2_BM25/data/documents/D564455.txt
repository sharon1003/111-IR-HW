prescribed for me but ive yet to fill it ashley pt how are you sleeping do you feel it affected you in any way anyone else nov 02 2010upvote  0suzie q1964how often did you take the nuvigil my dosage is a 150 mg tablet and i am cutting it in half if i take it everyday i feel different it hasnt changed my sleep patterns at this point but i dont take it on weekends if i am just hanging out at home and i usually only take it every other day during the week nov 02 2010upvote  0twopack your questions twin passed through here just last week but minus the moodpersonality specific part heres the way i answered then edited the neuro that treats my sleep apnea prescribed provigil for me before i was diagnosed with ms at that time i was slapping myself to stay awake while driving and thinking was a slow difficult process that felt like i was wading through chest high mud to find a match to light my fire life as me and near me was unpleasant and unsafe i have taken both provigil and nuvigil over the past three years these are expensive meds but both do more to noticably improve my daily life than any other drug i take id give up many other things to continue to afford either one initially i too took provigil only on work days i found that i was better able to function at work but guaranteed to drag through or sleep through my days off that is not a fun plan i started to take provigil every day so i could enjoy some quality time off neither drug wipes out my fatigue or boosts my energy wish they did what they do is help to keep me awake and alert during the day lately ive been making a switch from provigil to nuvigil i use the nuvigil more often on work days it seems to be the longer acting of the two since i work afternoon shift i need to remain awake and alert later as i drive home at midnight or after this isnt the kind of drug that causes my eyes to pop open and sends my energy into overdrive when it starts working it does its magic quietly for me even at higher doses it sometimes will keep me from sleeping well if i take it too late in the day though because of my schedule i would sometimes take half the provigil dose when i first got up and the other half at noon that doesnt seem necessary with the nuvigil i have not noticed general nervousness or excitement except on rare occasions i have to think it was caused by some combination of the drug and another influence like caffeine or cold medicine the only changes i have noticed in mood or personality would be positive ones resulting from being happier as i was able to function better at a higher level than had been possible for quite some time im much slower processing thoughts and information these days i also get angry or irritated more quickly than i used to i believe these problems are most likely cognitive symptoms of ms i have osa obstructive sleep apnea as well as ms its not totally clear to me how much of my fatigue and cog fog is channeled from either source i just know that between them my onoff switch has been replaced by a dimmer slide that tends to slip down no matter how many times it gets pushed up the combination of cpap by night and nuvigil by day has made it possible to wake up somewhat refreshed engage in a more active life think more clearly and drive safely every day well most days imo these drugs are well worth giving a try i would suggest titrating dose up if you tend to react easily to new medications as some people have reported generalized overstimulation when first taking them mary nov 02 2010upvote  0sllowe hi there mary thanks for reposting your experience like suzie im wanting to know experiences as im on the verge of trying it too have i read this correctly that you havent experienced any difference in your night time sleep shell nov 03 2010upvote  0ashley pti had a hard time sleeping sometimes especially at first i only took it for a few months i had to stop when we were trying to get pregnant when i started i only took it on work days which was 3 times a week for me that was actually worse because it didnt feel consistent when i started taking it daily then things leveled out for me i would have liked a lower dose i was taking 175mg a day for me if i took it after 8am then i didnt go to sleep at the time i wanted to i felt rested and i got enough sleep it just wasnt at the time i was used to again that got better when i consistently took it at and set alarms in the morning to take it at the same time everyday nov 03 2010upvote  0twopack ill be sure to take a look at that emily shell you did understand my comments correctly i do still have some sleep problems i just dont believe they are related to the nuvigil im seldom asleep before 2am but my shift work makes that happen ive always been a night owl personality anyway i usually have little trouble falling asleep im more likely to fall asleep quickly and then wake up after an hour or two unable get back to sleep parathesias are more likely to wake me or keep me awake than any medication i take i do use an occasional sleeping pill that just seems sooooooo wrong a pill to sleep a pill to wake up again i feel kind of michael jacksonlike when i start to regualte sleep with a pill mary nov 03 2010upvote  0twopack i looked and wouldnt quality anyway i thought by the name and the topic here that this study would be about improving sleep or lessening fatigue in ms patients wrong its apparently an investigational oral agent dmd i did see a very interesting statement on the site â€¢200 americans are diagnosed with ms each week  really youd never know it by the postings we get around here mary nov 03 2010upvote  0your answer notify me of new activity on this question join this community answer previous question next question
