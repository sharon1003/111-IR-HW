5 places where you should never give your social security number by column by href http www credit targetexternal adam levin credit commarch 31 2013getty images here are some places you should never give your social security number to email every time you go to a new doctor or dentist and they give you a clipboard brimming with documents to fill out and sign notice how they always ask for your social security number do you dutifully give it up did you ever wonder if they really need it i once asked a doctor why he wanted it his response i dont really know i guess its because weve always asked for it in actuality most doctors ask in case your insurance doesnt pay the entire invoice andor to fill out a death certificate if you die offer a next of kin who knows the number instead and your phone number for billing issues almost every day somebody asks for your social security number and like the grand marshal of a parade throwing rose petals or candy to the crowd you probably give it up without giving it a second thought  because thats what youve always done so the next time someone asks you for your social security number reflect on this in december the army announced that hackers stole the social security numbers of 36000 visitors to fort monmouth in new jersey including intelligence officers  cyber activists took control of the cias website the private information including some social security numbers of celebrities and political leaders including fbi director robert mueller and secretary of state hillary clinton were exposed the sensitive data of first lady michelle obama vice president joe biden and attorney general eric holder recently were posted on a website for the world to see hackers even listened in on a phone call in which the fbi and scotland yard were discussing the criminal investigation against those very same hackers and these incidents are only the crumbs on top of the coffee cake when you consider that hackers and thieves have improperly accessed more than 600 million consumer files since 2004 monty python had it right the moral to these horror stories is that if your social security number is stored on any computer anywhere hackers will find a way to access it or a compromised or disgruntled employee may well walk out the door with it if your doctor gym or childs grade school claims otherwise that their security systems can protect your private data better than the cia fbi and scotland yard to quote monty python run away your identity is your biggest asset and your social security number is the key to your personal kingdom with it an identity thief can wreak havoc hijacking your old credit accounts establishing new ones buying cars and houses committing crimes even obtaining medical products and services while pretending to be you endangering not just your credit and your reputation but also your life consumers whose social security numbers are exposed in a data breach are five times more likely to become fraud victims than those who arent according to the latest identity fraud report by javelin strategy  research just say no for better or worse you are the gatekeeper the person most responsible for shielding your social security number is you therefore your mission is to limit as best you can the universe of those who gain access to it heres a short list of companies and organizations that have absolutely no business requesting your social security number1 anyone who calls or sends you an officiallooking email who texts you a link to any site or designates a number to call where you are asked to confirm your ssn if they call check the credit or debit card that is the subject of the communication call the customer service number listed on the back and ask for the security department if they email or text do the same or go directly to the institutions website provided you know who they are make sure you type the correct url and make sure that the page where you are asked to enter your information is secure only provide personal information if youre the one who controls the interaction2 public schools your utility bill confirms your address your email and phone number give them channels to contact you in an emergency asking for your social security number is overkill3 little league summer camp and the like for the same reasons as school a social security number should never be required by these groups if they ask for your childs birth certificate show it to them dont leave it with them unless they can prove they will protect it and even then can you really believe them if you use credit to pay for the activity the organization may need your social security number if you pay for it upfront or with a direct debit to your bank account or credit card they dont period4 supermarkets a frequent shopper card is neither a loan nor a bank account its merely a tool grocery stores use to track your purchases primarily for marketing purposes regardless many supermarket chains request customers social security numbers on their application forms refuse5 anybody who approaches you on the street whether its a cell phone company salesman offering a free tshirt or someone running a voter registration campaign never ever give your ssn if you want an illfitting tshirt festooned with corporate logos buy one if you want to register to vote go to your county board of elections in person this is the short list there are plenty of other organizations that should never get your social security number and if you know one that ive left out please leave it in the comments dont just hand it over once you realize how often you are asked for your social security number you may be surprised it happens literally all the time so the next time someone does as they inevitably will heres how to handle it1 take a minute and think maybe they ask for ssns blindly because everyone else does or because thats how theyve always done it maybe they actually need it see if their reason sounds legitimate for example creditcoms credit report card does ask for your ssn in order to generate your credit score and credit report summary  an industry standard  but the information is fully encrypted with a banklevel authentication process2 negotiate there are many different ways to identify you without a social security number including your drivers license or account number fight to use those instead3 if you must share your social security number do so but make sure the people taking it down have strong security measures in place to protect it that said you only have their assurance and frankly in light of the mistakes people make and the sophistication level of hackers who really knows if they can protect it overcoming the addiction if all this sounds like a giant pain in the neck youre right it is in the midst of our busy lives we shouldnt be the only ones concerned with protecting our most valuable identity asset but it is what it is until somebody creates a silver bullet for identity theft we are forced to take matters into our own hands dont be passive ask the companies and nonprofit groups with which you do business how they plan to protect you do they password protect and encrypt all the personal information they collect do they have strict controls on who has access to computers containing your social security number and do they keep this sensitive data off laptops tablets and hard drives that are easy to steal or lose like the doctor i met many companies collect social security numbers they dont need because theyre operating on autopilot theyve always done it and their colleagues at other companies do it so the practice continues and spreads on the strength of simple dumb inertia i believe that we are smarter than that by demanding that companies do a better job protecting our personal information and refusing to hand out our social security numbers like candy at a parade we can force them to get smarter too and if they dont think were serious about this and the government doesnt finally force them off their social security number addiction it is highly likely that the ultimate regulator of the american economic system class action attorneys will be knocking on their doors this work is the opinion of the columnist and in no way reflects the opinion of abc news adam levin is
