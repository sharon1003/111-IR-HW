engineerapproved equipment in good working condition and providing normal output or production the engineer may reject equipment not in good working condition or not properly sized for efficient performance of the workb hourly owned equipment rates the base rate for the machine and attachments represent the major cost of equipment ownership such as depreciation interest taxes insurance storage and major repairs the hourly operating rate represents the major costs of equipment operation such as fuel and oil lubrication field repairs tires expendable parts and supplies for all equipment used on force account work determine and have the department confirm the hourly owned equipment rates as follows hoer   raf ´ ara ´  r  176  hocwhere hoer  hourly owned equipment rate raf

however compensation for equipment normally used on a 24 hours per day basis will not exceed the monthly rate plus adjustments and operating costs the rate adjustment factor assigned to any attachment will be the yearly factor as determined for the base equipment when multiple attachments are included with the rental equipment only the attachment having the highest rental rate will be eligible for payment provided that the attachment has been approved by the engineer as being necessary to the force account work when a piece of owned equipment is not listed in the blue book use the rate for similar equipment found in the blue book or use 6 percent of the purchase price as the monthly rate  r  and add the hourly operating rate found in the blue book for similar equipment of the same

department will pay a 15 percent mark up for overhead and profit for the actual invoiced rates during the idle period the department will not pay idle owned equipment costs for more than 8 hours in a 24hour day or 40 hours in a week the department will not pay for inoperable equipment the engineer may order specific equipment to the site up to 5 days before its planned usage if this equipment is

convenience of the state the department will pay as working equipment for the entire workday equipment used intermittently during the workday the department will not pay the cost of idle equipment when the work was suspended by the contractor for the contractor’s own reasons the department will only pay for the number of calendar days during the existence of the suspension the department will not compensate the contractor for days that the engineer determined were lost to weather the department will only pay for equipment physically located at the project site that was received to prosecute the scheduled work during the delay compensation for idle equipment will stop at the completion of the force account work or at the end of the suspension of workd rented equipment the department will pay a 15 percent mark up for overhead and profit for all rented equipment and its corresponding blue book hourly operating costs 1 equipment rented solely for force account work if the

the blue book and approved by the engineer the department will pay a 15 percent mark up for overhead and profit for all rented equipment paid for by the actual invoices add the blue book hourly operating cost to the marked up actual invoiced rates 2 equipment rented for original contract work but used for force account work if the contractor uses rented equipment currently on the project for original contract work to perform force account work then determine the hourly outsiderented equipment rate as follows hrer   hri ´ 115  hocwhere hrer  hourly rented equipment rate hri  hourly rental invoice costs prorated for the actual number of hours that rented equipment is operated solely on force account work use a monthly invoice rate divided by 176 a weekly invoice rate divided by 40 or a

work by the engineere moving of equipment the department will also pay for the time required to move needed equipment to the location of the force account work and to return it to its original location the department will pay for loading and transportation costs instead of moving time if equipment is moved by means other than its own power moving time back to the original location or loading and transportation costs will not be allowed if the equipment is used at the site of the force account work on contract items or related work the department will consider the actual cost of transferring the equipment to the project and returning it to the original location as an additional expense and pay for it as specified for equipment moved on the project exclusively for force account work the engineer will confirm the original location of the equipment before the contractor moves and uses it for force account work if the equipment is transported by a common carrier the allowance is the invoiced amount paid for the freight plus 15 percent however if the contractor’s forces transport the equipment the allowable compensation will be blue book rate of the hauling unit and hourly blue book operating cost plus the driver’s wages and the cost of loading and unloading the equipment calculated according to 10905 c25 foreman’s transportation the department will pay a

or by any other cause other than a suspension of work as defined in 10402 c 3 a significant subcontractor may submit a claim for reimbursement of home office overhead when a suspension of work has impacted its operations the engineer will calculate the payment for home office overhead using the following formula hoop   d ´ a ´ c  bwhere a  original contract amount b  contract duration in calendar days c  55 percent d  excusable compensable delay in calendar days hoop  home office overhead payment contract duration term b  is the number of calendar days from the execution of the

accepted progress schedule shows work during a portion of the winter then that portion is included in the b term exclude normal winter shutdown periods from the compensable delay term d the period from december 1 through april 30 is considered normal winter shutdown however if the contractor normally performs work during a portion of the winter then that portion is included in d when the director allows a subcontractor home office overhead compensation use the above formula to calculate the subcontractor’s hoop  however in the subcontractor calculation the a is equal to the

of the project cost such as aggregates steel and precast concrete the department will not pay delivered materials on small warehouse items or for plant materials10911 partial acceptance upon completion of a portion of the work the contractor may request partial acceptance of that portion of the work the final inspector will determine if the portion is acceptably completed the final inspector will grant written partial acceptance for that portion of the work or reject the contractor’s request such written partial acceptance will designate what portion of the work is accepted the date of acceptance and the warranty provisions started by the partial acceptance partial acceptance will relieve the contractor of maintenance responsibility for the designated portion of the work this does not relieve the contractor of responsibility to correct defective work or repair damage caused by the contractor10912 final acceptance and termination of contractor responsibility a final inspection notify the engineer when the project is complete and all of the engineer’s punch list items are complete if the engineer agrees the project is complete then within 10 business days the
