sinus and food how food can affect the sinusesaving sinus pressure drainage or just plain excessive mucus have you wonder how some of the foods you eat may be impacting your sinus issues these are questions many people have been asking which deserve an answer mucus and food there is such thing as a good kind of mucus it is produced to help our respiratory organs carry on their work efficiently this kind of mucus is being produced all the time by the membranes lining the sinus cavity yet when it becomes excessive it is annoying and we wish to do something about it at this point some begin to think about the possible connection between mucus and food from the outset we can say the connection is more real and verifiable than many realize the excessive mucus can irritate the sinus cavity and nasal cavity and cause infection in those organs membranes especially after eating certain foods sometimes environmental elements such as pollen house dust smog smoke etc are addressed by the immune systems as invaders that it must protect against and to do this it uses histaminea clear watery mucus like substance that is intended to wash off those invaders yet it is wrong choice of foods that can exacerbate this condition and in some cases actually be the cause of the primary cause of the mucus problem sinus and food the main function of the sinus membranes and the nasal cavity is to produce mucus yet an e xcessive amounts of mucus going down back of the throat sinus drainage is commonly classified as a sinus issue or  sinus problem  while large amounts of mucus coming through the nose can be attributed to allergic rhinitis or just to plain allergies in this context as we have already seen in the preceding paragraph we can affirm that some foods can impact the production of mucus to a degree most people do not realize eg cheese can cause sinus pressure to some and excess mucus to others the sinus and food relationship can be so real that one way to handle sinus issues such as pressure is to initially test for a food or foods suspected as culpritsfor example dairy foods just eat a substantial amount of that food by itself evaluate the reaction s if any 23 hours or longer later on your sinuses and other respiratory organs if indeed food is the cause of your sinus issue such signs as sinus pressure congestion headache drainage sinus infection symptoms etc will appear then depending on the severity of the reaction s if any you will have to decide what to do this simple test can be repeated with the same food s and see if the same reaction is obtained a second time if you do then you can be be reasonable sure you have found the cause of your sinus issue whether it be postnasal drip pnd sinus pressure or sinusitis rhinitis etc our site map has our other pages dealing with sinus issues which you may want to check then of course use this as a guide on your choice of foods get all the information you can on sinus  for example the meaning of the color of mucus very valuable information on this subject appears in the publication offered click issues in the sinus cavities such as sinus pressure can have their origin in some specific food as we have seen others are more related to the environment for example house dust which can in some cases produce also headaches and sinus pressure etc often a combination of food and the environment is the real culprit of some sinus issues in this latter context sinus drainage can be an indication that both elements should be checked on the hand some issues such as hay fever can be more attributed to the environment yet it can be easily exacerbated by some foods on the other hand some foods are used by some as sources of sinus relief some use oil of oregano to relieve and prevent sinusitis while it may have some antibacterial and anti fungal properties it is doubtful whether it can really treat effectively a sinus infection or an infected mucus situation and the green mucus which can accompany them fresh fruits and vegetables are often considered as good food for the sinuses one vegetable deemed to be especially good for some sinus issues is garlic in my own experience dealing sith sinus issues i know that garlic as well as other foods can be a blessing for the sinuses garlic can destroy known viruses and bacterial infection with its astringent and disinfectant power and it also builds defenses so one develops immunity to harmful airborne germs that could give the flu garlic neutralizes harmful bacteria and microbes that cause colds thus garlic can be very beneficial in preventing colds and the flu by killing the root cause of them considering also that viruses and the flu can irritate the sinus and nasal cavity membranes and this in turn cause sinus issues then garlic can be beneficial to help prevent sinus antibiotics do not kill viruses while garlic is known to have this medicinal property again allicin the active medicinal ingredient in garlic is what i take whenever a virus or cold threatens me if i dont have allicin i just eat a fresh garlic sandwich using two large cloves of the garlic bulb good foods for the sinuses fruits such as grapefruits lemons oranges with their abundant supply of vitamin c can help diminish the symptoms of colds and sinus pressure connected with allergies especially when mucus phlegm become very thick try squeezing a lemon into a cup of hot water and drink it while still warm it will help loosen the thick stuff in your air passages and make breathing easier rhinitis a constant swelling of the nasal membranes as well as sinus pressure and other sinus issues can benefit from some of these natural therapies one thing to remember along side the good foods for the sinuses is to expectorate and cough out the mucus rather than to swallow it and recycle back in all the viruses and bacteria that the body is trying to expel so here is a list of good foods for the sinusesassuming there are no allergy symptom sinus

can help pineapple studies have shown that it is of real benefit for those suffering from asthma and sinus disorders bromelain the active therapeutic element found in fresh pineapple has antiinflammatory properties which can reduce the swelling in air passages and sinus cavity membranes this helps by making breathing easier and by helping the elimination of clear green or yellow mucus sinus pressure etc it can also help in bringing relief again to those suffering from sinus pressure pain pneumonia colds and bronchitis bromelain has been found to be also to contain an enzyme that can break down proteins thus for breathing disorders and as a digestive aid pineapple is the fruit of choice for many but there are other foods that can help in keeping the sinuses clear foods to

properties also shown to have antiviral and antibacterial propertieshundred of scientific studies attest to its remedial validity onions chiles ginger cayenne pepper these foods can of course help prevent sinus pressure congestion etc so use them often as the old adage states the best cure is prevention and if a person were to abstain as much as possible from potential mucus producing foods that could possibly be the best mucus healing step one could take again this is thoroughly discussed in the publication offered please click we believe that practical experimentation and observation has its place in healing so long as a person realizes that not everyone reacts to foods and medication the same way wrong choice of foods impacts our health and well being more than perhaps most of us is aware of this is particularly true when it comes to sinus and mucus issues thus here are several lists of foods and how they can relate to those two issues worst foods for the

cauliflower etc attests to the wonderful defense against mucus and allergy symptoms which fresh vegetables can offer alongside fresh fruits vegetables and nuts vegetables rank very high as good sinus foods in fact good for ones health in general some have very specific remedial and healing properties for example garlic which is discussed more in detail in the next sections there is by now little doubt that nutrition plays and important role in the state of our sinuses when it comes to such disorders as sinus pressure sinus drainage keeping the sinuses clear the right way is always helpful acupressuresinus pressure points is perhaps the easiest fastest safer costeffective wayto keep the sinuses clear and help prevent sinus infections perhaps the best all around vegetable for your sinuses are some medicinal herbs among them is garlic if you can tolerate it garlic effect on sinus is garlic good for sinus problems  if the medicinal properties of a common vegetable have ever been thoroughly studied that would have to be garlic the medicinal properties of this lowly bulb can go to the root cause of such sinus disorders as sinus pressure drainage  hay fever sinusitis etc the reason is that garlic kills bacteria viruses infections the russian developed a secret garlic compound to relieve battle field wounds garlic could also help prevent sinus problems since it could destroy those germs from the outset thus the resounding answer is yes garlic can help sinus problems does garlic help fight flu  this is the remedy that russian pharmacologists recommend for fighting flu symptoms besides destroying viruses they consider allicin the medicinal active ingredient in garlicas a natural wonder drug which is refreshingly different from chemical antibiotics with their proverbial and powerful side effects they also maintain that allicin destroys only specific harmful germs and does not affect the bodys natural and beneficial bacteriaas antibiotics do considering that the flu can generate other sinus problems such as sinus pressure sinus drainage headaches etc it is good news that garlic can help prevent and fight flu problems thus again yes garlic helps fight the flu is garlic good for sore throats  often sinus infections and other sinus problems are accompanied by heavy discharge of mucus carrying bacteria and viruses this affluent passage of infected mucus in back of the throat eventually causes a sore throat dr klosa a german scientist and pioneer in the study of garlic as flu fighter discovered that patients who were given a solution of garlic oil water and onion juice concentrate in doses of 10 to 25 drops every four hours experienced relief and freedom from fever and viral symptoms moreover the convalescence period was also reduced none of the patients had any of the usual postflu complaints such as chronic inflammation of the lungs swelling of the lymph glands jaundice or pains in the muscles or joints and the usual cough accompanying the bout was much suppressed of course sore throats were also significantly reduced can garlic kill sinus bacteria  sometimes a bacterial sinus infection follows a viral infection phlegm yellow mucus green mucus etc are signs of such infections the lowly bulb garlic can be very effective in fighting these type of infection specially if used at the outset the simple protocol shown in the next section can be used to combat those infections thus for the foregoing and the previous sections on garlic the answer once again is yes garlic effect on sinus  how to use it  f or sore throats sinus issues clogged and runny nose common colds viruses green snot this is basically what dr klosa administered to his patients which relieved in most instances these disorders in a short timethis relief procedure should be administered at the onset of the problemto an 8 ounce cup of water add 10 drops of garlic oiltake every 4 hours increasing the number of the garlic oil by 5 drops up to 25 dropsif the increase of garlic oil is too much for ones stomach it should not be increasedthe relief procedure should be stopped if it is discomforting or one feels this is not for meif raw onions do not upset the stomach one can enhance the relief procedure by adding extract of onion juice to the above dosage garlic oil and onion juice extracts can be purchased at a health food store or through the internet it is good to have around the house these itemsperhaps in the refrigeratorso when those disorders strike they can be used at the very outset now there is in the markethealth food stores mostly and through the interneta product called allimax which is a concentration of allicin the medicinal active ingredient of garlic one capsule every 4 hours for several days can deal a deadly blow to those sinus issues if nipped at the bud i have allimax in the house all the time and it has proved very effective just recently my wife came down with the flu and a few days later i began to feel the same symptoms she had just had i started my allimax protocol and in a few days the symptoms disappeared i did not catch the flu other herbs such as thyme can be used as a natural decongestant together with the above relief procedure sinus pressure points acupressure can be used for quick relief of such disorders as sinus pressure keeping the sinuses clear can also contribute to sinus issues prevention including potential diseases of the sinus cavity besides using right foods sinus rinse and steam inhalation can help keep the sinuses clear g arlic medicinal properties it contains a long list of additional clinically proven relieving and preventive properties it has been called natures antibiotic here are some of the health blessings of this pungent inexpensive bulb we call garlicantibacterialanti inflammatorycancer fighterhigh antioxidantcardiovascular helperblood pressure regulatorantiviralenhances regulation of cholesterol levelsserves as stimulator of fibrinolisysinhibits platelet aggregationdigestion enhancer allicin as already mentioned is the active therapeutic ingredient in garlic to obtain it garlic must be crushed or finely minced and be let to stand for several minutes so the allicin can be formed warm foods such as soups are good to loosen and remove mucus from the body spices such as hot peppers pepper etc create an internal warmth that is likewise beneficial to the respiratory organs it is obvious that smoking will tend to exacerbate any ailment affecting the breathing organs allergies excessive mucus bronchitis drainage sinus pressure etc while foods can play an important role on sinus issues the opposite can be also true in some cases the abstinence of food or fasting fasting for therapeutic reasons has been common through the ages and its positive effects cannot be denied today we hardly hear about it pills nasal spraysone should be careful not to damage the cilia with while using spraysand injections have taken its place but is is good to know this alternative simple healing system in the animal kingdom it is used widely one of the premises behind it is that by concentrating the body energy resources in its defense mechanismwhich we call immune systemthe body can more successfully itself fight whatever is ailing it on the other hand some otc overthecounterremedies together with wise food choices can alleviate some sinus disorders such as sinus pressure congestion drainage and can help clear the sinuses etc in all these alternative right food choice is key while food plays obviously a crucial role in the relief of sinus issues other factors in our environment can also play a major role for example house dust allergy a simple test can give an initial clue as to the extent to which this item should be looked into as a potential sinus culprit in conclusion by now it is obvious and safe to say that vegetables can affect the sinuses in fact food can be the most important key preventive and healing factor when it comes to mucus production and other sinus disorders issues sinus mrihow to prevent sinus issues right eating the free flow of nerve energy to all organs of our body this of course would include our respiratory organs those two things are very important in sinus issues prevention such things as allergic reactions chronic sinus pressure sinus drainage congestion that does not go away etc can be helped by eating the right foods and ensuring that the circulation of nerve energy from the brain to the rest of the body is unimpaired a subluxated vertebrawhich exerts pressure on the spinal cordcan bring about this undesirable restriction the latter can re responsible for health issues which can emerge without apparent cause baffling physicians and other medical professionals this concept unknown by many and its importance and remedy is discussed in thee steps to quick sinus and mucus freedom click for more information then we have acupressure as a way to deal with sinus pressure congestion etc and to boost the immune system by simple application of this oriental therapeutic system which involves selfapplied pressure on some right points of the body
