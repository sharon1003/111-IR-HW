objective the primary focus of this chapter is the nature scope and importance of international organisations with special reference to their classification and role in the present global scenario after going through this chapter you should be able to • • know the meaning nature and scope of international organisation differentiate between the different types of international organisations2p a g e •analyse the importance of international organisations in an highly interdependent and inter connected world of today11 introduction in contemporary global politics international organizations play an enormous role to most of the world they symbolize the hope for international peace and security through global cooperation and mutual economic development examples of international organizations include the united nations un the world bank international bank for reconstruction and development the international committee of the red cross and greenpeace most international organizations operate as part of one or more international regimes an international regime is a set of rules standards and procedures that govern national behaviour in a particular area examples of international regimes include arms control foreign trade and antarctic exploration international organizations are often central to the functioning of an international regime giving structure and procedures to the “rules of the game” by which nations must play for example the world trade organization wto the north american free trade agreement nafta and the european union eu are key organizations that define the international trade regime12 meaning and nature of international organisation in general international organisation stands for membership group that operates across national borders for specific purposes the idea of international organisation reflects the cooperative arrangement instituted among states usually by a basic agreement to perform some mutually advantageous functions implemented through periodic meetings and staff activities the penguin dictionary of international relations defines international organisation as “formal institutional structures transcending national boundaries which are created by multilateral agreement among nation states their purpose is to foster international cooperation in areas such as security law economic and social matters and diplomacy”3p a g e however in the modern sense an international organization or more formally intergovernmental organization igo is an organization such as the united nations european community or the wto with sovereign states or other igos as members such organizations function according to the principles of intergovernmentalism which means that unanimity is required the european union is however an exception to this rule in some areas nongovernmental organizations ngos are private organizations that can also be international in scope generally and correctly used however the term “international organization” is reserved for intergovernmental organizations only it is in this sense that the term “international organization” is used in this lesson bennett identifies the characteristics of international organisation that include 1 a permanent organisation to carry on a continuing set of functions 2 voluntary membership of eligible parties 3 a basic instrument stating goals structure and methods of operation 4 a permanent secretariat to carry on continuous administrative research and information functions legally speaking the nature of an international organization is different from other organisations in the sense that the former must be established by a treaty providing it with legal recognition and usually in order to safeguard state sovereignty operates at the level of consent recommendation and cooperation rather than through compulsion or enforcement international organizations so established are subjects of international law capable of entering into agreements among themselves or with states thus international organizations in a legal sense are distinguished from mere groupings of states such as the g8 and the g77 neither of which have been founded by treaty though in nonlegal contexts these are sometimes referred to as international organizations as well international organizations must also be distinguished from treaties while all international organizations are founded on a treaty many treaties eg the north american free trade agreement nafta do not establish an international organization and rely purely on the parties for their administration13 scope and functions of international organisations4p a g e international organizations also differ in its scope of functions membership and membership criteria in terms of scope international organisations perform a varied number of useful functions within the state system their chief function is to provide the means of cooperation among states in areas in which cooperation provides advantages for all or large number of nations they not only work as a platform to take cooperative decisions but also the administrative tool for translating the decisions into action they also provide multiple channels of communication among governments so that areas of accommodation may be explored and easy access will be available when problem arise in conflict situations if states are willing to explore the possibilities of accommodation and compromise modern international organisations have made available a new dimension beyond the previously existing channels of diplomacy and peaceful settlement the united nations the specialised agencies and regional organisations provide multiple and continuous contact points through which accommodation can be reached we must note that international organisations generally have no independent means of carrying out coercion but states needing to minimise the effects of conflict find the many and diverse agencies of international organisation useful for that end the united nations for example provides several major organs whose functions include the resolution of conflict in other situations not involving conflict as in some of the technical work of international organisations cooperation is facilitated by the existence of these organisations for reaching agreements that have mutual advantages for all state concerned the fundamental idea and reality underlying modern international organisations involve diplomacy treaties conferences rules of warfare the regulation of the use of force peaceful settlement of disputes the development of international law international trade international economic cooperation international social cooperation culturalrelationship world travel world communications cosmopolitanism universalism peace movements the formation of leagues and federations international administration collective security and movements for world government the role of international organisations in the contemporary world order depends on their legal recognition by the international community in other words the organisation is a5p a g e subject of international laws and capable of enforcing them by bringing international claims it can make treaties it can coordinate with other organisations to avoid unsound competition or duplication of efforts to perform their functions effectively international organisations are endowed with certain privilege and immunities the agents and servants who perform the functions of international organisations also possess privilege and immunities international organisations are also entitled to the grant of privileges and immunities for their asset properties and representatives privileges for the representatives may include from personal arrest or detention and from seizer of their personal baggage and in respect of words written or spoken and all acts done by them in their capacity as representatives immunity from legal process of every kind inviolability for all papers and documents the rights to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags freedom from direct taxes and

international organisation briefly discuss the major characteristics of the international organisations q 2 discuss the important functions of international organisations 6p a g e 14 kinds of international organizations modern international organizations may be classified broadly into two main categories intergovernmental organizations igos and international nongovernmental organizations ingos 141 intergovernmental organizations intergovernmental organizations have national governments as members hundreds of igos operate in all parts of the world member nations have created each of these organizations to serve a purpose that those nations find useful membership can range from as few as two member nations to virtually all nations the un and its various agencies are igos so are most of the world’s economic coordinating institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec seeks to coordinate the production and pricing policies of its 12 member states the international atomic energy agency iaea seeks to regulate the flow of nuclear technology to developing nations the wto helps negotiate and monitor agreements among 128 nations to lower trade barriers military alliances such as the north atlantic treaty organization nato and the southeast asia treaty organization seato and political groupings such as the arab league and the african union are also igos in general regional igos have experienced more success than global ones and those with specific purposes have worked better than those with broad aims 142 international nongovernmental organizations international nongovernmental organizations are private organizations whosememberships and activities are international in scope ngos do not possess the legal status of national governments however the un and other international forums recognize many ngos as important political institutions examples of ngos include the roman catholic church greenpeace the international olympic committee and the7p a g e international committee of the red cross although multinational corporations mncs share many characteristics of ngos they are not international organizations because they do not coordinate the actions of members for mutual gain the igos can be further categories on the basis of the nature of their functioning global and regional membership membership criteria and cultural or historical links membership of some organizations global organizations is open to all the nations of the world this category includes the united nations and its specialized agencies and the world trade organization other organizations are only open to members from a particular region or continent of the world like european union african union and asean and so on finally some organizations base their membership on other criteria cultural or historical links the commonwealth of nations la francophonie the community of portuguese language

international nongovernmental organisations 16 importance of international organisations10  p a g e while there are less than 200 governments in the global system there are approximately 300 intergovernmental organisations igos such as the un nato the european union or the international coffee organisation and 5800 international nongovernmental organisations ingos such as amnesty international the baptist world alliance the international chamber of shipping or the international red cross plus a similar number of lesswellestablished international caucuses and networks of ngos all these igos and ingos play a regular part in global politics and transnational socioeconomic activities however the importance of international organisations has increased in the present interconnected and interdependent world the increasing interdependence forced the modern state to search the areas of mutual advantage such as trade communications economic development and world peace since the states must in so many areas cooperate adjust accommodate and compromise to promote their common welfare to solve problems not limited to national boundaries and to lessen conflict it is entirely logical for them to create elaborate agencies of international organisations for these ends it is also logical to assume that they will continue to be used by states as indispensable though limited tools for a wide variety of purposes since the trend of world events is toward increased contacts and a growing diversity of problems we may reasonably expect international organisations to also become increasingly diverse in number and purposes rather than to diminish in significance one sign of the important role of international organizations is how they have endured as international power relations shift in 1991 the soviet union dissolved and the cold war between the soviet union and the united states ended at this time one might have expected the nato military alliance to russia and other formerly communist countries in eastern europe ceased to pose a threat to the capitalist democracies of western europe one might have expected nato which defended western european nations to go out of business but it did not similarly the creation of the wto did not cause smaller freetrade associations such as nafta to end instead the mosaic of international organisations continues to expand particularly as new communications and11  p a g e informationprocessing technologies make international groups more practical and effective the interdependence of nations in the modern world means that no single nation can dictate the outcome of international conflicts nor can private groups and individuals rely on national governments to solve major world problems therefore both governments and individuals will continue to turn to international organisations as an important way to address these problems and to protect their own interests as the world shrinks the line between domestic and international problems becomes increasingly blurred international events have their international implications in this situation the international organisations may serve as useful tools of the states for their mutual cooperation check your progress 3 note use the space given below for your answer also check your answer with the model answer given at the end of the unit q 1 how could international organisation have a significant effect upon global politics 17 let us sum up to sum up international organisations of all types transcend country boundaries the growth of science and technology means of communication and the consequent interdependence of the states accelerated the formations of intergovernmental and nongovernmental organisations new global problems have arisen that demands global treatment among these are population food supply energy supplies mass poverty environmental controls outer space the oceans and seabed and insurance against human12  p a g e annihilation in this situation international organisations serve a useful function in channelling a portion of state interactions and providing vehicles for increased cooperation thus the international organisations have become indispensable in the current global system18 some useful books 1 le roy bennett international organisations principles and issues new jersey prentice hall inc
