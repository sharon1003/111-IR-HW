i when was jesus born a popular myth puts his birth on december 25 thin the year 1 c e b the new testament gives no date or year for jesus’ birth the earliest gospel – st mark’s written about 65 ce – begins with the baptism of an adult jesus this suggests that the earliest christians lacked interest in or knowledge of jesus’ birthdate c the year of jesus birth was determined by dionysius exiguus a scythian monk “abbot of a roman monastery his calculation went as followsa in the roman prechristian era years were counted from ab urbe condita “the founding of the city”  rome thus 1 auc signifies the year rome was founded 5 auc signifies the 5 th year of rome’s reign etcb dionysius received a tradition that the roman emperor augustus reigned 43 years and was followed by the emperor tiberiusc luke 3123 indicates that when jesus turned 30 years old it was the 15 thyear of tiberius reignd if jesus was 30 years old in tiberius’ reign then he lived 15 years under augustus placing jesus birth in augustus’ 28 th year of reigne augustus took power in 727 auc therefore dionysius put jesus birth in 754 aucf however luke 15 places jesus’ birth in the days of herod and herod died in 750 auc – four years before the year in which dionysius places jesus birth d joseph a fitzmyer – professor emeritus of biblical studies at the catholic university of america member of the pontifical biblical commission and former president of the catholic biblical association – writing in the catholic church’s official commentary on the new testament 1  writes about the date of jesus’ birth “though the year of jesus birth is not reckoned with certainty the birth did not occur in ad 1 the christian era supposed to have its starting point in the year of jesus birth is based on a miscalculation introduced ca 533 by dionysius exiguus”e the de pascha computus an anonymous document believed to have been written in north africa around 243 ce placed jesus birth on march 28 clement a bishop of alexandria d ca 215 ce thought jesus was born on november 18 based on historical records fitzmyer guesses that jesus birth occurred on september 11 3 bce ii how did christmas come to be celebrated on december 25 a roman pagans first introduced the holiday of saturnalia a week long period of lawlessness celebrated between december 1725 during this period roman courts were closed and roman law dictated that no one could be punished for damaging property or injuring people during the weeklong celebration the festival began when roman authorities chose “an enemy of the roman people” to represent the “lord of misrule” each roman community selected a victim whom they forced to indulge in food and other physical pleasures throughout the week at the festival’s conclusion december 25 th  roman authorities believed they were destroying the forces of darkness by brutally murdering this innocent man or woman b the ancient greek writer poet and historian lucian in his dialogue entitled saturnalia describes the festival’s observance in his time in addition to human sacrifice he mentions these customs widespread intoxication going from house to house while singing naked rape and other sexual license and consuming humanshaped biscuits still produced in some english and most german bakeries during the christmas season c in the 4 thcentury ce christianity imported the saturnalia festival hoping to take the pagan masses in with it christian leaders succeeded in converting to christianity large numbers of pagans by promising them that they could continue to celebrate the saturnalia as christians 2d the problem was that there was nothing intrinsically christian about saturnalia to remedy this these christian leaders named saturnalia’s concluding day december 25 th to be jesus’ birthday e christians had little success however refining the practices of saturnalia as stephen nissenbaum professor history at the university of massachussetts amherst writes “in return for ensuring massive observance of the anniversary of the savior’s birth by assigning it to this resonant date the church for its part tacitly agreed to allow the holiday to be celebrated more or less the way it had always been” the earliest christmas holidays were celebrated by drinking sexual indulgence singing naked in the streets a precursor of modern caroling etc f the reverend increase mather of boston observed in 1687 that “the early christians who first observed the nativity on december 25 did not do so thinking that christ was born in that month but because the heathens’ saturnalia was at that time kept in rome and they were willing to have those pagan holidays metamorphosed into christian ones” 3 because of its known pagan origin christmas was banned by the puritans and its observance was illegal in massachusetts between 1659 and 1681 4 however christmas was and still is celebrated by most christians g some of the most depraved customs of the saturnalia carnival were intentionally revived by the catholic church in 1466 when pope paul ii for the amusement of his roman citizens forced jews to race naked through the streets of the city an eyewitness account reports “before they were to run the jews were richly fed so as to make the race more difficult for them and at the same time more amusing for spectators they ran… amid rome’s taunting shrieks and peals of laughter while the holy father stood upon a richly ornamented balcony and laughed heartily” 5h as part of the saturnalia carnival throughout the 18 thand 19 thcenturies ce rabbis of the ghetto in rome were forced to wear clownish outfits and march through the city streets to the jeers of the crowd pelted by a variety of missiles when the jewish community of rome sent a petition in1836 to pope gregory xvi begging him to stop the annual saturnalia abuse of the jewish community he responded “it is not opportune to make any innovation” 6 on december 25 1881 christian leaders whipped the polish masses into antisemitic frenzies that led to riots across the country in warsaw 12 jews were brutally murdered huge numbers maimed and many jewish women were raped two million rubles worth of property was destroyed iii the origins of christmas customs a the origin of christmas tree just as early christians recruited roman pagans by associating christmas with the saturnalia so too worshippers of the asheira cult and its offshoots were recruited by the church sanctioning “christmas trees” 7 pagans had long worshipped trees in the forest or brought them into their homes and decorated them and this observance was adopted and painted with a christian veneer by the church b the origin of mistletoe norse mythology recounts how the god balder was killed using a mistletoe arrow by his rival god hoder while fighting for the female nanna druid rituals use mistletoe to poison their human sacrificial victim 8 the christian custom of “kissing under the mistletoe” is a later synthesis of the sexual license of saturnalia with the druidic sacrificial cult 9c the origin of christmas presents in prechristian rome the emperors compelled their most despised citizens to bring offerings and gifts during the saturnalia in december and kalends in january later this ritual expanded to include giftgiving among the general populace the catholic church gave this custom a christian flavor by rerooting it in the supposed giftgiving of saint nicholas see below 10d the origin of santa clausa nicholas was born in parara turkey in 270 ce and later became bishop of myra he died in 345 ce on december 6 th  he was only named a saint in the 19 th centuryb nicholas was among the most senior bishops who convened the council of nicaea in 325 ce and created the new testament the text they produced portrayed jews as “the children of the devil” 11 who sentenced jesus to deathc in 1087 a group of sailors who idolized nicholas moved his bones from turkey to a sanctuary in bari italy there nicholas supplanted a female boongiving deity called the grandmother or pasqua epiphania who used to fill the childrens stockings with her gifts the grandmother was ousted from her shrine at bari which became the center of the nicholas cult members of this group gave each other gifts during a pageant they conducted annually on the anniversary of nicholas’ death december 6d the nicholas cult spread north until it was adopted by german and celtic pagans these groups worshipped a pantheon led by woden –their chief god and the father of thor balder and tiw woden had a long white beard and rode a horse through the heavens one evening each autumn when nicholas merged with woden he shed his mediterranean appearance grew a beard mounted a flying horse rescheduled his flight for december and donned heavy winter clothinge in a bid for pagan adherents in northern europe the catholic church adopted the nicholas cult and taught that he did and they should distribute gifts on december 25 th instead of december 6 thf in 1809 the novelist washington irving most famous his the legend of sleepy hollow and rip van winkle wrote a satire of dutch culture entitled knickerbocker history  the satire refers several times to the white bearded flyinghorse riding saint nicholas using his dutch name santa clausg dr clement moore a professor at union seminary read knickerbocker history and in 1822 he published a poem based on the character santa claus “twas the night before christmas when all through the house not a creature was stirring not even a mouse the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in the hope that saint nicholas soon would be there…” moore innovated by portraying a santa with eight reindeer who descended through chimneysh the bavarian illustrator thomas nast almost completed the modern picture of santa claus from 1862 through 1886 based on moore’s poem nast drew more than 2200 cartoon images of santa for harper’s weekly  before nast saint nicholas had been pictured as everything from a stern looking bishop to a gnomelike figure in a frock nast also gave santa a home at the north pole his workshop filled with elves and his list of the good and bad children of the world all santa was missing was his red outfiti in 1931 the coca cola corporation contracted the swedish commercial artist haddon sundblom to create a cokedrinking santa sundblom modeled his santa on his friend lou prentice chosen for his cheerful chubby face the corporation insisted that santa’s furtrimmed suit be bright coca cola red and santa was born – a blend of christian crusader pagan god and commercial idol iv the christmas challenge· christmas has always been a holiday celebrated carelessly for millennia pagans christians and even jews have been swept away in the season’s festivities and very few people ever pause to consider the celebration’s intrinsic meaning history or origins· christmas celebrates the birth of the christian god who came to rescue mankind from the “curse of the torah” it is a 24hour declaration that judaism is no longer valid· christmas is a lie there is no christian church with a tradition that jesus was really born on december 25 th· december 25 is a day on which jews have been shamed tortured and murdered· many of the most popular christmas customs – including christmas trees mistletoe christmas presents and santa claus – are modern incarnations of the most depraved pagan rituals ever practiced on earth many who are excitedly preparing for their christmas celebrations would prefer not knowing about the holiday’s real significance if they do know the history they often object that their celebration has nothing to do with the holiday’s monstrous history and meaning “we are just having fun”imagine that between 193345 the nazi regime celebrated adolf hitler’s birthday – april 20 – as a holiday imagine that they named the day “hitlerday” and observed the day with feasting drunkenness giftgiving and various pagan practices imagine that on that day jews were historically subject to perverse tortures and abuse and that this continued for centuries now imagine that your greatgreatgreatgrandchildren were about to celebrate hitlerday april 20 th arrived they had long forgotten about auschwitz and bergen belsen they had never heard of gas chambers or death marches they had purchased champagne and caviar and were about to begin the party when someone reminded them of the day’s real history and their ancestors’ agony imagine that they initially objected “we aren’t celebrating the holocaust we’re just having a little hitlerday party” if you could travel forward in time and meet them if you could say a few words to them what would you advise them to do on hitlerday on december 25 1941 julius streicher one of the most vicious of hitler’s assistants celebrated christmas by penning the following editorial in his rabidly antisemitic newspaper der stuermer if one really wants to put an end to the continued prospering of this curse from heaven that is the jewish blood there is only one way to do it to eradicate this people this satan’s son root and branch it was an appropriate thought for the day this christmas how will we celebrate
