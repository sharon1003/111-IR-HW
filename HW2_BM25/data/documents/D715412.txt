acute intermittent porphyria back to list of questions question listen what can you tell me about acute intermittent porphyria and chester porphyria answer listen the following information may help to address your question what is acute intermittent porphyria aip what are the signs and symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria aip what causes acute intermittent porphyria aip how is acute intermittent porphyria aip inherited how might acute intermittent porphyria aip be treated what is chester porphyria what are the symptoms of chester porphyria what causes chester porphyria how is chester porphyria inherited how might chester porphyria be treated what is acute intermittent porphyria aip acute intermittent porphyria aip is one of the liver hepatic porphyrias aip is caused by low levels of porphobilinogen deaminase pbgd an enzyme also often called hydroxymethylbilane synthase the low levels of pbgd are generally not sufficient to cause symptoms however activating factors such as hormones drugs and dietary changes may trigger symptoms although most individuals with aip never develop symptoms symptomatic individuals typically present with abdominal pain with nausea treatment is dependent on the symptoms 1last updated 11112015what are the signs and symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria aip some people who inherit the gene for aip never develop symptoms and are said to have latent aip those individuals that present with symptoms usually do so after puberty probably because of hormonal influences although other activating factors include alcohol drugs eg barbiturates steroids sulfacontaining antibiotics  chemicals smoking reduced caloric intake stress and travel symptoms usually last several days but attacks for which treatment is not received promptly may last weeks or months 2 abdominal pain which is associated with nausea and can be severe is the most common symptom and usually the first sign of an attack 1 2 other symptoms may include 1 2 • gastrointestinal issues eg nausea vomiting constipation diarrhea abdominal distention ileus • urinary tract issues eg urinary retention urinary incontinence or dysuria • neurological issues eg muscle weakness in the arms or legs paralysis • psychiatric issues eg insomnia hysteria anxiety apathy or depression phobias psychosis agitation delirium somnolence or coma individuals with aip have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma some develop kidney failure 2last updated 11122015what causes acute intermittent porphyria aip aip is caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called porphobilinogen deaminase pbgd also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase hmbs and formerly known as uroporphyrinogen isynthase 1 the deficiency of pbgd is caused by a mutation in the hmbs gene the hmbs gene is the only gene known to be associated with aip 2 however the deficiency of pbgd alone is not enough to cause aip other activating factors eg hormones drugs dietary changes must also be present 1last updated 11122015how is acute intermittent porphyria aip inherited aip is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion which means only one of the two hmbs genes needs to have a diseasecausing mutation to decrease enzyme activity and cause symptoms 2last updated 11122015how might acute intermittent porphyria aip be treated treatment of aip may vary based on the trigger of the attack and the symptoms present treatment may include stopping medications that cause or worsen the symptoms treating any infections which may be present administration of pain medication monitoring fluid balance andor correcting electrolyte disturbances monitoring neurologic status and administering respiratory support mild attacks can be manged with increased caloric intake and fluid replacement recurrent acute attacks should be managed by a porphyria specialist 2 hospitalization is often necessary 1 panhematin an intravenous medication used to correct heme deficiency may also be prescribed 3 more detailed information about the use of panhematin for the treatment of aip can be found by clicking here last updated 11112015what is chester porphyria chester porphyria is a unique type of porphyria with the signs and symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria aip and the biochemical defects of both aip and variegate porphyria vp  chester porphyria does not conform to any of the recognized types of acute porphyria the symptoms associated with chester porphyria are similar to those observed in other acute porphyrias treatment is symptomatic 4last updated 11122015what are the symptoms of chester porphyria chester porphyria causes the same symptoms common to all acute porphyrias unlike in variegate porphyrias skin sensitivity to light is not a feature of chester porphyria 4 to view a list of symptoms seen in chester porphyria click here last updated 11122015what causes chester porphyria genetic studies have linked chester porphyria to a gene located on the long q arm of chromosome 11 4 some of the activating factors include 4 • drugs eg barbiturates aluminum hydroxide tricyclic antidepressants alcohol • smoking • surgery • metabolic abnormalities such as low levels of sodium  hyponatremialast updated 11122015how is chester porphyria inherited although the gene that causes chester porphyria has not been identified the condition is believed to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner 4last updated 11122015how might chester porphyria be treated the goal of management is to avoid activating factors treatment is symptomatic 4last updated 11122015we hope this
