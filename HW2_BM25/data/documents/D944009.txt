pseudoargument a pseudoargument is an argument based on opinions which can be started by both sides and both sides can stimulate the argument i have had many of these types of arguments in my life one pseudoargument is one i used to constantly have with my parents we constantly debated my bed time this is a pseudoargument because it is an argument between to sides which both sides are opinionated and have the ability to further stimulate the argument my parents always wanted me to go to sleep early they felt that if i had more sleep then i would be more willing to wake up in the morning and also to better in school i thought that the amount of sleep i had really didnâ€™t matter and that i could run on about 5 to 6 hours of sleep neither my parents nor i had sufficient evidence to back our claims up besides our opinions of my actions in the end they won because they are the parents and they can easily punish me posted by e money at 224 pm
