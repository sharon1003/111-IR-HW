anesthesia may harm childrens brains study anesthesia before age 3 linked to later mental problems by brenda goodman mafrom the web md archives aug 20 2012  a new study is raising fresh concerns about the use of general anesthesia in young children recent studies have suggested that anesthetic drugs may increase the risk for learning disabilities and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  adhd  but only in kids who are exposed to the drugs several times the new study which is published in the journal pediatrics links even a single dose of anesthesia to later harm however the study does not prove that anesthesia is the cause i dont want to scare parents says researcher lena s sun md a pediatric anesthesiologist at columbia university medical center in new york if children need to have surgery you need to weigh all the risks and all the benefits in terms of what you need to do sun says anesthesia study the new study is based on data from nearly 2900 children in australia followed by researchers since before they were born parents reported that 321 children in the study had medical procedures that required general anesthesia before age 3 the other 2287 children werent exposed to the drugs continue reading belowyou might like when the children were 10 researchers tested how well they could learn think remember reason and use language doctors also asked questions about their behavior and any problems like depression or aggression kids who were given anesthesia before age 3 were more likely to have learning problems by age 10 than other children children who got anesthesia as toddlers for example werent able to use language as well as their peers they also had more trouble solving problems there could be other explanations children who need surgery early in life might have other medical conditions that hurt their brain development in some way but the researchers say they dont think thats the case since most procedures performed in the study were minor those included common childhood surgeries including inserting ear tubes to help kids with chronic ear infections hernia repairs circumcisions removing a childs tonsils and dental procedures even after accounting for things that are known to have an impact on brain development such as moms education low birth weight and household income exposure to anesthesia was still linked to the likelihood that a child would have difficulty using language children exposed to anesthesia were more than twice as likely to have a language disability in particular it increased the chance that a child would have trouble listening to and remembering spoken words anesthesia was also tied to a 73 increased chance that a child would have trouble with abstract reasoning multiple exposures to anesthesia further raised a childs risk for problems the researchers found no link between anesthesia and behavioral problems or attention however1 2 3 view all
