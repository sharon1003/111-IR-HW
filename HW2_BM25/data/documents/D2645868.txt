purchased through our links to retailer sites we hate to break it to you but closing out of your open apps doesn’t save battery life what you actually need is an external battery pack especially if you’re someone who constantly forgets to charge your devices or if you just live life on the edge and always have a low battery external battery packs are small rechargeable lithiumion batteries enclosed in a durable plastic shell most have one or two usb type a ports which is what youre probably used to for charging your gadgets but some use the newer usb typec charging standard thats found on the nintendo switch and newer android smartphones like the samsung galaxy s9 and google pixel 2 some even have builtin usb or lightning charging cables so you can easily juice up your devices but most require you to use your existing charging cables because pretty much all of todays smartphones lack a userreplaceable battery an external battery pack is a musthave mobile accessory  because who honestly wants to be huddled up against a charging outlet at an airport speaking of flying just so you know the faa says lithiumion batteries like these have to be carried in carryon baggage and cant be in your checked baggage we’ve researched hundreds of portable batteries to find the best most powerful and fastest ones you can buy after narrowing our findings down we tested them to find the best battery for your needs and budget these top picks will ensure youll never hover around 1 again learn more about our top picks1 anker power core 13000portable phone charger check price best overall anker buy now pro large capacity battery small portable size con doesnt have integrated charging cables bottom line hands down the anker power core 13000 is one of the most reliable portable and powerful batteries you can buy advertisement  continue reading below the anker power core 13000 is the goldilocks of portable batteries its not too small its not too big and its size and capacity are just right the battery has two usb ports and its powerful enough to recharge some smartphones up to five times so if you forget to charge the battery on your charger — which you will — youll be ok itll still have juice to recharge your smartphone when you forget to charge that too it took us an hour and fifteen minutes to charge an i phone x during our tests the battery when fully charged is even powerful enough to give a mac book an additional 60 of power of course thats assuming you have a newer usbc equipped mac book speaking of usbc anker sells the battery with a usbc or microusb input for recharging it which takes five hours although we would have liked to see an integrated charging cable with this external battery pack its a shortcoming were willing to forgive considering the power core 13000s portability and powerfulness the battery is about the size of a deck of cards weighs less than a pound and is strong enough to recharge an i pad 15 times specs overview2 jackery bolt battery pack  check price best for i phones jackery buy now pro has integrated charging cables con its integrated flashlight isnt very bright bottom line the jackery bolt is one of the best batteries you can buy to recharge your i phone in a pinch the jackery bolt is the most versatile portable battery you can buy the only reason it wasnt named our best overall pick is because it was larger and heavier than the anker power core 13000 despite having a slightly smaller capacity however what the anker lacks is integrated charging cables which the bolt has on one side of the bolt youll find a microusb cable for charging your android smartphone tablet or pair of wireless headphones and the other has your choice of a lightning or usbc cable the 2inch cables tuck away neatly when youre not using them it also has an additional usb output so technically you could charge three devices simultaneously without issue theres a small blue led flashlight on its side too but it isnt very bright at just 4 inches tall and an inch thick the battery pack is about the size of a pointandshoot camera its still small enough to pocket but itll leave a noticeable bulge in your jeans jackery does make a smaller and more portable battery pack thats about an inch less wide however that model has a smaller 6000 m ah capacity compared to this ones 10050 m ah which provides enough juice to recharge a smartphone up to four times or fully recharge a tablet once during our testing we found that the bolt fully recharges an i phone x in an hour and a half it takes 5 hours to recharge the bolt with the included microusb cable and an apple 12w usb power adapter specs overviewadvertisement  continue reading below3 ravpower 26800m ah pdportable phone charger check price best big battery ravpower buy now pro powerful enough to recharge a nintendo switch or a laptop con at almost 7 inches long this battery wont fit in a pocket bottom line if youre willing to sacrifice a small size for a more powerful battery we think the ravpower is the best big battery you can buy although this external battery isnt the biggest you can buy we think if youre in search for a large portable battery pack this is the one to get its 26800 m ah capacity is huge you can charge a tablet and two smartphones with room to spare or a smartphone each day for over a week during our testing we were able to recharge a nintendo switch 35 times before it ran out of juice the battery is the size of a texas instruments graphing calculator and it weighs one pound its equipped with two standard usb ports as well as a 30w typec output which can be used to power or recharge a laptop you have the choice to recharge the battery with an included microusb cable or using the typec port if you pick the latter method youll save several hours usbc takes just 45 hours compared to 10plus hours with a microusb cable but youll need a a power adapter which is an additional expense fortunately a usbc to usbc cable is included this battery will definitely come in handy for power outages international flights road trips or camping it doesnt disappoint specs overview4 anker power core slim 5000 battery packcheck

a halfinch thick making it pocketfriendly best of all it offers up a large 10000 m ah capacity thats enough juice to recharge a smartphone around four times additionally the mi power bank supports qualcomm’s quick charge 30 so you can potentially recharge your phone battery from 0 to 80 in just 35 minutes the battery which weighs just 7 ounces has one usb port theres also a usbc port on board but sadly thats only for recharging the battery itself — so you cant connect it to another usbc device like the nintendo switch or a mac book the battery takes 35 hours to recharge it comes with a convenient dual microusbusbc cable for recharging and a 1year warranty specs overviewmore of our top picks just because they didnt make our top five doesnt mean theyre not worth shopping these next few portable battery packs will still get the job done6 mophie powerstation accharger  check price best splurge mophie buy now pros has enough juice to fully charge a mac book con expensive bottom line the mophie powerstation ac sports a sophisticated design and it packs plenty of power and ports to charge all your devices the mophie powerstation ac is a highend portable battery pack that was just announced at ces 2018 its about the size of a paperback book but it weighs much more — almost 2 pounds we love its modern durable design and cloth exterior that keeps it free from scratches plus it offers a generous capacity of 22000 m ah and its capable of 100w ac output meaning its the perfect external battery for powerhungry devices like a laptop or a tablet you can charge devices through its 3prong ac adapter its single 24a quickcharge usba port or with the builtin usbc port were glad to see that the usbc port features 30w usbpd a standard thats necessary to fastcharge devices like the nintendo switch or an i phone x during our testing we found that it delivers impressive performance you can charge an i phone x eight times with it a 12inch mac book twice or a 13inch mac book pro once that equates to over 10 additional hours of battery life on a laptop charging speeds vary depending on which port you use but we found that this is one of the fastest batteries you can buy best of all it only takes 3 hours to fully recharge if youre using a usbc to usbc cable and a power adapter good news theres a usbc to usbc cable included our only complaint is that the battery has a builtin fan that can be a little loud fortunately it only kicks in when youre using the ac port but wed choose a slightly noisy fan over a dead battery any day specs overviewadvertisement  continue reading below7 anker power core speed 20000 pdcheck price best for the nintendo switch anker buy now pro portable size con only comes in black bottom line great for gamers who want a portable battery powerful enough to recharge a nintendo switch or usbc laptop the nintendo switch requires a hefty 15v26a to charge and although weve listed a handful of portable battery packs capable of reaching these metrics we think the anker power core speed 20000 pd is the best battery for the switch the nintendo switchs biggest selling point is its portability because it offers entertainment in any environment thanks to its small size so we dont think youll want a large external battery to lug around with your switch measuring about an inch thick 65 inches tall 25 inches long and weighing in at 13 ounces we wouldnt call the anker power core speed 20000 pd small however we still think its portable — especially in comparison to other usbc pd battery packs and its easy to toss in a backpack we also gave it higher marks because it comes with a usb typec to typec cable and a wall charger — a rarity among battery packs most just come with a charging cable but no wall charger these two accessories can be used to not only charge the battery which takes about 3 hours but also to plug your devices into an outlet too as youd expect this battery is not only compatible with the nintendo switch it has a single usba port and a usbc port its generous 20100 m ah capacity is large enough to charge a smartphone fives times a usbc laptop once and a tablet twice specs overview8 life proof

capacity is just 10000 m ah which is small for its size bottom line this is a durable waterproof and reliable battery pack thatll definitely come in handy for camping this external battery pack from life proof can handle whatevers thrown your way because its water drop and dirtproof while we wouldnt recommend mixing electricity and water our tests did prove that the battery is in fact waterproof — just as long as the door that protects its charging ports is closed the battery can be submerged in 2 meters of water for an hour we also dropped the battery into 6 inches of wet snow and it worked perfectly fine the batterys large 10000 m ah capacity will keep your smartphone or tablet charged and ready to go its the perfect external battery for camping because it has a builtin flashlight and it comes with a lanyard that makes it easy to travel with not to mention its lightweight and small enough to toss in a small bag the battery is about the size of an i phone 8 plus just much thicker we were excited to see that it has four bright leds two of them shine white the others red if you press a button there are different intensities of white and a steady or flashing red light this feature would especially come in handy during roadside emergencies or camping you can expect the battery to charge a smartphone four times and a tablet once specs overviewrelated take a look at our favorite
