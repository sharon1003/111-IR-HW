420make your own gummy candydesserts food sweet by laura gummerman so we are a little bit obsessed with gummy candy in my house well by “we” i actually mean my husband who loves it enough for two or maybe three people we had a candy table at our wedding reception and made sure it was wellstocked with all the gummy candy varieties necessary for the event recently i started wondering if it was possible to make my own gummy candy or if it was the type of candy process that involves beakers candy thermometers and a physics degree from harvard to figure out i tested out a few of the easiest recipes i could find and thankfully it is totally possible to easily make gummy candy at home—no degree required some of the recipes weren’t flavorful enough and some didn’t quite have the right texture for me if there’s not enough gelatin it feels like eating a jello jiggler rather than a gummy but perseverance and many boxes of jello later i found a way that totally gets the job done gummy candy makes 2 trays of large letter gummiesslightly adapted from skip to my lou’s homemade gummi candy23 cup cold water 4 packets of unflavored gelatin 2 boxes of flavored jello 3 oz boxes silicon molds i used this alphabet tray and lip trayoptional koolaid packet of same flavor for a more intense flavor sugar citric acid in a glass measuring cup start with 23 cup cold water slowly pour in your unflavored gelatin while stirring briskly so the gelatin doesn’t clump together once the gelatin is poured add your jello packets while again continuing to stir the mixture allow the mixture to sit for 510 minutes until it starts to thicken it will kind of be the consistency of jelly once it has set up a bit boil some water in a pot bring the water down to a simmer and place the glass measuring cup in the water i found that it was really easy to burn the mixture when it was poured directly into a pan so doing it this way protects the mixture and allows it to heat up slowly let the mixture warm and thin out over about 5 minutes stirring often until it’s much thinner and more liquidy it should be more like a syrup remove the measuring cup and pour the liquid into your molds use a pot holder if the handle is too warm place the gummies in the fridge they should be set in about 20 minutes gently stretch the silicon mold in opposite directions around the gummy before pushing the mold inside out to remove now you can either leave your gummies plain or you can mix together a little citric acid into sugar and dip the gummies into that for a sour gummy twist for some reason the sour sugar will eventually start to melt on top of the gummy so i would dip them right before you eat them if the flavor of the jello isn’t intense enough for you add a small koolaid packet in a similar flavor when you add the jello to the mixture keep the gummies in an airtight container in the fridge and they should last for up to a week i love that i can now make my own gummy candy and personalize it for whatever occasion is coming up plus with the abundance of silicon molds you can create gummies out of any mold you can find and choose your own color and flavor if you ask me i think that’s pretty…well…sweet xo laura credits author and photography laura gummerman photos edited with a beautiful mess actions  print gummy candy ingredients23 cup cold water4 packets of unflavored gelatin2
