will also be the teams general manager i think dave is a great football coach and i think people are going to find out how great a coach he is johnson said when you get right down to it i think he is a better football coach than what i am hes got the passion for the game he loves dealing with the players i really believe hes going to give them the spark to make this organization better eddie j jones the dolphins president said johnson first indicated his latest desire to retire two weeks ago when he told jones and h wayne huizenga the teams owner i dont think i can do this anymore huizenga then told jones to assemble a list of candidates to succeed johnson the list reached about 20 names jones said but wannstedt was the only candidate to be interviewed and that did not take place until today huizenga who was able to talk johnson out of retirement last year met with his coach early this morning but it was a brief conversation its final wayne johnson said by 9 am johnson had an emotional meeting with his players telling them how close they were to being a genuine super bowl contender and emphasizing the importance of securing a firstround playoff bye to reach the super bowl you could have heard a pin drop cornerback jerry wilson said he was really talking from the heart next huizenga and wannstedt met with jones sitting in dave was so impressive with wayne jones said he didnt say well maybe we might be able to do this or that he said we can do this this and this right now waynes a very decisive guy himself at some point he stuck out his hand and said weve got a deal huizenga and jones cited the continuity that wannstedts hiring provides the dolphins were not stepping back and retooling jones said were moving on while johnson will no longer work for the team he said he would be available to help in a range of roles including talent evaluation well be calling him wannstedt said with a laugh were not going to let him lay around down there in the keys and gain 20 pounds at several points during his news conference johnsons voice quivered particularly when he described his coaching career as 35 great years he left with his wife rhonda without giving reporters a chance to ask about his strained relationship with marino johnson tried in vain to remold the passhappy marino into part of a more runoriented and less turnoverprone offense but he discovered the perils of coaching a legend even after marino threw 17 interceptions this season and contributed to the dolphins remarkable drubbing by the jacksonville jaguars on saturday many fans continued to side with marino over his coach wannstedt said he would probably meet with marino the n f ls career passing leader within several weeks to determine whether he wants to keep playing im not sure where his thoughts are wannstedt said dan and i will talk about the whole scope of the offense the team where were going and dan will make that decision were not going to pressure him into doing anything hes meant too much to dolphins fans over the years all over the country not to respect him with his decision marino is scheduled to count almost 6 million against miamis salary cap next season if he were to retire or be released the teams cap maneuverability would zoom to nearly 12 million a tantalizing prospect for the next freeagent auction wannstedt after immersing himself in all phases of the dolphins for a year believes he has the organization around him that he lacked in chicago he just didnt have the support there jones said he was trying to do it all here he doesnt have to and in him we think we have a terrific person who knows a lot about coaching and a lot about people someone who can keep us moving down the right road
