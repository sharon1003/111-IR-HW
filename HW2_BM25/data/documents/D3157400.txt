blac chyna wants full custody of dream kris jenner laughsby emily trainham at march 8 2017 1105 am  comments remember back when rob kardashian and blac chyna were really going strong and we all thought for sure that theyd make it oh wait that never happened their relationship was always dramatic and unhealthy and ridiculous and it was a miracle it lasted as long as it did oh yeah thats right but while no one ever thought that rob and chyna would stand the test of time we didnt want to imagine that theyd get into some big nasty custody battle over their threemonth old baby dream unfortunately it looks like thats how things are going to go down we heard last month that if rob and chyna cant come to an understanding on a fair custody arrangement for dream then kris jenner would  fight tooth and nail for rob to get full custody  and well the fight is coming according to a source close to chyna who spoke with radar chyna is definitely planning on going for full custody dream is her child the source says and she wants to have her all of the time she can have supervised visits with rob but chyna is the main parent the issue is that she doesnt think rob can ever get his sht together which on one hand is definitely fair but on the other hand rob is still her father and its undeniable that hes been pretty much living for her since she was born while chyna seems to be certain that dream belongs with her and only her shes afraid of fighting kris in court kris has money and power and chyna doesnt think she could win against all of that also she really wants to do more of their show so shes afraid that if she does too much to fight the family that she will have her money from that cut off it sounds like chyna has good reason to be afraid  a kardashian insider is also speaking out and if chyna wants a custody battle then thats what shes going to get kris thinks that the fact that blac chyna wants to go after full custody of dream is just hilarious the source claims she would obviously never allow that to happen kris lawyers are way too powerful were sure that kris has some mighty powerful lawyers but chyna also shouldnt underestimate rob whos made it exceedingly clear that being a father is his number one dream job these days he seems to enjoy being a dad even more than he enjoys making designer socks what were saying is that he wont give up custody easily and with kris and his huge famous family on his side chyna may not be ready for the fight thats coming her way it would be some delicious drama if it wasnt for that sweet innocent baby in the middle of it all blac chyna and rob kardashian a turbulent timeline of doom start gallery share tweet email
