sports basketball what kind of money do professional international basketball players make i am wondering how much players can make playing overseas or in places like mexico and canada also what is the competition like in these areas compared to ncaa d2 and d3 update thanks for no help everyone first of all allen iverson doesnt make 45 mil yr he just got a new contract for 76 in 4 yrs simple math is 764  19yr also i know mexico and canada are not overseas that is why i clearly said in places overseas or in mexico or canada hence the or they also show more follow 5 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer in my part of the world eastern europe specifically the balkans the star player on the team gets a good 300k a year but dont be fooled by that number because you can do alot more with a dollar in eastern europe than you can in the united states a person whos payed 300k in east europe can live like a millionaire in the us when it comes to competition i dont know how to compare because of the different style of play think about this one of the better bosnian centers is entering the nba draft this year and hes expected to get picked late 2nd round that might help you then again it depends where you want to go and what style of play you prefer in germany youll get paid more than in poland but the competition is greater so the pay has to be better too i hope i answered your question if you have any questions about basketball in europe just ask me and i think i can help laissez faire · 1 decade ago0 0 comment askers rating there is a very wide range there first of all if its something you want to do get into  there are agents that represent guys that are looking to go overseas in some places they play for very little  and its not entirely rare to get screwed by a team and never get your paycheck  especially if you dont have an agent another thing that makes it more difficult is that most of these teams only allow 2 americans per squad but i think they are increasing that number there are also different levels over there  just about each country in europe has at least 2 or 3 leagues players on the lower level teams probably make about 2030000 a year for about 89 months of work in the upper levels the amount can get up to above 6 digits but even the best americans that start out over there have to work their way up the ladder also there is an incredibly high turnover rate for players  i know of several good d1 players that have been dropped by teams overall i would say that the most of the americans playing over there are generally d1 or d2 guys that were either allleague in smaller conferences or just normal players for bigname schools remember the journey · 1 decade ago0 0 comment well first off canada and mexico are not overseas and secoundly you get paid by how much they think you deserve how much potential you have there is no fixed salary and kevin garnett doesnt make anything compared to shaquille oneal and allen iverson25 million a year kg makes 18 millionroots above branches below · 1 decade ago0 0 comment kevin garnett makes about 21 million dollars a year shaq makes about 20 million dollars a year kobe bryant makes about 18 million dollars a yearocean · 1 decade ago0 0 commentthey dont play for money they usually play for food or their freedom so that makes the competition fierce which is why they play so much harder than americans source s15 yrs following international basketball5k1dr0w · 1 decade ago0 2 commentmexican basketball maryanne m · 3 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these graphic design degrees should you donate your car need a dui attorney get an mba while working
