therapy to treat cancer is based on the observation that receptors for specific hormones that are needed for cell growth are on the surface of some tumor cells hormone therapy can work by stopping the production of a certain hormone blocking hormone receptors or substituting chemically similar agents for the active hormone which cannot be used by the tumor cell different types of hormone therapies are categorized by their function andor the type of hormone that is affected the growth of prostate cancer is stimulated by male hormones androgens  testosterone decreasing the production of these hormones is critical in helping men fight prostate cancer androgens are primarily made by the testicles and adrenal glands however in men with advanced prostate cancer the metastatic tumors themselves have the capability to produce testosterone generally prostate cancer responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels many androgen deprivation therapies decrease androgen production by the testicles but do not affect androgen production elsewhere in the body such as the adrenal glands or in the tumor abiraterone acetate works in a different manner than other androgen deprivation therapies abiraterone acetate interferes with an enzyme that is expressed in testicular adrenal and prostatic tumor tissues and is required as part of the body’s androgen producing process because of this interference the amount of androgens produced are decreased abiraterone acetate blocks androgen production at three sources the testes the adrenal glands as well as from the tumor itself note we
