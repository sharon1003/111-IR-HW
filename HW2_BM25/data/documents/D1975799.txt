science  mathematics astronomy  space how often does a location on our moon experience a high tide i know a location on the earth experiences a high tide twice a daybut does the moon experience the same amount update the choices are a once per day b twice per day c once per month d twice per month follow 5 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer garys answer is closest to the truth so far its misleading to talk about tides on a body that has no oceans thats sort of like talking about tides on a pond on earth there are no tides on the moon however if the moon did have a global ocean it would have two high tides per month the tidal effect of earths gravity would maintain a continuous high tide on the side facing earth and the side opposite earth with a continuous low tide along the limb of the moon as seen from earth those tides wouldnt change appreciably because of tidal locking the same side of the moon is always toward earth with minor libation due to the elliptical orbit high tides would occur on opposite sides along the line of the gradient of the suns gravity when earth observers see a new moon or a full moon the sides near and away from earth would have high tide when earth observers see a half moon the side near and away from earth would have low tides philip j · 8 years ago0 1 comment askers rating no it does not the earths tides move primarily because of the rotation of the earth this means different sections of the earth are in position to feel a tide from the moon because the earth rotates into those positions the moon however does not rotate with respect to the earth it is what is known as tidally locked this means the moon revolves in the same time it takes to orbit the earth because of this the same side of the moon is always facing the earth this is where the phrase dark side of the moon comes from no human until the space age had ever seen the other dark side of the moon so that means that as the moon goes around the earth it feels the same tide at the same spots at all times if there were oceans on the moon the same parts would be high tide all the time and other parts would be low tide all the time edit i dont know who made this question up presumably a teacher but that teacher is wrong the moon does not feel variable tides because it is tidally locked trust me look it up it is tidally locked and so any point on the moon always feels the same tide as it always has the tides dont change on the moon anyone giving you an answer is wrong because none of those answers are right if you dont believe me check out the wiki page on the tidal locking of our moon httpenwikipediaorgwikitidallocki source s astrophysics majorpermeative pedagogy · 8 years ago2 2 commentc once per lunar cycle which is close to a month on earth the tides are produced by the sun and the moon since the moon rotates with respect to the sun about every 28 or so days but not the earth then this is what what would cause the tides its relationship to the sun you dont need oceans to have tides and we see at least some of the dark side of the moon unless it is full it is the far side we can not see from earth tom s · 8 years ago0 2 commentd twice per month all due to the sun not the earth this assumes high tide is defined the same way as on earth but since there are no oceans on the moon you could define it some other way gary · 8 years ago0 1 commentnicely our earth reviews tides by using moon the moon would not have water for the tides to take place and our moon would not spin on a axis so that would desire to propose if it have been to have the water for a tide then it could have a severe tide on the two components of the moon the ingredient dealing with us and the ingredient thats no longer dealing with us and thats it yet placed in simple terms im ninety 9 constructive your answer is 4alterma · 1 year ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these earn your mba online find the best luxury cars find moving container services want to build a free website
