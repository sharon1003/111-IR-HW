investment properties in canada buying an investment property is a popular option for canadians looking at different ways to invest their money however unlike the mortgage you took out on your principal residence financing an investment property is a little more complex the number of units in the building and whether or not youll be occupying one of the units are the two major components that control what your financing will look like let’s take a look at how investment property mortgages work in canada investment property mortgages when you start shopping around for an investment property the first thing you need to consider is the number of units your building will have most buildings with 14 units are zoned residential so the qualification criteria and financing options from lenders are only slightly more difficult than that of a mortgage similar to what you have on your principal residence however buildings with 5 or more units are zoned commercial so a lender would require that you take out a commercial mortgage on it with a commercial mortgage the qualification criteria is even tougher to meet and interest rates are often much higher if its a multiunit property the second thing to consider is if you the owner will be living in one of the units or not if you will be occupying one of the units the property would be considered owneroccupied if all of the units will be rented out your property would be considered nonowner occupied the major difference between the two is how much of a down payment you need to make down payment maximum amortization period mortgage default insurance since april 19th 2010 canadians have been required to make at least a 20 down payment on nonowner occupied investment properties use the following chart to see the minimum down payment both owner and nonowner occupied investment properties require units owneroccupied down payment max loantovalue12 yes 5 9512 no 20 8034 yes 10 9034 no 20 80as you can see nonowner occupied investment properties require at least a 20 down payment however if you plan on living in one of the units you can put down as little as 510 depending on the total number of units in your property as of february 15th 2016 if the purchase price is over 500000 the minimum down payment for owneroccupied properties is equal to 5 of the first 500000 plus 10 of any amount over 500000 calculate your investment property mortgage payment thinking about buying an investment property let ratehubca help you calculate your monthly mortgage payment use calculator investment property mortgage rates so long as you meet the qualification criteria and can make at least the minimum down payment on your investment property you should qualify for the same mortgage rates and terms as you see on our site – these include fixed variable and adjustable rate mortgages it’s important to note however that some smaller lenders don’t offer investment property mortgages at all  that is unless you are going to occupy one of the units if you can find a smaller lender to work with be prepared for them to add a small premium to the mortgage rate such as 030 per cent mortgage rates qualification criteria debt ratios bank vs mortgage broker below are todays best mortgage rates for owneroccupied investment properties 14 units with down payments under 20 and maximum amortization period of 25 years closed mortgage rates term fixed1yr269  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates2yr299  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates3yr284  butler mortgage 330get this rate compare all rates4yr329  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates5yr299  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates6yr349  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates7yr339  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates10yr384  can wise financial a ratehub company 1435get this rate compare all rates term variable3yr245 prime  100mortgage intelligence 28get this rate compare all rates5yr215 prime  130butler mortgage 330get this rate compare all rates references and notes if you put down 20 or more you may qualify for up to a 30year amortization period however this will add 025 to your premium its also important to note that a number of financial institutions don’t offer investment property mortgage products
