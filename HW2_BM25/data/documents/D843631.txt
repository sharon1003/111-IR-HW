can i give my dog fat3 amazing comments there’s a lot of confusion about feeding furry friends fat this is partially because there are many different types it’s confusing whether it is good or bad for your dog really depends providing meat offcuts or pure lard cannot be compared to feeding the kind of fat that’s in processed junk foods supplementing a dog with omega 3 and 6 fatty acids is another scenario the truth is that kidney failure liver damage or pancreatic problems are possible if you overdo it that said your dog can actually handle more fat derived from meat sources than you cancan i give my dog fat answer yes in moderation it’s more important for canines to receive meat protein than the fat trimmings but moderate fat consumption will be beneficial for your dog a healthier coat and skin may be noticeable just don’t go overboard pancreatitis can develop fat is also difficult to digest for some dogs of course avoid trans fats you don’t have to worry about saturated fat too much unlike humans dogs aren’t nearly as susceptible to heart disease high cholesterol and other coronary risks natural vs processed most fats are okay for dogs a small amount of steak fat and beef fat are suitable examples even a bit of grease and tallow from rendered fat won’t be harmful if it’s a modest amount and only occasionally given this doesn’t mean that fat makes a meal lean meat is better than lots of fat but controlled amounts here and there is fine always avoid junk foodfats in fact forget feeding your dog processed products fat in a k9 diet some fat is necessary for a balanced diet it doesn’t have to be bad for your dog just strike the right balance be selective about what fats are eaten especially if human snacks or leftovers are shared premium dog food is the easiest way to consistently provide the right nutrients a healthy diet that has enough fat can include quality kibble wet dog food and fish a few times a week tip salmon and tunaare great due to the omega3 fatty acids what we recommend feed fresh foods because fat becomes rancid rather quickly look into a raw diet muscle fat raw bones and meat are all natural for dogs to eat don’t be too concerned with monounsaturated versus polyunsaturated etc focus instead on a balance of plantbased and meatbased fat dha and epa are the best omega3 fats you can get a quality dogformulated supplement to accomplish this fido feasting on fat suppose your dog has wolfed down a block of lard or a lot of pure fat how dangerous it is it’s hard to say but symptoms can be revealing digestive trouble is more likely than a serious medical problem a single occurrence probably hopefully won’t damage the dog’s liver or kidneys you may want to call the vet and discuss the situation just to be on the safe side conclusion on fat feed your dog fat in moderation meat’s benefits come from protein first and fat secondarily serious problems can result from excessive canine consumption pancreatitis is a top concern for dogs be selective which means no fat from processed foods add your own answer to the question is fat bad for dogs below was this article helpful yes no
