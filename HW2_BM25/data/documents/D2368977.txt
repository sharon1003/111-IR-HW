union pacific railroad primarily to increase ridership on u p passenger trains in the west the success of the 1932 winter olympics in lake placid new york spurred an increase in participation in winter sports and alpine skiing in particular a lifelong skier harriman determined that america would embrace a destination mountain resort similar to those he enjoyed in the swiss alps such as st moritz and davos during the winter of 1935–36 harriman enlisted the services of an austrian count felix schaffgotsch to travel across the western u s to locate an ideal site for a winter resort the count toured mount rainier mount hood yosemite the san bernardino mountains zion rocky mountain national park the wasatch mountains pocatello jackson hole and grand targhee areas late in his trip and on the verge of abandoning his search for an ideal location for a mountain resort development he backtracked toward the ketchum area in central idaho a u p employee in boise had casually mentioned that the rail spur to ketchum cost the company more money for snow removal than any other branch line and the count went to explore schaffgotsch was impressed by the combination of bald mountain and its surrounding mountains adequate snowfall abundant sunshine moderate elevation and absence of wind and selected it as the site harriman visited several weeks later and agreed the 3888acre 1573 km 2 brass ranch was purchased for about 4 per acre and construction commenced that spring it was built in seven months for 15 million publicist steve hannagan named the resort sun valley and developed the tag line “winter sports under a summer sun 5  count schaffgotsch returned to austria and was killed on the eastern front during world war ii  the centerpiece of the new resort was the sun valley lodge

brown to imitate wood the swissstyle sun valley inn originally the  challenger inn and village were also part of the initial resort opening in 1937 hannagan wanted swimming pools at the resort so
