live science planet earth mount etna eruptsby brett israel our amazing planet staff writer  january 13 2011 0156pm etmoremount etna put on an explosive show credit boris behncke mount etna the famous sicilian volcano turned on the fireworks wednesday jan 12 as it shot lava hundreds of feet into the air volcanic tremors at mount etna  on the italian island were detected around 2100 gmt 4 pm est on jan 11 the tremors peaked the next morning and lava began erupting at the southeast crater about 4500 feet 1375 meters high the crater pit overflowed with lava and ash plumes spewed into the air which forced a local airport to halt service the ash plumes had stopped by about 330 pm local time today jan 13 according to the italian institute of vocanology ingv citing surveillance cameras observing etna but more eruptions could be on the way scientists said this eruption is very similar to more than 200 episodes of lava fountaining at the summit craters of mount etna including 66 from the southeast crater in the year 2000 said boris behncke a volcanologist and expert on mount etna the same vent that erupted last night already produced nearly identical though longerlasting episodes in september and november 2007 and most recently on may 10 2008 etna is the largest active volcano in europe and one of the worlds most wellknown while 2010 was an exceptionally calm year for etna it is nearly constantly active and there is rarely a full year that passes without some eruptive activity on etna behncke told our amazing planet we expected etna to return to activity in this period behncke said there had been lots of premonitory signals two episodes of much weaker activity at the same vent that erupted last night one on dec 23 2010 and the next on jan 2 and 3 of 2011 suggested that a larger eruption was on the way we expected further episodes at similar intervals and also thought they would get stronger with time behncke said things did accelerate maybe a tiny little bit faster than we had imagined but the evolution was very logical and again very similar to many events in the past etnas lava fountaining may go on for weeks or even months similar to past episodes such as the series of 66 lava fountains during 2000 which lasted seven months behncke said at a height of 10900 feet 3328 meters etna looms over the city of catania as active as the volcano is its not a pressing danger to locals and no damage or injuries were reported or expected from yesterdays eruption etnas most violent eruption was in 1669 when 15000 people were killed the eruption is whats called a strombolian explosion named after the nearby volcano of the same name that has been erupting for hundreds of years bursting gas bubbles within the magma drive these explosions which eject lava tens to hundreds of meters into the air from a single crater these episodes happen every few minutes rhythmically or irregularly the lava fragments volcanic bombs are rounded as they fly through the air the ancient greeks believed mount etna to be the home of vulcan the god of fire to them mount etna erupting merely meant vulcan was forging weapons for mars the god of war reach our amazing planet staff writer brett israel at bisraeltechmedianetworkcom follow him on twitter btisrael ads by revcontent from the web you should never shop on amazon again after seeing this site tophatter think you have a high iq this history quiz says otherwise trendchaser american picker mike wolfes mansion is just plain disgusting miss penny stocks the unusual link between coconut oil and alzheimers memory repair this photo caused an uproar look closer poll hype avoid cleaning gutters for life see how this revolutionary product can help leaf filter
