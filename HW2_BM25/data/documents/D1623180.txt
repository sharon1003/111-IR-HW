26 million by capitol films a production company led by thenhollywood newcomer david bergstein 4 principal photography began in april 2008 5 that month james caan dropped out of the film after creative differences over his characters death scene 6 production was shut down frequently—as many as 14 times—for nonpayment of the cast and crew leading to walkouts by stars biel and gyllenhaal as well as several crew members 7 bergstein attributed the films financial woes to the 2008 financial collapse but the filmmakers believed they were being intentionally squeezed in a dispute over control of the film and to prevent the possibility of capitol releasing an unpolished version of the film wick and fisher decided to withhold film negatives and postpone shooting the crucial sequence in which biels character is injured with a nail gun until the final day of filming as a result of one of the unions pulling support for the film with only two days left to shoot the sequence was not shot and the film was left incomplete 4in early 2010 the films financier ronald tutor who controlled the films rights along with bergstein paid millions of dollars to get several films including nailed out of a foreclosure action bergstein hired an editor to assemble a cut of the film that was shown to russell when he was asked to return and film reshoots russell and tutor were unable to strike a deal and russell permanently left the production in july according to the hollywood reporter russells primary grievance was wick and fisher being pushed to accept 50 pay cuts the producers who also left the film called the requested concessions unfair unprofessional and detrimental to the movie 3 russell said of quitting the film this has been a painful process for me the multiple production delays and stoppages which were caused by david bergstein and preceded ron tutors direct involvement with me have now spanned two years and the circumstances under which the film would now be completed are much different on several fundamental levels than when we embarked several years ago i unfortunately am no longer involved in the project and cannot call it my film i wish ron tutor well 3 contractual agreements required biel and tracy morgan to film reshoots which did not involve russell 3capitol productions went bankrupt in 2010 and the property was purchased in 2014 by independent distributor millennium entertainment for an undisclosed sum retitled accidental love a cut was assembled under producer kia jam a former executive with capitol who said “people are expecting to see a broken film and it’s not we tried very much to be respectful of the creative forces behind it” 4 with the film set to be released russell negotiated with the directors guild of america to remove his name from the
