how to fix low oil pressure step by step guide on how to troubleshoot and repair low oil pressure this information pertains to all internal combustion engines difficulty scale 5 of 10tools and supplies needed flashlight socket set wrench set screwdrivers cleaner fluid catch basin manual oil pressure gauge protective gloves and eye wear start with the car on level ground in park with the emergency brake set sponsored linksstep 1  to verify the engine oil pressure is low start the engine cold and observe the gauge or light low oil pressure step 2  using the engine oil dip stick check the oil level of the engine and ensure a proper level engine oil step 3  the oil pressure switch is designed to send feedback data to the gauge or computer these switches can go bad causing the gauge or light to show a false reading remove the switch and insert a manual gauge to the engine and restart the engine the gauge should read between 25 and 45 pounds oil pressure switch step 4  the oil pump uses a screen to keep out impurities before entering the pump if this screen becomes plugged with sludge due to lack of maintenance the pump will scavenge causing low pressure engine oil pan removed while turned over sponsored linksoil pump pickup screen step 5  the oil pump is also designed with an oil pressure relief valve and spring which regulates pressure if this valve becomes faulty caused by a broken pressure spring the pump will have low oil pressure oil pressure relief valve step 6  an engine bearing is designed to support the crankshaft and other various engine parts while in motion when these bearings wear they can allow more oil to escape causing low oil pressure this is a sign the engine has worn out and replacement or rebuilding is needed engine bearing step 7  if the engine has no oil pressure suspect the oil pump drive some manufactures use a belt to drive the pump which are prone to failure oil pump drive belt helpful information engine oil is used to cool and lubricate bearing and machined surfaces without oil pressure an engine will experience extreme internal engine damage due to heat caused by friction all engines run on a preset pressure that cannot be adjusted this pressure will vary depending on engine speed temperature and weight oil as a rule of thumb the engine oil pressure gauge shouldnt drop below 14 or exceed 34 pressure of the gauge sponsored linksarticle published 20170126
