also has the unusual feature of the remains of a submerged towpath the riverside colleges did not permit barge horses on the backs so the beasts waded up the cam to the mill pulling their loads behind them access for mechanically powered boats is prohibited above la mimosa pub at the upstream end map 8 of jesus green map 6 between 1 april and 30 september when the middle and upper river are open only to manually propelled craft the most common of these are the flatbottomed punts between 1 october and 31 march powered boats are allowed as far as mill pool but few people take advantage of this as there are very few public mooring places along the backs and the river is too narrow and the bridges too low to afford easy passing or turning for many boats a punt being pulled up rollers on the

tributaries  editthe two principal tributaries of the cam are the granta and the rhee though both are also known as the cam 2rhee  editthe rhee begins just off the high street  ashwell springs  at ashwell in hertfordshire running north out of ashwell it forms the county boundary between bedfordshire and hertfordshire for around two kilometres then the boundary between bedfordshire and cambridgeshire for a further kilometre at this point its course turns east and from here until it merges with the granta it forms the parish boundary between a succession of villages though until it reaches barrington it remains at a distance of around a kilometre from any settlement of any size 2just after flowing under the roman ermine street it crosses the avenue of wimpole hall and a few kilometres later it receives the waters of the minor river mel that runs through meldreth it runs along the southern edge of the village of barrington where it still powers a water mill known as bulbeck mill at harston it passes harston mill the site of a water mill from at least the 11th century until the need for mill died out in the mid20th century and the parish church of all saints 6 it

extensively used for several forms of recreational activity these include angling swimming and various kinds of boating some participants of the annual cardboard boat race on suicide sunday 2012 angling  editthe water is not murky and is clean enough from its source to its confluence with the great ouse to support fish the fishing rights on the west bank are leased annually to the cambridge fish preservation and angling society 9the cam below bottisham sluice may still hold burbot a fish thought to be extinct in english waters since the early 1970s 10 the last known burbot caught in britain was in 1969 on the cam and in 2010 a fisherman reported spotting two in the great ouse 11above hinxton and great chesterford the river holds a stock of wild brown trout though it is also stocked by the audley fly fishers club and other angling societies who own the rights boating  editall boats require a navigation licence 12 from either the conservators of the river cam or the environment agency there are public moorings just below jesus lock on both sides of the river and on the western bank just north of the bridge at clayhithe both with a maximum stay of 48 hours and unofficial moorings on the railings adjoining riverside in cambridge unlimited stay but usually fully occupied which are under review by cambridge city council and likely to be reduced to eight or nine formalised residential moorings or removed altogether 13 the moorings on the commons in cambridge jesus green midsummer common map 5 and stourbridge common are reserved by the city council for

river cam or granta river cam or rheefrom source cambridge had been an inland port due to its location on the river cam prior to the draining of the fens as the university colleges rose in importance the course of the river through the town known as the backs was moved further to the east to accommodate their new buildings a report conducted in 1618 by richard atkyns highlighted the problems caused by sandbanks above clayhithe and watermills obstructing navigation an order made by the parliamentary committee of the association in 1643 regulated use of the river for trade but the biggest change was the construction of denver sluice on the river great ouse which reduced river levels on the lower river as tidal waters were excluded from the ouse both the university and the corporation of cambridge complained to parliament in 1697 that the trade route to the town from kings lynn had been severely impaired 17in 1699 the corporation sought to obtain an act of parliament which would allow them to improve the river from clayhithe to queens mill at cambridge 17 this was obtained on 27 february 1702 18 and created the conservators of the river cam a legal body with authority to charge tolls for use of the river which ranged from four shillings 20p a ton for wine to one penny 04p per person for passengers the conservators of which there were a maximum of eleven had powers to mortgage the tolls in order to raise capital for improvements to the river immediately this they did and built sluices at jesus green chesterton baits bite and clayhithe most of the tolls were collected at clayhithe 17prior to 1722 denver sluice had been destroyed and although cambridge corporation opposed its reconstruction it was rebuilt by 1750 the river entered a period of steady profitability with toll receipts rising from £432 in 1752 to over £1000 by 1803 in 1835 they peaked at £1995 and then declined slightly until 1846 the convervators also raised some revenue from rents on the public houses which they owned adjacent to each of the sluices 17 another act of parliament was obtained on 21 july 1813 18 which allowed the conservators to alter the tolls and charge penalties while the south level act of 1827 created commissioners who had responsibility for the river below bottisham this act also appointed the vicechancellor of the university and the mayor as navigation commissioners the conservators built locks at baits bite and bottisham and removed the sluice at chesterton 17the river was sufficiently profitable that the conservators were able to contribute £400 towards the cost of rebuilding the great bridge now called the magdalene bridge map 9 in 1823 and a further £300 for the rebuilding of the small bridge now silver street bridge in 1841 a year later they constructed a house at clayhithe which cost £880 and included a large room for meetings and banquets just three years later the eastern counties railway reached cambridge and the navigation declined rapidly receipts dropped from £1393 in 1846 to £367 in 1850 and were just £99 in 1898 most commercial carrying on the river had stopped by world war i although banhams operated two steam tugs and three barges until the late 1930s carrying gas water from cambridge gasworks to kings lynn where it was used in the manufacture of fertiliser the last recorded passenger services had ceased nearly 100 years earlier in 1839 and were started again in 2008 with the passenger vessel moored on jesus green 17traffic using the river today consists of private cruisers making the journey to jesus lock with the section above baits bite lock regularly in use by the university rowing clubs both for practice and for races motorised craft can navigate along the backs in winter but headroom is severely restricted the conservators of the river cam now have an office in the former lockkeepers cottage at baits bite while the house at clayhithe is now the residence of the foreman of the conservators the conservators are still responsible for the river above bottisham lock while the lower river has been managed by the environment agency since its creation in 1995 15the three locks are all of different sizes bottisham and baits bite locks are both fully automated with a vertical guillotine gate at the upstream end and traditional mitre gates at the downstream end jesus lock is manually operated and has mitre gates at both ends boat sizes are restricted to 968 ft 295 m by the length of bottisham lock and to 14 ft 43 m by the width of baits bite lock jesus lock is only 97 ft 30 m wide 19 the navigable lodes of reach swaffham bulbeck and bottisham the last of which is no longer navigable can be reached from the river cam flooding  editthe cam left flooding parts of
