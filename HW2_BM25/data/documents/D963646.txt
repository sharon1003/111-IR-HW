insurance subrogation may occur between an insurance company and an individual deemed at fault for the loss it most often occurs between insurance companies for all of the parties involved when an insurance company decides to pursue subrogation it is required by law to notify the insured client before proceeding there are two important reasons for a client to be notified of insurance subrogation activities the insurance company is required by law to attempt to recover their client’s deductible amount as part of its subrogation process if recovered this amount must be refunded to the client the insured client is required to cooperate with the insurance company’s subrogation attempts this may bar him from signing any agreements to release the other party from legal or financial responsibility without first obtaining permission from the insurance company in some circumstances pursuit of subrogation is simply not worth the insurance company’s time or expense if the insurance

a subrogation claim may be submitted the concept of subrogation claims makes the process of obtaining payment under an insurance policy go smoothly in most cases an individual’s insurance company pays its client’s claim for losses directly then seeks reimbursement from the other party or his insurance company the insured client receives payment promptly which is what he pays his insurance company to do then the insurance company may pursue a subrogation claim against he party at fault for the loss a subrogation claim may be submitted if the insured client has a loss that is covered by his insurance policy and another party is responsible or liable for the damages a subrogation claim may also apply when the insured client is at fault for the damages for example tom and john who are backing out of their respective parking spots at the mall simultaneously collide in the middle of the row both men have insurance to cover the loss and both make claims on their policies in such a case it is likely that both drivers will be deemed at least partially at fault both insurance companies may make subrogation claims against one another with each company ultimately paying their respective client’s portion of the other party’s claim waiver of subrogation a waiver of subrogation is an agreement by an insured person to leave his insurance company out of the claim this comes into play when an individual who caused damages wants to settle the matter directly with the other party’s insurance company most settlement agreements in such cases include a waiver of subrogation clause which once signed prevents the individual’s insurance company from stepping in to handle the issue if something goes wrong most insurance companies require their clients to notify them before signing a waiver of subrogation subrogation investigations benefit all in many cases widespread problems of health or safety might never come to public light if it weren’t for subrogation investigations for example in 2000 an insurance investigator at state farm insurance investigated multiple reports of firestone tires on ford vehicles suffering catastrophic failure causing property damage injuries and even deaths the investigator became concerned and reported the events to the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa the nhtsa then contacted both firestone and ford about the large number of failures in certain cases ford’s subsequent investigation into the problem discovered a high failure rate of several 15in firestone tire models most of which were manufactured in firestone’s decatur illinois plant this action led to a recall of certain firestone tire models on certain ford vehicles but more importantly the investigation ended in the closure of firestone’s decatur plant all of this occurred as a result of an insurance subrogation investigation in which the state farm investigator noticed a pattern of losses but the entire public community benefitted from the action taken related legal terms and issues contract – an agreement between two or more parties in which a promise is made to do or provide something in return for a valuable benefit damages – a monetary award in compensation for a financial loss loss of or damage to personal or real property or an injury liable – responsible by law to be held legally answerable for an act or omission negligence – failure to exercise a degree of care that would be taken by another reasonable person in the same circumstances
