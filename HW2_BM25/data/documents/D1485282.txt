fancy these breakfast burritos are not gourmet these breakfast burritos are not haute texmex cuisine these breakfast burritos are exactly that breakfast burritos and i often make them for my husband and kids when they’re at the pens working cattle at breakfast time they’re as simple as it gets…and you know what so am i yep that’s me—simple just give me a remote control a laptop a pedicure a manicure a deep tissue massage a pint of coffee haagen dazs an unlimited shopping spree at b  h a toni collette movie and a stack of archie comic books and i’ll stay out of your hair for at least eight minutes see i’m as simple as they come my point is if you’re looking for fancy chipotleasiagochorizopoblanofancyo breakfast burritos this morning…you’ve come to the wrong wife and mother and i’ve tried that route believe me i’ve tried it the problem is my family—my husband and four spawn—aren’t jiggy wit’ chipotleasiagochirozopoblanofancyo stuff they want it straight up and middleamericano without a lot of adornment but the great thing about this recipe is it’s basic and you can use the basic method to create whatever degree of ampedup breakfast burrito you’re in the mood for as the recipe proceeds i’ll let you know the things i’d add to the mix if i were living in a tiny apartment in chicago by myself just to give you some more ideas let’s hurry this along—they’ve got to be horseback by dawnthe cast of characters flour tortillas browned breakfast sausage breakfast potatoes monterey jack cheese eggs chives seasoned salt pepper and whatever else you want to throw in there let’s rewind for just a second we need to make the make some breakfast potatoes follow my basic recipe for those except this time we’re going to add in some red and green bell peppers you can also use frozen diced potatoes if you’d like but i never have things like that in my freezer when i need ’em basically i sautee coarsely chopped red and green bell pepper over high heat……until the peppers get a tiny bit black remove them from the pan then dice some cooked i boil them until tender but still a bit firm red or russet potatoes throw those in the same pan and cook until brown…then add in the peppers and onions cook for about ten minutes or until nice and golden brown then set aside hello breakfast potatoes i love you…and i always will just sit tight for a moment okay your life’s purpose shall be revealed very shortly now in the same dadgum skillet we ranch wives like to use the same dadgum skillet brown a pound of breakfast sausage when i say “breakfast sausage” i mean pork sausage that’s typically cut into patties and fried for breakfast think jimmie dean think j c potter think that stuff band geeks sell oh how i love band geeks they’re my life note you can use whatever sausage makes your skirt fly up chorizo chorizo would work swimmingly when it’s browned drain off the grease i know i know…that’s not like me but don’t worry i’ll make up for it important side note when you’re cooking with your friend hyacinth and her sevenyearold boy brings a frog into the kitchen don’t panic and don’t throw it in the skillet with the breakfast sausage you’ll regret it don’t do it now crack about a dozen eggs into a bowl or whatever ol’ thing is clean and please don’t panic this recipe can be halved not everybody eats as much as my family…i’m trying to remember that whisk the eggs then add in a bunch of chopped chives some seasoned salt some black pepper and plenty  at least a cup but more is better of grated monterey jack note feel free to also add cayenne pepper tabasco picante sauce cilantro andor another kind of cheese caciotta cheese is quickly becoming my favorite but my family quickly forms a picket line if i add anything weird okay—back to the skillet throw some breakfast potatoes in with the drained sausage…stir well to combine over low heat now pour the eggcheese mixture over the top now the key here is not to overstirovermesswith particularly if you use homemade breakfast potatoes the potatoes will fall apart and become mushy if you stir it around too much frozen diced potatoes hold their shape better just keep the eggs cooking over low heat so they won’t brown and turn them occasionally to cook a few minutes later this is what you’ll have as always check the seasoning to make sure it’s scrumptious enough add in more salt pepper or picante sauce if that suits you the point is to have everything already inside so the hungry can simply unwrap ’em and eat ’em i like to add a ton more cheese at this point but that’s just me to assemble simply spoon a generous portion of the egg mixture into a warm soft flour tortilla and if it were me i’d throw on some more picante or pico de gallo for goodness sake and because i’m rebellious i’d spoon on some green salsa and maybe even a bit of sour cream but these were for my family so i left them well enough alone to roll them up i can hear you saying “duh” you don’t know i can hear you but i do just tuck in the sides…and roll ’em up trying to keep them as tight as possible then i just wrap the little sweethearts in individual sheets of foil and if i’m just walking to the pens by our house i’ll place them in a napkinlined basket then i’ll adjust my hair ribbon and tie a chiffon scarf around my justfixed hair then i’ll wake up another thing you can do if you’re transporting these to a hungry crowd is to simply place them toasty and warm in a small cooler they’ll keep one another warm in the process enjoyrecipe breakfast burritos august 14
