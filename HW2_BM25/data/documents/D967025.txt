issue when searching for apartments if you look at a lot of places you will see some that refer to doubles but have photos of 2 single beds pushed together which is the size of a u s king just not as cozy some will give the size in centimeters where i searched for greater than 150cm width beds habitatapartmentscom in particular often gave the sizes in cms we ended up choosing an apt that had 2 singles pushed together because what we call a double in the u s is too small for us report inappropriate content gigismum toronto canada destination expertfor barcelona level contributor24296

bed sizes in barcelona mar 8 2011 727 amstandard bed sizes here in spain for households is 90cm width for single and 135 or at most 150cm for a double singles at 80cm are possible and in apartments that may be what you get for space reasons sometimes a double bed in spanish is una cama de matrimonio and a double room habitación doble may have that or may have twin beds camas individuales  apartments in europe have a large number of single beds to allow more flexibility in sleeping arrangements i found out that in canada the norm is to put in larger beds rather than singles which complicates things if you have a group that isnt just couples travelling with my brothers family and renting in thousand islands my small niece and nephew ended up sharing a bed possible at ages 3 and 8 but not later on and i went for that rental because it was the best i found having a second toilet whereas lots of places i looked at slept 810 with only one toilet and that in the bathroom not very
