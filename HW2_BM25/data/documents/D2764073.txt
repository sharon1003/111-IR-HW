vrm system quality and design the quality of the vrm system in question and capability of handling processors that require lots of power usually comes down to these things • mosfet amperage rating denotes how many amps each mosfet are capable of there are two mosfets for each phase high side and low side if these mosfets each are rated for a not very high amperage level these may be unsafe to use for higher tdp processors many msi boards lack amperage capability and fail due to over current unfortunately it is not usually obvious what the mosfet amperage rating is on the motherboard and spec sheets will have to be searched and found hence the existance of the amd motherboard vrm information list to inform the user about vrm quality a low quality board can indicate that the mosfets are not rated for enough amperage for higher tdp applications transistors usually have their model no imprinted on them in small print this model no can be searched online to obtain detailed documents describing the capacity of the particular transistor including amperage rating • you can see that mosfets per channel are usually in groups of 3 or 4 usually on a good quality motherboard you will see 2 primary transistors mosfets themselves  1 or more high side transistors and 1 or more low side transistors  and one or two slightly smaller transistors nearby called mosfet drivers some motherboard manufacturers particularly lower end ones that cannot devote as much cost into their motherboard may choose to lower the cost on some motherboards and instead of a proper driver use a third transistor chip this is a sacrifice of quality  reliability while this may be fine esp for lower cpu power applications some boards that use a 3rd transistor driver chip use an improperly sized chip causing problems and failures with high tdp application it is more common that vrm failures occur with such boards note that the driver chips are sometimes integrated with the pwm controller in a not so obvious fashion  so dont fret if you happen to think that they are entirely missing • smaller mosfets are usually always low rds on low rds on fets much more efficient and cooler other style mosfets may also be low rds on but this may not be obvious • although motherboards with higher phase count can use lower quality transistors this does not mean it will supply less current than a lower phase count motherboard with higher quality transistors the higher phase count motherboard would have the additional advantage of higher power delivery efficiency cooler running resulting in lower chance of common failure by overheat • driver mosfets also known as dr mos integrate the mosfets and the driver into one package note that while this can result in more efficiency driver mosfets can be more fragile and failure prone at high voltage and current this is rather noticeable on the intel side of things where most newer driver mosfet boards are failing due to over current usually only during extreme overclocking scenarios the combination of low phase count and driver mosfets on the infamous msi 790fxgd70 and succeeding 890fxgd70 resulted in a board that was particularly known for vrm failures in high amperage scenarios ie phenom ii x6 the msi 890fxagd65 and new 82 msi motherboards have doubled the amount of phases  and driver mosfets  resulting in higher possible amperage capability although these driver mosfet motherboards with larger phase count are still more prone to failures which have happened on these boards the problem is not nearly as rampant as with more phase count each of the driver mosfet can supply less amperage and run under less heat and stress a proper mosfet design will have two primary mosfet chips high side and low side and one or more driver chips mosfets are rated for a certain amperage this may not be obvious and will require searching for spec sheets on the internet for more info hence the existence of the amd motherboard vrm information list to inform the user about vrm quality a low quality board can indicate that the mosfets are not rated for enough amperage for higher tdp applications what vrm cooling will do for you vrm cooling is an important part of keeping vrm temps down vrm cooling is usually placed on the mosfets active transistors that are the most fragile and the hottest often the vrms get little to no air so as much heat radiation as possible would be best what i recommend you do in terms of cooling the vrms and running a high tdp processor • add any sort of vrm heatsink such as mosc1 if there isnt already especially on 41 boards even with quality • add active cooling a small fan or spot cool will do while most vrms will run safe with vrms and no active fan cooling huge temperature drops have been shown from even really weak 40mm fans that dont push much air • improve on case airflow ie add that top fan in the slot above the vrms heat naturally dissipates upward ocn member mdocod has found that as of 3 march 2011 at least 71 of the vrm cooling failure incidents in the compiled list of horror stories have happened on a cooling that deviates from stock cooling this value may be higher due to the amount of situations where cooling was not described stock cpu cooling is designed to blow down onto the motherboard components including vrms this includes tower cooling any sort of water cooling remember tdp rating on all boards is done with processors at stock and with stock cooling that means your 41 phase or even 31 phase on amd platform may actually be fine for a more power consuming ie 125w tdp processor with stock cooling  at stock speed but deviate any one of these and youre on your own motherboard tdp ratings and how they relate to vrm quality a lot of people claim that their boards are rated tdp at 125w140w and its still safe to run that processor on that board not that you should take these ratings with a grain of salt but you should be reminded that all motherboards are ratified in tdp capability with processors at stock speed and with the stock cooler installed note that although tdp has more to do with processor heat output and choice of stock cooler it is closely related to the processors actual power consumption at stock speed you are within that tdp limit and with the stock cooler air blows past the heatsink fins and onto the board so some air gets to the vrm area and other motherboard components for cooling when you overclock youre then exceeding these limits which may bring additional heat and instability into the vrms can be fixable with mosfet heatsinks and fan overclocking is usually associated with aftermarket heatsinks many tower heatsinks that blow over the motherboard this removal of vrm cooling may significantly increase chances of catastrophe at least 70 of all vrm failure incidents happen with aftermarket cpu cooling installed motherboards with lower phase count and lower rated transistors usually have vrm systems that run hotter and are more prone to failure heat causes a lot of vrm problems including unstable power delivery and even fire hazard proper mosfetvrm cooling may help and some boards allow you to monitor vrm temps ie tmpin2 on hwmonitor on some gigabyte boards  for your board it may depend tmpin2 may exist or may not at all and it may not even be vrms though different vrm systems may be rated for temperature differently ideally the temperature should be the same as the cpu load ie my vrms load at around 60 with my cpu tagging along at slightly lower than that typically proper vrm cooling installed will allow for higher tdp capability as the vrms can run under less heat and stress  as a result the tdp is rated higher than usual for stock speed operation my cpu speed is throttling even if it is stone cold over current protection ocp is something i have recently been examining protection features exist against vrm overheatingoverloading depending on motherboard model and brand i believe it is a crucial feature on motherboards today because this is the function that will protect your vrms from a catastrophic failure this is why i have never seen asus boards fail even if people take a lowly 31 asus boards and try to overclock a phenom ii x6 on it asus boards feature this technology it is a part of the pwm controller design ocp can work in various ways one of the ways it works is it downclocks the cpu speed  voltage  via coolnquiet or its own function  if the vrm temperatures are detected as too high similar to if cpu temps are too high until they can recuperate and lower in temperature as a result it can reduce performance during a full load scenario it is also how asus gets away with rating a few select 31 phase amd motherboards at 125w though at times the ocp may kick in too often at load even at stock speedstock cooler and the rating wouldve been slightly improper for the board there is no 31 phase board ready for 125w processors another common way is a full board shutdown if mosfets are overloaded suddenly to the point where immediate shutdown is needed for protection ie beginning an occt run on a 31 power phase on a phenom ii x6 oced and at 15v then ocp will kick in and the board will shut down to protect itself asrock boards and some gigabyte boards are known for this some boards will do this past a certain point others dont ocn members and i have found that most recent msi amd boards feature no protection of any sort against vrm failureover currentover temperature and this is likely why a majority of the catastrophic failures in the horror stories list are msi boards what to do if you suspect your vrms have failed 1 unplug everythingcut power to the pc 2 check for visible damage blown caps missing parts from mobo burn marks this might not always be the case 3 use your sense of smell if they blew itd be pretty obvious to the nose but it might smell really bad 4 put out the fire if theres any 5 run standard troubleshooting procedures to make sure its not anything else ie check the power supply 6 try testing the motherboard with the 24pin plugged in but without the 4pin8pin cpu power plug this is the ultimate dealbreaker if the motherboard only boots when cpu power plug is unplugged though it obviously wont post you sir have a vrm failure on your hands remember not all vrm failures are visible and involve fire  explosions boards will sometimes quietly go with a shutdown and not boot again sometimes vrm failures can take out other parts as with psus and sometimes not
