biggest capital expenditures a building owner or facility manager makes this post builds on one of earlier posts about commercial roof maintenance costs how much does a commercial roof replacement cost one study reports on a roof with average dimensions of 10000 square feet a new commercial roof can cost over 42500 or over 425 per square foot that study also found 80 of the roofs tracked had been replaced before they needed to be in another case the roofing and pavement consulting firm benchmark presented a cost range from retail roofing projects it has examined benchmark reported on a majority of retail roofing projects it has looked at roof replacement costs generally range from 350 to 650 per square foot however the cost depends on whether a project was aiming for roof recovery or consisted of a complete tearoff and replacement job find out how much your project will cost request an onsite exact  fair estimate other sources have reported commercial roof replacement costs can vary from 700 to 1200 per square foot in all of these cases there is one critical thing to keep in mind using an average commercial roof replacement cost for estimating a single project can be problematic since project costs can vary depending upon labor inputs or project complexity however using it to budget for a portfolio of multiple property holdings is far more valuable commercial roof replacement costs over time one wellknown study looked at commercial roof replacement costs over time the study drew upon data collected over a space of 9 years the study concentrated on lifecycle costs for low slope commercial roofs that were chosen from among 100000 square meters of roofing on 38 buildings owned by carnegie mellon university or 108 million square feet of commercial roofing on 38 buildings approximately this overall roofing network ranged from newlyinstalled roofing systems to roofing systems over 50 years old the entire network was valued at between 22 million and 32 million when an average roof replacement cost of 215 to 323 per square meter costs accumulated over 9 years was used all of the buildings were located within pittsburgh pennsylvania which made them subject to the same climate conditions and some other variables all of the roofs had insulation installed under them that met the requirements set by local climate conditions the low slope commercial roofs were chosen because they were the most prone to leaking problems the researchers also said low slope epdm and sbs modified bitumen roofs could be considered representative of the data used in this study carnegie mellon university roof study results pros  cons of various roofing systems from july 1998 to december 2006 the university’s database for the entire roof network showed 1781 roof leakrelated work and repair records it came out to an average of 200 leaks per year or 52 leaks on each building annually in terms of 2006 dollars the average roof replacement cost came out to 269 per square meter over 9 years or 45 million spent on replacement of 16900 square meters over a 9year stretch from 1998 to 2006 roof replacement costs termed “owner capital costs” ranged from 0 to approximately 162 million or a total of 412 million for the entire time span the variances in roof replacement costs show the importance of thinking about commercial in terms of lifecycle among other things roof budgeting relies upon two primary factors the roof’s service life expectancy and how much square footage the roof’s dimensions consist of put off roof replacement with roof restoration
