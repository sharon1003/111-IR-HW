guidance for pointofcare blood lead testing and reporting october 2011childhood lead poisoning remains a serious new york state nys public health problem in 2009 over 2700 of nys children under the age of six were diagnosed with lead poisoning defined as a confirmed blood lead level greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter µgd l lead poisoning is associated with serious lifelong adverse effects on childrens physical cognitive and behavioral development routine blood lead testing of young children is essential to assure early identification and coordination of followup to prevent further exposure as lead crosses the placenta a pregnant woman with an elevated blood lead level ebll may expose her fetus to the toxic effects of lead in 2009 86 nys pregnant women were identified as having eblls greater than or equal to 10 µgd l for women who are pregnant postpartum or of reproductive age lead poisoning prevention education risk assessment and blood lead testing if a risk is identified and management of pregnant and postpartum women with eblls are essential elements of a comprehensive approach to preventing and eliminating lead poisoning in nys under nys public health law phl and regulations health care providers are required to test all children for lead at or around age one year and again at or around age two years assess all children ages six months to six years for lead exposure using a risk assessment tool at least annually with blood lead testing for children identified as being at risk for lead exposure assess all pregnant women for lead exposure using a risk assessment tool at the initial prenatal visit with blood lead testing for women identified as being at risk for lead exposure nys phl and regulations require all laboratories that conduct blood lead testing including physician office laboratories pols and limited service laboratories lsls to report all results of such testing to the department the department recognizes the availability of and access to blood lead testing using pointofcare technologies and requires all entities that perform blood lead testing on humans hold the appropriate level of approval to conduct such testing the medicaid program medicaid managed care and family health plus plans provide reimbursement for pointofcare blood lead testing of children under age six years and pregnant women

assist the laboratory in determining whether the laboratory should create a hl7 or ascii file or perform html data entry for their laboratory results precertification the type of electronic reporting will determine what is necessary for precertification precertification is the ability of a laboratory to successfully generate and transmit laboratory test result data in a format consistent with established eclrs specifications during this phase the laboratory enters live patient data into the eclrs test system and faxes the corresponding paper records to the nysdoh lppp at 5184748136 a minimum of ten records must be submitted before the laboratory may be promoted to the certification process certification certification is the final step for electronic reporting of blood lead test results eclrs staff will send an excel spreadsheet with at least ten records to lppp staff to compare to the corresponding paper records lppp staff will provide feedback to eclrs staff whether the electronic data quality is acceptable unacceptable data quality includes inconsistencies between paper and electronic records or missinginvalid data eclrs staff will relay to the laboratory all lppp feedback prior to accepting additional electronic records and assist the laboratory to report quality data when lppp staff determines a laboratory has met expected certification criteria eclrs will send the laboratory and lppp staff an email notice informing them of the final approval for certification note laboratories considering changing their electronic method of reporting must contact eclrs prior to doing so a modified certification process comparing the data in the two electronic reporting platforms will be followed before the laboratory is approved to change methods appendix ablood lead screening standards of practice for waived testing devices eg lead care ® iistandard guidance consent for testing of a minor to offer lead screening of children during community screening events the laboratory must establish a procedure for determining whether the person arranging for testing for a minor has a legal right and the capacity to consent to testing of the minor consent for testing of a minor a minor is an unmarried person under the age of 18 as part of the process for obtaining approval to perform lead testing in outreach settings the laboratory must attest that it has a procedure for establishing proof of a persons right of guardianship and eligibility to provide informed consent for any test subject who is a minor specimen collection to avoid lead contamination from dust regularly clean work surfaces by wet wiping prior to skin puncture thoroughly clean finger by scrubbing area with soap and water and then with an alcohol swab obtain whole blood samples using leadfree capillary collection tubes provided with the test kit or use vacuum tubes certified for lead or trace element analysis reject venous blood specimens with visible clots and when using edta as anticoagulant reject specimens when the collection tube is not at least one half full specimen collection directions for specimen collection handling and storage are included in the product insert and must be followed explicitly staff should document their having read and understood the insert persons collecting patient specimens should have a thorough understanding of the specimen type proper collection method including the need to clean the skin area and specimen handling for venous blood collected in a vacuum tube use leadfree capillary tubes to transfer sample to the treatment reagent tube be conscious of environmental requirements as described in the users guide to ensure reliable test results test environment requirements apply to all test settings eg inoffice and community outreach venues including mobile vans record keeping keep records of instrument calibration and kit lot numbers and quality control results for each days runs record keeping records should allow crossreference of each patients results with kit lot number and quality control data to retrospectively identify patients in order to contact them for retesting if there is a product recall or problem with test performance confirmatory testing refer for confirmation testing all cases with a lead test result greater than or equal to 8 micrograms per deciliter µgd l  note the level of 8 µgd l is the confirmation threshold recommended by the manufacturer of the lead care ® ii device to minimize possible false negatives confirmatory testing whenever lead results generated by a waived device are greater than or equal to 8 µgd l  record results with a comment that results of confirmatory testing are pending refer a properly collected venous sample to a nys doh laboratory permitted for blood lead confirmation testing or refer the patient to that laboratorys patient service center for collection of a venous blood sample if venous blood was collected inoffice that specimen may be referred or a new specimen may be collected quality assurance have product insert and device users guide available to staff in the testing area periodically compare blood lead results obtained from the waived device with results obtained from confirmatory laboratories periodically review quality control records for irregularities quality assurance compile a procedures manual that minimally includes written policies to ensure compliance with manufacturers requirements for quality control report results as applicable to your provider type and assess personnel competency competency reviews of testing personnel should consider collection technique as well as performance of quality control and proficiency testing participation in proficiency testing is strongly recommended ensure device operators are familiar with requirements for routine quality control new lot new shipment new operator and use of control materials to investigate suspect problems differences greater than 3 µgd l should be investigated if a control material value is not within proper range refer to the trouble shooting section of user guide public health reporting report all results of blood lead analyses to nys doh with demographic data as required by subparts 671 and 673 note residents of nyc must have their results reported to the nycdohmh within 24 hours of analysis notify the health care practitioner
