soil types affecting earthquakes the effects of an earthquake can be more severe for structures built on the some types of soil bodies of earth rest on tectonic plates which slide around underneath the surface when these plates collide they create earthquakes that shake the ground and cause damage both to the earth and to nearby structures and lifeforms property owners can reduce the extent of earthquake damage by purchasing properties that have certain soil characteristics that make the property more resistant to the shaking property owners ideally want to construct their buildings on solid bedrock does this spark an idea compact soil areas that resist earthquakes best are areas that have a lot of rock and highly compacted soil hard rock areas resist shaking and do not break apart easily so property owners do not have to worry as much about structural damage areas that are artificially filled very wet or filled with loose sand suffer the most during an earthquake soil liquidification large earthquakes create whats called soil liquidification which is the loss of strength in saturated soil after a buildup of pore water pressures during dynamic loading soils have shear resistance which is the ability of the soil to resist force that comes horizontally soils subjected to earthquakes can lose their shear resistance which causes the soil to flow around in a semiliquid state this can cause a lot of damage to structures resting on the soil the shear stresses created by the earthquake are cyclical and the excess pore pressures lead to the liquidification of the soil this liquidification has the most destructive effects in lowlying areas with poorly compacted artificial fill this liquidified soil can come up from the ground through cracks which causes sand to deposit all over and permanently deforms the land vibrating soil soil types also effect the intensity of the earthquake the more condensed and compact the soil and the more hardened rock that the soil contains the less the soil will transfer vibrations looser soil tends to transmit more vibrations which leads to more destructive earthquakes felt on the surface in addition the vibrations are also longer on looser soil which can create more damage over time soil elevation deep valleys and sedimentary basins that have loose soil that goes very deep shake the most because these areas have a lower altitude many cities are built in valleys in basins which lead to earthquakes that can be catastrophic highrise buildings and bridges sustain the most damage from earthquakes occurring in soft soil soil at higher altitudes do not carry as many vibrations but these areas have the potential for landslides tags that have areas have areas that cause damage earthquake more earthquakes that property owners posted by alexy davidoff at 838 am email this blog this share to twitter share to facebook share to pinterest labels geology
