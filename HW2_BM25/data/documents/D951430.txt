and marco verpelli nuclear data section division of physical and chemical sciences department of nuclear sciences and applications international atomic energy agency vienna austria compiled and checked september to december 2007 introduction of ddep halflives in october 2008 nuclide selection criteria the table contains all nuclides present within ensdf ddep lnhb web site and the nuclear wallet cards for which a halflife or natural abundance is reported nuclides for which only the level width is known are not included uncertainties uncertainties are shown in italics and are expressed in terms of the last digit s of the recommended value for example 686080 6 means 686080 ± 0006 0037 3 means 0037 ± 0003 and 197 131 19 means 197 131 and 019 table column 1 nuclide nuclide names are of the form z element name and a m i where m i denotes an isomeric state nuclides are listed in order of 1  increasing atomic number z 2  increasing mass number a 3  mass excess δ see column 3 some nuclides have illdefined δ and possess the same values for z a and δ which prevents any distinction being made between ground and metastable state s on the basis of the energies of these levels under these circumstances ground or metastable states cannot be distinguished and these states remain unassigned within the data file for example 81tl190 is illdefined as either j π  2  or 7  and 83bi194m is illdefined as either j π  10 or j π  6 7 column 2 j π spin and parity assignments without and with parentheses are based on strong and weak arguments respectively see the introductory pages of any issue of nuclear data sheets for descriptions of strong and weak arguments for j π assignments column 3 mass excess mass excesses are given in me v with 12 c mass excess equal to zero by definition values for isomers are obtained by adding the excitation energy to the ground state mass excess whenever the excitation energy is not known the mass excess for the next lower isomer is given an appended “syst” denotes that the value is obtained from systematics column 4 natural abundance or halflife abundances are in bold font ddep data have precedence on ensdf data an appended “ syst ” is present when a limit or an approximate value is obtained from systematics the adopted halflife units are as followsyyear 1 year  31 556 926 secondsddayminminutessecondms10 3 secondμs10 6 secondns10 9

the 16 th edition of the book was over 100 pages long so as you can imagine it was a very large table to minimise browser related problems with such a large page we have split the table into parts
