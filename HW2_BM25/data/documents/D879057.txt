available protein structures general bacterial porins are a family of proteins from the outer membranes of gramnegative bacteria the porins act as molecular filters for hydrophilic compounds 1 they are responsible for the molecular sieve properties of the outer membrane porins form large waterfilled channels which allow the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules into the periplasmic space some porins form general diffusion channels that allow any solute up to a certain size that size is known as the exclusion limit to cross the membrane while other porins are specific for one particular solute and contain a binding site for that solute inside the pores these are known as selective porins as porins are the major outer membrane proteins they also serve as receptor sites for the binding of phages and bacteriocins general diffusion porins usually assemble as a trimer in the membrane and the transmembrane core of these proteins is composed exclusively of beta strands 2 it has been shown 3 that a number of porins are evolutionarily related and these porins are e coli pho e phosphoporin phosphate anion selective tc 1 b112  omp c  tc 1 b113 omp f general porins of differing pore

linked together by beta turns on the periplasmic side of the outer membrane and long loops on the external side of the membrane the β strand lie in an antiparallel fashion and form a cylindrical tube called a βbarrel 2 the amino acid composition of the porin βstrands are unique in that polar and nonpolar residues alternate along them this means that the nonpolar residues face outwards so as to interact with the nonpolar lipid membrane whereas the polar residues face inwards into the center of the βbarrel to form the aqueous channel the phospholipids that comprise the outer membrane give it the same semipermeable characteristics as the cytoplasmic membrane 4the porin channel is partially blocked by a loop called the eyelet which projects into the cavity in general it is found between strands 5 and 6 of each barrel and it defines the size of solute that can traverse the channel it is lined almost exclusively with charged amino acyl residues arranged on opposite sides of the channel creating a transversal electric field across the pore the eyelet has a local surplus of negative charges from four glutamic acid and seven aspartic acid residues in contrast to one histidine two lysine and three arginine residues is partially compensated for by two bound calcium atoms and this asymmetric arrangement of molecules is thought to have an influence in the selection of molecules that can pass through the channel 3 homologous families  editthree dimensional structural analyses show that there are many atleast 48 other families which share sufficient sequence similarity to the general bacterial porin gbp family are homologous in structure and function to general bacterial porin family one such family is the sugar porin sp family  tc 1 b3 the sp family includes the well characterized maltoporin of e coli for which the threedimensional structures with and without its substrate have been obtained by xray diffraction the protein consists of an 18 βstranded βbarrel in contrast to proteins of the general bacterial porin family gbp and the rhodobacter por ca porin rpp family  tc 1 b7  which consist of 16 βstranded βbarrels although maltoporin contains a wider betabarrel than the porins of the gbp  tc 1 b1 and rpp families  tc 1 b7  it exhibits a narrower channel showing only 5 of the ionic conductance of the latter porins the rhodobacter por ca protein the only well characterized member of the rpp family was the first porin to yield its threedimensional structure by xray crystallography it has a 16stranded βbarrel structure similar to that of the members of the gbp  tc 1 b1 family paupit et al 1991 presented crystal structures of phosphoporin pho e tc 1 b112  maltoporin lam b tc 1 b311 and matrixporin omp f all of e coli and found these have 3d folds similar to that of the rhodobacter porin por ca structural and sequence analysis provide firm evidence that the gbp sp and rpp families together with 44 additional families in tcdb belong to a single superfamily however we have been able to demonstrate homology between members of families gbp and rpp using statistical means m saier unpublished results porin superfamilies  editgeneral bacterial porin family belongs to porin superfamily i the homologous families sugar porin sp family and rhodobacter por ca porin rpp family also belong to the porin superfamily i subfamilies
