121008“the family stone” a house for the holidays the family stone received mixed reviews but i liked it would i have enjoyed it as much if it hadn’t taken place in this beautiful old house however maybe not ha i tracked down the house where it was filmed in connecticut so read onthe stone family home the family stone is about a family gathering at christmas there are five grown children and everett dermot mulroney is bringing his girlfriend meredith sarah jessica parker home to meet everybody for the first time the kitchen the set designers were careful to fill the house with “details” that would make it look and feel like the stone family really lived here down to every photo and magnet on the fridge sybil’s desk in the kitchen which is her domain when diane keaton saw the interior of the house for the first time she says she thought it was “disgusting” she couldn’t stand all the clutter “and all of the stuff everywhere” but she admitted that it suited the family’s personality “for them it was perfect”the dining room everett’s room matches his buttonedup personality parents’ bedroom amy’s attic bedroom cozy living room how the “family stone” house looks today on streetview as for the filming location a reader named kathy tells me they used this house in greenwich connecticut for the exteriors according to zillow it was built in 1860 and was last sold in 2008 for about 4 million it has 5 bedrooms and 3500 square feet looks a little different in the summer doesn’t it the snow in the movie by the way was real kathy tells me they brought snow machines in but then didn’t need them after all thanks to mother naturep s visit houses onscreen page to see more including…are you hooked on houses more to tour the “sex and the city” movie real estate heaven set design the

holiday” this is so much fun guessingastrid121008 at 826 am when i saw that movie i didn’t care much for the actual movie but i loved that house it’s so warm and cozy and inviting it looked like a house filled with things that were collected over time not someone buying the collection for a catalogue because it all matched angela121008 at 840 am i loved this house granted it was a bit cluttered although perfect for that family…but man i would love to live in a house just like it great movie too one of my favorite christmas movies stepmom’s house was great too – very similiar to this one thanks for sharing angelabungalowbliss121008 at 847 am i’m a huge fan of several cast members sjp rachel mc adams luke wilson plus i’m a sucker for holiday movies–so i knew i would love this one but having it set in a house like this sealed the deal for me i’ve watched it several times specifically for the purpose of checking out details like you’ve pointed out as i have with to kill a mockingbird and it’s a wonderful life have you seen the changeling it’s not a holiday flick but oh angelina’s bungalow is so cool especially the kitchen heather121008 at 914 am the outside of the home is gorgeous as are the bones on the inside but i agree with diane keaton i can’t stand all the clutterstarwoodgal121008 at 944 am let’s not forget the house from “home alone” i love movies where the house is actually more like a character than a set my husband gets really annoyed when i’m paying more attention to the movie sets and decorations than the movie story line “ooo i love that comforter look at that paint color”it is a sickness i have halucinda121008 at 953 am i really liked this movie it had so many layers i remember liking the house when i watched the movie i’m also crazy for diane keaton’s crisp white shirt and big chunky beads…such stylemike121008 at 1008 am i 3 this house it may be my favorite movie house of all tossup with the father of the bride house this place just oozes familial warmththe pleasures of homemaking121008 at 1014 am i love that house i never saw the movie and if i’m going to cry i may have to watch it alonemanuela amy from texas121008 at 1051 am i’m laughing at that red apple computer i had a giant blue one like that man if diane keaton came to my house she would have a heart attack at all the clutterthat button is so cute wink wink i’m getting ready for your house tour but it’s not what you would expectreagan121008 at 1057 am i loved this movie i thought that the house was from step mother as well…maybe it’s just the angle of the shot or something i need to rent this moviewingnut121008 at 1120 am this is really a great movie not what you would expect when you watch the trailer like you said you think it’s going to be a comedy and it is hilarious but it’s a drama very welldone movie and i can see a lot of it being realistic fifi flowers121008 at 1135 am loved this movie… i could not think of the name fun christmas movie trivia

ist4ac3y1123108 at 350 pm i loved the movie and i loved that house i live in the chicago burbs and in area’s by and on lake michigan there are many many beautiful home’s like this one since i was a kid my favorite thing to do was drive the “circle tour” and just gaze at the houses so worth a trip if you’re in the city visiting btw i’ve been struggling with house to design a house i just moved in well 6 years ago and when i saw this movie i just knew this was the way to go… even though i’ve alway’s avoided wallpaper… i don’t care anymore the house is that much of an inspiration thanks so much for the pics rebecca22209 at 227 am i so so loved this house i think i stuck with the movie mostly for the house i dream of a big rambling family home full of memories and collections and history… if i ever had a decorator i’d make her watch this movie and maybe stepmom and say “make my house like that”katrine holme32109 at 1034 am i watched this movie a long time ago and then recently watched another movie also starring diane keaton and i think that they used the same pregnancy picture in this other movie “because i said so” did anyone else recognize jessica3511 at 918 am yes i noticed that toomegan33009 at 145 pm the funny thing is about this house is that i live right next door to it it was filmed in old greenwich greenwich ct jane stewart52309 at 1230 pm the director tom bezucha emailed your site to me i am so happy that people love the house it exists forever in the movie but not in real life the interior was created on stage in culver city cal enjoy jane stewart production designer of “family stone”hookedonhouses52309 at 127 pm jane i’m so glad you stopped by this is one of my alltime favorite movie houses i love how the rooms reflect the personalities of the family members instead of just being a “pretty backdrop” for the story thanks for your comment juliastars8109 at 511 am i loved this house in the movie as well i got a sense of deja vu when i first saw the house is it from another movie i can’t figure it outhookedonhouses8109 at 1254 pm stars– a lot of people have asked if it’s the same house as the one used in “stepmom” it’s not but maybe that’s why it looks familiar to you as far as i know it wasn’t used in any other movies but if anyone knows differently please let us know juliastars8209 at 513 am yes that’s the movie i’m thinking of thanks i own “the family stone” and it’s such a great holiday movie on a slightly random note the house from “the women” is also gorgeous diana10209 at 345 pm does anyone remember the movie bed of roses with christian slater and mary stuart masterson it was released back in 1996 for some reason this house reminds me of christian’s parent’s house in the movie where they visit during the christmas holiday
