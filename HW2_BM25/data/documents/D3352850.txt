calories than is contained in celery itself is this true and if so is the weight loss significant eg if someone ate 1kg of celery would it noticeably affect their weightnutritionshare improve this

active oldest votesup vote8down voteaccepted the urban legend website snopes argues that this legend is true it is the bodily energy devoted to the digestion of the green stalks that exhausts calories they also emphasize that it works as a displacement toothose who are eating it arent eating something else their references seem to be largely based on newspaper articles which isnt reassuring they also cite food reference but they arent terribly wedded to the claim prefixing it with supposedly the straight dope tried an ad hoc experiment showing that even ignoring the cost of digestion over a period of an hour eating celery the total calories consumed were outweighed by the base rate of calorieburning by a person eating or even restingafter an hour id eaten eight stalks i was interrupted a couple times thankfully all things considered i think i packed away as much of the stringy stuff as could reasonably be expected total consumption 514 grams total calories ingested 72 bear in mind that you burn roughly 60 calories per hour while asleep 85 while eating  according to one calorie calculator i found i need 78 calories per hour just to support my body weight so both sites with limited rigour suggest that yes eating celery burns more calories than it providesshare improve this answeredited mar 15 13 at 955answered nov 18 11 at 1107oddthinking ♦924k 24 380 483thanks but is the weight loss significant that is still not answered – wikis nov 18 11 at 20351no if you are expecting significant weight loss by effectively reducing your calorie intake by one meal on one day i have bad news for you – oddthinking ♦ nov 18 11 at 21331to support my body weight presumably requires more energy than to digest celery wikipedias negative calorie food article asserts that the amount of energy required to digest celery is much lower than the energy contained in celery although like the snopes and straight dope articles the references seem largely unreliable – douglas s stones mar 15 13 at 1544support my body weight simply refers to awake resting levels the effort to chew and digest would be on top of that the references arent great it is true but it is one of those esoteric questions that is unlikely to have a large reproduced peerreviewed experiment to directly test it so i think they are as good as we can hope to find – oddthinking ♦ mar 15 13 at 2211add a commentup vote10down vote the reason for this claim is most likely the high content of dietary fiber in celery dietary fiber cannot be used as energy by humans but it still causes some feeling of satiety you dont get many calories from celery due to the high amount of fiber  the energy content of celery is only 14 kcal100g  but digestions itself takes some amount of energyshare improve this answeranswered

the body but the body expends only half of a single calorie digesting it enwikipediaorgwikinegativecaloriefoodfoods – duralumin mar 18 13 at 957add a commentup vote8down vote i dont mean to step on the obvious here but if 1kg of celery per day was all you ate meaning that you allow no other caloric intake you would certainly lose weight and probably quite rapidly however over an extended peiod of time you would eventually become malnourished and probably die conversely adding 1kg of celery to a diet assuming a healthy diet at 18002000 kcalday certainly has some benefits mostly due to its being high in fiber and water these same properties also may cause some loss of water weight through increased diuresis initially however i think even this would be barely noticeable and replaced very quickly it would probably be detectable only if you were to weigh yourself carefully before and after voiding even taking into consideration indiviual variations in metabolism and calories burned while chewing the idea is that digesting food is only 515 of the average persons daily energy expenditure according to some sources alcohol and protein take the most energy to digest link found at
