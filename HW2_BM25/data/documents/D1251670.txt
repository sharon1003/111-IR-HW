of a car or an automobile as its the essential communication between the car and the road wheel locking when brake pressure is applied to brake disc or to drum in case of drum brakes  the brake pressure applied retards the wheel at point of time the wheels lock but still the vehicle is moving so the tires are sliding on the road problems a locked tire cannot generate any lateral force to turn the vehicle as the wheel is actually sliding so the driver cannot steer the vehicle another problem is the varying driving condition each will lock randomly based on the surface condition for example lets assume that the right side wheels are driven on sand or outside the road and left side wheels are driven on normal road  mostly this is a situation in rural areas the right side wheels will lock first  hence without an abs the car may loss stability under this condition and will skid hence to prevent the wheel from locking abs is used the abs is a electronic system which uses sensors  wheel speed sensors  and actuators  abs pump  valves  the sensor continuously monitors the speed of all individual wheels  so under braking condition it can detects that a wheel is going to lock  wheel speed would be approaching zero while vehicle is still moving  or not  if wheel locking is sensed there will be valve which releases the brake pressure  hydrualic lines  to the particular wheel now the wheel again starts to rotate after a certain rpm is reached the brake pressure is now applied by the abs pump thus this cycle is carried out at frequency at which the drivers wont feel the intermediate retardation of the wheels the abs pump working can be slightly felt at the brake pedal  remember abs does not reduces the braking distance in normal driving condition  it just allows the vehicle to be steered even when brake is applied ebd is more closely related to abs but the intended function is little different electronic brake distribution the concept is that a vehicle will have its own weight distribution say 50  on front and rear  this is in static condition hence same load will be acting on all the four wheels but under dynamic condition each will have a different weight distribution this is because there may be transfer of loads during acceleration  cornering  while climbing hill etc due to this each will have different loads hence while braking the braking pressure must be different for each wheels this is achieved by ebd  its commonly a sub system of abs because if a car has abs it will have ebd hence ebd also prevents wheel from locking under various driving condition by regulating brake pressure this is because the car will have less braking distance or maximum deceleration when both wheels retard at same rate  this is where ebd kicks in by applying right pressure to each wheel the extension of ebd with yaw sensors gives rise to electronic stability control which prevents under steer and over steer of a car as sharjith naramparambath

braking system system or abs is a safety system which prevents the wheels on a moving vehicle from locking up or cease while rotating while braking abs offers improved vehicle control over dry and especially slippery surfaces by reducing the braking distance but it can also increase the braking distance in case of loose surfaces like snow gravel etc ever since the invention of abs it has been evolving and the recent systems not only prevent wheel locking but also electronically control the fronttorear brake bias which we know as electronic brake force system traction control system emergency brake assist or electronic stability control working of abs when brakes are applied under heavy loads the braking pressure becomes high resulting in heavy braking or in other words locking up of wheels the abs overcomes this by monitoring the wheel speed and releases pressure on each wheel brake lines in the form of rapid pulses switching between different brake lines which prevent lockingup preventing lockup under heavy braking helps the driver in maintaining control over the vehicle in modern abs an individual brake line is provided for each of the four wheel enabling different braking pressures for different road surfaces of the wheels what is ebd  electronic brake force distribution system also called as electronic brakeforce limitation is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies the amount of force applied to each of a vehicle’s brakes based on road conditions speed loading etc ebd system is always coupled with antilock brakeforce system the most important function of ebd is to maintain vehicular control with variation in braking pressure applied to each wheel in order to maximize stopping power generally most of the weight of all vehicles is carried by the front end so the ebd ensures less braking pressure at the rear end to avoid skidding but in some ebd’s the distribution of braking pressure at the rear end is more initially when the brakes are applied before the effects of weight transfer comes into play working of ebd system an ebd is a subsystem of the abs and its function is to control the effective adhesion utilization by the rear wheels the antilock brake force system releases pressure in different brake lines at the time of heavy braking to prevent lockingup the action comes in the form of releasing pressure from the braking circuit when it detects extreme and rapid deceleration in any of the four wheels in order to make sure that the driver maintains control over the steering during panic or emergency braking for example if the wheels of a vehicle are on snow as well as asphalt then in case of emergency braking the abs will monitor the speeds and eventually the ebd system will release less pressure for wheels on snow and more pressure for wheels on asphalt to prevent wheel lockup156k views · view upvoters · answer requested by mohan s n subbupromoted by truth finder this site

head updated apr 9 2014 · author has 197 answers and 3382k answer views abs is anti lock braking system when you press hard on the normal brake pedal the discdrum brakes are engaged and they slow you down but at the risk of locking up the wheels this means they do not have any circular movement left and due to the inertia of the car they will just keep skidding along the road surface turning the steering wheel will have no effect as the wheels have very little grip left what the abs does is monitor the wheels under braking if the system senses that the wheels are about to stop moving it releases the brake even if you are pressing the brake pedal when the wheels are moving you have enough grip on the road so you can turn the steering to give direction to your car in newer systems this brake on and brake off pulsing happens at a frequency of nearly 50 times per second imagine that ebd is electronic brakeforce distribution this systems monitors each of the individual brakes and wheels under braking it decides which wheel to brake more and which to brake less depending on many conditions like road friction less priority and body weight higher priority of the car typically most of the braking force is distributed at the front to as the front is heavier than the rear half of the car in a few systems immediately after braking more pressure is applied on rear brakes before the effects of weight transfer become apparent and then the brake force is redistributed hope i have clarified your doubts p s this is my 100th answer so thank you537k views · view upvoters your

and 2763k answer views to tell the difference between ebd and abs we must first understand what they are and what they do abs is actually the most important of the lot in a way that it is the foundation of the other systems notably ebd lets start abs antilock braking system as we know a vehicle moves due to the frictional force between the tyre and road when we apply brakes the brakes apply a torque in the opposite direction as that of friction and the wheel gradually comes to rest this is how normal brakes work now whenever we are traveling on smooth surfaces like snow the friction coefficient is low and hence less frictional force when a brake is applied in these conditions or even when you brake hard on a regular surface the amount of torque is so high that the vehicles wheels stop rotating and start sliding this is known as locking of wheels unless you are a skilled drifter this is potentially a dangerous situation as you dont have control over the wheels experienced it firsthand a few months ago so here comes the use of abs the function of abs is to prevent the wheels from locking even under very hard braking or on surfaces with low friction like snow wet roads a typical abs consists of the following parts 1 ecu 2 four sensors for monitoring wheel speed 3 a pair of valves in each brake unit the ecu monitors the speed of each wheel if it detects that any wheel rotating at a slower speed than others this indicates an imminent wheel lock it redirects the valves to reduce brake pressure conversely if it detects a wheel faster than the others it instructs the valves to increase brake pressure all of this helps us maintain control of our car even in extreme situations ebd electronic brake force distribution system ebd is basically a subsystem of abs and it always works in conjunction with an abs system there main job of ebd is to optimise brake force on each wheel individually so to get maximum breaking power without losing control it can alter braking pressure on each wheel individually depending on the conditions and weight distribution of the vehicle at that moment hope this helps  155k views · view upvoters sam agrawal mechanical

author has 96 answers and 1536k answer views the abs antilock brake system monitors the speed of each wheel to detect locking when it detects sudden braking it will release braking pressure for a moment and then provide optimum braking pressure to each wheel by repeating this process in a short period of time it enhances steering control during sudden stops as a result it will also help improve the ability of stopping the vehicle abs only supports the drivers control of the vehicle and it is not a substitute for it it is the drivers responsibility to drive at the appropriate speed depending on the condition of the road and to keep a generous distance from the car ahead of you coupled along with abs there is another electronic marvel called the ebd or electronic brake force distribution simply put ebd is a system wherein the amount of braking force on each wheel of the car can be varied taking factors such as load bearing on each wheel condition of the road speed of the vehicle and so on ebd is an extension of the antilock braking system it can monitor each wheel’s speed and accelerationdeceleration to determine how much load it is bearing by adjusting the valves in the braking system’s hydraulic lines ebd can distribute more braking force to wheels that are carrying more of the load and less to those that are doing less work some ebd systems also monitor steering wheel angle and the car’s rate of turn yaw so if the car understeers or oversteers during midcorner braking it can be automatically brought back to its intended path by judicious application of the appropriate brake thanks4k views · view upvoters neerav pandya marketing personal answered apr 16 2016abs  known as anti lock braking system contain ecm  hydrilic modular  sensor on wheels function  in normal braking when we apply the brake by hydrilic medium brake pads hold the rotor  disc  and vehicle drop its speed to minimum at that time when calipers hold the rotor wheels are lock  consider panic braking situation  not gentle braking  you had press the pedal full force  now at that time due to velocity of vehicle and lock position of wheel you cant able to stear the vehicle and vehicle start travelling to force direction  now abs prevent this situation  when we apply panic braking ecm calculate the load and activate the hydrulic modular symantenously ecm start getting the inputs from the wheel sensors as well and send the necessary fluid to the wheels through hydrulic modular valves  when calipers hold the rotor and sensor sense the rotation lock it close the modular valve and release the brake so it again comes in motion but this time with less speed  after as it sense the rotation again valve open and hold the disc and apply the brake so vehicle speed get decrease and same time wheels doesnt get lock as well so you can stear the vehicle in desire trake and avoid collisions its like the same effect you clapping this hold and release take place around 20

2016presentanswered apr 11 2014 · author has 339 answers and 4256k answer views ebd or electronic brakeforce distribution system can be considered as a pre abs system when normal braking happens the tyre with least load are prone to skid and lock up so what ebd does is it senses the load on all the tires and distributes the brake force on all the wheels according to the load on the wheels ie the wheels with light load have less force on them while the wheels with greater load have a greater braking force abs or antilock braking system is something that performs pumping of brakes there is a threshold value above which if force is applied on the wheel it will lock leading to skidding and that is where abs kicks in whenever a wheel speed sensor senses a lock up in any particular wheel it sends the data to the electronic control unit brain to abs which in turn instructs the master cylinder holds the brake oil to release the pressure valves and pumps help in that from that particular wheel avoiding lockup abs is more effective on slippery surfaces snow water but doesnt makes much difference in the stopping distance on gravels but maneuverability is definitely improved84k views · view upvoters ashish patel answered dec 27 2016the antilock braking system abs detects the speed of the wheels through sensors on each wheel when one wheel slows down much slower than all other wheels the computer releases the brakes on that wheel almost immediately the computer applies the brakes again the computer is in fact pumping the brakes but it does it much faster than we do you can also release brakes on just the wheel s that are skidding something we cannot do by pumping pedal abs definitely could rescue us from a bad situation the abs controller exactly knows that such a rapid deceleration is impossible so it reduces the pressure on that brake until it sees an acceleration then increases the pressure until it again sees the deceleration you can do this very quickly before the tire can really change the speed significantly the result is that the tire slows down at the same speed as the car with the brakes keeping the tires very close to the point where they will start to lock this gives the system maximum braking power do not go anywhere we are here to help you httpgetpartsus is there to help you find all your needs the costeffective way to have a spare part is to
