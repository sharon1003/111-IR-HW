are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller ones belonging to both the u s state of alaska and the russian federal subject of kamchatka krai 1 they form part of the aleutian arc in the northern pacific ocean occupying an area of 6821 sq mi 17666 km 2 and extending about 1200 mi 1900 km westward from the alaska peninsula toward the kamchatka peninsula in russia and mark a dividing line between the bering sea to the north and the pacific ocean to the south crossing longitude 180° at which point east and west longitude end the archipelago contains both the westernmost part of the united states by longitude  amatignak island and the easternmost by longitude  semisopochnoi island  the westernmost u s island in real terms however is attu island west of which runs the international date line while nearly all the archipelago is part of alaska and is usually considered as being in the  alaskan bush  at the extreme western end the small geologically related commander islands belong to russia the islands with their 57 volcanoes form the northernmost part of the pacific ring of fire physiographically they are a distinct section of the larger pacific border province which in turn is part of the larger pacific mountain system physiographic division these islands are most known for the battles and skirmishes that occurred there during the aleutian islands campaign

geography  editunalaska island in the aleutian islands the aleutian islands from 32000 feet 9700 m active aleutian volcanoes the islands known before 1867 as the catherine archipelago comprise five groups east to westthe fox islands islands of four mountains andreanof rat islands and near islands all five are located between 51° and 55° n latitude and 172° e and 163° w longitude 4 the largest islands in the aleutians are attu the farthest from the mainland and unalaska umnak and unimak in the fox islands the largest of those is unimak island with an area of 157141 mi² 40699 km² followed by unalaska island the only other aleutian island with an area over 1000 square miles 2600 km² the axis of the archipelago near the mainland of alaska has a southwest trend but near 179° its direction changes to the northwest this change of direction corresponds to a curve in the line of volcanic fissures that have contributed their products to the building of the islands such curved chains are repeated about the pacific ocean in the kuril islands the japanese chain and in the philippines all these island arcs are at the edge of the pacific plate and experience much seismic activity but are still habitable the aleutians lie between the pacific and north american tectonic plates  citation needed the general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western the island chain is a western continuation of the aleutian range on the mainland 5the great majority of the islands bear evident marks of volcanic origin and there are numerous volcanic cones on the north side of the chain some of them active many of the islands however are not wholly volcanic but contain crystalline or sedimentary rocks and also amber and beds of lignite the coasts are rocky and surfworn and the approaches are exceedingly dangerous the land rising immediately from the coasts to steep bold mountains 5these volcanic islands reach heights of 6200 feet 1900 m makushin volcano 5691 feet 1735 m located on unalaska island is not quite visible from within the town of unalaska though the steam rising from its cone is visible on a rare clear day residents of unalaska need only to climb one of the smaller hills in the area such as pyramid peak or mt newhall to get a good look at the snowcovered cone the volcanic bogoslof and fire islands which rose from the sea in 1796 and 1883 respectively lie about 30 miles 50 km west of unalaska bay 5in 1906 a new volcanic cone rose between the islets of bogoslof and grewingk near unalaska followed by another in 1907 these cones were nearly demolished by an explosive eruption on september 1 1907 5 newly found information in 2017 the volcanic cone erupted sending ash and ice particles 30000 feet 9000 m in the air 6the aleutians seen from space image of the islands taken by the sts56 crew these cloud formations were seen over the western aleutian islands aster image of the islands aleutian islands on may 15 2014 by nasa’s aqua satellite climate  editthe climate of the islands is oceanic with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy rainfall fogs are almost constant summer weather is much cooler than southeast alaska around sitka  but the winter temperature of the islands and of the alaska panhandle is very nearly the same 5 during the winter the islands are the center for the semipermanent lowpressure area called the aleutian low the mean annual temperature for unalaska the most populated island of the group is about 38 ° f 3 ° c  being about 30 °f −1 °c in january and about 52 °f 11 °c in august the highest and lowest temperatures recorded on the islands are 78 °f 26 °c and 5 °f −15 °c respectively the average annual rainfall is about 80 inches 2000 mm and unalaska with about 250 rainy days per year is said to be one of the rainiest places within the u s 5flora  editcape promontory cape lutkes on unimak island in the aleutian islands alaska the growing season lasts approximately 135 days from early in may until late in september but agriculture is limited to the raising of few vegetables with the exception of some stunted willows the vast majority of the chain is devoid of native trees 5 on some of the islands such as adak and amaknak there are a few coniferous trees growing remnants of the russian period while tall trees grow in many cold climates aleutian conifers — some estimated to be two hundred years old — rarely reach a height of even 10 feet 3 m and many of them are still less than 5 feet 15 m tall this is because the islands much like the falklands and other islands of similar latitudes experience such strong winds that taller trees are vulnerable to snapping off instead of trees the islands are covered with a luxuriant dense growth of herbage and shrubs including crowberry bluejoint grasses sedges and many flowering plants 7 there are areas of peat bog near the coasts endemic plants include the endangered aleutian shield fern fauna  editthe aleutians are home to many large colonies of seabirds buldir island has 21 breeding seabird species including the bering seaendemic redlegged kittiwake large seabird colonies are also present at kiska gareloi semisopochnoi bogoslof and others the islands are also frequented by vagrant asiatic birds including the common rosefinch siberian rubythroat bluethroat lanceolated warbler and the first north american record of the intermediate egret 8the habitats of the aleutians are largely unspoiled but wildlife is affected by competition from introduced species such as cattle caribou and foxes nearly all of the aleutians are protected as part of the alaska maritime national wildlife refuge and the aleutian islands wilderness 9observations have identified sea otters as a keystone species along the coasts of many of the aleutian islands their presence encourages the growth of kelp forests as the otters control sea urchin populations as large populations of sea urchins can create urchin barrens by clearing away kelp stands 10economy  editon the less mountainous islands the raising of sheep and reindeer was once believed to be practicable 7 there are bison on islands near sand point sheep raising seems to have died off with the advent of synthetic fibers which lowered the value of wool during the 1980s there were some llama being raised on unalaska the current economy is primarily based on fishing and the presence of u s military the only crop is potato chickens are raised in barns under protection from the cold transportation  editin addition to a partial air service and a ferry service the alaska marine highway passes through many of the u s islands demographics  editthe native people refer to themselves as unangan and are now generally known by most nonnatives as the  aleut  the aleut language is one of the two main branches of the eskimo–aleut language family this family is not known to be related to any others the 2000 u s census recorded a population of 8162 on the islands of whom 4283 were living in the main settlement of unalaska history  editprehistory  editbecause of the location of the islands stretching like a broken bridge from asia to america many anthropologists believe they were a route of the first human occupants of the americas the earliest known evidence of human occupation in the americas is much farther south the early human sites in alaska have probably been submerged by rising waters during the current interglacial period people living in the aleutian islands developed fine skills in hunting fishing and basketry hunters made their weapons and watercraft the baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully shredded stalks of beach rye russian period  editexplorers traders and missionaries arrived from russia beginning in 1741 in 1741 the russian government sent vitus bering a dane in the service of russia and aleksei chirikov a russian in the ships saint peter and saint paul on a voyage of discovery in the northern pacific after the ships were separated by a storm chirikov discovered several eastern islands of the aleutian group and bering discovered several of the western islands bering was shipwrecked and lost his life on the komandorski islands  commander islands that now bears his name  bering island  the survivors of berings party reached the kamchatka peninsula in a boat constructed from the wreckage of their ship and reported that the islands were rich in furbearing animals 5siberian fur hunters flocked to the commander islands and gradually moved eastward across the aleutian islands to the mainland in this manner russia gained a foothold on the northwestern coast of north america the aleutian islands consequently belonged to russia until that country transferred all its possessions in north america to the u s in 1867 5during the consolidation of the russianamerican company there was sporadic conflict with the native population frequently disastrous to the poorly armed and vastly outnumbered russians the colonies soon entered a relatively stable state based on cooperation intermarriage and official policies that provided social status education and professional training to children of mixed aleutrussian birth 11 within a generation the daytoday administration of the russianamerican colonies was largely in the hands of nativeborn alaskans reversing the usual trend in colonization where indigenous technologies are replaced the russians adopted the aleut kayak or baidarka sea otter hunting techniques and the working of native copper deposits the russians instituted public education preservation of the aleut language through transliteration of religious and other texts into aleut via an adaptation of the cyrillic alphabet vaccination of the native population against smallpox and sciencebased sea mammal conservation policies that were ahead of their time 11by 1760 the russian merchant andrian tolstykh had made a detailed census in the vicinity of adak and extended russian citizenship to the aleuts during his third and last voyage in 1778 captain james cook surveyed the eastern portion of the aleutian archipelago accurately determined the position of some of the more important islands and corrected many errors of former navigators 5orthodox christian heritage  editamong the first christian missionaries to arrive in the aleutian islands was a party of ten russian orthodox monks and priests who arrived in 1793 within two years a monk named herman was the only survivor of that party he settled on spruce island near kodiak island and often defended the rights of the aleuts against the russian trading companies he is now known in the orthodox church as saint herman of alaska another early christian missionary of the russian orthodox church was father veniaminov who arrived in unalaska in 1824 he was named bishop innokentii in 1840 and moved to sitka he is now known in the orthodox church as saint innocent of alaska the principal settlements were on unalaska island the oldest was iliuliuk also called unalaska settled in 1760–1775 with a customs house and an orthodox

considerable fleet of united states revenue cutters which patrolled the sealing grounds of the pribilof islands 5 the first public school in unalaska opened in 1883 the u s congress extended american citizenship to all native americans and this law has been held to include the indigenous peoples of alaska in 1924 a hospital was built in unalaska in 1933 by the u s bureau of indian affairs world war ii  editmain article aleutian islands campaign during world war ii small parts of the aleutian islands were occupied by japanese forces when attu and kiska were invaded in order to divert american forces away from the main japanese attack at midway atoll the u s navy having broken the japanese naval codes knew that this was just a diversion disputed and it did not expend large amounts of effort in defending the islands more than 90 americans were taken to japan as prisoners of war most of the civilian population over 800 of the aleutians and pribilovians was detained by the united states in
