how many squares are there on a chess board oh dear  this simple question leads to some big arguments between the chess piecesthe board has 8 squares along the bottom and 8 squares up the side so most people would say the answer is 8x8 64 but suppose you count the big square as one and then you also want to count up all the smaller squares  how many squares are there in total if you like playing with chess boards try the eight queens puzzle1first of all the whole board makes one big square 4then there are four slightly smaller squares measuring 7x7 weve marked where the corners go on the main board using numbers 14 weve outlined where the first square goes in red  9then there are nine squares measuring 6x6 weve marked where the corners go on the main board using numbers 19 weve outlined where square number 2 goes in blue  when you add a list of square numbers you get the square pyramid numbers the formula for the number of balls in a square pyramid   2 n 3  3 n 2  n  รท 6where n  the number of layers of the pyramid the number of squares on a chessboard  the 8th pyramid number so if you make n 8 in the formula youll get the answerfind more fantastic formulas in the perfect sausage you can even find out how many rectangles are on a chess board using triangle numbers the answer is t8x t8 36 x 36  1296 so how many squares of different sizes have we counted so far its 1  4  9    you might have noticed these are the square numbers 1 21 2 24 3 29heres the next smaller size of square how many can we fit on a chessboard its the next square number 4 2   16here are the other possible squares numbers of each square that will fit on the board  25  36  49  64so the total number of squares on the chess board  1  4  9  16  25  36  49  64  204the murderous maths of everything murderous maths home page
