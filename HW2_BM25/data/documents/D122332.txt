cooking lessons from the kitchn how to stirfry vegetables emma christensen may 29 2012share email we are always trying to eat more vegetables more greens a quick stirfry is one of the fastest easiest tastiest ways to make a lastminute vegetable side dish to suit any meal grace young proved this to be true when she demonstrated a basic stirfry recipe for us romaine lettuce leaves warm and slightly wilted tumbled in a sauce of garlic and chilies after that — the same recipe and method but this time with halved baby bok choy we couldnt stop eating either of these here is a recipe and a stirfry technique that any of us can take into our kitchens and adapt to just about any vegetable we find in the fridge the technique for a vegetable stirfry is the same no matter which vegetables you use this stirfry of romaine lettuce and the second of baby bok choy from grace can just as easily be made with red peppers and mushrooms asparagus and snow peas or bok choy and green beans see more stirfry basics how to stirfry chicken how to make fried rice need a wok heres our guide • how to buy  season a wok grace talking about how important it is to cut vegetables in the same size and to make sure that they are very dry before stirfrying the basics of stirfrying vegetables• dont crowd the pan grace advises that we stick to no more than four cups of chopped hard or mediumhard vegetables or eight to twelve cups chopped leafy greens in a 14inch wok in order to avoid crowding the pan a sauté pan is fine for some stirfrying but not great for greens like in this recipe its simply not deep enough to hold greens the way a wok is • dry the vegetables when stirfrying anything from snow peas to lettuce its important that the vegetables are very dry otherwise the vegetables will steam and braise in the pan and lose their crisp texture giving the vegetables a whirl in a salad spinner is the easiest solution but you can also pat them thoroughly with kitchen towels• pay close attention all stirfrying is quick but a stirfry of just vegetables goes even quicker dont walk away from the stove or pause to answer a text once the oil is in the pan a stirfry needs your full attention for a two to three minute recipe we think we can handle that1 cut up the ingredients it is very important that all the ingredients are cut as directed in the ingredient list the most

stove also have a very small bowl of water next to the stove heat the wok turn on a stove burner as high as it will go set a 14inch wok over this high heat burner to determine when the wok is hot enough start flicking droplets of water from the small bowl into the pan after 30 seconds as soon as a bead of water evaporates within 1 to 2 seconds of contact the wok is heated and ready for stirfrying do not overheat the wok pull wok off the heat and add oil pull the wok off the heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil pick up the pan and carefully swirl it to coat the bottom and sides if the wok smokes wildly the moment you add the oil youve overheated the wok remove the wok from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes when its cool enough to handle carefully remove the oil with paper towels wash the wok and start again add the aromatics to the wok put the wok back on the heat add the garlic and chiles if using and stir them for 10 seconds or until fragrant add the vegetables push the garlic up the sides of the wok and add the lettuce or bok choy or whatever else youre using season the vegetables sprinkle the salt and pepper over top set a timer for 2 minutes its helpful for
