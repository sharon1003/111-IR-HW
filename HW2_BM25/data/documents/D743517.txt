slosh  psurge  surge products  local impacts  faq  resources contents introduction storm surge vs storm tide factors impacting surge notable surge events surge vulnerability facts introduction along the coast storm surge is often the greatest threat to life and property from a hurricane in the past large death tolls have resulted from the rise of the ocean associated with many of the major hurricanes that have made landfall hurricane katrina 2005 is a prime example of the damage and devastation that can be caused by surge at least 1500 persons lost their lives during katrina and many of those deaths occurred directly or indirectly as a result of storm surge storm surge vs storm tide storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm over and above the predicted astronomical tides storm surge should not be confused with storm tide which is defined as the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide this rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas particularly when storm surge coincides with normal high tide resulting in storm tides reaching up to 20 feet or more in some cases storm surge vs storm tide factors impacting surge storm surge is produced by water being pushed toward the shore by the force of the winds moving cyclonically around the storm the impact on surge of the low pressure associated with intense storms is minimal in comparison to the water being forced toward the shore by the wind wind and pressure components of hurricane storm surge the maximum potential storm surge for a particular location depends on a number of different factors storm surge is a very complex phenomenon because it is sensitive to the slightest changes in storm intensity forward speed size radius of maximum windsrmw angle of approach to the coast central pressure minimal contribution in comparison to the wind and the shape and characteristics of coastal features such as bays and estuaries click on image to play video other factors which can impact storm surge are the width and slope of the continental shelf a shallow slope will potentially produce a greater storm surge than a steep shelf for example a category 4 storm hitting the louisiana coastline which has a very wide and shallow continental shelf may produce a 20foot storm surge while the same hurricane in a place like miami beach florida where the continental shelf drops off very quickly might see an 8 or 9foot surge more information regarding storm surge impacts and their associated generalizations can be found in the faq section surge animation with shallow continental shelf click on image to play video surge animation with steep continental shelf click on image to play videoadding to the destructive power of surge battering waves may increase damage to buildings directly along the coast water weighs approximately 1700 pounds per cubic yard extended pounding by frequent waves can demolish any structure not specifically designed to withstand such forces the two elements work together to increase the impact on land because the surge makes it possible for waves to extend inland although elevated this house in north carolina could not withstand the 15 ft 45 m of storm surge that came with hurricane floyd 1999additionally currents created by tides combine with the waves to severely erode beaches and coastal highways buildings that survive hurricane winds can be damaged if their foundations are undermined and weakened by erosion beachfront road and boardwalk damaged by hurricane jeanne 2004in confined harbors the combination of storm tides waves and currents can also severely damage marinas and boats in estuaries and bayous salt water intrusion endangers the public health kills vegetation and can send animals such as snakes and alligators�fleeing from flooded areas damaged boats in a marina notable surge events ike 2008  slosh historical run hurricane ike made landfall near the north end of galveston island as a category 2 hurricane storm surges of 1520 feet above normal tide levels occurred along the bolivar peninsula of texas and in much of the galveston bay area property damage from ike is estimated at 249 billion more katrina 2005  slosh historical run katrina was one of the most devastating hurricanes in the history of the united states it produced catastrophic damage  estimated at 75 billion in the new orleans area and along the mississippi coast  and is the costliest u s hurricane on record storm surge flooding of 25 to 28 feet above normal tide levels was associated with katrina more dennis 2005  slosh historical run dennis affected much of florida and its effects extended well inland over portions of the southeastern united states with the maximum amount rainfall of 1280 inches occuring near camden alabama storm surge flooding of 79 ft produced considerable storm surgerelated damage near st marks florida well to the east of the landfall location the damage associated with dennis in the united states is estimated at 223 billion more isabel 2003  slosh historical run isabel was the worst hurricane to affect the chesapeake bay region since 1933 storm surge values of more than 8 feet flooded rivers that flowed into the bay across virginia maryland delaware and washington d c isabel was the most intense hurricane of the 2003 season and directly resulted in 17 deaths and more than 3 billion in damages more opal 1995  slosh historical run hurricane opal made landfall near pensacola beach florida as a category 3 hurricane the storm caused extensive storm surge damage from pensacola beach to mexico beach a span of 120 miles with a maximum storm tide of 24 feet recorded near fort walton beach damage estimates for opal were near 3 billion more hugo 1989  slosh historical run hugo impacted the southeastern united states including south carolina cities charleston and myrtle beach hugo was responsible for 60 deaths and 7 billion in damages with the highest storm surge estimated at 198 feet at romain retreat south carolina more camille 1969  slosh historical run camille was a category 5 hurricane the most powerful on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale with maximum winds of more than 155 mph and storm surge flooding of 24 feet that devastated the mississippi coast the final death count for the u s is listed at 256 this includes 143 on the gulf coast and another 113 from the virginia floods more audrey 1957  slosh historical run there were 390 deaths associated with audrey as the result of a storm surge in excess of 12 feet which inundated the flat coast of southwestern louisiana as far as 25 miles inland in some places more new england 1938  slosh historical run the long island express was a fastmoving category 3 hurricane that struck long island and new england with little warning on september 21 a storm surge of 10 to 12 ft inundated the coasts of rhode island connecticut southeastern massachusetts and long island ny especially in narragansett bay and buzzards bay six hundred people died due to the storm more galveston 1900  slosh historical run at least 8000 people died when hurricane storm tides the surge plus the astronomical tide of 815 feet inundated most of the island city of galveston tx and adjacent areas on the mainland more surge vulnerability facts from 19902008
