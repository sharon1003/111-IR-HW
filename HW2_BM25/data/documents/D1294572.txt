family cobitidae they are native to east asia but are also popular as an aquarium fish and introduced elsewhere in asia and to europe north america and australia 1 2 the alternate name weather loach is shared with several other cobitidae including the other members of the genus misgurnus and the spotted weather loach  cobitis taenia commonly known as spined loach this term comes from their ability to detect changes in barometric pressure and react with frantic swimming or standing on end this is because before a storm the barometric pressure changes and this is known to make these fish more active the pond loach also comes in a variety of colors such as pink orange albino and gray contents  hide 1 description2 in the aquarium3 as food4 see also5 references6 bibliography7 external links description  editlike many other loaches pond loaches are slender and eellike they can vary in colour from yellow to olive green to a common light brown or grey with lighter undersides the mouth of the loach is surrounded by three sets of barbels it uses them to sift through silt or pebbles to find food it also uses them to dig under gravel and sand to conceal itself out of nervousness or defence unlike the other loaches who use the spines beneath the eyes they can grow up to 12 inches 305 cm long the fish are bottomdwelling scavengers feeding mainly on organic material such as algae pond loaches are omnivorous and may also feed on tubifex worms and other small aquatic organisms by producing a layer of mucus to keep themselves damp they can survive short periods of desiccation they are very hardy fish that can live in poor quality water in the aquarium  editorange misgurnus anguillicaudatus side view of a pink loach weather loach m anguillicaudatus macro pond loaches are active peaceful and hardy fish that are sometimes used as starter fish in an aquarium they can be friendly towards humans allowing physical contact and hand feeding they are extremely peaceful they get along well with goldfish  citation neededthe loaches will be more active given more space and greater numbers solitary pond loaches tend to spend much of their time hiding they will spend a lot of time hiding or staying still but should be given a place to stay which will have cover and shade tank decorations that they can swim through and driftwood both work great for this due to their jumping ability the average cover should be enhanced with tape or other barriers however if you happen to find your loach black and dry on the floor one morning try placing it back in the aquarium usually it will revive and swim away and make a full recovery in some cases it has been reported that they can live up to three days out of a tank  citation needed also they may even travel up tubes and take up residence in filters so check there if your pond loach does not show up for roll call one day pond loaches enjoy digging and burrowing themselves in the substrate of their tank so make sure that your substrate is fine enough for them to dig in if you keep live plants in your tank they will be uprooted by the loaches so it is a good idea to weight your plants the pond loach is also peculiar in that it will sometimes bury itself in the substrate during times of stress this often surprises new owners as the fish will disappear shortly after introduction to the tank only to reappear later because of their appetite for snails these loaches can help alleviate snail infestations in tropical fish tanks though many have reported that while pond loaches do eat snails they do not eat them at a fast enough rate to deal with an infestation the fish prefer a p h of 6580 but will tolerate far more acidic conditions even for extended amounts of time with little negative reaction this makes the pond loach a great choice for firsttime aquariums and for those who want a fish tank but do not want the intense daily attention other fish require this fish should be kept in groups of at least 3 as they like to be in physical contact with each other and feel each other with their barbels when they rest one trait which distinguishes the pond loach from most other tropical fish commonly seen at aquarium speciality shops and pet stores is the fact that they thrive at room temperature 6872° f 2023° c and can do well even at temperatures as low as the upper 50s fahrenheit 1315° celsius  the usual tropical temperature will result in a significantly reduced lifespan from an average 10 years to four or less purchasers often presume when buying tropical freshwater fish that all species will thrive in the typical for home freshwater aquarium installations 7682 °f  2428 °c range this presumption is incorrect in the case of the pond loach there are other varieties bred from captivity like the gold strain and the peppered strain not to be confused with the pepper loach sometimes the pond loach especially the golden variety is mistaken for the kuhli loach the kuhli however likes warm tropical temperatures will tolerate more acidic conditions and matures at a much smaller four inches 10 cm although these two species have numerous differentiating traits individual kuhli and pond loaches may resemble each other while young and at the usual age and size of what most fish stores market as food  editloaches cooked in a pot at komagata dozeu tokyo japan the pond loach is a common
