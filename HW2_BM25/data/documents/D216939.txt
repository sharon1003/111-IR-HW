among the most famous and influential figures in the history of western art in just over a decade he created about 2100 artworks including around 860 oil paintings most of them in the last two years of his life they include landscapes still lifes portraits and selfportraits and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art his suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty born into an uppermiddleclass family van gogh drew as a child and was serious quiet and thoughtful as a young man he worked as an art dealer often travelling but became depressed after he was transferred to london he turned to religion and spent time as a protestant missionary in southern belgium he drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881 having moved back home with his parents his younger brother theo supported him financially and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter his early works mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work in 1886 he moved to paris where he met members of the avantgarde including émile bernard and paul gauguin who were reacting against the impressionist sensibility as his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes his paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in arles in the south of france in 1888 during this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees wheat fields and sunflowers van gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability he often neglected his physical health did not eat properly and drank heavily his friendship with gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when in a rage he severed part of his own left ear he spent time in psychiatric hospitals including a period at saintrémy after he discharged himself and moved to the auberge ravoux in auverssuroise near paris he came under the care of the homoeopathic doctor paul gachet his depression continued and on 27 july 1890 van gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver he died from his injuries two days later van gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime and was considered a madman and a failure he became famous after his suicide and exists in the public imagination as the quintessential misunderstood genius the artist where discourses on madness and creativity converge 6 his reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the fauves and german expressionists he attained widespread critical commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist contents  hide 1 letters2 life21 early years22 etten

gallery in the hague 7 theo pictured right in 1878 was a lifelong supporter and friend to his brother the most comprehensive primary source on van gogh is the correspondence between him and his younger brother theo their lifelong friendship and most of what is known of vincents thoughts and theories of art are recorded in the hundreds of letters they exchanged from 1872 until 1890 8 theo van gogh was an art dealer and provided his brother with financial and emotional support and access to influential people on the contemporary art scene 9theo kept all of vincents letters to him 10 vincent kept few of the letters he received after both had died theos widow johanna arranged for the publication of some of their letters a few appeared in 1906 and 1913 the majority were published in 1914 11 12 vincents letters are eloquent and expressive and have been described as having a diarylike intimacy 9 and read in parts like autobiography 9 the translator arnold pomerans wrote that their publication adds a fresh dimension to the understanding of van goghs artistic achievement an understanding granted us by virtually no other painter 13there are more than 600 letters from vincent to theo and around 40 from theo to vincent there are 22 to his sister wil 58 to the painter anthon van rappard 22 to émile bernard as well as individual letters to paul signac paul gauguin and the critic albert aurier some are illustrated with sketches 9 many are undated but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order problems in transcription and dating remain mainly with those posted from arles while there vincent wrote around 200 letters in dutch french and english 14 there is a gap in the record when he lived in paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond 15life main article vincent van gogh chronology early years see also van goghs family in his art vincent willem van gogh was born on 30 march 1853 into a dutch reformed family in grootzundert in the predominantly catholic province of north brabant in the southern netherlands 16 he was the oldest surviving child of theodorus van gogh a minister of the dutch reformed church and anna cornelia carbentus van gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth note 2 vincent was a common name in the van gogh family his grandfather vincent 1789–1874 who received a degree in theology at the university of leiden in 1811 had six sons three of whom became art dealers this vincent may have been named after his own greatuncle a sculptor 1729–1802 18van goghs mother came from a prosperous family in the hague 19 and his father was the youngest son of a minister 20 the two met when annas younger sister cornelia married theodoruss older brother vincent cent van goghs parents married in may 1851 and moved to zundert 21 his brother theo was born on 1 may 1857 there was another brother cor and three sisters elisabeth anna and willemina known as wil in later life van gogh remained in touch only with willemina and theo 22 van goghs mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised the importance of family to the point of claustrophobia for those around her 23 theodoruss salary was modest but the church supplied the family with a house a maid two cooks a gardener a carriage and horse and anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the familys high social position 24vincent c 1866 about 13 years old van gogh was a serious and thoughtful child 25 he was taught at home by his mother and a governess and in 1860 was sent to the village school in 1864 he was placed in a boarding school at zevenbergen 26 where he felt abandoned and campaigned to come home instead in 1866 his parents sent him to the middle school in tilburg where he was deeply unhappy 27 his interest in art began at a young age he was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother 28 and his early drawings are expressive 26 but do not approach the intensity of his later work 29 constant cornelis huijsmans who had been a successful artist in paris taught the students at tilburg his philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things particularly nature or common objects van goghs profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons which had little effect 30 in march 1868 he abruptly returned home he later wrote that his youth was austere and cold and sterile 31in july 1869 van goghs uncle cent obtained a position for him at the art dealers goupil  cie in the hague 32 after completing his training in 1873 he was transferred to goupils london branch at southampton street and took lodgings at 87 hackford road stockwell 33 this was a happy time for van gogh he was successful at work and at 20 was earning more than his father theos wife later remarked that this was the best year of vincents life he became infatuated with his landladys daughter eugénie loyer but was rejected after confessing his feelings she was secretly engaged to a former lodger he grew more isolated and religiously fervent his father and uncle arranged a transfer to paris in 1875 where he became resentful of issues such as the degree to which the firm commodified art and was dismissed a year later 34van goghs home in cuesmes while there he decided to become an artist in april 1876 he returned to england to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in ramsgate when the proprietor moved to isleworth in middlesex van gogh went with him 35 36 the arrangement did not work out and he left to become a methodist ministers assistant 37 his parents had meanwhile moved to etten 38 in 1876 he returned home at christmas for six months and took work at a bookshop in dordrecht he was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the bible into english french and german 39 he immersed himself in religion and became increasingly pious and monastic 40 according to his flatmate of the time paulus van görlitz van gogh ate frugally avoiding meat 41to support his religious conviction and his desire to become a pastor in 1877 the family sent him to live with his uncle johannes stricker a respected theologian in amsterdam 42 van gogh prepared for the university of amsterdam theology entrance examination 43 he failed the exam and left his uncles house in july 1878 he undertook but also failed a threemonth course at a protestant missionary school in laken near brussels 44in january 1879 he took up a post as a missionary at petitwasmes 45 in the coalmining district of borinage in belgium to show support for his impoverished congregation he gave up his comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person and moved to a small hut where he slept on straw 46 his squalid living conditions did not endear him to church authorities who dismissed him for undermining the dignity of the priesthood he then walked the 75 kilometres 47 mi to brussels 47 returned briefly to cuesmes in the borinage but gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to etten he stayed there until around march 1880 note 3 which caused concern and frustration for his parents his father was especially frustrated and advised that his son should be committed to the lunatic asylum at geel 49 50 note 4van gogh returned to cuesmes in august 1880 where he lodged with a miner until october 52 he became interested in the people and scenes around him and recorded them in drawings after theos suggestion that he take up art in earnest he travelled to brussels later in the year to follow theos recommendation that he study with the dutch artist willem roelofs who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the académie royale des beauxarts he registered at the académie in november 1880 where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective 53etten drenthe and the hague see

neighbours as subjects in august 1881 his recently widowed cousin cornelia kee vosstricker daughter of his mothers older sister willemina and johannes stricker arrived for a visit he was thrilled and took long walks with her kee was seven years older than he was and had an eightyearold son van gogh surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage 55 she refused with the words no nay never  nooit neen nimmer  56 after kee returned to amsterdam van gogh went to the hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin anton mauve mauve was the successful artist van gogh longed to be 57 mauve invited him to return in a few months and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels van gogh went back to etten and followed this advice 57late in november 1881 van gogh wrote a letter to johannes stricker one which he described to theo as an attack 58 within days he left for amsterdam 59 kee would not meet him and her parents wrote that his persistence is disgusting  60 in despair he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp with the words let me see her for as long as i can keep my hand in the flame 60 61 he did not recall the event well but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame kees father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry largely because of van goghs inability to support himself 62mauve took van gogh on as a student and introduced him to watercolour which he worked on for the next month before returning home for christmas 63 he quarrelled with his father refusing to attend church and left for the hague note 5 66 within a month van gogh and mauve fell out possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts 67 van gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models a practice of which mauve seems to have disapproved 68 in june van gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital 69 soon after he first painted in oils 70 bought with money borrowed from theo he liked the medium and spread the paint liberally scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush he wrote that he was surprised at how good the results were 71rooftops view from the atelier the hague 1882 private collection by march 1882 mauve appears to have gone cold towards van gogh and stopped replying to his letters 72 he had learned of van goghs new domestic arrangement with an alcoholic prostitute clasina maria sien hoornik 1850–1904 and her young daughter 73 van gogh had met sien towards the end of january 1882 when she had a fiveyearold daughter and was pregnant she had previously borne two children who died but van gogh was unaware of this 74 on 2 july she gave birth to a baby boy willem 75 when van goghs father discovered the details of their relationship he put pressure on his son to abandon sien and her two children vincent at first defied him 76 and considered moving the family out of the city but in late 1883 he left sien and the children 77poverty may have pushed sien back into prostitution the home became less happy and van gogh may have felt family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development sien gave her daughter to her mother and baby willem to her brother 78 willem remembered visiting rotterdam when he was about 12 when an uncle tried to persuade sien to marry to legitimise the child 79 he believed van gogh was his father but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely 80 sien drowned herself in the river scheldt in 1904 81in september 1883 van gogh moved to drenthe in

focused on painting and drawing working outside and very quickly he completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages 82 from august 1884 margot begemann a neighbours daughter ten years his senior joined him on his forays she fell in love and he reciprocated though less enthusiastically they wanted to marry but neither side of their families were in favour margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine but survived after van gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital 75 on 26 march 1885 his father died of a heart attack 83van gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885 84 during his twoyear stay in nuenen he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly 200 oil paintings his palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones particularly dark brown and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguish his later work 85there was interest from a dealer in paris early in 1885 86 theo asked vincent if he had paintings ready to exhibit 87 in may van gogh responded with his first major work the potato eaters and a series of  peasant character studies  which were the culmination of several years of work 88 when he complained that theo was not making enough effort to sell his paintings in paris his brother responded that they were too dark and not in keeping with the bright style of impressionism 85 in august his work was publicly exhibited for the first time in the shop windows of the dealer leurs in the hague one of his young peasant sitters became pregnant in september 1885 van gogh was accused of forcing himself upon her and the

ontario toronto he moved to antwerp that november and rented a room above a paint dealers shop in the rue des images  lange beeldekensstraat  91 he lived in poverty and ate poorly preferring to spend the money theo sent on painting materials and models bread coffee and tobacco became his staple diet in february 1886 he wrote to theo that he could only remember eating six hot meals since the previous may his teeth became loose and painful 92 in antwerp he applied himself to the study of colour theory and spent time in museums—particularly studying the work of peter paul rubens – and broadened his palette to include carmine cobalt blue and emerald green van gogh bought japanese ukiyoe woodcuts in the docklands later incorporating elements of their style into the background of some of his paintings 93 he was drinking heavily again 94 and was hospitalised between february and march 1886 95 when he was possibly also treated for syphilis 96 note 6after his recovery and despite his antipathy towards academic teaching he took the higherlevel admission exams at the academy of fine arts in antwerp and in january 1886 matriculated in painting and drawing he became ill and run down by overwork poor diet and excessive smoking 99 he started to attend drawing classes after plaster models at the antwerp academy on 18 january 1886 he quickly got into trouble with charles verlat the director of the academy and teacher of a painting class because of his unconventional painting style van gogh had also clashed with the instructor of the drawing class franz vinck van gogh finally started to attend the drawing classes after antique plaster models given by eugène siberdt soon siberdt and van gogh came into conflict when the latter did not comply with siberdts requirement that drawings express the contour and concentrate on the line when van gogh was required to draw the venus of milo during a drawing class he produced the limbless naked torso of a flemish peasant woman siberdt regarded this as defiance against his artistic guidance and made corrections to van goghs drawing with his crayon so vigorously that he tore the paper van gogh then flew into a violent rage and shouted at siberdt you clearly do not know what a young woman is like god damn it a woman must have hips buttocks a pelvis in which she can carry a baby according to some accounts this was the last time van gogh attended classes at the academy and he left later for paris 100 on 31 march 1886 which was about a month after the confrontation with siberdt the teachers of the academy decided that 17 students including van gogh had to repeat a year the story that van gogh was expelled from the academy by siberdt is therefore unfounded 101paris 1886–88see also japonaiserie van gogh and

acquaintances still life paintings views of le moulin de la galette scenes in montmartre asnières and along the seine in 1885 in antwerp he had become interested in japanese ukiyoe woodblock prints

adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack particularly in paintings such as his seascape at saintesmaries 1888 104 105 two years later vincent and theo paid for the publication of a book on monticelli paintings and vincent bought some of monticellis works to add to his collection 106van gogh learned about fernand cormon s atelier from theo 107 he worked at the studio in april and may 1886 108 where he frequented the circle of the australian artist john peter russell 109 and met fellow students émile bernard louis anquetin and henri de toulouselautrec – who painted a portrait of him in pastel they met at julien père tanguy s paint shop 108 which was at that time the only place where paul cézanne s paintings were displayed in 1886 two large exhibitions were staged there showing pointillism and neoimpressionism for the first time and bringing attention to georges seurat and paul signac theo kept a stock of impressionist paintings in his gallery on boulevard montmartre but van gogh was slow to acknowledge the new developments in art 110conflicts arose between the brothers at the end of 1886 theo found living with vincent to be almost unbearable 108 by early 1887 they were again at peace and vincent had moved to asnières a northwestern suburb of paris where he got to know signac he adopted elements of pointillism a technique in which a multitude of small coloured dots are applied to the canvas so that when seen from a distance they create an optical blend of hues the style stresses the ability of complementary colours – including blue and orange – to form vibrant contrasts 87 108le moulin de blutefin 1886 from the le moulin de la galette and montmartre series bridgestone museum of art tokyo f273courtesan after eisen  1887 van gogh museum amsterdam

paris 111 towards the end of the year vincent arranged an exhibition alongside bernard anquetin and probably toulouselautrec at the grandbouillon restaurant du chalet 43 avenue de clichy montmartre in a contemporary account bernard wrote that the exhibition was ahead of anything else in paris 112 there bernard and anquetin sold their first paintings and van gogh exchanged work with gauguin discussions on art artists and their social situations started during this exhibition continued and expanded to include visitors to the show like camille pissarro and his son lucien signac and seurat in february 1888 feeling worn out from life in paris van gogh left having painted more than 200 paintings during his two years there hours before his departure accompanied by theo he paid his first

van gogh museum amsterdam ill from drink and suffering from smokers cough in february 1888 van gogh sought refuge in arles 14 he seems to have moved with thoughts of founding an art colony the danish artist christian mourierpetersen became his companion for two months and at first arles appeared exotic in a letter he described it as a foreign country the zouaves the brothels the adorable little arlésienne going to her first communion the priest in his surplice who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros the people drinking absinthe all seem to me creatures from another world 114the time in arles became one of van goghs more prolific periods he completed 200 paintings and more than 100 drawings and watercolours 115 he was enchanted by the local landscape and light his works from this period are rich in yellow ultramarine and mauve his paintings include harvests wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area including the old mill 1888 a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields 116 this was one of seven canvases sent to pontaven on 4 october 1888 in an exchange of works with paul gauguin émile bernard charles laval and others 116the portrayals of the arles landscape are informed by van goghs dutch upbringing the patchworks of fields and avenues appear flat and lacking perspective but excel in their use of colour 117 his newfound appreciation is seen in the range and scope of his work in march 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded perspective frame three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the société des artistes indépendants in april he was visited by the american artist dodge mac knight who was living nearby at fontvieille 118 119 on 1 may 1888 for 15 francs per month he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the yellow house at 2 place lamartine the rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months 120on 7 may van gogh moved from the hôtel carrel to the café de la gare 121 having befriended the proprietors joseph and marie ginoux the yellow house had to be furnished before he could fully move in but he was able to use it as a studio 122 he wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included van goghs chair 1888 bedroom in arles 1888 the night café 1888 café terrace at night september 1888 starry night over the rhone 1888 and still life vase with twelve sunflowers 1888 all intended for the decoration for the yellow house 123van gogh wrote that with the night café he tried to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself go mad or commit a crime 124 when he visited saintesmariesdelamer in june he gave lessons to a zouave second lieutenant – pauleugène milliet 125 – and painted boats on the sea and the village 126 mac knight introduced

a starry sky 127 note 7in preparation for gauguins visit van gogh bought two beds on advice from the stations postal supervisor joseph roulin whose portrait he painted on 17 september he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished yellow house 129 when gauguin consented to work and live in arles with him van gogh started to work on the décoration for the yellow house probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook 130 he completed two chair paintings van goghs chair and gauguins chair 131after much pleading from van gogh gauguin arrived in arles on 23 october and in november the two painted together gauguin depicted van gogh in his the painter of sunflowers van gogh painted pictures from memory following gauguins suggestion among these imaginative paintings is memory of the garden at etten 132 note 8 their first joint outdoor venture was at the alyscamps when they produced the pendants les alyscamps 133 the single painting gauguin completed during his visit was van gogh painting sunflowers 134van gogh and gauguin visited montpellier in december 1888 where they saw works by courbet and delacroix in the musée fabre 135 their relationship began to deteriorate van gogh admired gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal but gauguin was arrogant and domineering which frustrated van gogh they often quarrelled van gogh increasingly feared that gauguin was going to desert him and the situation which van gogh described as one of excessive tension rapidly headed towards crisis point 136the night café 1888 yale university art gallery new haven connecticut the

known gauguin stated fifteen years later that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour 138 their relationship was complex and theo may have owed money to gauguin who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially 139 it seems likely that van gogh had realised that gauguin was planning to leave 139 the following days saw heavy rain leading to the two men being shut in the yellow house 140 gauguin reported that van gogh followed when gauguin left the house for a walk and rushed towards me an open razor in his hand 140 this account is uncorroborated 141 gauguin was almost certainly absent from the yellow house that night most likely in a hotel 140after the altercation with gauguin van gogh returned to his room where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor either wholly or in part accounts differ note 9 causing severe bleeding 142 he bandaged the wound wrapped the ear in paper and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel van gogh and gauguin both frequented 142 van gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital 145 146 where félix rey a young doctor still in training treated him the ear was delivered to the hospital but rey did not attempt to reattach it as too much time had passed 140van gogh had no recollection of the event suggesting that he may have suffered an acute mental breakdown 147 the hospital diagnosis was acute mania with generalised delirium 148 and within a few days the local police ordered that he be placed in hospital care 149 150 gauguin immediately notified theo who on 24 december had proposed marriage to his old friend andries bonger s sister johanna 151 that evening theo rushed to the station to board a night train to arles he arrived on christmas day and comforted vincent who seemed to be semilucid that evening he left arles for the return trip to paris 152during the first days of his treatment van gogh repeatedly and unsuccessfully asked for gauguin who asked a policeman attending the case to be kind enough monsieur to awaken this man with great care and if he asks for me tell him i have left for paris the sight of me might prove fatal for him 153 gauguin fled arles never to see van gogh again they continued to correspond and in 1890 gauguin proposed they form a studio in antwerp other visitors to the hospital included marie ginoux and roulin 154despite a pessimistic diagnosis van gogh recovered and returned to the yellow house on 7 january 1889 155 he spent the following month between hospital and home suffering from hallucinations and delusions of poisoning 156 in march the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople including the ginoux family who described him as le fou roux  the redheaded madman  149 van gogh returned to hospital paul signac visited him twice in march 157 in april van gogh moved into rooms owned by dr rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home 158 two months later he left arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in saintrémydeprovence around this time he wrote sometimes moods of indescribable anguish sometimes moments when

windows one of which was he used as a studio 162 the clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings he made several studies of the hospitals interiors such as vestibule of the asylum and saintrémy september 1889 some of his works from this time are characterised by swirls such as the starry night he was allowed short supervised walks during which time he painted cypresses and olive trees including olive trees with the alpilles in the background 1889 cypresses 1889 cornfield with cypresses 1889 country road in provence by night 1890 in september 1889 he produced two further versions of bedroom in arles 163limited access to life outside the clinic resulted in a shortage of subject matter van gogh instead worked on interpretations of other artists paintings such as millet s the sower and noonday rest and variations on his own earlier work van gogh was an admirer of the realism of jules breton gustave courbet and millet 164 and he compared his copies to a musicians

was still able to paint and draw a little during this time 168 and he later wrote to theo that he had made a few small canvases from memory  reminisces of the north  169 among these was two peasant women digging in a snowcovered field at sunset hulsker believes that this small group of paintings formed the nucleus of many drawings and study sheets depicting landscapes and figures that van gogh worked on during this time he comments that this short period was the only time that van goghs illness had a significant effect on his work 170 van gogh asked his mother and his brother to send him drawings and rough work he had done in the early 1880s so he could work on new paintings from his old sketches 171 belonging to this period is sorrowing old man at eternitys gate a colour study hulsker describes as another unmistakable remembrance of times long past 90 172 his late paintings show an artist at the height of his abilities according to the art critic robert hughes longing for

lautrec surrendered de groux apologised for the slight and left the group later while van goghs exhibit was on display with the artistes indépendants in paris claude monet said that his work was the

artists death in may 1890 van gogh left the clinic in saintrémy to move nearer to both dr paul gachet in auverssuroise and to theo gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists –

of which is likely his final work 178the church at auvers 1890 musée dorsay paris during his last weeks at saintrémy his thoughts returned to  memories of the north  169 and several of the approximately 70 oils painted during as many days in auverssuroise are reminiscent of northern scenes 179 in june 1890 he painted several portraits of his doctor including portrait of dr gachet and his only etching in each the emphasis is on gachets melancholic disposition 180 there are other paintings which are probably unfinished including thatched cottages by a hill 178in july van gogh wrote that he had become absorbed in the immense plain against the hills boundless as the sea delicate yellow 181 he had first become captivated by the fields in may when the wheat was young and green in july he described to theo vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies 182he wrote that they represented his sadness and extreme loneliness and that the canvases will tell you what i cannot say in words that is how healthy and invigorating i find the countryside 183 wheatfield with crows from july 1890 is a painting hulsker discusses as being associated with melancholy and extreme loneliness 184

died 30 hours after the incident 160 the shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting or a local barn 188 the bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably stopped by his spine he was able to walk back to the auberge ravoux where he was attended to by two doctors but without a surgeon present the bullet could not be removed the doctors tended to him as best they could then left him alone in his room smoking his pipe the following morning theo rushed to his brothers side finding him in good spirits but within hours vincent began to fail suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the wound he died in the early hours of 29 july according to theo vincents last words were the sadness will last forever 189 190 191 192vincent and theos graves at auverssuroise van gogh was buried on 30 july in the municipal cemetery of auverssuroise the funeral was attended by theo van gogh andries bonger charles laval lucien pissarro émile bernard julien tanguy and paul gachet among twenty family friends and locals theo had been ill and his health began to decline further after his brothers death weak and unable to come to terms with vincents absence he died on 25 january 1891 at den dolder and was buried in utrecht 193 in 1914 johanna van goghbonger had theos body exhumed and moved from utrecht to be reburied alongside vincents at auverssuroise 194there have been numerous debates as to the nature of van goghs illness and its effect on his work and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed the consensus is that van gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning 195 perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947 196 and this has been supported by the psychiatrists hemphill and blumer 197 198 biochemist wilfred arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious 195 temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested 198 whatever the diagnosis his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition overwork insomnia and alcohol 198style and works artistic development starry night over the rhone 1888 musée dorsay paris van gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged 199 when he took up art as an adult he began at an elementary level in early 1882 his uncle cornelis marinus owner of a wellknown gallery of contemporary art in amsterdam asked for drawings of the hague van goghs work did not live up to expectations marinus offered a second commission specifying the subject matter in detail but was again disappointed with the result van gogh persevered he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters and with different drawing materials for more than a year he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black and white note 11 which at the time gained him only criticism later they were recognised as early masterpieces 201in august 1882 theo gave vincent money to buy materials for working en plein air vincent wrote that he could now go on painting with new vigour 202 from early 1883 he worked on multifigure compositions he had some of them photographed but when his brother remarked that they lacked liveliness and freshness he destroyed them and turned to oil painting van gogh turned to wellknown hague school artists like weissenbruch and blommers and received technical advice from them as well as from painters like de bock and van der weele both of the hague schools second generation 203 when he moved to nuenen after the period in drenthe he began several large paintings but destroyed most of them the potato eaters and its companion pieces are the only ones to have survived 203 following a visit to the rijksmuseum van gogh wrote of his admiration for the quick economical brushwork of the dutch masters especially rembrandt and frans hals 204 note 12 he was aware that many of his faults were due to lack of experience and technical expertise 203 so in november 1885 he travelled to antwerp and later paris to learn and develop his skills 205olive trees with the alpilles in the background 1889 museum of modern art new york theo criticised the potato eaters for its dark palette which he thought unsuitable for a modern style 206 during van goghs stay in paris between 1886 and 1887 he tried to master a new lighter palette his portrait of père tanguy 1887 shows his success with the brighter palette and is evidence of an evolving personal style 207charles blanc s treatise on colour interested him greatly and led him to work with complementary colours van gogh came to believe that the effect of colour went beyond the descriptive he said that colour expresses something in itself 208 209 according to hughes van gogh perceived colour as having a psychological and moral weight as exemplified in the garish reds and greens of the night cafe a work he wanted to express the terrible passions of humanity 210 yellow meant the most to him because it symbolised emotional truth he used yellow as a symbol for sunlight life and god 211van gogh strove to be a painter of rural life and nature 212 and during his first summer in arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and traditional rural life 213 his belief that a power existed behind the natural led him to try to capture a sense of that power or the essence of nature in his art sometimes through the use of symbols 214 his renditions of the sower at first copied from jeanfrançois millet reflect van goghs religious beliefs the sower as christ sowing life beneath the hot sun 215 these were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop 216 his paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism but rather than use traditional christian iconography he made up his own where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life 217 in arles having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight he was ready to paint the sower 208memory of the garden at etten 1888 hermitage museum st petersburg van gogh stayed within what he called the guise of reality 218 and was critical of overly stylised works 219 he wrote afterwards that the abstraction of starry night had gone too far and that reality had receded too far in the background 219 hughes describes it as a moment of extreme visionary ecstasy the stars are in a great whirl reminiscent of hokusai s great wave the movement in the heaven above is reflected by the movement of the cypress on the earth below and the painters vision is translated into a thick emphatic plasma of paint 220between 1885 and his death in 1890 van gogh appears to have been building an oeuvre 221 a collection that reflected his personal vision and could be commercially successful he was influenced by blancs definition of style that a true painting required optimal use of colour perspective and brushstrokes van gogh applied the word purposeful to paintings he thought he had mastered as opposed to those he thought of as studies 222 he painted many series of studies 218 most of which were still lifes many executed as colour experiments or as gifts to friends 223 the work in arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre those he thought the most important from that time were the sower night cafe memory of the garden in etten and starry night with their broad brushstrokes inventive perspectives colours contours and designs these paintings represent the style he sought 219major series main article list of works by vincent van gogh larlésienne madame ginoux with books november 1888 metropolitan museum of art new york van goghs stylistic developments are usually linked to the periods he spent living in different places across europe he was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout his evolution as an artist was slow and he was aware of his painterly limitations he moved home often perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli and through exposure develop his technical skill 224 art historian melissa mc quillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes and that van gogh used the moves to avoid conflict and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation 225portraits see also portraits by vincent van gogh paintings of children van gogh series and van goghs family in his art the portraits gave van gogh his best opportunity to earn he believed they were the only thing in painting that moves me deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite 223 226 he wrote to his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character rather than aiming for photographic realism 227 those closest to van gogh are mostly absent from his portraits he rarely painted theo van rappard or bernard the portraits of his mother were from photographs 228in december 1888 he painted la berceuse – a figure that he thought as good as his sunflowers it has a limited palette varied brushstrokes and simple contours 219 it appears to be a culmination of portraits of the roulin family completed in arles between november and december the portraits show a shift in style from the fluid restrained brushstrokes and even surface of portrait of the postman to the frenetic style rough surface broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in madame roulin with baby

musée dorsay paris van gogh created more than 43 selfportraits between 1885 and 1889 230 note 13 they were usually completed in series such as those painted in paris in mid1887 and continued until shortly before his death 231 generally the portraits were studies created during introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others or when he lacked models and so painted himself 223 232the selfportraits reflect an unusually high degree of selfscrutiny 233 often they were intended to mark important periods in his life for example the mid1887 paris series were painted at the point where he became aware of claude monet paul cezanne and signac 234 in selfportrait with grey felt hat heavy strains of paint spread outwards across the canvas it is one of his most renowned selfportraits of that period with its highly organized rhythmic brushstrokes and the novel halo derived from the neoimpressionist repertoire was what van gogh himself called a purposeful canvas 235they contain a wide array of physiognomical representations 230 van goghs mental and physical condition is usually apparent he may appear unkempt unshaven or with a neglected beard with deeply sunken eyes a weak jaw or having lost teeth some show him with full lips a long face or prominent skull or sharpened alert features his hair may be the usual red or at times ash coloured 230van goghs gaze is seldom directed at the viewer the portraits vary in intensity and colour and in those painted after december 1888 especially the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin 232 some depict the artist with a beard others without he can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear in only a few does he depict himself as a painter 230 those painted in saintrémy show the head from the right the side opposite his damaged ear as he painted himself reflected in his mirror 236 237selfportrait with grey felt hat winter 1887–88 van gogh museum amsterdam

paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground the second set was completed a year later in arles and is of bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light 241 both are built from thickly layered paintwork which according to the london national gallery evoke the texture of the seedheads 242in these series van gogh was not preoccupied by his usual interest in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion rather the two series are intended to display his technical skill and working methods to gauguin 134 who was about to visit the 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist vincent wrote to theo in august 1888 im painting with the gusto of a marseillais eating bouillabaisse which wont surprise you when its a question of painting large sunflowers  if i carry out this plan therell be a dozen or so panels the whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow i work on it all these mornings from sunrise because the flowers wilt quickly and its a matter of doing the whole thing in one go 243the sunflowers were painted to decorate the walls in anticipation of gauguins visit and van gogh placed individual works around the yellow houses guest room in arles gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the paris versions 134 after gauguins departure van gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the berceuse triptych and included them in his les xx in brussels exhibit today the major pieces of the series are among his best known celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tiein with the yellow house the expressionism of the brush strokes and their contrast against often dark backgrounds 244still life vase with twelve sunflowers august 1888 neue

should like to do something with them like my canvases of sunflowers he went on to say they are beautiful in line and proportion like an egyptian obelisk 248in mid1889 and at his sister wils request van gogh painted several smaller versions of wheat field with cypresses 249 the works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto and include the starry night in which cypresses dominate the foreground 246other works from this period include olive trees with the alpilles in the background 1889 about which in a letter to his brother van gogh wrote at last i have a landscape with olives

optimistic joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring they are delicately sensitive and unpopulated he painted swiftly and although he brought to this series a version of impressionism a strong sense of personal style began to emerge during this period the transience of the blossoming trees and the passing of the season seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in arles during the blossoming of the trees that spring he found a world of motifs that could not have been more japanese 251 vincent wrote to theo on 21 april 1888 that he had 10 orchards and one big painting of a cherry tree which ive spoiled 252during this period van gogh mastered the use of light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees as if they are the source of light – almost in a sacred manner 251 early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards including view of arles flowering orchards 253 van gogh was enthralled by the landscape and

depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at saintrémy 255many of the late paintings are sombre but essentially optimistic and right up to the time of van goghs death reflect his desire to return to lucid mental health yet some of his final works reflect his deepening concerns 256 257 writing in july 1890 from auvers van gogh said that he had become absorbed in the immense plain against the

expressive and literate and have been described as among the foremost 19thcentury writings of their kind 9 these began a compelling mythology of van gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young 280 in 1934 the novelist irving stone wrote a biographical novel of van goghs life titled lust for life based on van goghs letters to theo this novel and the 1956

based a series of paintings on reproductions of van goghs the painter on the road to tarascon the original of which was destroyed during the second world war bacon was inspired by an image he described as haunting and regarded van gogh as an alienated outsider a position which resonated with him bacon identified with van goghs theories of art and quoted lines written to theo  real painters

elements of his art such as the portrayal of pairs of male figures can be traced back to this 17 hulsker suggests that van gogh returned to the borinage and then back to etten in this period 48 see

signac who all saw van gogh after the bandages were removed maintained that only the earlobe had been removed 142 according to doiteau and leroy the diagonal cut removed the lobe and probably a little more 143 the policeman and rey both claimed van gogh severed the entire outer ear 142 rey repeated his account in 1930 writing a note for novelist irving stone and including a sketch of the line of the incision 144 the version intended for ginoux is lost it was an attempt to deliver this painting to her in arles that precipitated his february relapse 168 artists working in black and white eg for illustrated papers like the graphic or the illustrated london news were among van goghs favourites 200 van gogh 2009 letter 535 to theo van gogh nuenen on or about tuesday 13 october 1885 what particularly struck me when i saw the old dutch paintings again is that they were usually painted quickly that these great masters like hals rembrandt ruisdael – so many others – as far as possible just put it straight down – and didnt come back to it so very much and – this too please – that if it worked they left it alone above all i admired hands by rembrandt and hals – hands that lived but were not finished in the sense that people want to enforce nowadays  in the winter im going to explore various things regarding manner that i noticed in the old paintings i saw a great deal that i needed but this above all things – what they call – dashing off – you see thats what the old dutch painters did famously that – dashing off – with a few brushstrokes they wont hear of it now – but how true the results are rembrandt is one of the few major painters to exceed this volume of selfportraits producing over 50 but he did so over a fortyyear period 230 her husband had been the sole support
