editor’s note around the country at shoe stores and malls a scene repeated itself early friday morning teenagers went crazy trying to buy a pair of shoes it’s not a new scene the air jordan shoe has been stirring up shopping frenzies since it was introduced back in 1985 this year nike brought a 1996 design lighting a fire under fans once more to get a taste of what the original shoe craze was all about we looked back to dec 28 1985 and this piece from the post’s style section “crazy for the chic sneakers”the air jordan i was banned by the nba for violating a uniformity rule courtesy of nikean air jordan what’s an air jordan“what’s an air jordan” your 14yearold screams in disbelief it’s that hightop basketball shoe you probably bought your teenager a few months ago if you wince at the memory of the 65 price tag be consoled you’re not alone between 2 12 and 3 million other people bought the sneaker this year in a streetfad whirlwind that made it a legend at least in the annals of sports shoes and perhaps in the annals of feet the shoe has brought nike about 105 million since last march according to the company “it’s far and away the most successful shoe in the history of athletic footwear” says chris van dyke of nike “we would have considered it successful if we had made 2 million to 8 million the first year”in its 10month sales blitz the air jordan far outdistanced even the stan smith tennis shoe which has sold about 7 million pairs over a period of more than 10 years according to david falk senior vice president of pro serv the sports management company that represents both jordan and smith it all started on oct 15 1984 at a preseason game when the chicago bulls’ heroic michael jordan landed on the court sporting his team’s colors on the most unlikely looking pair of hightops  black leather with a red nike “swoosh” stripe and red laces as legend goes the nba soon threatened to discipline the highjumping jordan there would be a fine of 5000 if he dared to play an nba game in those unorthodox things again wearing them was some kind of technical foul the nike air jordan logo rick bowmerapthe rest is shoe history the world of basketball watched jordan return to the court in modified shoes nike had added white a traditional basketball shoe color to the air jordan line then the nba said “okay okay we give in”since march parents around the country have been saying the same thing it is widely supposed that black urban teenagers were the air jordan trendsetters “in our business it’s all you do look at feet” says dave fogelson at adidas which is coming out with its own autograph patrick ewing shoe in may “and the kids in the urban areas are the first to recognize the new trendy shoe it’s very important to them it’s a part of their interests and culture and so they save up and buy these shoes”if the parents didn’t give in the kids themselves lined up with the cash to blow and according to phillip fenty owner of fleet feet in adamsmorgan the d c summer job program for young adults put many a kid in jordans “they were fashionconscious kids” fenty says from the city the craze spread to the suburbs and from the young it spread to the younger and to teens at heart in most cases claims the corps of shoe sales clerks the kids came in dragging their parents to the jordans many but not all parents were convinced one mother in silver spring says when the craze “for expensive tennis shoes started i put a ceiling of 35 on all my kids’ shoes”“they were a pretty priceinsensitive product when they first came out” says pete cain manager of the allnike store on m street about the rather hefty price tag of the shoes “but nobody was complaining about it people were so hot after the shoe that they didn’t care we got 65 pairs in midmarch which sold almost immediately    there really hasn’t been anything like it before which added to the excitement”now however “they’re just another basketball shoe on the shelf” says cain “they’re definitely not at their peak anymore the hysteria is gone”trying hard to keep the fad alive nike may be running rubber into the ground the company introduced all kinds of jordans in time for the holidays “sky jordans” for ages 5 to 11 and even hightop “baby jordans” in infant sizes and for those turned off by a hardtocoordinate blackandred pair of shoes there are new colors much more white with a timid blue swoosh nike’s van dyke explains that “the life cycle for shoes in this industry is getting shorter and shorter many companies aren’t going to be able to keep up with the pace we spend 80 million a year in product development just to keep up”the “air” in the air jordans is a snappy reference to both the basketball player with a reputation as a “flyer” and the “aircushioned” innersole that nike claims cushions the feet against shock“we tend not to see a problem with a shoe design until the shoes have been out two years” says dr paul taylor podiatrist for the washington bullets “but i don’t expect any with the air jordan because the aircushioned sole has been used on their running shoes very successfully”nike turned its focus to creating a better basketball shoe three years ago by incorporating improvements used in the company’s running shoes since 1978 “there’s more impact in basketball than in running and fortunately because of their popularity the shoe industry has decided to improve basketball shoes” adds taylor now he says “all the top shoes made by the major manufacturers are excellent” but need to be individually fitted because “everbody’s feet are different”coincidentally with the downtoearth trend of his namesake shoe michael jordan himself has been grounded lately the 6foot6 player has been recuperating since nov 4 from a broken navicular tarsal a tiny bone in his left foot the influence of the jordans on the athletic shoe industry however isn’t fading people have gotten used to the look of hightops in often strange teamcolor combinations reebok the biggest name in tennis and aerobic shoes this year has come out with a women’s hightop in solid colors and in the thin soft garment leather reebok has made popular although many women have been stealing over to the men’s shoe section for years fenty says “ reebok created a whole new market in women’s hightops    particularly in solid black”and probably because of the jordan team colors are big news for sneakers georgetown’s basketball team shoe is new this season in light gray with dark gray trim and “hoya” written on the back made for them by nike as part of its new “college colors program” it will be sold in area stores as well ten other colleges this year ordered teamcolor sneakers including st john’s syracuse north carolina state and villanova on a recent saturday patrick ewing stepped onto the madison square garden court for the first time wearing his new shoe no it’s not the “patrick ewing shoe” it’s called “the conductor” and ewing will wear it in the knicks’ team colors  royal blue and orange come this spring the teenagers’ new chant may be “patrick ewings gotta have ‘em gotta have ‘em gotta have ‘em”an earlier version of this blogpost story inaccurately reported that nike had brought back the original air jordan design it has brought back a 1996 design the story has been corrected
