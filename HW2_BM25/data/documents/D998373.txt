shipping or traveling with cremated remains traveling with cremated remains consumers flying with cremated remains should bear in mind several important issues before heading to the airport first it is not always reliable to place cremated remains in luggage as the luggage can get lost or damaged but carrying on a container with cremated remains will have to pass successfully through airport security scanners therefore you should know what kinds of containers are most likely to pass and what wont scanable containers— cardboard or fiberboard — cloth — plastic — transparent glass — and probably all wooden ones nonscanable urns— metal — stone such as granite — ceramic transportation security administration tsa workers are not permitted to open nonscanable urns and check through the contents therefore if you arrive at the airport with cremated remains that wont pass through security youre in danger of missing your flight other points to remember if the person is newly deceased and you are actively working with a cremation provider for the arrangements indicate that you want the cremated remains delivered to you in a nonmetalic shipping container even if your familys plans call for a more elaborate container to be used before final disposition you may transport an empty nonscanable cremation urn separately but it will be opened and inspected by tsa staff during the security check how do you get the cremated remains into the urn your family has chosen for final disposition while many families will welcome the active involvement of transferring cremated remains into a more memorial container before final ceremonies some may wish to ask for the help of a local clergy person consumer group or funeral home in that locale most funeral homes do not have a price on their price list for this service and there will be no charge those on the list of tsa funeral home partners are not the only ones available for this service other families find that the socalled temporary container is really quite sufficient for final disposition being deposited in a place unseen or because scattering is planned consumers who already have cremated remains in a nonscanable container but who need to travel with it will have to remove the cremated remains so each can be sent through security separately generally cremated remains will be in a plastic bag inside the urn making removal a relatively easy task other times there may be a narrow neck on the urn with no plastic bag inside in that case its a good idea to pour the cremated remains into a new plastic bag before boxing any simple cardboard box can be used to repackage them before heading for the airport if removing the cremated remains is too emotional for you by all means call on a local funeral provider member of the clergy or nonprofit group to assist you with the task a note of caution some of the tsas funeral home partners may have been lured by promises or hopes that joining the list would provide an opportunity to sell to survivors additional goods and services more than half the list are funeral homes owned by wall street corporations whose sales people may have monthly revenue quotas those arent the only funeral homes on the list and others have surely joined as a public service you the consumer be the judge shipping cremated remains if you are uncomfortable having the cremated remains taken from an urn you may wish to consider shipping the urn with contents intact to your final destination or perhaps you will not be traveling at all and need to make shipping arrangements anyway ups and fed ex will not knowingly accept cremated remains for shipment cremated remains may be shipped through the u s postal service but they must be shipped by priority mail express ask for delivery confirmation  they will no longer ship by registered mail it would be a good idea to doublebox the container with adequate stuffing between the two boxes to prevent any damage make sure the person on the receiving end is expecting the package and can travel to the post office to sign for it also dont just ship cremated remains to a cemetery and expect the cemetery to know what to do with them if you havent made advance arrangements
