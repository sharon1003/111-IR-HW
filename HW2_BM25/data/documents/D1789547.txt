funds which as the label implies means customers pay no commission to purchase the funds that’s the most of any of the brokerage houses we review to help investors home in on the funds that fit the bill etrade put out a quarterly allstar list that highlights the top choices according to the firm’s analysts if a customer wants to stray from the ntf fund list they’ll pay a reasonable 1995 commission which is competitive with most brokers the financial bar for getting started investing at etrade is pretty low its ira minimum is 0 and it’s still a low 500 for a regular brokerage account just note that individual funds set their own minimums so having enough to open an account isn’t the same as having enough money to buy into a mutual fund charles schwab appears on many of our best brokers lists including best brokers for beginners and best brokers for iras in the realm of mutual fund investing the company offers more than 4300 ntf mutual funds and the broker goes so far as to waive its steep 76 mutual fund commission on any funds it carries that charge sales loads an additional charge we recommend investors avoid schwab has removed the investment minimum on its own index

regularly updated lists of the best funds in various categories as evaluated either by morningstar for td ameritrade clients or in the case of merrill edge its inhouse investment pros fidelity and vanguard are no slouches in this category either with healthy lineups of notransactionfee funds — about 3700 and 2800 respectively along with etrade and charles schwab they deserve an honorable mention in this category buyers of ntf funds should be mindful of shortterm redemption fees in exchange for waiving the trading commission brokers expect investors to commit to holding the investment for a little while typically 30 to 90 days unload the fund any earlier and you’ll pay a penalty around 50 is pretty standard best brokers for costconscious investors these brokers serve two types of

a mutual fund mutual funds pull together two things — money from multiple investors and stocks bonds or other assets investors buy shares in the fund and their money is then pooled to purchase investments that align with the fund’s goal for investors mutual funds are a convenient way to instantly diversify even small amounts of money you might not be able to afford to purchase a share of each individual investment in a mutual fund — these funds often hold 100 investments or more even if you could afford it buying would take time and incur multiple transaction fees read our full mutual fund explainer for more details how much does a mutual fund cost that depends on the type of mutual fund you choose actively managed mutual funds employ a professional to invest and manage the fund’s assets that costs more than a passively managed fund such an index fund which skips the fund manager and instead selects its investments by copying a benchmark like the standard  poors 500 an sp 500 index fund aims to mirror the performance of the benchmark index in either case keeping wealtheroding fees at bay requires guarding against both high brokerage account fees and the costs that come with mutual funds themselves there are three common expenses associated with mutual funds transaction fees charged on the purchase or sale of the fund — and in some cases on both select a broker with a long list of notransactionfee mutual funds — like many of the ones we’ve recommended above — to avoid this cost early redemption fees charged by a broker for selling out of a fund in the first 60 to 90 days aim to hold your mutual funds as a longterm investment expense ratios this charge comes from the fund itself it’s an annual fee that is often higher on actively managed funds than passively managed funds expense ratios are expressed as a percentage of your investment a fund with a 1 expense ratio will cost 10 a year for every 1000 you invest you can’t avoid expense ratios but you can steer your money toward lowcost funds familiarizing yourself with the average mutual fund expense ratios will help you recognize if you’re paying too much how do you invest in mutual funds you can buy mutual funds at any online broker or directly through a fund company such as black rock or american funds we have some specific instructions about investing in mutual funds to help guide you in general online brokers will offer a larger and more diverse fund selection than direct purchase through a fund company if you don’t have an individual retirement account or brokerage account you’ll need to open one you can do that through any of the brokers mentioned above if you have an employersponsored retirement plan such as a 401 k it likely offers access to a small selection of mutual funds as well how much money do you need to invest in a mutual fund you’ll generally face two minimums a brokerage account minimum which typically falls between 0 and 2500 and the mutual fund minimum which may be 1000 or more these minimums are combined — if the broker allows you to fund an account with 1000 you can then invest that money in a mutual fund with a minimum of 1000 if that’s too big of an investment you might consider exchangetraded funds which are a type of passive mutual fund you can buy for a share price much like an individual stock that often means a lower barrier to entry» compare mutual funds vs etfs how do you make money from a mutual fund as with any investment the hope here is that the money you put in will earn a return mutual funds earn that return through dividends or interest on the securities in their portfolios or by selling a security that has gone up in value in both cases the fund typically passes those returns through to investors you also earn a return if the value of the mutual fund itself increases and you sell that fund for more than its purchase price updated jan 19 2018 about the author dayana yochim dayana is a personal finance writer
