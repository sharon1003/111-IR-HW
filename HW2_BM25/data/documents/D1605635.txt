indonesian killings of 1965–66 in the present day ostensibly towards the communist community where almost a million people were killed when suharto overthrew sukarno the president of indonesia following the failed coup of the 30 september movement in 1965 the gangsters anwar congo and adi zulkadry in medan  north sumatra were promoted from selling black market movie theatre tickets to leading the most powerful death squad in north sumatra they also extorted money from the ethnic chinese as the price for keeping their lives anwar is said to have personally killed 1000 people today anwar is revered by the right wing of a paramilitary organization pemuda pancasila that grew out of the death squads the organization is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers who are openly involved in corruption election rigging and clearing people from their land for developers invited by oppenheimer anwar recounts his experiences killing for the cameras and makes scenes depicting their memories and feelings about the killings the scenes are produced in the style of their favorite films gangster western and musical various aspects of anwar and his friends filmmaking process are shown but as they begin to dramatize anwars own experiences the fiction scenes begin to take over the films form oppenheimer has called the result a documentary of the imagination some of anwars friends state that the killings were wrong while others worry about the consequences of the story on their public image after anwar plays a victim he cannot continue oppenheimer from behind the camera states that it was worse for the victims because they knew they were going to be killed whereas anwar was only acting anwar then expresses doubts over whether or not he has sinned tearfully saying he does not want to think about it he revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place and retches repeatedly while describing how he had killed people during the genocide the dancers from the films theatrical poster are seen before the credits begin to roll production  editin 2001 while conducting interviews for their 2003 film the globalisation tapes oppenheimer and cynn began delving into the indonesian killings of 1965–66 after moving up the ranks of those involved with the killings oppenheimers interviews led him to meet anwar congo in 2005 11 the film was shot mostly in medan north sumatra indonesia between 2005 and 2011 after seeing an early preview of the act of killing filmmakers werner herzog and errol morris signed on as executive producers 12the

killing received widespread acclaim from critics the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported a 96 approval rating with an average rating of 8710 based on 136 reviews the websites consensus reads raw terrifying and painfully difficult to watch the act of killing offers a haunting testament to the edifying confrontational power of documentary cinema 13 on metacritic the film holds an average score of 89 out of 100 based on 30 reviews indicating universal acclaim 14nick schager of the village voice called it a masterpiece 15 pulitzer prizewinning journalist chris hedges called the film an important exploration of the complex psychology of mass murderers and wrote that it is not the demonized easily digestible caricature of a mass murderer that most disturbs us it is the human being 16 awardwinning filmmaker ruhi hamid said it is the most extraordinary film i have ever seen it actually turns around what we think of as documentaries an extraordinary record of a horrendous part of indonesian history 17in some quarters oppenheimer has been accused of treating his subjects in bad faith 18 as far as their goal at the beginning was to glorify mass murder oppenheimer responds that could never have been his goal therefore that side of them may have been betrayed 19 20 21 22 in an interview with the village voice oppenheimer said when i was entrusted by this community of survivors to film these justifications to film these boastings i was trying to expose and interrogate the nature of impunity boasting about killing was the right material to do that with because it is a symptom of impunity 23australian national university professor of asian history and politics robert cribb stated that the film lacks historical context 24 in reply oppenheimer said that the film is essentially not about what happened in 1965 but rather about a regime in which genocide has paradoxically been effaced yet celebrated – in order to keep the survivors terrified the public brainwashed and the perpetrators able to live with themselves it never pretends to be an exhaustive account of the events of 1965 it seeks to understand the impact of the killing and terror today on individuals and institutions 25bradley simpson historian at the university of connecticut and director of the indonesia east timor documentation project at the national security archive states the brilliant oscarnominated film has prompted vigorous debate among indonesians about the crimes and the need to hold responsible parties accountable and suggests that it could have a similar effect in the united states whose own role in the killings has never officially been acknowledged much less accounted for though some of the relevant documents have been made available to the public 26an indonesian academic soe tjen marching analyzed the film in relation to hannah arendt s theory of the banality of evil 27the primary subjects in the film anwar congo and herman koto have seen the film and neither feels deceived according to oppenheimer oppenheimer says that upon watching the film anwar congo started to cry tearfully he told me this is the film i expected its an honest film a true film he said he was profoundly moved and will always remain loyal to it oppenheimer went on to say that in the call with congo he also became down on himself saying there is nothing left for me to do in life but to die oppenheimer seeing congo so moved and almost ashamed for what he had done said this to him youre only 70 years old anwar you might live another 25 years whatever good you do in those years is not undermined by the awful things in your past he felt it may have been cliche but he felt it was honest and all he could manage to say to congo 28 a subsequent interview on al jazeera s program 101 east revealed that anwar had misgivings about the film and the negative reaction to it in indonesia which was causing problems for him he confided these concerns directly to oppenheimer in an apparent skype conversation displayed within the program 29in 2015 the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by the guardian 30top ten lists  editthe act of
