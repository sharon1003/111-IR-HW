toothpastes over 95 of the toothpaste sold in the u s now contains fluoride with many grocery stores carrying few if any nonfluoridated brands the use of fluoride toothpaste particularly during early childhood presents health risks this is why the fda requires a poison warning on every tube of fluoride toothpaste now sold in the us risks from ingesting fluoride toothpaste include permanent tooth discoloration dental fluorosis stomach ailments acute toxicity skin rashes perioral dermatitis and impairment in glucose metabolism all of these risks have been unnecessarily increased by the marketing practices of toothpaste manufacturers who use cartoon packaging and candyflavors to target adultstrength fluoride toothpaste to young children  the dental community’s failure to educate the public about the dangers of swallowing too much fluoride toothpaste has further exacerbated the problem a major source of children’s daily fluoride intake fluoride toothpastes sold in the u s generally contain between 1100 and 1450 parts per million ppm fluoride the equivalent of over 1 mg of fluoride for each gram of paste although the fine print on the back of the toothpaste tube instructs users not to swallow and to use only a “peasized” amount advertisements continue to depict heaping swirls of paste on the brush basch 2013 and manufacturers continue to market fluoride toothpastes in bubblegum fruit and candylike flavors basch 2014 using childappealing flavors is particularly dangerous because young children have poorly developed swallowing reflexes and invariably swallow large amounts of the paste they add to the brush not surprisingly numerous studies have found that many children ingest a significant amount of fluoride each day from toothpaste alone according to the journal of public health dentistry “virtually all authors have noted that some children could ingest more fluoride from toothpaste alone than is recommended as a total daily fluoride ingestion” levy 1999 a major risk factor for dental fluorosis one side effect from swallowing too much fluoride is dental fluorosis dental fluorosis is a defect in tooth enamel caused by excessive fluoride intake during the toothforming years age 0 to 8 in its mild forms dental fluorosis presents as cloudy white splotches and streaks on the teeth while in its moderate and severe forms fluorosis can cause extensive brown and black staining along with pitting and crumbling of the enamel children who ingest a lot of toothpaste whether accidentally or purposefully can develop the disfiguring brown and black stains of advanced fluorosis particularly if they also drink fluoridated water fluorosis on the front teeth even in its “ mild ” forms but especially in its severe forms can cause selfesteem problems for a child particularly when they reach adolescence acute poisoning in 1997 the fda ordered toothpaste manufacturers to add a poison warning on all fluoride toothpastes sold in the u s the warning reads“keep out of reach of children under 6 years of age if you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing seek professional help or contact a poison control center immediately”the fda requires this warning because children who swallow too much fluoride toothpaste can suffer acute poisoning even death in fact a single tube of bubblegum flavored colgateforkids toothpaste contains enough fluoride 143 mg to kill a child weighing less than 30 kg whitford 1987a while fatalities from fluoride ingestion are rare the last reported death occurred in 2002 bouts of acute fluoride poisoning are not acute fluoride poisoning which occurs at doses as low as 01 to 03 mg per kg of bodyweight generally presents in the form of gastric pain nausea vomiting headache dizziness and flulike symptoms akiniwa 1997 gessner 1994 a child weighing 10 kg would only need to ingest 1 to 3 grams of paste less than 3 of a tube of colgateforkids to experience one or more of these symptoms although it is believed that many poisoning incidents from fluoride toothpaste go undiagnosed and unreported shulman 1997 the number of calls to poison control centers in the u s for fluoride poisonings from toothpaste has skyrocketed since the fda issued its poison warning indeed in the early 1990s prior to the fda’s warning there were about 1000 poisoning reports each year from fluoride toothpaste shulman 1997 today there are over 23000 reports a year resulting in hundreds of emergency room treatments reports to poison control centers in u s due to excessive ingestion of

mc caffery 2003 mellette 1983 1976 the condition usually appears in women between the ages of 20 and 50 where fluoride toothpaste is the cause of the condition significant improvement in symptoms will be experienced within a few weeks of using a nonfluoridated toothpaste in addition to dermatitis fluoride toothpaste may also cause stomatitis ie mouth ulcers “canker sores” brun 2004 douglas 1957 impaired glucose metabolism perhaps the most important yet most overlooked risk from excessive ingestion of fluoride toothpaste is the impact it can have on blood glucose and insulin levels in the 1980s researchers at the university of indiana reported that rats receiving acute but relatively small doses 05 mgkg of fluoride had significantly higher glucose levels in their blood and decreased levels of insulin shahed 1986 whitford 1987b since that time numerous studies have repeated this finding in both animals and humans at doses which many children routinely ingest from fluoride toothpaste it is now estimated for example that blood fluoride levels of just 95 ppb produce an increase in glucose levels and a decrease in insulin menoyo 2005 strikingly this level is routinely exceeded by about 5 to 10 of children using fluoride toothpaste particularly those living in fluoridated communities this finding raises the obvious question of whether the widespread use and ingestion of fluoride toothpaste is contributing to or exacerbating the rising prevalence of diabetes in children diabetes is a condition caused by persistently high glucose levels a chemical that can simultaneously increase glucose levels and decrease insulin insulin is a hormone that helps clear glucose from the blood should be handled very carefully particularly among those who already have diabetes indeed several researchers have already begun suggesting that diabetic children should use toothpastes with lowfluoride content as noted by the authors in a recent study from the journal of fluoride chemistry“ knowing that chronic fluoride intake is capable of decreasing insulin signal and causing insulin resistance the use of dentifrices with lower f content is recommended especially for diabetic children for whom excessive f consumption may lead to health implications” chiba 2012 references akiniwa k 1997 reexamination of acute toxicity of fluoride fluoride 30 89104 basch ch
