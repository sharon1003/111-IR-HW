and more discussions on this topic author message paula j kilgore member username levichey post number 9 registered 62001posted on thursday may 29 2003  1030 pm i have a question to reassure me of what i was told by a vet today i have a mare that is difficult sometimes to catch in heat i had her ultrasounded today to try to see where approximately she is in her cycle upon palpation he said that one ovary was a little larger than the other and that her cervix was beginning to soften the ultrasound showed a follicle about 20 mm he suggested that i wait until saturday 2 days and give her a shot of lutalyse and then she should be ready to breed by monday or tuesday this stuff confuses me anyway but this made it worse if she already has a follicle doesnt that mean that she is already in the process of coming into heat if so what would giving the lutalyse at this point do i thought it was for mares in diestrous to bring them into estrus robert n oglesby dvm moderator username dro post number 8482 registered 11997posted on friday may 30 2003  525 am the idea is that it will hasten involution of the corpus luteum cl or involute a persistant cl i tend to agree with you however unless you have a reason to suspect something wrong with her cycling it may be a touch of overkill dr opaula j kilgore member username levichey post number 10 registered 62001posted on friday may 30 2003  832 am so without giving her the shot when do you think she would be ready to breed she had a foal on april 23 and i was planning on breeding her back on her second heat she was 30 days last weekend but wanted nothing to do with the stallion even through day 32 that was why i had her checked to try to figure out where in her cycle she was i guess she is just a little later than average robert n oglesby dvm moderator username dro post number 8484 registered 11997posted on saturday may 31 2003  934 am we carefully explain heat and ovulation predicition by a number of means including folliculr size at equine reproduction � breeding and foaling � heat estrus detection ovulation prediction and timing insemination it should answer your questions and provide more background dr ob greenwood member username bevpolo post number 17 registered 62001posted on sunday jun 1 2003  851 pm paula i use lutalyse frequently but never when a mare already has a follicle i will use lutalyse to short cycle the mare after a foal heat so i do not have to wait for the 30 day heat to breed or i will do it when a mare just has no follicular activity i have also done it in one case where i ended up with two embryos and wanted to abort and rebreed i would never lutalyse a mare with a 20mm follicle however all mares are different in the speed of maturation but in most cases a 20mm follicle will not take longer than a week to mature i have had a few odd cases where they will digress with severe changes of weather or a stressful event occurs with the mare however a 20mm follicle on friday could easily be a 3540mm on its own by monday in your case using lutalyse may bring on the follicle too quickly which means by the time you read this it could be too late and you miss breeding you expressed concern about her passing 30 days and that by no means is a set number for a mare each mare is different the 20mm follicle appears to be her second heat let me know what happens i would be interested to see how fast she comes on with the lutalyse if you gave it to her bev robert n oglesby dvm moderator username dro post number 8505 registered 11997posted on monday jun 2 2003  319 pm hello b if your position that there is a whole lot of lutalyse or othe pg f2a product given uneccasarily you have my whole hearted agreement but occasionally there is a need in a mare with a 20 mm follicle persistant cls whether due to late diestral ovulations or those resistant to the natural resolution mechanism will prevent a mare from returning to heat in a timely manner however these persistant cls do not prevent follicular development to 20mm or larger i am not aware that the pg f2a will hasten ovulation when given to a normal mare already entering the early stages of estrus dr opaula j kilgore member username levichey post number 11 registered 62001posted on monday jun 2 2003  322 pm thanks for all the advice and info i chose not to give the mare the shot of lutalyse i took her to the stud saturday and although she showed some slight signs of heat she would not stand for the stud sunday she showed a little stronger but still wasnt willing ive not heard from the stud owners today but hopefully she is getting close to standing i will let you know for sure how it turns out b greenwood member username bevpolo post number 18 registered 62001posted on monday jun 2 2003  404 pm dr o  paula definitely agree that lutalyse is the way to go with persistant clshowever with just one palpation or ultrasound in paulas case how do we know that is a persistant cl and not a follicle coming on i would have had the mare palpated again on saturday to see progession ultimately the lutalyse probably would not have done any harm or as you said it would not have hastened the ovulation but what is the point when she is doing fine on her own from what paula says about her teasing patterns the follicle is coming on nicely and hopefully they will hit breeding with a soft 45 lets hope that is what happens paula let us know what day she is bredand you may want to palpate her to confirm ovulation my best bev paula j kilgore member username levichey post number 12 registered 62001posted on thursday jun 5 2003  905 pm thought i would let you know the outcome of this story the mare never would stand for the stud and by yesterday wednesday she was getting down right ill towards him today she was palpated and ultrasounded again and her follicle is still there and is still only about 25 cm apparently it is just stuck at that point anyway my next move is 10 days of regumate followed by a shot of lutalyse on day 11 to try to get her to cycle paula robert n oglesby dvm moderator username dro post number 8533 registered 11997posted on friday jun 6 2003  306 pm bummer paula why the regumate why not just go ahead with the lutalyse if he suspects a persistant cl by waiting and monitoring you have increased the chance it may help this mare b greenwood member username bevpolo post number 20 registered 62001posted on friday jun 6 2003  416 pm paula that was my question toowhy the regumate i was waiting for dr o to say it first i think you need to try and get her palpated a litte more often you would not have had to wait all those days relying on the teaser to tell you what was going on lutalyse her and palpate her on the fifth day after the shot and then every other day so you can really monitor the activity that way she doesnt have to sit around at the breeding shed spending your board money best of luck bev paula j kilgore member username levichey post number 13 registered 62001posted on monday jun 9 2003  823 am i guess he was just trying to regulate her hormones this was the same process that i went through the first year i bred her to get her to stand i gave her 3 lutalyse shots that year with no luck but when i did the regumate followed by the lutalyse she came right in and was bred oh and shes at home until she gets through with this regumine of hormones then i will take her back on about the fourth day after the lutalyse shot its only about 20 miles to the stud this is her third year being bred the first year i had these problems the second year i bred her on foal heat and she bred like a dream and this year she is exactly like she was the first year i guess since the regumate followed by lutalyse worked so well the first time i didnt question trying it again paula paula j kilgore member username levichey post number 14 registered 62001posted on wednesday jun 25 2003  1203 pm just wanted to let you all know the outcome so far since i started this discussion i continued with the regumate followed by the lutalyse shot took the mare back to the stud on day 4 after the shot and finally on day 6 she decided she was ready to stand to breed she has bred 3 days so far hopefully in a few weeks an ultrsound will show a successful breeding paula robert n oglesby dvm moderator username dro post number 8660 registered 11997posted on thursday jun 26 2003  640 am thanks paula do let us know if she settles dr opaula j kilgore member username levichey post number 15 registered 62001posted on thursday jul 31 2003  222 pm sorry that i am only now updating you on the fact that my mare did get with foal i had her checked on day 17 and she was bred maybe i ended up taking the long way around but it was successful and hopefully next year i will have another healthy foal thanks for all of your advice post a message to this discussion posting instructions full service members may post to this discussion and should address the
