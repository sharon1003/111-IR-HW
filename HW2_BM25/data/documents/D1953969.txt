distortion refers to the deformation of the waveform at the output of the device compared to the input usually due to overload generating a distorted or “dirty” signal in electronic music sound distortion is frequently used to create certain audio effects distortion effect simulates the sound of analog and digital distortion and includes tone parameters that allow you to determine how the distortion changes your signal and enable you to control on how much distortion increases the output level of the signal amplitude distortion is a distortion occurring in a system or a device when the output amplitude is not a linear function of input amplitude clipping is a form of audio distortion which appears because of overloading an electronic device named so because its graphic waveform looks as if the edges of the waveform were “clipped”crossover distortion is a type of distortion which is caused by switching between devices driving a load it occurs in pushpull class ab or class b amplifiers during the time that one side of the output stage shuts off and the other turns on crossover distortion is most thought of as a problem only with lowlevel signals but digital converters are also sometimes plagued with this problem but it is more a manifestation of quantization error at low bit depths frequency distortion “amplitudefrequency distortion” or “waveformamplitude distortion” is a type of distortion in which the relative magnitudes of the different frequency elements of a wave are changed during transmission or amplification harmonic distortion is the presence of harmonics in the output signal of a device which werent present in the input signal ordinarily for the purpose of changing the instrument’s timbre intermodulation distortion is a distortion caused by two or more audio signals of different frequencies interacting with one another phase distortion is a change in the sound because of a phase shift in the signal phase distortion synthesizers are subtractive synthesizers but with some differences – they use the waveform flexibility of wavetable synthesis in the oscillator and instead of choosing waves for selection on the oscillator you are given full control above the shape of the waveform between all set forms thd total harmonic distortion can be described as a measure of the difference between the harmonic frequency level at the output stage of the amplifier as compared to the input stage expressed as a percentage it’s a very finetuning specification hardly perceptible to many ears but the lower the thd the more accurately the amplifier or speaker plays the sound tim transient intermodulation distortion occurs in amplifiers that apply negative feedback when signal delays make the amplifier unable of correcting distortion when exposed to fast transient signals p s for more info recommend you check this book  good musician the biggest glossary of all music production words acoustics terms edm genres audio engineering terminology recording vocabulary and electronic music theory definitions  kindle edition by shadow producers arts  photography kindle e books  amazoncom250 views
