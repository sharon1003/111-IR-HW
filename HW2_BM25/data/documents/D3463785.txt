love two very different things i think being in love is the romantic part—sex all the time midday naps in the sheets the jokes the laughs the fun long conversations with no pauses overwhelming separation anxiety … just the best sides of both people you know but love begins when the excitement of being in love starts to fade the stress of life sets in the butterflies disappear the sex becomes a chore the tears the sadness the arguments the cattiness … the worst parts of both people but if you still want that person by your side through all of those things … that’s when you know—that’s when you know you’re good at love” ― nick miller  isnt it pretty to think sotags love 14 likes like“id begun to grow weary of my constant daydreaming because as i retreated more often into fantasy it had become a reminder of my growing discontent with real life and my thoughts after very little sleep seemed to float even further into the realm of the superfluous” ― nick miller  isnt it

there let it wash over me and let myself be consumed by it if i cooperate maybe it wont stay too long maybe itll let me go free but if i fight it it might stay longer just to spite me so i decided to let the feeling inhabit me as long as it desired while i lay still cautious not to incite me secretly hoping it would leave me soon and bother someone else but outwardly pretending to be its gracious host the most discouraging element of what i felt was my inability to understand it usually when i was filled with an unpleasant feeling i could make it go away or at least tame it by watching a lighthearted film or reading a good book or listening to a feel good album but this feeling was different i knew non of those distractions could rid me of it but i knew nothing else i couldnt even describe it is this depression maybe once you ask someone to describe depression he cant find the words maybe im part of the official club now i imagined myself in a room full of people where someone in the crowd also suffering from depression immediately noticed meas if he detected the scent of his own kindwalked over and looked into my eyes he knew that i had the feeling inside me because he too da the feeling inside him he didnt ask me to talk about it because he understood that our type of suffering was ineffable he only nodded at me and i nodded back and then during our moment of silence we both shared a sad smile of recognition knowing that we only had each other in a room filled with people who would never understand us because they didnt have the feeling inside them” ― nick miller

only beautiful muses in this world i’m quite convinced that very few if any can do it alone jake you must understand something … you must understand that momentary rage is good but that abiding hate is ruinous don’t hide from people in hate when you can rage silently in their presence rage means you’re alive rage brings you closer to the truth misanthropes have nothing to write about because
