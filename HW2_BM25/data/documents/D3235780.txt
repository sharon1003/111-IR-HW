methodology the difference between these two terms have to be understood clearly citation is a reference to a published or unpublished source it is generally an abbreviated alphanumeric expression found in the pages of a thesis or a dissertation the primary motive of citation is to exhibit your intellectual honesty on the other hand reference consists of the act of referring reference appears at the bottom of a page as a footnote as well as a list at the end of the thesis or the paper you are writing what is citation a citation is how you quote the source of the ideas within the body of the research paper citation is included at the places wherever you quote from different authors normally you put the citation at the end of the sentence within brackets inside this bracket the author’s name year the book was published or the page in which this particular extraction appeared are included what exactly comes inside this bracket is a decision made by the format you follow in writing the paper different formats have different styles for citation you can see that from the following examples apa – ‘her blood warmed the earth martin 2014’mla – ‘her blood warmed the earth martin 263’the very purpose of citation lies in the fact that you are willfully acknowledging the writer of the work from whom you have borrowed a quotation what is reference reference consists of the act of referring as a researcher you refer to some books and journals while writing the thesis or dissertation as a matter of fact you would include some references in the pages of your thesis in the form of footnotes the footnotes contain the reference passages taken from the relevant books and journals from which you quote them at the end of each chapter you would give the corresponding books and journals from which you have picked the quotations mentioned in the footnotes these are references however you do not have footnotes in apa style you only have a list called ‘references’ at the end also when it comes to the end list that gives references there are small changes between those lists in different styles too this list of reference is normally known as the bibliography in apa this list is known as mentioned earlier as ‘references’ in mla the list is named ‘ works cited ’ also apa reference list only contains the sources you have actually cited in the text in other lists of reference normally the sources that were only consulted are also included here are some examples of the way reference appears in these end lists apa mla usually references are included at the end of
