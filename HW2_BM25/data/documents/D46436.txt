the sum in question must be due under the terms of the contract b the sum must be owed to the claimant not someone else white and carter councils ltd v mc gregor 1962 award of an agreed price what happens when the defendant repudiates the contract but the claimant keeps on performing can he claim the price agreed upon w  c an advertising contractor agreed with mc g a garage proprietor to display advertisements for his garage for 3 years on the same say mc g refused to perform and requested cancelation w  c refused to do so it did displayed the advertisements and then sued for the full amount mc g argued that because they repudiated before w  c put up the advertisements w  c were only entitled to damages in respect of the loss of time needed to find new customers the house of lords disagreed and said the full price was owed criticised as encouraging wasteful performance not really in keeping with mitigation ○ held that the claimant had an option whether to keep performing or not ○ mitigation was not applicable in an action for an agreed price in that case however two restrictions were noted a cooperation principle b no legitimate interest if it can be shown that a person has no legitimate interest financial or otherwise in performing the contract rather than claiming damages he ought not be allowed to saddle the other party with an additional burden with no benefit to himselfjust as a party is not allowed to enforce a penalty so he ought not to be allowed to penalise the other party by taking one course when another is equally advantageous to him on a literal reading there will always be a financial interest it will always be cheaper to sue for the price as opposed to damages due to the absence of the mitigation doctrine ministry of sound ireland ltd v world online ltd 2003 award of an agreed price as noted in  obligations are rarely entire hence if the defendant just stops the claimant performing then he will not be able to claim for that part of the contract so if one is paid to do work in a house and the homeowner wont let you in then you cant keep performing after the repudiatory breachattica sea carriers corp v ferrostaal 1976 the alaskan trader 1983 award of an agreed price when does one have no legitimate interest two separate views a where damages would be an adequate remedy  b where refusal would be wholly unreasonable the alaskan trader 1983 award of an agreed price ship chartered for 24 months serious engine failure after one year charterers repudiated the owners ignored this and carried out expensive repairs costing 800000 and taking 5 months told the charterers the boat was ready but they were not interested as opposed to rechartering the boat however the owners left it anchored until the charter ran out they then sued the charterers for the seven months of unpaid hire costs the arbiter held that the owners had no legitimate interest in failing to seek damages as the conduct was wholly unreasonable as such they could not use the action for an agreed sum given that they had failed to mitigate their action for damages would be unavailable the problem with the case is that it doesnt quite fit the authority if the ship is difficult to relet elsewhere if it would cost time and money to advertise then dont the owners have a legitimate interest in keeping it anchored the this case looks like a limited imposition of the doctrine of mitigation alder v moore 1961 liquidated damages 1 to be struck down as a penalty clause the sum must be payable in the event of a breach if the event is not actually a breach of contract then it is enforceable  hence you promise not to play football again if breached then you must pay £1000 is a penalty clause whereas if you play football again you agree to pay £1000 is not a great way of geting round the restriction protector loan co v grice 1880 liquidated damages 2 must create a new liability to pay a sum hence if one merely asks for acceleration of payment this is not a penalty clause  another massive loopehole just say you promise to pay £1000 by 1 mayone can pay later so long as one does not play football wall v rederiaktiebolaget luggude liquidated damages 3 should the party who is to receive the liquidated damages be able to claim it is a penalty may be advantageous if damages exceed the preestimate  suggests it is possible but other cases are uncertain burrows argues it should not be allowed it is not the purpose of the rule it is not unfair one would be better off than making a genuine preestimate dunlop v new garage and motor co 1915 liquidated damages key points a if a genuine preestimation of loss then valid b if it is extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss than could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach then it will be struck down other points a whether it is a penalty clause is to be judged with at the time it was made b use of the word penalty or liquidated damages is relevant but not conclusive c if you dont pay £500 on completion within three days you must pay £1000 is a penalty clause d if one sum is to be paid for multiple types of breach it is likely not a genuine preestimate e if it is difficult to work out what the damages would be then a lump sum may be acceptable philips hong kong ltd v ag of hong kong 1993 liquidated damages courts have emphasised that where parties are in equal bargaining positions the court should be slow in construing a term as a penalty clause murray v leisureplay 2005 liquidated damages test recast  not a penalty clause unless intended to act as a deterrent cooperative insurance v argyll stores 1998 specific performance defendant was a supermarket claimant was the owner of a shopping centre the supermarket was the biggest shop in the shopping centre the claimant the landlord granted the defendant a 33 year lease there was a covenant however which obligated the defendant to keep the shop open

however really affect the landlord directly he makes money from the other shops rent the loss of people will end up costing the landlord indirectly through demands for lower rent because the quantification issue was so difficult he asked for specific performance in civilian jurisdictions this would be specifically enforceable the house of lords however held that it was not lord hoffmann bore in mind the massive losses it would cause the defendant the lack of certainty regarding the obligation and the fact it would need constant supervision of the court it would also enrich the claimant at the expense of the defendant finally it is akin to slavery sky petroleum ltd v vip petroleum ltd 1974 petrol specifically enforceable during an oil crisis specific performance specific
