baldness which type of gland secrete on oily substance sebaceous glands as keratinocytes int eh stratum basale are pushed toward the skins surface they begin to die to activate vitamin d the skin cells need to be exposed to ultraviolet light to prevent an unwanted hair from growing back you must destroy the hair matrix what happens in a decline in the activity of sebaceous glands aging which is not an accessory structure of the skin dermis papillae what is the response by effectors when the body temperature is elevated sweat glands increase production of sweat langerhans cells function where in immune responses merkel cells is a  which is found where touch receptor found in epidermis keratins is a protective protein of    skin hair melanin is described as  yellow to black pigment lamellated paciniam corpuscles are nerve endings sensitive to pressure cerumen is also known as earwax carotene is described as yelloworange precursor of vitamin astriae is described as silvery white streakscorpuscle of touch meissner corpuslce is a  which is found where touch receptor found in dermal papillae which of the following answers includes the four main categories of tissues connective epithelial muscle nervous one way of classifying epithelial tissues depends on whether they are arranged in layers or not the terms used in this classification are simple stratified or pseudostratified smooth muscle tissue is located in the walls of hollow internal structures eg blood vessels airways of lungs and the urinary bladder are cells that perform supportive functions for neurons neuroglia which of the following are essential for proper blood clotting platelets which of the following is a function of muscle tissue generation of force perichondrium surrounds cartilage which of the following cells engulf foreign microorganisms that invade the body phagocytic white blood cells are cells embedded in extracellular matrix chondrocytes all epithelium sits on a thin extracellular layer called the  basement membrane which of the following types of tissue protects and supports organs binds organs together stores energy reserves as fat and provides immunological protection connective filtration diffusion and osmosis most easily occur through which of the following simple squamous epithelium simple cuboidal epithelium forms the  kidney tubules goblet cells are found in the  columnar epithelium of the lining of the large intestine the function of ciliated simple columnar epithelium is to move fluids or particles along a passageway ciliated simple columnar epithelium is found in the lining s of the  uterine fallopian tubes the columnar cells of stratified columnar epithelium are located only in the apical layer pseudostratified columnar epithelium with cilia and goblet cells is found in the lining of the trachea the name of a specific kind of stratified epithelium depends on the shape of its surface cells the most abundant protein in the human body is  collagen a type of connective tissue that is the major storage site of the energy reserves of the body and helps to support and protect various organs is  adipose tissue the strength of cartilage is due to the presence of  collagen fibers a tissue that contains collagen elastic and reticular fibers and several kinds of cells imbedded in a semifluid ground substance is  loose areolar connective tissue combined with adipose tissue which of the following forms the subcutaneous layer areolar connective tissue what tissue is found in the dermis of the skin periosteum of bone the membrane capsules of organs and heart valves dense irregular connective tissue what tissue is usually attached to bone skeletal muscle if fibroblasts of the stroma of injured tissue are active in repair a scar will form a tissue that consists largely or entirely of closely packed cells with little extracellular material between adjacent cells and at least some of the cells touching a basement membrane is epithelium the follicles of the thyroid gland an endocrine gland are made up of which type of epithelium simple cuboidal are cells numerous in connective tissues that secrete the fibers and ground substance of the matrix fibroblasts are connective tissue cells that are specialized for storing triglycerides adipocytes what tissue forms tendons and ligaments dense regular connective tissue elastic cartilage contains  chondrocytes and elastic fibers synovial membranes line which of the following the cavities of certain joints which of the following lines the abdominal cavity serous membrane which of the following describes the tissue depicted in this illustration pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium mesothelium forms which of the following epithelial layer of serous membranes which of the following are secretions of endocrine glands hormones which of the following is a typical characteristic of connective tissue composed of cells imbedded in a noncellular matrix the principal epithelial membranes of the body include all of the following except periosteal membranes a common autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and destruction of exocrine glands especially the lacrimal tear glands and salivary glands is sjögren’s syndrome the tissue depicted in the illustration below is which of the following hyaline cartilage which membrane is attached to the outside of the heart and also lines a portion of the thoracic cavity pericardium transitional epithelium is found lining the inner surface of the urinary bladder tf epithelial tissues repair well because they have a good blood supply false tf generally tissues heal faster and leave less obvious scars in the young than in the aged in fact surgery performed on fetuses leaves no scars true tf with aging collagen fibers are likely to increase in number and change in quality true tf an obese person has many more blood vessels than a lean person a situation that can cause high blood pressure since the heart has to work harder trueepithelial tissue covers and lines the body and its parts epithelial tissue can be classified according to its function associated with the inner lining of some joints between bones are synovial membranes the presence of  in a tissue allows stretching and ability to return to the original shape elastic fibers which of the following is true concerning connective tissue some connective tissues have a rich blood supply which type of tissue is found in the lungs and involved in diffusion simple squamous epithelium if you were going to design a hollow organ that needed to expand and stretch which of the following epithelial and connective tissues might you use transitional epithelium and elastic connective tissue which of the following statements is not true concerning epithelial tissue epithelial tissue is well supplied with blood vessels in the repair of tissue scar tissue appears when fibroblasts secrete extracellular materials and collagen a connective tissue with a liquid extracellular matrix is blood the interior of your nose is lined with a mucous membrane the four main types of tissue are connective epithelial muscular and nervous which of the following materials would not be found in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue keratin which connective tissue cells secrete antibodies plasma cells modified columnar epithelial cells that secrete mucus are  cells goblet which tissue forms the bulk of the heart wall cardiac muscle stratified squamous epithelium functions mainly to perform what function protection what tissue type is found in tendons dense regular connective tissue in what tissue type would you find stores of calcium and phosphorus bone which of the following statements is true concerning glandular tissue endocrine gland secretions diffuse into the bloodstream exocrine gland secretions enter ducts as cells are pushed from the deeper portion of the epidermis toward the surface they degenerate and die sweat from eccrine glands helps regulate body temperature the hypodermis subcutaneous layer consists of areolar and adipose tissue with pressuresensitive nerve endings what contributes to the color of skin and absorbs ultraviolet uv light melanin in melanocytes and keratinocytes nails are formed from epidermal cells which layer of skin has no blood vessels epidermis which layer of skin undergoes cell division mitosis stratum basale which of the following best describes the stratum corneum many layers of completely keratinized and dead cells hair is surrounded by these cells and is also a product of cells of the  epidermis people who rarely venture outdoors or completely cover their skin when outdoors may develop a deficiency of vitamin d gray hair and changes in skin pigmentation in older people are due to a decrease in the number of functioning melanocytes half of burn victims die when the burn area exceeds  percent of the body 70nail growth originates at which of the following nail matrix which of the following is the most common cell type found in the epidermis keratinocyte which of the following are cells of the epidermis that participate in immune responses mounted against microbes that invade the skin langerhans cells which of the following does not impart color to skin keratin hair and nails are composed primarily of which of the following substances keratin in which stratum do new skin cells arise in this figure of the epidermis bwhich of the strata of the epidermis in the figure is missing in thin skin stratum lucidum constant exposure to friction or pressure stimulates the formation of a n  which is an abnormal thickening to the epidermis callus which term means “itching” pruritis blood vessels in the dermis will constrict in response to which of the following conditions decrease in environmental temperature a morphine patch applied to the skin is effective in treating pain because the skin is capable of  absorption tf the deepest part of the skin is composed of dense regular connective tissue false tf the buildup of bilirubin in the blood makes the mucous membranes nail beds and skin appear blue in color cyanotic false tf most sweat glands are eccrine rather than apocrine true tf the skin is the largest organ of the body both in surface area and in weight truethe hair structure that responds to touch is the  root plexus skin coloration changes when exposed to ultraviolet radiation of the sun in which portion of the skin will you find dermal papillae superficial region of the dermis if you pricked your fingertip with a needle the first layer of epidermis that it would penetrate is the  stratum corneum which below is described as a localized overgrowth of melanocytes nevus the red or pink tones seen in some skin are due to hemoglobin in the blood moving through capillaries in the dermis when you have your hair cut scissors are cutting through the hair  shaft which of the following is not true concerning eccrine sweat glands they produce a viscous secretion which tissue is the main type found in the deeper region of the dermis dense irregular connective which of the following is not directly a function of skin calcium production which of the following is not true concerning hair hirsutism is another name for malepattern baldness sebaceous glands  secrete an oily substance as keratinocytes in the stratum basale are pushed toward the skin’s surface they  begin to die to activate vitamin d the skin cells need to be exposed to  ultraviolet light to prevent an unwanted hair from growing back you must destroy the  hair matrix aging can result in  a decline in the activity of sebaceous glands the portion of the nail that is responsible for nail growth is the  nail matrix which below is associated with a langerhans cell function in immune responses which of the following is not an accessory structure of the skin dermal papillae what is the response by effectors when the body temperature is elevated sweat glands increase production of sweat
