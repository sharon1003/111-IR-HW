calderbank letters and offers of compromise 80500 introduction in broad terms these two devices provide a sanction as to costs against a party who unreasonably fails to accept an offer of settlement settlement is thereby encouraged and a measure of relief is afforded to the party who incurs costs unnecessarily as a consequence of such unreasonable conduct a calderbank letter  calderbank v calderbank 1975 3 all er 333 leaves costs in the discretion of the court subject to principles which have been developed in relation to the instrument by contrast an offer of compromise made under ucpr pt 42 div 3 provides a more certain consequence as to costs 80510 calderbank offers the term relates to an offer of settlement expressed to be without prejudice save as to costs a calderbank offer may be in writing or oral however if oral evidentiary issues may arise and less weight may be given to the offer in the circumstances of the case see gilsan v optus no 4 2005 nswsc 1073 at 30– 32 an effective offer may be made before action ofria v cameron no 2 2008 nswca 242 at 27 principles relating to calderbank offers the informal offer must operate against the background of the court’s discretion with respect to the award of costs which is to be exercised presumptively in favour of an order that “costs follow the event” miwa pty ltd v siantan properties pte ltd no 2 2011 nswca 344 at 7 frequently the approach that is taken is to ask two questions namely whether a there was a genuine offer of compromise and b it was unreasonable for the offeree not to accept it miwa at 8 cited in tati v stonewall hotel pty ltd no 2 2012 nswca 124 at 10 where a party has unreasonably failed to accept such an offer the letter may be tendered in support of an application for a special order for costs the application may be made by a successful party seeking an order for costs on an indemnity basis contrary to the general rule that costs are awarded on the ordinary basis previously called “a party and party basis” or by a losing party seeking an order for costs possibly on an indemnity basis contrary to the general rule that costs follow the event the decision is an exercise of the court’s general discretion as to costs costs may also be ordered on an indemnity basis in favour of a defendant who has made an offer better than the result obtained by the plaintiff but there is no presumption in favour of such an entitlement jones v bradley no 2 2003 nswca 258 at 8 however there is no presumption specifically in the context of calderbank offers that an offeree who does not accept an offer and does not obtain a more favourable judgment will necessarily pay indemnity costs from the date of the offer this is not to be taken to be indicative of any view on the meaning or content of r 4214 tati v stonewall hotel pty ltd no 2 above at 9 discretionary considerations are at large mostly they will bear on whether the failure to accept the offer was unreasonable some will be peculiar to the case in hand see ritchie’s at 421325 thomson reuters at r 421580 commonwealth of australia v gretton 2008 nswca 117 a relevant factor is the modesty of the claim ofria v cameron no 2 above at 24 there is a degree of flexibility in assessing calderbank offers asuch an offer may be inclusive of costs unlike a formal offer under the rules see  80520  elite protective personnel pty

still be regarded as amounting to a calderbank offer elite personnel pty ltd v salmon above at 16 smec testing services pty ltd v campbelltown city council 2000 nswca 323 at 84 however the intention to rely upon the offer as a calderbank one should it be defective under the rules must be made clear dean v stockland property management pty ltd no 2 2010 nswca 141 old v mc innes 2011 nswca 410 80520 offer of compromise the rules under pt 42 div 3 provide for a formalised offer of compromise and a relatively certain consequence as to costs depending on the outcome of the proceedings an offer of compromise under the rules is an alternative to the informal and less predictable calderbank letter the rules are not reviewed here comprehensively the treatment is selective rules and principles

offer to show why the timeframe was not reasonable azar v kathirgamalingan 2012 62 mvr 462 at 207 in assessing what was “such time as is reasonable in the circumstances” the fact that the offer is made to a person under legal incapacity might sometimes be or give rise to a relevant factor azar at 207 offers of compromise referring to costs such as “costs as agreed or assessed” or “plus costs” were rejected as invalid in a series of decisions of the nsw court of appeal old v mc innes 2011 nswca 410 at 105 cf vieira v o’shea no 2 2012 nswca 121 at 22 rule 2026 2– 7 has been amended rule 2026

from a specified estate or fund offers of compromise “inclusive of costs” remain invalid r 2026 2 c in addition an offeree unable to assess the offer of compromise should seek further particulars or documents in accordance with the procedure set out in r 2026 4 and 5 where the offer of compromise makes no provision for costs a plaintiff accepting the offer is entitled to costs on the ordinary basis up to the time when the offer is made r 4213a 2 where the offer proposes judgment in favour of a defendant the defendant is entitled to costs against the plaintiff accepting the offer from the

purpose of calculating interest in relation to costs after all questions of liability and relief have been decided and for the purpose of certain specified statutes such as the motor accidents act 1988 the consequences of acceptance and nonacceptance of an offer of compromise in relation to costs the headings appearing over the rules in this division omit reference to the parties making and accepting the offer in each instance the circumstances in which each rule applies are stated fully in the following review in considering whether a result is less as or more favourable to the plaintiff than an offer of compromise under the rules the amount of costs recoverable is not to be taken into account atkinson v zey 2008 nswca 30 at 7 rule 4213a applies where an offer of compromise made by a plaintiff or a defendant is accepted by the opposite party r 4213a 1 the consequence specified in r 4213a 2 is that the plaintiff is then entitled to an order for costs on the ordinary basis up to the time when the offer was made that is so unless the offer is for a verdict for the defendant each party to bear its own costs or the court otherwise orders rule 4214 applies where an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted by the defendant and the plaintiff obtains a result no less favourable to the plaintiff than the offer r 4214 1 the consequence specified in r 4214 2 is as follows unless the court otherwise orders the plaintiff is entitled to the plaintiff’s costs in respect of the claim aassessed on the ordinary basis up to the time from which those costs are to be assessed on an indemnity basis under para b and bassessed on an indemnity basis iif the offer was made before the first day of the trial as from the beginning of the day following the day on which the offer was made and iiif the offer was made on or after the first day of the trial as from 11 am on the day following the day on which the offer was made the phrase “in respect of” has been liberally construed as including the costs of an application for extension of the limitation period mc lean v the commonwealth unrep 22896 nswsc per sperling j there is a strong presumption in favour of the ordinary

australia pty ltd 2009 nswca 368 it was held that rr 4214 4215 and 4215a did not specify that exceptional circumstances or the avoidance of substantial injustice must be established before the court will make a different order it was held that instead the discretion should be one that is exercised having regard to all the circumstances of the case at 15 in barakat v bazdarova 2012 nswca 140 it was noted by tobias aja that there now appears to be a conflict of opinion in the court of appeal “as to whether a court can otherwise order for the purpose of the indemnity costs rule in the absence of exceptional circumstances” at 48 the issue was flagged in jovanovski v billbergia pty ltd no 2 2010 nswsc 617 at 5 dargan v united super pty ltd no 2 2011 nswsc 1527 at 4 george v webb 2012 nswsc 86 at 39– 40 however the cases were decided without having to deal with the issue in barakat v bazdarova it was also considered not necessary to decide whether exceptional circumstances were required before the court may “otherwise order” for the purposes of r 4214 2 at 50 instead tobias aja outlined the factors he took into account in deciding whether the circumstances relied upon by the appellants constituted exceptional circumstances or circumstances which even though not exceptional would justify depriving the respondent of indemnity costs at 50– 51 a marginal difference between the offer and the result does not justify departure from the rule houatchanthara v bednarczyk unrep 141096 nswca per clarke j departure from the rule has been held to be justified where the plaintiff’s case at trial is significantly different fowdh v fowdh unrep 41193 nswca or where the costs are wholly disproportionate to the amount involved and the proceedings were brought for an ulterior purpose jones v sutton no 2 2005 nswca 203 at 32– 43 rule 4215 applies where an offer made by a defendant is not accepted by the plaintiff and the plaintiff obtains a result as or less favourable to the plaintiff r 4215 1 the consequence specified in r 4215 2 is as follows unless the court otherwise orders athe plaintiff is entitled to an order against the defendant for the plaintiff’s costs in respect of the claim to be assessed on the ordinary basis up to the time from which the defendant becomes entitled to costs under para b and bthe defendant is entitled to an order
