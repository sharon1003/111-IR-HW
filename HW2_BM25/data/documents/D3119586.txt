possible to insert secured pdf into another pdfdouglasswehla apr 26 2012 120 pmwe are creating pdfs from word documents using acrobat for a client the client wants to distribute the files in such a way that the text and images cannot be copied but the file as a whole can be inserted into other pdfs they would also like to keep the file size manageable the current approach is to secure the pdf using acrobats password encryption file  properties  security or tools  protection  encrypt but as far as i can tell once you restrict any permissions on a file extracting pages or inserting it into other files is no longer an option the clients clients get around this by printing and scanning the secured pdf which they should not have to do please note that we are not trying to insert pages into a secured pdf i know how to do that but that is not the problem we want to insert one or more secured pdfs into another file i have tried saving the word document or firstpass pdf to an image format and then back into pdf but this results in files ranging from 3 to 10 times the original size can our problem be solved using acrobat or pdf format can anyone authoritatively tell me that it cannot be done we are open to other software and file type combinations i am using word 2010 and acrobat x on windows 7 64bit but setups vary within our company at the client company and out in the wild 9449 views tags translate
