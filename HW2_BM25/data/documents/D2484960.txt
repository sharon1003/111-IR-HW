player but lodge declined as he was still in college 10 11 they instead recruited bassist clint warwick the five appeared as the moody blues for the first time in birmingham in 1964 the name developed from a hopedfor sponsorship from the mb brewery which failed to materialise the band calling themselves both the m bs and the m b five and was also a subtle reference to the duke ellington song mood indigo 12 in an interview it was revealed that the band was named moody blues because mike pinder was interested in how music changes peoples moods and due to the fact that the band was playing blues at the time 12 around this time the band were the resident group at the carlton ballroom later to become rock music venue mothers on erdington high street the band soon obtained a londonbased management company ridgepride formed by alex murray  alex wharton  who had been in the ar division of decca records their recording contract was signed in the spring of 1964 with ridgepride which then leased their recordings to decca they released a single steal your heart away that year which failed to chart they also appeared on the cult tv programme ready steady go singing the uptempo b side

films in the pop era produced and directed by alex wharton the single became a hit in britain where it remains their only number 1 single 13 and in the united states where it reached no 10 the band encountered management problems after the charttopping hit and subsequently signed to decca records in the uk london records in the us directly as recording artists a fourtrack extended play release titled the moody blues featuring both sides of their first two decca singles was issued in a colour picture sleeve in early 1965 their debut album the magnificent moodies produced by denny cordell with a strong merseybeat  rb flavour was released on decca in mono only in 1965 it contained the hit single together with one side of classic rb covers and a second side with four lainepinder originals alex wharton left the management firm and the group released a series of relatively unsuccessful singles they enjoyed a minor british hit with a cover of i dont want to go on without you no 33 in february 1965 while the pinderlaine original from the bottom of my heart i love you produced by denny cordell with a vocal choral sound towards the conclusion that anticipated their sound on nights in white satin was issued as a uk single in may 1965 and did a little better no 22 but then everyday another pinderlaine song stalled at no 44 in october 1965 and no further british singles were released for about a year the group was still in demand for live gigs though and they had chart success in the us and in europe during those months when bye bye bird decca at 15048 was lifted

perform it live because the group had relaunched themselves without him a few months earlier this singles release is often listed as being cancelled however both promo and regular stock copies have been seen over the years arrival of hayward and lodge  editthe group reformed in november 1966 by then boulevard de la madeleine had made the belgian charts and won them more fans which came in handy when they relocated to belgium for some time the new members were john lodge their bassist from el riot who was now finished with his education and justin hayward formerly of the wilde three hayward was recommended to pinder by eric burdon of the animals and was endorsed by famed uk singer marty wilde the leader of the wilde three pinder phoned hayward after reading his lead guitarist letter and was impressed when hayward played him his 45 rpm single london is behind me during their car ride to meet the other members in esher  citation neededafter financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member the band soon realised that their style of american blues covers and novelty tunes was not working and decided to perform primarily their own material however as appearances on french tv show they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968 the haywardsung  dont let me be misunderstood  and  bye bye bird  with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by

which was issued as a single cw with haywards rocker leave this man alone in september 1967 this too was not a uk hit but further established their new moodies identity ray thomass flute had been in evidence earlier ive got a dream on their debut album however it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of everyman deram records threshold records 1967–1972  editdays of future passed  editthe moody blues contract with decca records was set to expire and they owed the label several thousand pounds in advances the second album had never materialised either they had the support however of decca ar manager hugh mendl who had been instrumental in the recent establishment of londondeccas new subsidiary imprint deram records with mendls backing the moody blues were offered a deal to make a rock and roll version of antonín dvořák s new world symphony to promote the companys new deramic stereo sound audio format 6 in return for which the group would be forgiven their debt the moody blues agreed but insisted that they be given artistic control of the project and mendl as executive producer was able to provide this despite deccas notoriously tightfisted attitude to their artists 17 the group was unable to complete the assigned project  citation needed which was abandoned however they managed to convince peter knight who had been assigned to arrange and conduct the orchestral interludes to collaborate on a recording that used the bands original material instead although deram executives were initially sceptical about the hybrid style of the resulting concept album 6days of future passed released in november 1967 became one of the most successful poprock releases of the period earning a gold record award and reaching no 27 on the british lp chart five years later it reached no 3 in the usbillboard charts the lp was a song cycle or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day the album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by the beatles to whom pinder had introduced the mellotron that year it took the form to new heights using the london festival orchestra 18 a loose affiliation of deccas classical musicians given a fictitious name adding the term london to sound impressive to provide an orchestral linking framework to the moodies already written and performed songs plus overture and conclusion sections on the album including backing up graeme edges opening and closing poems recited by pinder strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of haywards  nights in white satin  absent on the single but the orchestra and group never performed together on the recording with the bands rock instrumentation centred on pinders mellotron despite being a lush concept album the lp was cut in a very workmanlike manner with the band recording a particular song then the track being presented to peter knight who quickly composed a suitable linking orchestral portion which the decca musicians london festival orchestra then recorded the album was as much an original work by knight himself as the group the composing credits were listed on the sleeve as redwaveknight although hayward wrote nights and tuesday afternoon thomas provided another morning and twilight time lodge penned peak hour and evening time to get away and edge contributed the opening and closing poems the first morning glory and the latter titled late lament read by mike pinder who composed both the sun set and dawn is a feeling sung by hayward with pinder singing the bridge section clarke produced the album and afterwards continued working with the band sometimes known to fans as the sixth moodie he produced their albums and singles for the next eleven years engineer derek varnals also contributed heavily to the creation of the early moodys studio sound working with pinder and clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the mellotron as opposed to the sharp cut off the instrument normally gave partly achieved by removing all the sound effects tapes trains whistles cockerel crowing etc and then doubling up the tapes of orchestral instruments sounds which combined with pinders ability and sensitivity at playing pinder having earlier worked for the company that manufactured the mellotron and varnals recording skills at creating an orchestral wave sound that characterised their nonorchestra accompanied sound thereafter the album plus two singles therefrom  nights in white satin  and  tuesday afternoon  as a medley with forever afternoon listed as forever afternoon tuesday on the album took time to find an audience in the moody blues native britain the two singles from the album didnt initially catch on nights in white satin made only no 19 on the british singles chart in early 1968 and tuesday afternoon didnt chart at all however the british public learned to appreciate nights in white satin subsequently it made no 9 on the uk singles chart on reissue in december 1972 and no 14 on the charts on another reissue at the end of 1979 and is now regarded as the moody blues signature song by british audiences in the us nights in white satin did not make the billboard hot 100 in 1968 although it reached no 2 on rerelease in 1972 tuesday afternoon was more successful on initial release stateside peaking at no 24 on the billboard hot 100 in search of the lost chord  editthe 1968 followup lp in search of the lost chord included  legend of a mind  a song written by ray thomas in tribute to lsd guru timothy leary which encompassed a flute solo performed by thomas – four members of the group had taken lsd together at the start of 1967 a promotional film for the song was filmed on location at grootbijgaarden castle near brussels in belgium lodge provided a twopart song house of four doors set either side of thomas epic piece justin hayward began playing sitar and incorporating it into moody blues music voices visions of paradise om etc  having been inspired by george harrison haywards voices in the sky charted as a single in the uk no 27 as did lodges ride my seesaw no 42 no 15 in france – still their concert finale number – which featured pinders nonalbum song a simple game as the b side pinders the best way to travel was another high point as was his closing song om sung by pinder and thomas again featuring hayward on sitar graeme edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry and some of their early albums from the late 1960s began with various band members reciting poems by edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that followed edge narrated his brief departure poem on lost chord although pinder recited the majority of edges poetry as according to edge he had the best voice for it due to smoking more cigarettes and drinking more whisky at the time 19on the threshold of a dream  editon 1969s on the threshold of a dream hayward edge and pinder share the opening narration on edges in the beginning leading into haywards lovely to see you his never comes the day was issued as a uk single while thomas wry observations of life in dear diary and lazy day were striking features pinder contributed the closing track on side one so deep within you side two closed with the dream sequence edges poem the dream leading into pinders have you heard parts i and ii with the two parts separated by his classically themed instrumental piece the voyage to our childrens childrens children  editthe bands music continued to become more complex and symphonic with heavy amounts of reverberation on the vocal tracks resulting in 1969s to our childrens childrens children — a concept album inspired by the first moon landing the opening track higher and higher saw pinder simulate a rocket blastoff on keyboards then narrate edges lyrics thomas floating and eternity road stood out as did haywards gypsy and a rare pinderlodge collaboration out and in lodge provided his twopart eyes of a child and candle of life while pinder contributed sun is still shining the album closed with  watching and waiting  composed by ray thomas and justin hayward and sung by hayward it was during 1969 that the band established their own label threshold under licence to decca records to our childrens childrens children was the first of their albums to be released on their own label the song watching and waiting was issued as a single on the threshold label but failed to chart a question of balance  editalthough the moodies had by now defined a somewhat psychedelic style and helped to define the progressive rock then also known as art rock sound the group decided to record an album that could be played in concert losing some of their fullblown sound for a question of balance 1970 this album reaching no 3 in the american charts and no 1 in the british charts was indicative of the bands growing success in america incidentally it seems to have been one of the first rock albums broaching the issue of ecology eg line well spoil the seas with the rivers weve lost from edges dont you feel small haywards question in a differing version was issued as a single reaching no 2 in the uk kept from the top spot only by the england world cup football teams novelty record back home justin hayward began an artful exploration of guitar tone through the use of numerous effects pedals and fuzzboxes and developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitarsolo sound the moody blues had by now become a billtopping act in their own right they appeared twice at the famous isle of wight festival a dvd of their 1970 performance has been released pinders melancholy man a no 1 single in france stood out beside haywards question on the 1970 album every good boy

seventh sojourn 1972 which reached no 1 in the us the band returned to their signature orchestral sound which while difficult to reproduce in concert had become their trademark the title every good boy deserves favour was borrowed tongueincheek from a mnemonic used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef egbdf the opening track procession was the only item composed

bands were picking up their work pinders songs a simple game 1968 and so deep within you 1969 were successfully covered by the four tops pinder winning an ivor novello award for a simple game elkie brooks later covered haywards nights in white satin pinder also appeared on john lennon s imagine album in 1971 providing additional percussion on i dont wanna be a soldier i dont want to die the 1968

in late 1972 a reissue of the fiveyearold nights in white satin became the moody blues biggest us hit soaring to number two on the billboard hot 100 and becoming a certified millionseller the song had bubbled under the hot 100 charts on its original release the song also returned to the uk charts reaching no 9 ten places higher than its original release in 1967 threshold records  editthe moodies were also among the pioneers of the idea that a successful rock band could promote itself through their own label following the beatles creation of apple records after their on the threshold of a dream album 1969 they created threshold records prompted in part by disputes with londonderam over album design costs their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives the idea was for threshold to produce new albums and deliver them to londondecca who would act as distributor the group attempted to build threshold into a major label by developing new talent —most notably the uk hard rock band trapeze and the portland oregon classicalacoustic sextet providence —but these efforts were unsuccessful and the moodies eventually returned to more traditional recording contracts however they helped lay groundwork for other major acts to set up similar personal labels and distribution deals including the rolling stones  own label and led zeppelin s swan song  citation needed and all of the moodies studio releases from 1969 to 1999 bore the threshold logo on at least one of their format versions hiatus and solo work 1974–1977  editin the spring of 1974 after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of asia the group took an extended break erroneously reported as a breakup at the time because of the other band members feeling exhausted and overshadowed this was said by hayward in the final issue of higher  higher magazine 2006 although the band had typically featured four lead vocalists with edge also contributing vocally hayward was the principal guitaristvocalist whilst pinder was considered to be the person most responsible for their symphonic sound arrangements and overall conceptual direction pinder and thomas also doubled as the moodies onstage mcs as the 1969  caught live  5  album displayed before the bands 1973–74 world tour their last with pinder hayward wrote a song called island with the intention of including it on a potential followup album which the moodies recorded in 1973 before ultimately going their separate ways an additional cause of the hiatus were the long tours that had by this time strained pinder who needed a rest  citation needed in 1974 the band oversaw preparation of the compilation album this is the moody blues which was released that year hayward and lodge released a duo album the very successful blue jays 1975 and a uk chart single blue guitar no 8 which was credited to hayward and lodge even though it was just hayward with 10cc backing him the album had originally been a projected liaison between hayward and pinder but after pinder dropped out john lodge stepped in tony clarke produced it the members then released solo albums pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year having moved to california in 1974 i returned to britain for a visit in summer 1975 i was trying to get the band to do an album but the response was so weak i returned to california with my two new mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album the promise 21 edge produced two albums with guitarist adrian gurvitz kick off your muddy boots 1975 and paradise ballroom 1976 hayward composed the acoustically textured songwriter 1977 which was followed up in later years by night flight 1980 moving mountains 1985 which hayward dedicated to peter knight classic blue 1989 the view from the hill 1996 and live in san juan capistrano 1998 lodge released natural avenue 1977 pinder produced the promise 1976 and thomas collaborated on two projects

and john lodge in 1977 the group made a decision to record together again with their record company decca urging a reunion album london records decided to release a somewhat poorly mixed eightyearold recording of the band performing at londons royal albert hall against their artistic wishes londondecca did this in an attempt to reenergise public interest in the moody blues before their anticipated new album but by this time pinder had remarried and started a family in california so for their reunion recording the band decamped stateside with producer clarke the sessions were marked with tension and division first there was a fire at the studios they were using then after quickly relocating to pinders home studio a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them inevitably causing tensions to rise with pinder then dropping out before completion clarke was also forced to leave because of nonmusical reasons before the album was completed but by the spring of 1978 octave was ready for release pinder citing his young family and by then probably considering the bands touring days behind them excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow his decision caused acrimony within the band notably from edge and ray thomas had said pinder was initially agreeable to touring but his opting out later on with a major comeback tour already planned was a severely embarrassing blow to them attempts were made by their management to downplay pinders absence notably at a major uk music press party decca organised when the top decca dignitary guest while making a welcome back speech openly referred to mike pinder being currently absent over in the states  much to their dismay octave pinder departs and the arrival of moraz long distance voyager and the present  editduring this period the progrock band yes had asked their swissborn keyboardist patrick moraz to leave morazs management had some contacts with the moodies and after a successful audition with the band in england in 1978 he was engaged as keyboardist for the octave world tour that began in germany in october the album sold well and produced the hits  steppin in a slide zone  no 39 us written by lodge and  driftwood  no 59 us written by hayward the music video produced for driftwood featured moraz although pinder was the one who played on the actual recording the video for steppin in a slide zone simply showed the other four members without pinder which was rather awkward as pinders keyboards featured extensively on the song notably on the distinctive intro and during a solo section of the piece a group performance of haywards had to fall in love and lodges slide zone on the  kenny everett show also depicted them as a four piece on octave hayward had some four solo composed songs more than on the other side of life later in 1986 edge contributed ill be level with you aka little man one of only a few songs showing a complete group unity several songs sounded like solo efforts while lodges survival haywards appropriate closing the day we meet again and pinders final contribution and lead vocal one step into the light curiously as the band is depicted as doing so on the cover photo – where pinder is perhaps significantly barely glimpsed at all and almost out of focus were all high points on the album around this time justin hayward enjoyed a solo hit no 5 in the uk us no 47 with the song forever autumn from jeff waynes musical version of the war of the worlds in recent times hayward has sung both this and the eve of the war live in the touring version of the album as featured on waynes original bigselling double album the moody blues toured the us and europe during much of 1979 a live cd the moody blues live in seattle 1979 during the octave tour of a concert at seattle center coliseum recorded on 25 may 1979 was later issued in 2013 by 1980 they were ready to record again this time bringing in producer pip williams moraz was retained as the bands permanent keyboardist though pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band pinder took legal action to prevent the new moody blues album from reaching the public without his contributions but he was not successful and ultimately he never returned to the fold nevertheless when released in 1981 long distance voyager was a colossal success reaching no 1 on billboard and going top 5 in the uk the album yielded two hits  the voice  no 15 us written by hayward and  gemini dream  no 12 us written by hayward and lodge john lodges talking out of turn also charted in the us reaching no 65 edge provided 22000 days featuring thomas as lead voice with hayward and lodge while thomas contributions were the final portion of the set with his singing on the final two songs painted smile reflective smile a poem narrated by a dj friend of the band and veteran cosmic rocker by now the mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio albums and the band embraced a more modern less symphonic approach though still retaining a lush keyboardled sound as moraz gave a more contemporary edge  citation needed in live concerts the mellotron was still used heavily by moraz until the mid1980s including on songs that did not originally feature it 22the present 1983 again produced by williams was less successful than its predecessor though it spawned a uk top 40 hit no 35 in  blue world  no 62 in the us and a us top 40 hit in  sitting at the wheel  which failed to chart in the uk videos were also produced for both singles the present was released in conjunction with talencora ltd shortly before decca was bought out by polydor records the other side of life sur la mer  editin 1986 they enjoyed renewed success with their album the other side of life and in particular with the track  your wildest dreams  – a us top 10 hit and no 1 on billboards adult contemporary singles chart for two weeks which garnered a billboard video of the year award after being frequently featured on mtv it made them the first act in history to earn each of its first three top 10 singles in a different decade along with go now in 1965 and nights in white satin in 1972 23 newly employed producer tony visconti and barry radman a synth programmer formerly engaged by moraz delivered a modern sound the moodies had been seeking in order to remain competitive with their pop contemporaries and the albums title song also charted in the us at no 58 the renewed interest in the band ensured a younger audience with many of their longtime followers remaining loyal despite a fair number of older fans finding the albums of this period far more lightweight in content  for example lodge had gone from writing powerfully reflective mystical or humanitarian themed pieces such as house of four doors candle of life and one more time to live to quirkier items such as here comes the weekend rock and roll over you and love is on the run from me while haywards songs seemed  citation needed less the deeper drama of numbers such as the actor dawning is the day you can never go home the land of make believe etc to pleasant and more radiofriendly perennial far simpler songs about lost love and romance your wildest dreams no more lies i know youre out there somewhere etc there were still some deeper songs being created by the band the voice 22000 days the other side of life the spirit deep etc but the overall tone had noticeably become a more lightweight commercialised one presumably this was with record company agreement to keep in accordance with the then prevailing times  citation needed their live shows from this period included a good number of their 1980s album tracks however over time more of the core seven album era favourites reappeared in their playlist but pinders compositions were permanently retired from their setlists after his departure the moody blues performed live at the birmingham heart beat charity concert 1986 which raised money for birmingham childrens hospital the band played four songs and later provided backup with the electric light orchestra for george harrison the moodies continued their early videogeneration success with sur la mer 1988 and its video and single  i know youre out there somewhere  no 30 us no 52 uk no 2 us mainstream rock a sequel to your wildest dreams their sound took on an everincreasingly synthetic and technical quality as moraz and visconti began using modern sequencers samplers and drum machines hayward and lodge wrote and sang on most of the songs as the band came under pressure from their new record company polydor records to promote those it deemed to be the two more commercial looking and sounding members and they decided to exploit that aspect rather than catering for the band as a whole or retaining the fiveway songwriting methods the group had done with pinder 24by then ray thomas was playing a diminished role in the recording studio with the band evolving into a synthpop act a genre that was unsuitable for the use of a flute thomas provided additional percussion notably a brisk tambourine on many more moodies songs which continued to be featured plus occasional harmonica but by this point he was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer and he was also unwell during this period further limiting his involvement with the band in the recording studio thomas provided some backing vocals for both the other side of life and sur la mer however for reasons unclear multiple production considerations led visconti to leave thomas vocals off the latter of these two albums thereby further reducing the texture of their overall vocal sound which had previously been rich fourpart harmonies hayward lodge thomas and pinder then went down to three thomas lodge and hayward upon pinders departure and reduced still further to just the more similarsounding voices of hayward and lodge lodge also providing falsetto vocals and high harmonies with pinder and thomas each having provided both lower and higherpitched vocal harmonies in the groups earlier vocal sound the bands vocal sound had become the blend of just hayward and lodge which was still recognisable if less textured than the original fourpart more complex choral sound moraz was displeased with viscontis exclusion of thomas from the final release of sur la mer and accused him of tailoring the album for radio as revealed in a 1989 newspaper article where it revealed morazs anger with the state of the band and at visconti in particular despite his diminished participation in the recording process thomas high value remained on stage primarily from his continued ability to sing out his 1960s and 1970s moodies classics and also in flute and keyboard duets he composed with moraz which were performed only during moodies concerts the band had begun to reinforce their concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist  bias boshell was the first replaced in 1987 by guy allison before boshell returned by 1990 as well as female backing singers1990s to present  editdeparture of moraz and court tv lawsuit  editin 1991 halfway through the production of their new studio album patrick moraz did an interview with keyboard magazine and made some comments in the article that suggested dissatisfaction with his role in the moodies his complaints ranged from the moodies music becoming too simple in structure to the other members reluctance to allow him to make significant contributions to the songwriting on their albums he also was occupied with spending large amounts of time planning a music concert to celebrate his native switzerland s 700th anniversary instead of rehearsing with the moodies and as a result he was fired from the group before the project was completed so boshell and new keyboardist paul bliss were brought in to finish the new albums keyboard tracks despite previous credits as an official band member and being included in group photos on the four 80s studio albums from long distance voyager to sur la mer subsequent moodies compilations downplay moraz to being merely an additional keyboardist and several band photos have him cropped or airbrushed out notably on the covers to gold which did not even mention him in the booklet liner

he won was shown on court tv but he was awarded only 77175 in back pay due to accounting slowups instead of the 4000000 he sought keys of the kingdom  editkeys of the kingdom released in 1991 had modest commercial success when released and once again haywards songs led off the album with the new singles  say it with love  and  bless the wings that bring you back  also included was a new ambient flute piece by ray thomas entitled celtic sonant hayward and thomas also cowrote never blame the rainbows for the rain to close the album lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album leaving his trademark highenergy rock music and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as lean on me tonight though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as emilys song for his daughter in 1971 survival in 1978 and talking out of turn in 1981 while his more powerful songs continued with magic and the lennonesque shadows on the wall this gentler trend continued on the two successive moodies albums hayward wrote the driving twopart piece say what you mean tony visconti produced some of the tracks on keys as did christopher neil and alan tarney the ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the montreux jazz festival a nonalbum haywardlodge song cut at these sessions highway was included on the say it with love twelveinch single and on a later box set and compilation album while the vinyl album did not include their song once is enough as on the compact disc version the group remained a steady concert draw and a series of video and audio versions of their 1992 night at red rocks concert enjoyed great success particularly as a fundraiser for american public television where it had been first broadcast the concert was conducted and arranged by larry baird who has participated in many other bands orchestral live concerts such as kansas michael bolton three dog night al jarreau and alan parsons the group also continued their use of additional musicians on stage and in the studio but after the two legal suits from both pinder in 1981 and moraz in 1992 the band was careful not to recognise future keyboardists as official members following on from his contributions as keyboardist on the keys of the kingdom album paul bliss continued to play keyboards for the band live being promoted to first keyboardist in 2001 but was replaced in march 2010 after 19 years continuous service thomas and bliss continued the tradition of a flutekeyboard duet for many tours after edge injured himself in 1991 second drummer gordon

the recording hiatus ended in 1999 with the album strange times their first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by british critics although justin hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the albums chart performance – probably not helped by the long recording hiatus – which was notably less than keys of the kingdom in 1991 it was recorded in recco italy at haywards suggestion and was the bands first selfproduced effort the album featured keyboards and arrangements from italian musician danilo madonia who continued to work instudio with the band the album opened with english sunset a pop song featuring a modern nearly techno arrangement the song this is the moment which is not on strange times  which was originally featured in the broadway production of jekyll and hyde was a minor hit in the us strange times was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by graeme edge nothing changes narrated by edge with hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track and notably concluded by quoting mike pinders 1968 song title a simple game also in 1999 the moody blues appeared in an episode of the simpsons called viva

the rock and roll hall of fame 34writing for the guardian in 2015 rob chapman described the band as psychedelias forgotten heroes he stated despite their success rock critics rarely took the moody blues seriously a pattern that continued for the next 45 years he also wrote despite the critical disapproval the best of the moody blues music between 1967 and 1970 possessed grace and beauty like the beatles they understood how pop songs worked as ensemble pieces none of them were particularly virtuosic or showy as musicians and their music is refreshingly free of the noodling longeurs that characterised the output of their more selfindulgent contemporaries 35moody bluegrass  editthe moody bluegrass project is a group of nashville artists who have recorded two tribute albums of moody blues songs in the bluegrass style the first album moody bluegrass – a nashville tribute to the moody blues was released in 2004 those involved included alison krauss harley allen tim obrien john
