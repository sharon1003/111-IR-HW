thymine base present in only dna the n1 of the molecule bonds with the sugar within the nucleotide and the other groups participate in hydrogen bonding to adenine thymine  editthymine is one of the five bases that form nucleic acids along with adenine guanine cytosine and uracil the formula of thymine is c 5 h 6 n 2 o 2 thymine is always paired up with adenine through two hydrogen bonds only in dna to stabilize the nucleic acid structure thymine is not present in rna instead uracil takes place of thymine and binds with adenine it is a derivative of pyrimidine and can be derived by methylation of uracil at the 5th carbon hence the other name of thymine 5methyluracil uracil takes its place in rna which also binds to adenine thymine is a single ring planar molecule thymine combined with deoxyribose yields deoxythymidine while thymine with ribose makes thymidine thymine binds with deoxyribose to form the nucleoside deoxythymidine which is the same thing as thymidine this compound can be phosphorylated with one two or three phosphoric acid groups creating thymidine mono di or triphosphate respectively nucleoside thymidine thymine is a part of one of the most common mutations of dna which involves two adjacent thymines or cytosines in the presence of uv light this may form thymine dimers causing kinks in the dna molecule interfering with normal function uses of thymine include cancer treatment where it serves as a target for actions of 5fluorouracil 5fu substitution of this compound to thymine in dna and uracil in rna allows inhibition of dna synthesis in activelydividing cells tautaumerization  editthymine may go through tautaumerization interchanging from the keto to the enol functionality by intermolecular proton transfer references  edit
