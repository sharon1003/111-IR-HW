designed to launch a secret weapon the ship is a poor sailing ship and his endeavours are made harder by a sadistic lieutenant placed under the command of admiral harte with whose wife jack had an affair in the previous book jack is given a free hand in the hope that his lucky streak of capturing prizes will continue this mostly doesnt happen as jacks most notable action is driving the privateer bellone aground outside a spanish port while allowing several merchants to escape disappointing admiral harte jack is assigned to escort convoys up and down the channel during this time he gets a reputation for lingering in port as he carries on an affair with diana meanwhile stephen is sent on a secret mission to gather intelligence in spain upon returning stephen is advised by heneage dundas a close friend of jacks to warn him about visiting diana when stephen does jack is angry and accuses stephen of lying to him as to where he had been during his absence soon they challenge each other to a duel while in port jack calls on diana but finds her with canning as the main reason for the duel jealousy over diana has vanished he is willing to drop the duel but does not tell stephen prior to the date of the duel jack is ordered to raid the french port of chaulieu to sink the gathered french troopships and gun boats and to destroy the corvette fanciulla on the way the crew plans to mutiny because of the treatment they receive from lt parker stephen overhears their plans and goes to jack the first time they have spoken since the challenge forewarned jack separates the instigators of the mutiny from the rest of the crew during the engagement in chaulieu the polychrest runs aground jack leads three boats to board the fanciulla after a short battle the polychrests capture the ship and pull off the polychrest marooned on a sand bar however after hours of pounding by the shore batteries the polychrest founders and sinks soon after leaving chaulieu after the battle the duel is forgotten by both stephen and jack who returns in the fanciulla to england and is posted captain jack is offered a ship that is currently being built but will not be ready to sail for six months afraid of being captured by his creditors he declines and asks for a temporary command he is assigned to hms lively whose captain hammond has just left to take up his seat in parliament stephen is again sent to spain to gather more intelligence this time he returns with news that the spanish will declare war as soon as four ships full of gold from montevideo are safely in port while stephen is gone sophia at stephens urging asks jack to transport her and cecila to the downs while on board sophia and jack come to an agreement not to marry anyone else jack is too poor to propose anything more while waiting on the admiraltys orders stephen attends an opera and observes diana sitting in a box with canning this stuns stephen so badly that he is still sitting in his box long after the opera ends eventually having to be told to leave by the ushers fearing that a change in parliamentary leadership will leave jack penniless stephen asks that the lively be included in the squadron sent to intercept the spanish the admiralty grants this request assigns stephen the title of captain pro tem so he will receive a generous share of the prize money and tasks him to be a negotiator because of stephens temporary rank and the now obvious connection to the admiralty jack realizes that stephen has been a spy for britain the spanish convoy refuses to surrender and a quick battle breaks out one spanish galleon explodes and the other three surrender the victorious captains share of the prize money will be enough to pay off jacks debts categories add category
