why does copper oxidize and turn green the natural color of copper is peachy or pinkishwhite with a bright metallic luster it is one of the very few elements whose natural color is neither white nor gray however it undergoes oxidation reaction and turns green after being exposed to air fast fact a prime example of copper oxidation is the statue of liberty wherein a green color has developed on the structures surface due to redox and not due to effect of acid rain as generally believed by people according to the copper development association until now the oxidation of the statues copper skin is about 0005 inch copper is a metallic element with atomic number 29 and is represented by the symbol cu cuprum it is a malleable can be shaped into a thin sheet and ductile can be shaped into a thin wire element in humans and animals it is an essential metal that is found in the body cells and tissues due to high thermal and electrical conductivity copper is used in many aspects of life such as building materials thermal and electrical conductors and in the manufacture of various metallic alloys in fact its use can be traced back to the ancient times and early civilizations this is evident from the old copper crafts copper wares and other material remnants of the past civilizations due to its chemical properties copper ranks third as an industrial metal next to aluminum and iron in nature copper is usually found in association with sulfur which is then purified by means of other techniques examples of oxidation◆ oxidation of iron is referred to as rust and it leads to the corrosion and formation of a flaky reddishbrown outer layer ◆ another example is the oxidation of aluminum leading to the development of a flaky white layer this is usually seen on aluminum doors and windows after heavy rainfall ◆ when an apple is cut and the surface is exposed to air it turns brown oxidation of copper and changing of color oxidation is a phenomenon whereby an element loses electrons andor hydrogen on interacting with another element similar to iron and aluminum the element copper undergoes the process of oxidation if it is exposed to air if the atmosphere consists of high humidity moisture then this process is faster the copper metal reacts with oxygen resulting in the formation of an outer layer of copper oxide which appears green or bluishgreen in color this layer is known as the patina unlike other destructive oxidation processes the patina acts as a protective layer and it does not cause any weakness in the metal thus copper is considered as an important element that is resistant to corrosion the patina prevents further corrosion of copper beneath the oxidized layer very often this layer is seen on the rooftops of old buildings and acts as a waterproofing and sunproofing coat reactions☞ the oxidation process is characterized by the formation of three main products azurite malachite and brochantite these minerals impart the characteristic bluishgreen color to oxidized copper metal and form the patina layer simply speaking it is a redox reaction wherein both oxidation and reduction take place at the same time ☞ firstly copper donates electrons while reacting with oxygen to form copper oxide which is reddish brown in color this can be represented as 4cu  o 2  2cu 2 o copper oxide  equation 1 ☞ cu 2 o again reacts with oxygen to form cu o which is black in color 2cu 2 o  o 2  4cu o  equation 2 ☞ the atmosphere also consists of various pollutants like sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide carbon dioxide etc in areas where combustion of coal takes place sulfur fumes are present on a large scale as sulfur is an impurity present in most of the coal types copper oxide reacts with this element to form bluecolored copper sulfate cu s which may further react with carbon dioxide and moisture present in air to form the patina layer alternatively the copper oxide may also directly react with co 2 h 2 o and sulfur oxides to form the compounds brochantite malachite and azurite ☞ brochantite is mainly formed when high level of sulfur fumes are present it is green in color and is also known as hydrated copper sulfate 4cu o  so 3  3h 2 o  cu 4 so 4 oh6 brochantite  equation 3 ☞ malachite is a greencolored naturally formed compound and along with azurite it comprises greenishblue colored semiprecious mineral stones known by the same names this indicates that oxidation of copper also takes place in naturally formed rocks and gems apart from copper utensils statues rooftops etc 2cu o  co 2  h 2 o  cu 2 co 3 oh2 malachite  equation 4 ☞ azurite is also known as hydrated copper carbonate and it imparts a slight bluish tinge to the oxidized metal it is formed near areas that are mined for copper 3cu o  2co 2  h 2 o  cu 3 co 3 2 oh2 azurite  equation 5how to oxidize copper there are several methods to oxidize copper at home using daily essentials like salt kitchen ammonia baking soda water etc by this technique you can impart an antique or oldstyle feel to your desirable copper items like coins medals showcase pieces etc ◆ firstly clean the copper metal with mild detergent and water and wipe evenly in a single direction ◆ in a steel utensil mix about half tablespoon salt half tablespoon baking soda and about 15 oz of ammonia in half liter of water ◆ fill this solution in a spray bottle and spray the copper item at least once in a day after few weeks a greencolored patina will start covering the metal surface ◆ it is better to perform this technique outdoors to get smoother and fasterdeveloping carbonate layers ◆ to oxidize smaller objects like copper coins a simpler method is to hang them in a jar without touching the sides and the bottom ◆ they should be cleaned with alcohol and washed with detergent before attaching them to the jar with a thread ◆ the jar bottom is filled with half a centimeter of ammonia and as the fumes start reaching the copper surface close the jar with a lid ◆ in a couple of hours a clear green layer starts forming on their surface unscrew the lid and remove the coins after a desirable thickness of patina has been developed for preventing oxidation the best way is to protect the surfaces which are likely to be exposed to air and water with the help of a protective coat this way the metal surface is prevented from reacting with oxygen andor water you can also apply lemon on the copper surface to remove any patina layer of carbonates that have formed on the oxidized items a very effective way of cleaning large copper utensils showcase statues pipes etc is to immerse them into a solution consisting of water vinegar and table salt heat the water till boiling point and leave the items immersed till a couple of hours after removing them clean the items with soap or detergent to get back the shiny copper coat who discovered copper uses of copper chemical properties of copper melting point of copper copper wire facts copper wire uses copper facts and
