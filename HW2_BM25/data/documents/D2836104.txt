constructing a personal budget regardless of the tool used a budgets usefulness relies on the accuracy and currency of the data computer generated budgets have become commonly used as they replace the need to rewrite and recalculate the budget every time there is a change pencil and paper a simple budget can be written on a piece of a paper with a pencil and optionally a calculator such budgets can be organized in ring binders or a file cabinet simpler still are preformatted budgeting books or bookkeeping forms in which a budget can be created by filling in the blanks spreadsheet software spreadsheet software allows budgeting by performing calculations using formulas for example in keeping track of income and expenditure a drawback of budget spreadsheets is that some do not offer dateshifting so information has to be reentered or moved at the end of each month moneymanagement software some software is written specifically for money management products are designed to keep track of individual account information such as checking savings or moneymarket accounts these programs can categorize past expenses and display monthly reports that are useful for budgeting future months moneymanagement websites several websites have been devised to help manage personal finances some may have a privacy policy governing the use and sharing of supplied financial information spendingmanagement software spendingmanagement software is a variation of moneymanagement software unlike typical budgeting that allocates future personal income towards expenses savings and debt repayment this type of software utilizes a known amount of money the cash on hand to give the user information regarding what is left to spend in the current month this method eliminates some of the guesswork associated with forecasting what a person might receive for income when it comes to allocating budgeted money like moneymanagement software some spendingmanagement software packages can connect to online bank accounts in order to retrieve a current status report concepts  editpersonal budgeting while not particularly difficult tends to carry a negative connotation among many consumers sticking to a few basic concepts helps to avoid several common pitfalls of budgeting purpose a budget should have a purpose or defined goal that is achieved within a certain time period knowing the source and amount of income and the amounts allocated to expense events are as important as when those cash flow events occur simplicity the more complicated the budgeting process is the less likely a person is to keep up with it the purpose of a personal budget is to identify where income and expenditure is present in the common household it is not to identify each individual purchase ahead of time how simplicity is defined with regards to the use of budgeting categories varies from family to family but many small purchases can generally be lumped into one category car household items etc flexibility the budgeting process is designed to be flexible the consumer should have an expectation that a budget will change from month to month and will require monthly review cost overruns in one category of a budget should in the next month be accounted for or prevented for example if a family spends 40 more than they planned on food in spite of their best efforts next months budget should reflect an approximate 40 increase and corresponding decrease in other parts of the budget busting the budget is a common pitfall in personal budgeting frequently busting the budget can allow consumers to fall into prebudgeting spending habits anticipating budgetbusting events and underspending in other categories and modifying the budget accordingly allows consumers a level of flexibility with their incomes and expenses budgeting for irregular income special precautions need to be taken for families operating on an irregular income households with an irregular income should keep two common major pitfalls in mind when planning their finances spending more than their average income and running out of money even when income is on average clearly a households need to estimate their average yearly income is paramount spending which will be relatively constant needs to be maintained below that amount a budget being an approximate estimation room for error should always be allowed so keeping expenses 5 or 10 below the estimated income is a prudent approach when done correctly households should end any given year with about 5 of their income left over of course the better the estimates the better the results will be to avoid running out of money because expenses occur before the money actually arrives known as a cash flow problem in business jargon a safety cushion of excess cash to cover those months when actual income is below estimations should be established there is no easy way to develop a safety cushion so families frequently have to spend less than they earn until they have accumulated a cushion this can be a challenging task particularly when starting during a low spot in the earning cycle although this is how most budgets begin in general households that start out with expenses that are 5 or 10 below their average income should slowly develop a cushion of savings that can be accessed when earnings are below average whether this rate of building a cushion is fast enough for a given financial situation depends on how variable income is and whether the budgeting process starts at a high or low point during the earnings cycles allocation guidelines  editthere are several guidelines to use when allocating money for a budget as well past spending is one of the most important priorities a critical step in most personal budgeting strategies involves keeping track of expenses via receipts over the past month so that spending for the month can be reconciled with budgeted spending for the next month any of the following allocation guidelines may be used choose one that will work well with your situation the 60 solution  editthe 60 solution is a budgeting system created by former msn moneys editorinchief richard jenkins the name the 60 solution originates from jenkins suggestion on spending 60 of a households gross income before taxes on fixed expenses fixed expenses includes federal state and social security taxes insurance regular bills and living expenses like food and clothing car and house payments 2the other 40 breaks down as follows with 10 allocated to each category retirement money set aside into a pension or other retirement account eg ira or 401 k  longterm savings money set aside for car purchases major home fixups or to pay down substantial debt loads irregular expenses vacations major repair bills new appliances etc fun money money set aside for entertainment purposes if an individual has a high amount of nonmortgage debt jenkins advises that the 20 apportioned to retirement and longterm savings be directed towards paying off debt once the debt is paid off the 20 retirement  savings is to be immediately redirected back into the original categories according to jenkins tracking each individual expense is unnecessary as the balance of his primary checking account is roughly equivalent to the amount of money that can be spent in this plan software designed to easily set up and track a 60 solution budget is built into the deluxe and higher versions of microsoft money 2007 and microsoft money plus housing as 25 of spendable income  editanother allocation principle is that housing expenses mortgage or rent should be limited to 25 of spendable income this rule of thumb especially applies to families moving to new housing if a house payment for a 300000 house plus taxes will result in a 2000 monthly mortgage bill will it take up too large a portion of the budget to calculate find income level tax rate and mortgage interest rate in housing markets with exceptionally high prices such as california new york city london or boston massachusetts in the early 2000s this rule of thumb may be difficult to follow a high percentage of income spent on housing will necessitate lower percentages in other categories one of the critical factors that many people overlook during the budgeting process is the supplierreplacement costcutting technique this is the process of scrutinizing each current expenditure comparison shopping and replacing with a lower cost equal quality alternative the newfound savings is then reapplied to debt savings accounts and enjoyment spending following a budget  editonce a budget is constructed and the proper amounts are allocated to their proper categories the focus for personal budgeting turns to following the budget as with allocation there are various methods available for following a budget envelope accounting or the envelope system is a method of budgeting where on a regular basis ie monthly biweekly etc a certain amount of money is set aside for a specific purpose or category in an envelope marked for that purpose then anytime you make a purchase you look in the envelope for the type of purchase being considered to see if there are sufficient funds to make the purchase if the money is there all is well otherwise you have three options 1 you do not make the purchase 2 you wait until you can allocate more money to that envelope 3 you sacrifice another category by moving money from its associated envelope the flip side is true as well if you do not spend everything in the envelope this month then the next allocation adds to what is already there resulting in more money for the next month with envelope budgeting the amount of money left to spend in a given category can be calculated at any time by counting the money in the envelope optionally each envelope can be marked with the amount due each month if a bill is known ahead of time and the due date for the bill spreadsheet budgeting with dateshifting  editbudget spreadsheets with dateshifting typically offer a detailed view of a 12month income and expense plan a good way to follow and manage a budget when using a spreadsheet that offers dateshifting is to set the current month a few months before the current month along the 12month cycle month 4 for example in this way previous expenses and results can be viewed when creating or adjusting the budgeting planning avoid few pitfalls  editonce you have a budget it is also important to follow it and manage within the budget allocated pitfalls to watch out for are as below have a goal in mind know the future expenses do not get too harsh on entertainment  personal expenses plan for the unexpected track your spending  review it regularly adjust and update budget accordingly
