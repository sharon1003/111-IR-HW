energy supplies of the world  petroleum coal gas uranium published actual energy supplies coal oil natural gas uranium most recent report data included here is from a published may 2010 report from the ogj the oil and gas journal the efforts at extracting shale gas in the united states by the process of what is called fracking are not documented here partly due to our concerns of the extreme environmental damages done in those efforts depending on whether that can be done on a large scale with minimal environmental damage some of these results may be affected as a true scientist i always have a very cautious attitude toward all new ideas especially when those new ideas are the source of a few giant corporations wanting to make billions of dollars of profits within good science any new idea is always confirmed or denied by having competitor scientists be given access to the new technology where they independently go through the logic and experimental research when they get similar results to the inventor then it is concluded that the new idea is good if they cannot confirm the claimed results then the new idea is considered to be either incomplete or faulty in recent decades a few truly huge corporations are so wealthy and so powerful that they are able to get laws passed where they both deny any competitor any access to new ideas they come up with and also they create an absolute secrecy regarding any experimental results they might have so in several very profitable fields those megacorporations have felt absolutely free to do anything they wish one of the scariest examples is monsanto chemicals which has essentially been using the 300 million americans as guinea pigs regarding their genetically modified foods there is no doubt that gmo has the potential of wonderful advances the problem is that in 1992 monsanto ot the us government to agree to never label any gmo foods because they got the government to agree that many people would not buy gmo foods if they knew from food labels in addition monsanto got many very unique laws passed by the us congress where they have absolute monopolistic control of that whole field of research and currently more than 90 control of all seeds used by all farmers in the us again if we had independent confirmation of the safety of specific gmo products fine but the entire safety of 300 million americans is reliant on having to totally trust monsanto to never make any mistakes and always be honest and honorable but monsanto has shown many times that when billions of dollars is involved they rarely seem to be either honest or honorable similar situations exist in many other multibillion dollar businesses the really troubling fact is that no one seems willing to look to future safety when billions of dollars is sitting there gmo is especially troublesome as researchers have found that laboratory animals often have dna changes occur several generations after some modification has been done in an experiment that seems to imply that thirdgeneration or fifthgeneration humans might all have their dna altered a hundred years later due to some mistake having been done in some gmo alteration of tomatoes or other foods that we all unknowingly eat today in the case of fracking the process has only been tried for around five years and it is already known that the horrific chemicals injected down into the earth to more easily extract natural gas does seriously contaminate the aquifers down there no one knows whether groundwater supplies of ten years from now or fifty years from now will be deadly or safe to drink the actual scientific research has not yet been donei personally find it rather scary that in 2005 the us government chose to let the companies that are doing fracking to be exempt from that is do not have to comply with the clean water act the companies got that legal exemption passed several years before the public or the senators or congressmen had ever even heard of fracking contributing to political campaigns from k street with lobbyists certainly works but does this indicate that our senate and congress are willing to totally sell out even our health and safety regarding the water supply which we need to survive many people have noted that the tobacco industry denied absolutely everything that was critical of cigarettes for decades and they always got congress to support them the asbestos industry the same where massive amounts of asbestos still exist in america today the lead industry defended against all challenges for decades for decades including trying to destroy the career and credibility of a scientist named needleman in the 1980s after three years of vicious attacks needlemans work was proven true and lead was then gradually removed from gasoline there is still massive amounts of lead in paint in american houses today in many of these cases it eventually was learned that the industries not only gave enormous amounts of money to specific political campaigns but they also gave huge amounts of money to thousands of scientists to make public arguments to try to justify their products wowi am merely a research scientist and not anyone with political skills so i am merely an observer regarding such things but it sure seems really scary to mepoliticians regularly seem to talk as though american supplies of energy are virtually unlimited but many experts have said for a long time that is not true just what are the facts here are data from the oil and gas journal ogj and other respected and trusted sources along with the rates that we are consuming each type of energy the results are definitely interesting and scarythose respected sources show that without imported oil the united states would completely use up all the known american oil reserves including offshore in slightly over four years the whole world figures to use up all the known world oil supplies in 43 years or even less if world demand keeps rapidly growing that oil took hundreds of millions of years to form the 2010 published report statistical review of world energy june 2010 bp includes two tiny graphics that show these facts but they chose to not describe it in words near the bottom of page 28 is a graphic that shows that north america has around 8 years of natural gas left in known and suspected supplies near the bottom of page 43 there is a graphic which has no explanation but their data shows that the world currently has known or suspected supplies of oil for about 467 years natural gas for about 628 years and coal for about 119 years which confirms the more clear calculations we provide here apparently we must keep in mind that that organization represents and promotes the giant corporations that mine and sell those specific energy products their report has a number of very tricky features rather than referring to the terrifyingly short 4 years and 8 years we have calculated for the united states they leave that text out which they used to nicely discuss in previous year reports and only have those crude visuals that mention all of north america canada definitely has large supplies of oil natural gas and uranium which the us has been buying for many years with extensive study it is possible to discover references to slightly longer time intervals of us supplies but even those optimistic numbers only show 108 years for all known and suspected u s oil 467 years for the world and for all known and suspected u s natural gas 117 years and 628 years for the world it is such terrifying information no wonder they go to so much trouble to keep anyone from understanding their reportit is also not very obvious to see that the us produced 5934 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2009 but it consumed much more at 6466 billion cubic meters if it were not for the fact that canada happens to produce 161 bil while only consuming 95 bil where they have a lot of excess gas that they can sell to the us we really would have no way to use the amounts of natural gas we use today canada figures to need their own gas in coming years and that will force us to cut back around ten percent on the amount of natural gas we use today yet politicians and t boone pickens want america to change all vehicles over to burning natural gas instead of gasoline dont they know that we already have to import truly massive amounts of natural gas for what we already do and that even if we would drill hundreds of new wells we would at best use up all the remaining natural gas under america within a handful of years is anyone paying attention since every congressman and senator has a staff of over 400 people working for himher shouldnt at least one of those 20000 highlytaxpayerpaid staff members have learned this stuff editors note this information and the 2010 report upon much of it is based does not include a very controversial method that some mining companies have recently begun using to extract oil and natural gas something often called fracking that method is amazingly destructive to the environment they intentionally chemically contaminate enormous amounts of water which is then pumped down into bored wells which is then followed by massive dynamiting the process certainly releases a lot of natural gas that otherwise was unavailable but it totally dynamites entire mountains out of existence as well as intentionally polluting and contaminating rivers and land where pure water may be beyond ever recovering by late 2012 fracking seems to won over everyone news reports now claim that the us will become entirely energy selfsufficient due to fracking and they tell endless optimistic speculations this is a process which was not even thought possible just a few years ago and already we have bought into committing our future and the environment to the consequences of fracking my personal suspicion is that fracking will be seen to cause such massive environmental damage including medical effects on nearby residents within a year or two that laws will be tried to get passed to forbid its use really huge amounts of money will certainly be given to politicians to make sure that such laws do not passi wonder if we might become so totally dependent on the additional gas and oil obtained by fracking that society overlooks the destructive aspects of fracking i guess the question is whether common sense or a pursuit of billions of dollars of profit will win that debate i hope and trust that the right side will win and that our societal lust for more and more energy might be somehow tamed or solved by other energy sources which do not have so many terrible consequences possibly including some of the concepts and devices described in these related web pages i also hope that russia and canada and the us will resist destroying the seafloor under the arctic ocean in their announced pursuit of oil well drilling there at the moment the various countries and companies are still arguing over who has control or ownership of those regions which had always been inaccessible under the north polar ice cap i strongly encourage you to find some honest source of information on the fracking process regarding the terrible chemicals injected into the earths water supplies along with the environmental consequences of dynamiting many mountains into nonexistence the people of north dakota have apparently not read such information and all they see is that they are now experiencing business prosperity specifically because of fracking please note that the assumed not actually proven reserves under alaska which might be available by additional drilling and pipelines is actually rather small at the rate that the us is currently using up petroleum around 7 billion barrels per year it is generally believed by experts that only a few months of true benefit would will occur by removing all the oil under alaskasomehow logic does not seem to be applying politicians in tv interview shows now april 2006 are insisting that by digging up alaska for additional oil we may get a full million barrels every day from those domestic sources sounds good huh except that a it would take at least ten years to actually start receiving that oil and b the 7 billion barrels of oil that we currently use means 22 million barrels per day see the strangeness a big and expensive production to extract all the possible oil from under alaska and under the oceans around it might provide one million barrels per day onetwentieth of our current usage or 5 and that is only if the optimistic opinions of oil there are trueon top of that the famous alaska pipeline has been regularly leaking in recent years due to massive corrosion and extreme lack of maintenance whether anyone wants to spend more billions to repair or replace the pipeline would be another consideration that no politician seems interested in consideringpublic service categories selfsufficiency  many suggestions environmental subjects scientific subjects advanced physics social subjects religious subjects public encyclopedia services home page main menu email in any case alaska oil might represent a single year of oil supply for the us the thousands of oil rigs in the gulf of mexico might represent about three years supply we have already sucked out virtually all the oil under texas and oklahoma and other states and whether or not states or the government gives in and lets bp and the others drill off the atlantic coast and off california another couple years supply notice this is not saying centuries but years you will see much of the american transportation system shut down within a handful of years why cant someone plan ahead other politicians and leaders brag about being able to grow american corn and then process it into ethanol as being the glowing solution to all the future energy needs and the ending of dependence on imported supplies of energy a discussion below notes that with all currently known methods of processing corn into ethanol more external meaning imported fuel is required in that processing than the ethanol will eventually be able to provide spokespeople seem to happen to forget to mention this fact that manufacturing ethanol is a losing proposition they also seem to forget to mention that we are currently 2007 using up around 15 of all the corn grown in the us for making ethanol which is already endangering the supplies of food and livestock feed from corn to produce only enough ethanol for around 140 of what we consume as gasoline in our vehicles what additional corn do they expect to grow and process into ethanol bush has announced that 13 of all us cropland will be used for ethanol production in 2008 we have to hope that we dont have any storms or floods that affect the remaining cropland as we all enjoy being able to eat foodmany people who have emailed in to criticize this presentation which i note is all officially published figures instantly say that by tapping alaskan oil the us will be totally independent of foreign oil for many decades those people have been given very wrong information the huge and expensive aleyska alaskan pipeline has already nearly depleted all the certainly known supplies in around 30 years was that in supplying 7 billion barrels per year no that existing pipeline had originally been operated at near its capacity of around a million barrels per day in 365 days that is 0365 billion barrels per year this confirms the fact that alaskan oil has only supplied a maximum of around five percent of american petroleum consumption 0365  70 and even at that we have already used up nearly all the known oil supplies the oil flowing through the existing alaska pipeline has greatly dropped off in recent years as wells have gone dry in recent months only around 04 million barrels had been flowing per day less than half full prior to it being completely shut down due to massive corrosion aug 2006 see the reality in the 30 years that oil has been massively pumped out of alaska the pipeline has never had the capacity to carry even 10 of the countrys needs so if people truly think that alaska is some sort of magical solution to the vast importation of petroleum then they will need to build around 20 more pipelines to carry it across alaska to valdez but even if they did that where we could obtain our entire 7 billion barrels of consumption from there even really optimistic estimates do not indicate that there is much over 7 billion barrels of oil still in the ground under alaska so we would use it all up in just one year actually less because more realistic scientists believe there is only 2 or 3 billion barrels of oil still under alaska which we would use up in 3 or 5 months why doesnt anyone see how foolish it would be to invest enormous amounts of money to build more giant pipelines and to drill more oil wells separate from all the environmental issues it is just a stupid idea but all the politicians make it sound that by permitting oil drilling in the alaskan wildlife refuge all our oil problems would be solved not even close there are certainly people especially the oil companies that wouldwill make a fortune but for virtually no actual benefit it might be different if there were truly large reserves of oil under alaska but we have already removed much of them and already burned them its like wanting to build an impressive gate after all the horses have escaped but the american public has been greatly convinced that this is some kind of brilliant idea only for those who will make fortunesin 2005 and 2006 it became very popular for politicians to give speeches regarding spending hundreds of billions of taxpayer money to build a hundred new nuclear power plants their research staffs must not have informed them that the us closed its last uranium mine more than ten years earlier as we have already mined essentially all the uranium under the united states the official government data presented below shows that we imported around 92 of all the uranium used in our nuclear power plants in 2002 it would have been even higher except that we have been decommissioning nuclear weapons and degrading the warheads into reactor fuels sorry for the editorial comments but even as an impassionate scientist there are some truly foolish ideas being promoted which have virtually no relationship to reality even if enormous amounts of oil were now discovered in alaska or under the oceans around it we still have no obvious way to transport enough out to provide more than about 5 of our current needs yes the newly drilled oil might be able to provide that 5 of our needs for 10 or 20 years is it really worth destroying a wildlife refuge and potentially contaminating large areas just to briefly provide 5 of our oil needs no one seems to ask that question i am not necessarily expressing an opinion here only asking a logical question those published sources also show that without imported natural gas the united states would completely use up all the known american natural gas reserves in slightly over eight years the whole world figures to use up all the known natural gas supplies in 67 years or even much less since world demand keeps rapidly growing for the united states this is especially catastrophic since natural gas is a difficult product to transport long distances it is certainly possible to produce the methane that is the primary component of natural gas but the current techniques tend to use up a lot of other fuels in the process as a result of a vague impression of shortages of those resources and the current necessity of importing around 63 of the oil we americans use up and even more in the future politicians have recently started talking about building a lot of new nuclear plants there are only 103 now operating and they produce around 20 of the electricity used in the united states the published figures reprinted below show that we have already mined the vast majority of uranium under the united states and we now only have enough speculative uranium left for around 4 years of current usage rates in generating electricity and even that is incredibly optimistic in 1995 the doe department of energy official report on existing supplies of american uranium indicated that the total of the proved reserves and the estimated additional resources as defined in that report could provide a total of around 3000 tons of u 3 o 8 given that number and knowing that we use up around 28000 tons of u 3 o 8 each year that is barely one months supply the remaining speculative uranium under the united states would be very hard to get to to mine and it would therefore be many times more expensive than any uranium from anywhere else if politicians think they want to use american taxpayer money to build a lot of new nuclear plants maybe they should review the facts presented below also some other facts from their own government reports such as that in 2002 573 million pounds of nuclear ore was processed and loaded into us reactors however only 234 million pounds were provided from domestic sources with 527 million pounds being imported the remainder came from stockpiles mostly from decommissioning nuclear weapons into nuclear fuel 92 of the uranium we used in 2002 was importedthere are very good reasons for that in 1975 published reports suggested that the united states had 581 thousand metric tons of reasonably assured and another 962 thousand metric tons of estimated additional us erda report jan 1977 for a total of 1543 thousand metric tons in 2005 that total is now 102 thousand metric tons of which none is reasonably assured note that we have already mined over 93 of all the uranium in the united states and 100 of that that is easily minable and these figures are the more recent inflated values including more speculative sources remembering that the doe report of 1995 indicated a total of 3000 tons of economically viable u 3 o 8 in 1990 there were 39 uranium mines operating in the us producing 89 million pounds of uranium per year by the year 2000 that was down to 10 mines producing 40 million pounds and by 2003 down to 6 mines producing 2344 million pounds is that scary worse the 6 mines are not mines at all but operations that recover uranium from various sources specifically decommissioned nuclear warheads there are no operating uranium mines in the us during these past several yearsnot one pound of uranium has been mined in the us for more than 20 years with over 92 of the uranuim used in our nuclear powerplants being imported much of the rest came from decommissioned nuclear warheads that have been degraded into fuelgrade material again the world is better off in seeming to have sufficient uranium for around 52 years at current usage rates coal seems to be the only fuel that we have in abundant quantity does this mean that american society will soon need to revert to that of 150 years ago when coal powered industry more significantly why are no political leaders even mentioning any of this their good friends and generous political donors the giant companies that mine and process and sell these resources probably dont want us to get scared over such things but shouldnt they be accountable to us it is my hope that someone reviews these figures and then confirms that they are accurate and starts to try to do something and rather that simply relying on this webpage for the data you can find these figures on industry and government webpages what could be done good question but the united states seems hurtling toward a day possibly within ten years where there will be a crisis of every type of energy supply how will american industry compete in the world market then and what will happen to the highenergymaintenance lifestyles of americans wowit is also useful to look at the energy sources used to create our electricity we will use official published figures for the year 1975 and then 1999 for comparisons in 1975 the us used up a total of 711  10 15 btus of energy supplies of which 201  10 15 btus was consumed to make our electricity roughly 28 of the total in 1999 the us consumed a total of 966  10 15 btus of energy supplies of which 394  10 15 btus was consumed to make our electricity roughly 41 of the total electricity consumption essentially doubled between those times but the consumption of usage for other purposes nearly stayed the same traffic increased a little but vehicles are slightly more efficient so not much change there enormous numbers of factories in the us have closed down where products are now being manufactured in china and elsewhere so that usage has actually dropped but for a bad reason here are the specific energy sources used to create that electricity1975 energy use for electricity production source amount  10 15 btus percent coal 96

154petroleum 13 33hydroelectric 33 85nuclear 77 196other 09 24total 394 1000we can see some interesting things from this data the contribution from hydroelectric has stayed relatively constant because there are really no more large rivers that can be dammed in the us in very recent years that contribution has started going down because the continued massive usage has caused the water level in most reservoirs to have greatly dropped for example lake powell of the glen canyon dam has been around 120 feet low for the past couple years 2004 and 2005 lower water level means that even more water must be released to generate a constant output that is demanded by consumers and by congress because the lower water has less potential energy to give up usage of petroleum to generate electricity has greatly dropped off a good thing but consumption of natural gas in generating electricity nearly doubled the us has massive amounts of coal so it is good that the usage of coal had doubled during that period in 1975 nuclear power was really just getting going on a large scale so the 1999 figures are much higher however since 1999 the us has essentially run out of uranium figures below and so that has been dropping back off recently note that the other category even with massive government financing only got up to producing 24 of the electricity by a total of wind solar biomass and geothermal facilities considering the enormous financial investments in such things the performance is distressingly minor and is likely to never become really significantwhy because of the scale of the rate that we are using up all those resources politicians do not seem to comprehend that consider this in 1999 just to make about 15 of our electricity we permanently used up about 6000000000000 cubic feet of natural gas that amount is hard to comprehend it means that every year around 90000 cubic feet of natural gas are used up for every family in the us for the record even families that heat their homes with natural gas in cold climates generally use far less than that every year in 1975 the total natural gas consumption was around 198  10 15 btus so usage for making electricity was less than 16 of that in 1999 that production was nearly the same 199 but we had to import more than 15 additional to fill our needs important note politicians seem confident that alternate fuels will easily provide for all of americas future energy needs if it were true that there were already available 50000000000000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas to replace the energy content of one years usage of 20000000000000 cubic feet of natural gas fine assuming that all that equipment could be altered to use hydrogen as a fuel but there is an enormous problem hydrogen gas does not exist naturally it immediately chemically reacts to create compounds specifically water in order to get hydrogen then we must spend energy to dissociate water and that process is not very energy efficientthe point here is that hydrogen cannot correctly be seen as a natural resource at all it must be manufactured by first using up some other source of energy usually electricity to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen even if some dreamer imagines that hydrogen would someday provide 20000000000000000 btu that is now supplied to us each year by natural gas they need to give some thought to the fact that at least four times that amount of energy needs to be used in first getting the hydrogen in other words hydrogen cannot be any energy solution for the future instead it should be looked at as a highertech version of a battery which also requires some external source of electric power to charge it up batterypowered or hydrogenpowered vehicles might sound really exciting to the public and to politicians but that is only because they have not yet thought through the entire picture specifically of where that source energy would come fromso sadly the future will not be able to rely on either hydrogen or batteries to solve longterm problems in a shortterm sure they will look very impressive to reporters and carbuyers but in the bigger view they are a poor idea and a waste of a lot of effort that really needs to be directed more to actually finding solutionsthere is actually a very obvious area where research should be done in fact it should have been occurring for the past 30 years it turns out that the generation and distribution of electricity is horribly inefficient of all the energy that is in the source fuel which gets used up amazingly only around 13 of it actually arrives at our electrical outlets to be used oneeighth what happens to that other 87 virtually all of it winds up heating the atmosphere being closely related to global warming in a link down below there is a discussion of efficiencies of different types of electrical powerplants all of which are generally in the 30 overall efficiency range from there that electricity gets sent the many miles to you through wires which all heat up due to the massive amounts of electricity run through them they are essentially all like those hot wires inside your toasterpeople have ripped into me for many years regarding this statement that 60 of the electricity put into the powergrid at the power plants is lost and that only 40 of the electricity makes it through the powergrid so it is refreshing to see that ibm has started running tv commercials in jan 2009 that start off announcing that more than half of electricity is lost in the powergrid maybe people will be willing to believe ibm about such statementsso what i see as the saddest aspect of this whole mess is that we could have greatly improved things at least 30 years ago there are relatively easy ways to improve the 13 delivery up to nearly 50 delivery so we would only have to be using up around 14 of the precious resources we now do in making the same amount of electricity the hurdle is that the equipment to do that is very expensive utilities have never wanted to have to make such massive investments because they have never needed to or been forced to do so the most obvious improvement is to simply stop dumping enormous amounts of heat with cooling towers and the like and instead using some more expensive low pressure steam turbines to remove much of the heat from that otherwise wasted heat you may already be using a similar technology home central furnaces around 1960 were around 60 efficient with the rest of the heat going up the chimney by 1980 better heat exchangers and designs had gotten that up to around 80 but then a new technology was introduced actually an old technology but first applied to home furnaces  the concept of a condensing furnace such furnaces do not even need a conventional chimney but simply a plastic pvc pipe millions of homes already have these highefficiency furnaces which have around 97 or 98 efficiency that general idea could be applied to electric powerplants and even after the utility had squeezed out every bit of electricity they could create the lowgrade heat could even then be used in many ways for example at least one electric powerplant in germany has been providing freeheating for hundreds of nearby homesas to distribution electric lines it may be possible to put thermal insulation around each wire to reduce losses this is done when such lines have to run in underground conduits so the technology already exists there are certainly many solutions but people have to start addressing the right questions in order to find themaround 1981 i mentioned to some fellow physicists these ideas regarding greatly improving the thermal efficiency of electric power generation and distribution i was laughed at and told that i was being very foolish for thinking about such things i eventually realized that they simply assumed that the designers of such equipment had already made everything as efficient as it should be they were wrong in that assumptionthe existing energy resources regarding each type of fuel no one can absolutely say the precise amount of a fuel that is still in the ground still not mined modern technological tools like sonar can provide good guidelines as to where the fuel is and how much of it is there but until it is actually brought up to the surface any numbers regarding future quantities must be estimates sometimes two different estimates are provided one for proven reserves which are usually the extents of known resources and the other being future discoveries based on many assumptions regarding advances in technology the first value is probably pretty reliable the second is often rather speculative we have generally tried to avoid the speculative guesses as to future discoveries mostly because researchers have already used satellites and many other technologies to examine every portion of the earth and large undiscovered quantities of any of these energy resources seems relatively unlikely we will consider each primary energy resource separately here oil natural gas nuclear coal and hydroelectric note some of the tables have base quantities of 1000 million in other tables we use the term billion for that same quantity the bp tables use 1000 million because in britain the word billion means a million million what americans would call a trillion so in any cases where the words billion or trillion are used here it is in an american usage of meaning 10 9 and 10 12 we apologize for the possible confusion in britain oil oil supply proved oil reserves in 1000 million barrelsrank

barrels note a barrel is equal to 159 litres 42 gallons there are two important considerations to note in this data using the 2004 data note that the united states had 294 billion barrels of proven reserves and that we were using oil up at 6873 billion barrels per year this indicates that without any imported oil we would use up all of the proven reserves in just 428 years four years usage is all we have everusing the 2009 data note that the united states had 284 billion barrels of proven reserves and that we were using oil up at 682 billion barrels per year this indicates that without any imported oil we would use up all of the proven reserves in just 416 years four years usage is all we have everthe other is the same thing for the world the world proven reserves 2004 were 11886 billion barrels and that the world was using oil up at 27613 billion barrels per year this indicates that even if future use does not increase in china and the other developing countries all of the known oil reserves in the world will be used up gone in just 43 years the world proven reserves 2009 were 13324 billion barrels and that the world was using oil up at 30688 billion barrels per year this indicates that even if future use does not increase in china and the other developing countries all of the known oil reserves in the world will be used up gone in just 43 years however looking at the amazingly rapid increase in consumption in china india south korea and many other developing countries it seems clear that worldwide consumption of oil will certainly soon double meaning that worldwide supplies may not last much beyond 20 years from nowas a personal observation with the total united states oil supply only being 25 of the worlds total and the fact that current us consumption would use all us oil up in only four years or so i wonder about the actual benefit of building more billion dollar pipelines across alaska to try to remove more of the oil up there faster

encouraged that you review these tables especially this last one specifically to see that the usa uses 2489 of the worlds production of petroleum while producing only 853 this means that we have a constant shortage of 1636 of the worlds production which must be provided by imports from other countries this is why we have to import nearly 70 of all the petroleum that we use 1636  1636  853 then look at the list to see which countries are friendly to the usa we can certainly count on canada but they only have about 118 of excess production that they do not need themselves we tremendously rely on the nearly 3 excess from mexico the over 3 excess from venezuela and about a half percent excess from colombia it may be optimistic to say that those countries are friends to the usa their governments now seem averse to us foreign policies and it seems likely that any of those three might easily suddenly decide to sell instead to china if that country offers a far better price but we are noting that these near neighbors and potentially reliable friends only can provide around half of our current shortfall the result is that we have immense dependence on a very few countries in the mideast specifically saudi arabia and uae and kuwait which between them produce an excess of around 17 which would actually be enough for us our dependence on those three specific countries is enormous if saddam had been able to keep and hold kuwait in 1991 it would have been a petroleumsupply nightmare for the usa that war in 1991 was promoted as enabling the kuwaiti people to remain free but the us had far more important financial reasons for needing to do it similarly if the large number of extremist wahhabi muslims in saudi arabia should decide to attack the few hundred members of the saudi royal family and exterminate them and start running saudi arabia the us figures to have a crisis that it cannot overcome the wahhabis would not likely sell a drop of petroleum to the us and they would certainly find other customers such as china it is possible that in a single day the greatest available supply of imported petroleum to the us could terminate causing economic consequences that are beyond imagination when people talk about terrorists doing another 91101 they may be worrying about small potatoes by simply doing a coup in saudi arabia and ending that supply of petroleum to us they could clearly do a thousand times more damage to us than the reality of 91101 did our leaders seem to spend their time worrying about the wrong questions each congressman and senator has a staff of around 400 people which we taxpayers pay for of course what do those people do shouldnt they be able to find this published information shouldnt at least a few of that city of employees be able to see the dark consequences of decisions that are only halfthoughtthrough as a result of all this we necessarily rely on potentially unstable governments such as nigeria as suppliers of petroleum it is very scaryethanol politicians and spokespeople for a few giant corporations keep bragging about ethanol as being the total solution to the energy crisis regarding gasoline for vehicles this is an example of what has become amazingly effective as spin where outright deception is done to mislead the public it is unbelievable that we allow such behaviors by leaders without arresting themfirst yes ethanol actually has most of the benefits that are attributed to it the most significant disadvantage regarding actual vehicles is that ethanol has long been known to meltdestroy rubber seals like orings in automotive fuel systems so nearly all older vehicles cannot use ethanol or even the standard modern gasoline which contains maybe 10 ethanol without having damage but overall this still sounds wonderful in fact if kept as a hobbylevel fuel it would be great but that is not how it is promotedthe primary reason why ethanol has been promoted so heavily is because it is a product that is made from corn and from the usa currently 2007 roughly 20 of all corn grown in the usa is used up for producing ethanol before ethanol that corn was used as food for people and for livestock toward our national food supply there are already great concerns that even that 20 reduction of available corn for food uses is endangering our food supply as long as weather is good we may be fine but if there are any weather anomalies where crops are damaged or destroyed there may be immediate food supply crises with no obvious solution except to start importing food and cornthat 20 of the entire national corn crop used to create ethanol generates around 5 billion gallons of ethanol this might sound like a lot but it is not when compared to our usage of gasoline a simple way that we can see this is to note that there are presently 140 million drivers in the us and the average driver drives 12000 miles per year for that mileage the average driver buys a little over 600 gallons of gasoline per year so between all those drivers multiplying we see that about 84 billion gallons of gasoline are used up by private drivers each year if we add in the many large trucks and the millions of smaller trucks and railroads and airliners and taxis and all the rest government figures show that roughly 200 billion gallons of gasoline or diesel are used each year in the usa the 5 billion gallons of ethanol currently made from 15 of all the corn crop is therefore only about 140 of the actual consumptioncould we rely on ethanol much more than we already are it is hard to see how unless we stop raising livestock no steaks and no milk and eating corn products we cannot give up many more percent of the corn crop to being used to make ethanol we are already about at the maximum that is possible so when president bush and nascar and politicians keep insisting that america can become selfsufficient by building and selling vehicles that can run on e85 85 ethanol as compared to the common current 10 they seem to be ignorant of where that ethanol would come from sure there is plenty of ethanol for nascar races but such things are actually misleading the american public into thinking that there is no problem or that technology has solved the future energy supply problems it is absolutely untrue and what i would define as a lie because the people promoting such statements know that they are not truethere is yet another tremendous disadvantage to using ethanol virtually no one seems willing to admit that the processing of corn into ethanol is very energy intensive by any known method it always takes more external fuel which is invariably petroleum or natural gas based to make ethanol than the end fuel contains making ethanol is a losing proposition have you ever heard anyone admit that fact so the actual fact is that the production of ethanol is not only using up 20 of the entire corn crop of all us farmers but also requiring more additional imported oil and natural gas than it could ever replacedo such things ever make you wonder how competent our leaders are it also makes one wonder exactly when anyone is going to realize that this ethanol adventure has been a really stupid idea our government has provided the taxpayer money to nearly entirely finance everything related to ethanol so businesses have had very little to lose our politicians see that brazil has accomplished getting most of their vehicles to run on brazilgrownsugarcane ethanol but brazil has far fewer vehicles than we do and they have very large croplands that are not needed for feeding cattle so it works pretty well in that country as to why politicians assume that it will work in the usa is pretty hard to fathom you may have also realized that where the us used to be a huge provider of food for starving people in many countries the fact that we now have deleted 20 of the corn from availability as food has greatly affected that you may have noticed that representatives of ngos nongovernmental organizations such as charities have been making a lot of noise over this situation but as long as the american government thinks that ethanol is going to solve all the energy problems they are not going to change their current courseas an update note to this discussion on ethanol in april 2007 it was announced that massive numbers of american farmers have converted from growing crops like wheat to growing corn because the demand for ethanol had recently doubled the crop value of corn it is predicted that in 2008 fully 13 of all grain crops grown in the usa will be corn primarily to be converted into ethanol news reports also have noted that dairy cattle will have less and more expensive corn to eat in the future meaning that there will be less and more expensive milk and milk products to eat with less wheat being planted there will be less wheat for processing into bread and bread products again reducing supplies and increasing the grocery prices for us large numbers of types of food figure to rapidly get far more expensive for all of us at the grocery store and nearly completely this is occurring because of this sad adventure in trying to solve energy supply problems with producing ethanol at least if someone was going to try something like this it would have been nice if they decided to try something that had a more realistic

isotopes u238 u234 and u235 only the last of these is useful for the fission process in other words for electric power plants or for weapons unfortunately only 071 of natural uranium is u235 so mining a metric ton tonne of uranium only results in 71 kilograms or about 15 pounds of u235 this is accomplished by a process called enriching the uranium it also results in the rest nearly all u238 being depleted uranium this happens to be one of the most dense materials that exists nearly twice as heavy as lead and nearly three times as heavy as iron because of this fact it was discovered that there was a handy way to use up massive amounts of depleted uranium by adding a layer of armoring on military tanks the fact that incoming shells are only lead they tend to have fairly minimal effect on the tank structure this improves the physical safety of the crew inside the tank with the possible exception of the constant radiation of so much nearby uranium for many hours during tank duty it is not necessary or desirable to enrich the uranium to really high u235 percentages which is necessary for weaponsgrade material it is only necessary to improve the 071 natural percentage of u235 up to around 4 for fission to be reliable modern fuel pellets are sometimes made to around 5 u235 which is very expensive to do even pure u235 uranium cannot be completely converted into energy when an atom of 235 u 92 fissions it generally breaks apart into two mediumsized nuclei usually one with an atomic weight in the 90 to 100 range and the other in the 140 to 150 range an example is a 92 kr 36 nucleus and a 141 ba 56 nucleus along with three neutrons one neutron  235 u briefly becomes 236 u which breaks up into the five objects mentioned which have a total atomic mass of 92  141  1  1  1 or 236 note that this fission which occurs because low speed neutrons are created in abundance and which crash into other nuclei to break them apart is extremely different from if the 235 u was left alone to spontaneously disintegrate in millions of years where it simply gives off an alphaparticle 4 he 2 and becomes a 231 th 90 nucleus the real difference is that this second process does not create lots of extra low speed neutrons it is possible to analyze the overall efficiency of fission and it is surprisingly low if the entire weight mass of a u235 atom and the neutron which hits it are described as pure energy it is around 220000 millionelectronvolts of energy after that atom fissions we can total up the energy of the new mass of the five resulting objects and the total around 219800 millionelectronvolts of energy nearly all the mass still exists as mass something that virtually no nonphysicist seems to know only about 11000 of the mass of the atom plus neutron disappears so only that small fraction becomes energy therefore that single atom fissioning releases around 199 millionelectronvolts total of energy in a variety of ways so the fission process actually only has an energy efficiency of just under 01 or 199  220000 so nuclear energy at least as fission is not a very efficient process however there is another type of nuclear energy called fusion which is highly efficient there are several variants of fusion which are possible one of the more tame of which is what powers our sun we have another webpage on the specific fusion process that the sun uses with all the techspeak related to that the united states appeared to have far more natural uranium than any other country in 1975 it was considered that there were probably around 581000 metric tons that was reasonably confirmed and that there were an additional 962000 metric tons that had not been found but that seemed likely to exist this second figure is extremely speculative as it is not based on any actual data or any proven logic and it represents primarily an educated guess regarding such additional reserves the total of these two was 1543000 metric tons according to the world nuclear association in their website as of 2005 reasonably assured resources plus inferred resources rar  ir essentially the total of the two figures above of course realizing that we had been mining uranium rapidly and constantly since 1975 the usa currently has a total of 102000 metric tons of rar  ir where we had 1543000 metric tons in 1975 we only had 102000 metric tons just 30 years later and that remaining amount is not easily mined this explains why all the 39 uranium mines in the united states closed down in the early 1990s we import essentially all the uranium used in nuclear power plantsit is sort of amusing darkly to a physicist to see politicians talk about building a hundred new nuclear power plants to supposedly solve our foreign dependence on energy supplies one would think that they should be aware of the fact that we have had to import virtually 100 of all the uranium used in the nuclear power plants we now operate do they think the tooth fairy will provide a massive new supply of uranium for the horde of new reactors they want to spend taxpayer money to build by the time that such new reactors might be ready to go into operation around 2020 even the supplies of canada and australia will have mostly been used up we will not likely have any logical source for uranium for existing nuclear power plants much less another hundred new ones they want to build it would figure that we could wind up with a hundred shiny new nuclear power plants which will never able to be used planning ahead does not seem to be required any moreit seems amazing that this does not seem frightening to our leaders not counting military uses or uses for research we certainly need to be mining at least 14000 metric tons of natural uranium each year just to supply the hundred existing nuclear powerplants we are operating and our experts only believe we have 102000 metric tons yet to find we need to replace around 2000 metric tons of spent fuel pellets and they each required enrichment by about a factor of seven to get up to the 4 or 5 necessary for operation and multiplying is the need for 14000 metric tonnes of raw uranium it is mined as a material called yellowcake which is an oxide of uranium about 40 of the weight of yellowcake is oxygen atoms that have to be removed in the 30 years between 1975 and 2005 if we have mined 14000 metric tons each year that is around 420000 metric tons we have already mined only counting the uranium used for power plant reactors so that the figures seem to generally agree 581000  420000 is in very rough agreement to the recent assessment that we now probably have 102000 metric tons yet available to mine on the good side countries like australia have discovered huge amounts of natural uranium here is a chart of the countries with the largest rar  ir amounts facts in september 2005 the world nuclear association published information announced the following figures which may be optimistic given their position as officially promoting nuclear energy and mining regarding supplies of uranium in two categories reasonably accessible and inferred that is far more difficult to dig up the numbers are in metric tonnes they note that each year 68000 metric tonnes are used up consider that fact in examining the world supplies which they published in sept 2005 country reasonably assured inferred speculative australia 700000 10000kazakhstan 280000 90000canada 310000 30000south africa 120000 120000namibia 50000 70000russian federation 50000 60000niger 90000 20000united states 0 100000just in case you need clarification the grand total of all uranium under canada australia and the united states totaled about 1100000 metric tonnes in 2005 and the us is consuming most of the 68000 tonnes that get used up each year duh even using data which is likely to be as optimistic as the nuclear industry can get away with the us consumption will entirely use up all the uranium under canada australia and the united states by the year 2020 which even includes inferred deposits which are not even proven to exist and which would certainly be immensely costly to mine there is no realistic future for nuclear power generation beyond the year 2020 and even that is based on several assumptions which may be too optimistic this statement is certainly true in the united states but it seems unlikely that even france and japan and germany will be able to find or buy enough uranium to keep their existing nuclear power plants in operation after about 2020 in 1975 the estimated total amount of reasonably assured plus inferred resources in just the united states was 3700000 tons which as noted was recognized as the largest amount in any country in the world we are certainly efficient at mining arent we in just 15 years after that we had dug up nearly all the uranium under the united states and all those mines closed down for not having any more uranium to mine we reduced our supply of uranium in us mines from 3700000 tons down to a possible remaining 100000 tons which are considered to be in locations that are too difficult and too expensive to mine so our current total is actually closer to zero tonsduring that period of 1975 to 1990 our government used about 34 of all the uranium mined to create nuclear warheads with the other 14 having been used to feed our 103 nuclear power plants the iaea had previously published similar information for jan 1 2003  country reasonably assured plus inferred resourcesaustralia 1074000kazakhstan 622000canada 439000south africa 298000namibia 213000brazil 143000russian federation 158000united states 102000specifically about australia and canada we can see that in around three years 20032005 australias inferred remaining amount dropped from 1074000 to 710000 and canadas remaining amount dropped from 439000 to 340000 metric tonnes of course the number given for the united states has not changed since about 1992 since we no longer have any working uranium minesif these rates of reduction between the published 2003 and 2005 data have remained valid during the seven more years after the sept 2005 data we might extrapolate to estimate that australia might have mined nearly all the remaining uranium there already while canada might have mined an additional 200000 metric tonnes to now have maybe 140000 metric tonnes left under canada that is australia removed about 364000 tonnes in that 27 years or 135000 metric tons per year in the seven succeeding years that would be about 940000 of additional uranium ore mined in australia considerably more than the 710000 tonnes they had left in sept 2005 that seems to imply that australia may have already mined essentially all the uranium ore they had for canada the figures are 37000 tons per year during 2003 to 2005 which implies 260000 more tons in the next seven years leaving just 80000 metric tonnes left by late 2012 that suggests that canada might only have about two years of mining uranium ore leftthis published data seems to suggest that even the year 2020 may be unreasonably optimistic as terrifying as it might seem the us may start having immense difficulty in obtaining enough uranium for existing nuclear power plants by 2015 or 2017so the idea of spending many billions of dollars to build 100 new nuclear power plants is total insanity even the two new nuclear plants which president obama authorized which figure to be completed and ready to go into operation around 2020 may have no available nuclear fuel to put into themsee why this is really important stuff it seems realistic to conclude that both australias and canadas mines will run out of uranium within a couple years of now 2011 even in the most optimistic view the likelihood that either of those countries will have any uranium to sell to us in 2020 seems very unlikely you might also note that the us has no remaining uranium that is reasonably accessible which is why all those 39 mines closed nearly 20 years ago even if all those mines might be reopened at massive cost there is barely even oneyearssupply of inferred uranium that is believed to be in the total of the 39 minesso logic seems to be that the us will still not have uranium from the us mines and the two friendly countries will have also run out fairly soon where will the uranium come from for the existing us nuclear power plants in 2020 and afterward if china actually builds 470 new nuclear reactors or even a hundred or twenty doesnt it seem that china would certainly outbid the us for any uranium that kazakhstan might be willing to sell those publications stated that we were currently using up uranium at the rate of 68000 metric tonnes per year this is in reasonable agreement with the figures above where around 400000 metric tonnes of uranium has been used up in the six years since the 2005 figures the overall point here is that neither australia nor canada can possibly have enough remaining uranium to mine for even ten years from now and that is at current usage rates with china planning to build 470 nuclear power plants and many other countries also planning their own the available supplies will disappear far faster than even thatlogically it is hard to see how any nuclear power plant can possibly have any uranium to use even ten years from now unless the cost of uranium skyrockets so that every country that has even a few tonnes sends miners down to try to find it that world nuclear association in its impressive enthusiasm to promote nuclear energy found a way to make every imaginable assumption in claiming that the entire world probably contains enough remaining uranium to last for as long as 50 years when even they struggle to find a positive statement to make only a reference to 50 years maxx it is not a good sign no one is going to invest in a billion dollar uranium mine to try to find one or two tons of uranium which may be down therecertainly by 2020 no one will be able to ignore the fact that the price of uranium will have increased by ten times or more to motivate additional attempts at mining around the world and the fact that nuclear power plants will even then 2020 have become far too expensive to operate to supply electricity to anyoneso how can anyone explain the wild enthusiasm for building and operating nuclear power plants at least up until the march 2011 nuclear power plant disasters in japan consumption all of the reactors operating in the united states are light water reactors there are 69 pressurized water reactors pwrs and 34 boiling water reactors bwrs currently pwrs are reaching and exceeding a burnup meaning the amount of initial nuclear energy in the fuel of over 55000 mwdmtu megawattday per metric tonne of uranium and bwrs are reaching and exceeding burnups of greater than 45000 mwdmtu in both cases the fuel starts with a uranium235 concentration of between 45 and 50 and at discharge it is in the range of 06 to 08  uranium235 in 2004 the 103 operating nuclear reactors produced a record total of 789 billion k wh of electricity this info is from the nuclear energy institute inc we can analyze this information we can say that the average burnup is around 50000 megawattdaysmetric ton of uranium in the fuel this is the same as 1200000 megawatthourston of uranium in the fuel or 12  10 12 watthours it is known that roughly 2000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel is replaced each year with each metric ton having 12  10 12 wh of energy in it then 2000 metric tons have 2400  10 12 wh of energy that gets released from above we know that 789  10 12 wh become electricity this indicates that a nuclear plant has an overall operating efficiency of 7892400 or 329 this is in very good agreement with figures from other sources the overall efficiency is primarily limited by the efficiency of the steam turbine and the related huge heat losses from the cooling towers and the alternator configuration which converts the rotational energy of the turbine shaft into an electromagnetic field and then to electricity the primary point here is that we are confirming that 2000 metric tons of fuel is replaced each year that fuel is not just natural uranium natural uranium only has around 071 of the 235 u that is actually the fuel material natural uranium must therefore be enriched up to the nearly 5 required concentration for use in power generation reactors this is a complex and difficult process but the main point here is that seven times as much natural uranium needs to be processed in order to get one amount of enriched fuel suitable for the reactor therefore we are not just consuming 2000 metric tons of natural uranium each year but around 7 times that much or 14000 metric tons each year for current american electricity production of roughly 20 of the countrys electricity in actual use the nuclear fuel is processed into small fuel pellets each of which only weighs around 7 grams 14 of an ounce and about the size of a stub piece of chalk in school the 2000 metric tons that are discarded each year therefore actually are around 280 million little pellets of spent fuel there are already around 40000 metric tons of spent fuel currently needing to be stored somewhere from just american nuclear power plants this quantity if all brought together would cover a football field maybe 10 feet deep unfortunately it is all highly radioactive and therefore dangerous and that radioactivity constantly creates heat the world therefore seems to have sufficient uranium 3537 thousand metric tons68 thousand metric tons of consumption each year or a supply for 52 years as noted above the united states has a far worse situation 102 thousand14 thousand or only around 73 years and that quantity is in extremely difficult locations in mines that had been considered not profitable to mine because they are so hard to get to as a related subject the us decommissioned thousands of us and ussr retired nuclear bombs the nearly pure u235 from those warheads that the united states and the former soviet republics dismantled was then mixed with natural uranium or even depleted uranium to create nuclear material the us did this during the 2000 decade which provided a few percent of the uranium used in power plants in a great distinction with nuclear power plants which require uranium to be enriched to around 4 or 5 the nuclear weapons have uranium that was enriched to around 90 that is around 20 times more enriched than is needed for reactors so they could be deenriched with 19 times as much natural uranium to create 20 times that much usable reactor fuel since the year 2000 roughly 30 metric tons of highgrade nuclear weapons material has been replacing the need for around 9000 metric tons of uranium oxide each year as long as there was a supply of these decommissioned nuclear warheads the annual need of 14000 metric tons for producing american electricity was reduced this helped to stretch our meager supplies so the necessary importation of uranium for those years was not 100 but it dropped to around 92 as long as we still had decommissioned warheads to degrade into fuel a few experts seem aware of the upcoming crisis they are looking at many possibilities such as modifying some existing reactors to be able to use thorium232 as a fuel instead of uranium235 or plutonium239 there are fairly large known reserves of thorium it is not clear whether this is a generally usable concept it may take several decades to do enough research to know there is a clarification that seems necessary here in the year 2002 we gave a figure of 2000 metric tons of actual fuel pellets being installed in the 103 operating american reactors however we also said that 573 million pounds was used for that purpose this might seem confusing the explanation is this the 573 million pounds is 26000 metric tons of raw ore actually u 3 o 8 uranium oxide the usual form that natural uranium is found roughly 22000 metric tons of this is actually uranium this natural uranium is nearly all the isotope 238 u with only 071 being the important 235 u isotope that is used in reactors however reactors are designed to currently need fuel that is around 4 to 5 235 u in order to accomplish this enrichment all the 235 u from seven amounts of uranium ore is concentrated into one amount thereby enriching it from 071 to around 5 with the remaining six amounts then being depleted uranium that is without any 235 u in it the processes are not as perfect as that and some 235 u does not get captured from the depleted uranium so more than a 71 ration of ore to fuel is involved because of this necessary enrichment the 22000 metric tons of raw uranium oxide ore results in around 3000 metric tons of fuel grade material and 19000 metric tons of depleted uranium this 3000 metric tons of actual fuel is the source for the 2000 metric tons that go into us nuclear reactors

btupound subbituminous can have 8300 to 10500 btupound lignite can have 6300 btupound therefore this chart converts the quantities consumed into a more consistent quantity based on the heat content of crude oil which is generally pretty close to 19000 btupound therefore to convert the values in this chart to actual tonnes metric tons of coal you should multiply by about 15 for bituminous 1900013000

fuels only ie bituminous coal and anthracite hard coal and lignite and brown subbituminous coal note that very few countries either export or import significant quantities of coal that may change in the future as oil natural gas and nuclear energy supplies dwindle there is a way of confirming some of the things described in this presentation it is fairly commonly accepted that a welloperating coalpowered electric generation plant should use around 039 million metric tons tonnes of coal in producing 10 9 kwh of electricity this is around 043 million tons american or 086 billion pounds of coal that means that 086 pound of coal is consumed to produce 1 kilowatthour of electricity the energy content in coal is quite variable but it is reasonable to expect that the better quality coal used in power plants has around 13000 btu of energy in it that means that 086 pound of coal has around 11200 btu of energy in it a kilowatthour of electricity is equal to 3412 btu that means that the power plants have an overall efficiency of 341211200 or 305 with the rest going into heat that contributes toward global warming this is in the same ballpark efficiency as the other sources of

review of world energy 2005 bp note this chart only tabulates commercially traded fuels thus excluding fuels such as wood peat and animal waste conclusion the united states seems to be in a very dangerous situation we seem to lately take glee in antagonizing even ally countries so it might even be possible that we may have to totally rely on energy resources that we have in the united states and from the official figures collected above we can see that the supplies are dangerously lowyes these comments seem to resemble a the sky is falling the sky is falling theme malthus said that 200 years ago and then people in the 1930s and then in the 1970s but they were not yet consuming energy at the astounding rates we do today there are certainly people in this field such as colin mac donald who see absolutely no reason for any concern they trust in the accomplishments of new technologies to discover even more of these various resources so they do not have the slightest concerns about future supplies maybe they are right but the consequences of if they are wrong are mindboggling and terrifying especially for the united states it seems to me that any of many things could trigger true nightmares for the usa we currently import around 63 of all the oil we consume in the us mostly from the mideast and mostly from saudi arabia the worlds largest producer as seen in the numbers above we see that chinas economy is growing amazingly rapidly which means that the are needing more and more energy to drive their industrial economy doesnt it seem possible that china could some day even tomorrow approach saudi arabia and offer to buy all the oil they have for five times the current market price 300 per barrel what would saudi arabia do what else but to sell all their oil to china unless the us is suddenly willing to pay so much for oil that the entire rest of the american economy would disintegrate china could also approach iran and venezuela and other countries to buy all their oil too try to think of any solution to the american situation then except to try to invade yet more countries equally as dire is if the many millions of wahhabi muslims in saudi arabia would decide to kill off the saudi royal family and take over that country the wahhabis would not sell a gallon of oil to the us so that is another day that would be totally disastrous for the usa neither of these situations has the slightest hint of any solution in either case our oil supply would be instantly reduced by around half and there would be nothing we could do about it imagine the productivity of american industry and business with only have the oil available and the new cost of it skyrocketing there are many terrifying possibilities yes it would be nice to be able to accept the comfortable views of people who see no problems ahead but doesnt it make sense to at least do a little preparing for such bad possibilities what can be done well for things that you can do
