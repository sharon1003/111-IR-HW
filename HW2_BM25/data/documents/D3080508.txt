answer views firstly not all honey is created equally unfiltered and unpasteurized unheated honey is predominantly glucose and fructose sugars along with a number of enzymes that the bees use to convert the sucrose sugar they get in the nectars they collect into glucose and fructose proteins from pollens proteins from nectars and a variety of other small amounts of vitamins and minerals that are found in the original nectar and added by the processing of the bees honey that has been processed filtered heated or adulterated with high fructose corn syrup hfcs is essentially nothing more than a sugar syrup sold with a honey label lots of honey imported into there usa for instance is cut with hfcs has been found to contain pesticides from the offshore region of origin has been heated mostly to increase bottling efficiency by making the honey run through pipes faster until the temperature labile content has been degraded and has lost any additional nutritive benefit that pure unfiltered unpasteurized honey is known for it also doesnt taste near as good as raw honey as such what i am calling pure honey unfilteredetc is more than simply sugar it is a different sugar than what you have in your kitchen cabinet which is 99 sucrose with the other 1 mostly dust and debris from processing the sugar in the factoryand perhaps a little glucose and has a bit more nutritive value than eating plain or table sugar honey is certainly not any kind of magical nutrient as it is often portrayed on internet sites promoting certain diets or in books that claim honey can cure just about anything mostly because it it natural it is however sugar with benefits if you are not diabetic you can eat about as much honey as you think youd like your body will take up and metabolize the sugar quite readily and then use it for energy most people stop thinking honey is really tasty by the time they get to a couple tablespoons or so during the day if you continue to eat lots more than this and just like any easily digested sugar you can desensitize your bodys reaction to the sugars and begin to develop prediabetic symptoms or syndromes if you like to sweeten your drinks with honey put honey on your morning toast or just dip into the honey jar for a treat now and then honey is no worse for you and could be considered a little better for you than consuming processed sugar cane or beet sugar both of these are 99 sucrose like all food products whether they be for nutrition or for treats moderation in consumption is the key61k views · view upvoters · answer requested by quora

comparing industrially refined sugar to natural nontreated honey which can be unfair im taking that you dont want to base your diet on honey as many answers seem to think just that you want to substitute refined sugar for honey ill base my answer on that assumption i cant agree with the other answers that honey is just sugar yes honey is mainly composed of two types of sugar but it also contains proteins minerals and vitamins not in huge amounts that you can use to justify making it the main part of your diet but enough to differentiate it from white refined sugar it is a more complete ingredient and it tastes better if you use honey to sweeten your morning beverage of choice to put on cereal instead of sugar to eat with some white cheese or yogurt instead of high sugar jam it is bound to be better for you than using huge amounts of refined sugar i wouldnt recommend having more than a few tablespoons of it every day since it is mainly sugar and will not be good for your blood sugar levels but honey has lots less adverse effects than sugar on the contrary it will help keep your throat hydrated helping with coughs honey also has healingscarring properties and can be a mild antimicrobial agent but non of these is officially proven so there might be debate be aware that such as with any other food your body react in unique ways dont over do it or you might get undesired reactions try to find honey that is pure natural and not tempered with as some companies do add more sugar and other things to honey to prevent it from crystallizing or to make it cheaper crystallization is actually a sign of the honeys purity so you shouldnt be concerned if it does and should just put it in a water bath at around 40°c until it goes back to liquid honey also doesnt spoil ever so you can keep it indefinitely so to sum up id say use it no more than you would normal sugar replace normal sugar with it as it does have other nutrients and properties but be careful not to overdo honey doesnt dissolve as well in water and you might need to stir more for it to sweeten juice or coffee so dont try to solve this by adding more honey but all in all if youre not going to base your diet mainly on honey and will eat it only in place of sugar and high sugar jams together with other items such as bread cheese fruit cereal then go for it i cant give you the exact amount you should eat but try to keep track of your blood sugar levels so you know youre not doing more bad than good hope it helps21k views · view upvoters · answer requested by quora user your response is

ok its not 100 pure sugar and there are likely a small amount of nutrients in it if you really like honey theres no harm in using it instead of where you would use sugar but there arent going to be any health benefits from it also even if something has some potential unknown benefits consuming as much of it as possible is likely to be a bad thing you should aim to eat many different types of

answer views how much honey can i ingest every day it depends and depends a lot  on your weight metabolism genetics lifestyle other components of your diet it depends on the honey too i used to consume a pound of raw intensely dark buckwheat honey a day but could barely eat a teaspoonful of lighter varieties ive eaten that much honey daily for several years  but that was combined with mostly vegetarian diet 2030 km on a bicycle daily frequent fasting meditation and of course coffee  side effects still alive and kicking if that can be considered a side effect havent been to a gp in decades other than for checkups knock on wood wouldnt recommend trying it a pound of good honey daily from day one perhaps easing into it with full understanding of potential complications and with a well developed ability to discern what your body is telling or whispering to you there are people who eat more honey than i used to daily without side effects and who are very healthy not sugar though sugar is different no matter what they tell you dry wine is 85 water  but that doesnt necessitate alcoholism to quench ones thirstwhy is it better than sugar because it is sweeter than sugar by weight in other words you need less honey that sugar to get the same sweetness it also has a more advantageous composition of complex sugars than refined sugar  making it less likely to produce undesired side effects that alone can be a huge difference  and i didnt even start on the real goodies  the plant stuff from the nectar and the enzymes that bees add to it for more info alex gerulaitis answer

two of honey in the morning with fruit or yogurt or cereal another tablespoon should be consumed at bedtime in between another one or two tablespoons can be ingested with fruit snacks in baked goods or as used in cooking honey contains about 60 calories per tablespoon generally the percentage of ones total caloric requiremnets provided from simple sugars should not exceed 10 thus the 180 to 300

but there are already many good answers on here honey is an additive and you cantshouldnt scoop it into a bowl and eat it like cereal raw unfiltered honey does more for your system than straight up white sugar but it is still sugar  if you eat a lot of it at once you can get sugar highs and its really not great to do that to your blood sugar often if i add more than a tablespoon of honey to a full mug of tea i find it almost unbearably sweet and usually use less than that anyway you could probably make it your full carb count of the day if you wanted to but i still wouldnt suggest consuming more than a tablespoon or two as a snack  it is higher calorie than table sugar  60 calories per tablespoon vs 45 in sugar533 views · answer requested by quora user aran scutcher food nerd answered mar 10 2016 · author has 176 answers and 1973k answer views no doubt honey is healthier than highly refined products like white sugar however it remains a potent energy source that is still processed and will still contribute to problems such as obesity diabetes and tooth decay if over consumed honey has a lower gi than sugar rougly 15 less on average though this varies a lothoney being less refined has a lot less calories per weight aprox 20 but is also denser than sugar which balances this out if your measuring by volume who recommends no more than 25 grams of sugar per day which is equivalent to about 31 g of honey however given sugar is added into such a wide range of products you would never be able to eat that much honey healthily per day just one can of normal soda has already put you over the limit so the reality is if you switch to honey from sugar this is good but you still need to keep the quantity limited and bear in mind all the hidden sugar in other products you consume also you dont need sugar or therefore honey as part of a balanced diet so dont let it replace more important nurishment from vegetables proteins and some carbs hope this helps941 views ·

be certain benefits from it  not only nutrients but other compounds from the bees that we dont know a lot about and maybe some benefits in terms of allergies from the plants that the pollen was gathered from but on the other hand these beneficial elements are carried in a base of sugar i really dont think the sugar in honey is particularly healthier than any other refined sugar it has been refined by the bees thats all so i would not personally have more honey each day than i would have of table sugar  for me that is almost none or just as an occasional treat at a party i dont think the benefits of it outweigh the harm of eating large amounts of sugar i would use it very sparingly if i want something sweet i generally eat a piece of fruit but honey advocates would probably
