first step of photosynthesis light energy is changed to chemical energy what wavelengths of visible light might be used to power photosynthetic reactions in a plant whose sole pigment is reddish yellow green blue violet a particular pigment may be considered responsible for a specific plant process if its absorption spectrum matches the action spectrum of the processmatrix is to mitochondria as  is to chloroplasts stroma the electrons lost by chlorophyll a of photosystem ii when it absorbs light are replaced by electrons from water chlorophyll a and its associated molecules and are packaged in unites called  which are located in the  photosystems thylakoid membrane the concentration gradient required for photosynthetic phosphorylation is generated as  are from the  protons stroma to the thylakoid space the carbon fixing reactions of the calvin cycle begin when a carbon dioxide molecule is joined to a molecule of ribulose bi phosphate c4 plants are so named because during carbon fixation the carbon dioxide molecule is attached to  forming a four carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate pepin c3 plants when oxygen levels are high and carbon dioxide levels are low  occurs but this process produces no  photorespiration atp  nadphin photorespiration oxygen combines with ru bp to produce  which is subsequently oxidized glycolic acid c4 plants differ in several ways from c3 plants which statement does not represent such a difference they have a higher rate of photorespiration arrow 1 could represent water arrow 3 could represent adparrow 4 could represent nadpharrow 7 represents carbon dioxide the changes in p h over 36 hour period could indicate that acid products were being produced at night and degraded during the day the graph could be illustrating which of the following processes camthe calvin cycle of photosynthesis require all of the following except glucose all of the following fates for sugar produced during photosynthesis are possible in a plant cell except its polymerization into glycogen for storage purposes in the chloroplasts it has been found that light independent reactions actually occur in the stroma which of the following statements correctly describes photosynthesis in green plants none of the above the end products of the light reactions of photosynthesis are oxygen atp and nadphin which of the following structures or areas would the light reactions of photosynthesis occur thylakoid disc all of the following statements about the light reactions of photosynthesis are true except carbon dioxide fixation occurs iethe light reactions of photosynthesis supply the calvin cycle with atp and nadphwhich sequence correctly portrays the flow of electrons during photosynthesis water nadph calvin cycle which of the following conclusions does not follow from studying the absorption spectrum for chlorophyll a and the action spectrum for photosynthesis chlorophyll owes its color to the absorption of green light cooperation of the two photosystems of the chloroplast is required for reductions of nadpin mechanism photophosphorylation is most similar to oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration in what respect are the photosynthetic adaptations of c4 and cam plants similar in both cases an enzyme other than rubisco carries out the first step in carbon fixation light driven electron transport in the chloroplast pumps h where into the stroma the stage of photosynthesis that actually produces sugar is the calvin cycle for every carbon dioxide molecule fixed by photosynthesis how many molecules of oxygen are released 1which of the following statements is a correct distinction between autotrophs and heterotrophs autotrophs but not heterotrophs can nourish themselves beginning with nutrients that are entirely inorganic all of the following statements are related to the light reaction of photosynthesis all of these are true except some of the energy of the excited electrons is used to split carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen an activity performed by plants but not by animals fixation of carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis the oxygen released comes from water only which is not a byproduct of the light reaction of photosynthesis pgalbelow are four statements which statements are true for both aerobic respiration and photosynthesis 1 3 4all of the following statements are correct regarding the light reaction in photosynthesis except carbon dioxide is used to make glucose when electrons are passed along the electron transport chain during photosystem i this results in the production of nadphone of the outcomes of noncyclic photophosphorylation that does not occur in cyclic photophosphorylation is nadph is produced which of the following requires sunlight adp and water photosystem iithe primary difference between the c3 and c4 pathway is that c4 plants have higher rate of photosynthesis than c3 plants releases energy d calvin  benson cycle stores energy obtained from light into nadph b noncyclic photophosphorylation a metabolic pathway that involves movement of substances between two kinds of cells e c4 photosynthesis occurs in the stroma of a chloroplast d calvin  benson cycle the ultimate source of electrons used in making a molecule of glucose c photolysis describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose h₂o broken down into h⁺ c⁻ and o₂ through photolysis h is used for creating atp from adp by adding a phosphate the o₂ is released through the stomata for use in cellular respiration describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 2 for light reactions photons from light strike the pigments in photosystem ii which then charges the electrons in pigment p680 describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 3 the electrons travel to the primary acceptor where they follow a chain and hit the cyto chrome complex describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 4 after the electrons are then hit with another burst of photons where they hit the pigment in photosystem i p700 describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 5 they then reach psis primary acceptor and afterwards the nadp reductase where nadp is reduced to nadph describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 6 in the dark reactions calvin cycle co₂ is absorbed through the stomata where it combines with ribulose biphosphate with the aid of rubisco to then form 3phosphoglycerate describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 7 then with the use of atp this becomes 1 3biphosphoglycerate describe the biochemical pathways of the light and dark reactions in c3 photosynthesis begin with a molecule of glucose 8 nadph is then used to turn this compound into g3p a precursor to glucose and other compounds extra c4 and cam plants improve upon c3 photosynthesis include advantages and disadvantages of each note you may want to include leaf anatomy in your discussion c4 plants combine co₂ with phosphoenolpyruvate to form a 4carbon sugar also they can fix co₂ at lower co₂ concentrations extra c4 and cam plants improve upon c3 photosynthesis include advantages and disadvantages of each note you may want to include leaf anatomy in your discussion 2 cam plants use crassulacean acid metabolism where co₂ is released at night allowing for less time with the stomata open however they do not produce o₂ the main purpose is to avoid phosphorylation
