science  mathematics biology biology question difference between anabolism and catabolism could you please tell me in easy words thanks in advancefollow 7 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer catabolism is when your body breaks things down eg complex foods into their smallest units amino acids simple sugars etc eg eating and inhaling anabolism is when your body takes the smallest units and uses them to build more complex molecules eg building muscle · 9 years ago3 0 comment askers rating what does anabolism mean source shttpsshrinkeima71hcretha · 1 year ago0 0 comment good question it is often not very clear what the difference between these topics are cellular biology is the biology of cells it looks at all the things that make cells tick specifically what signaling molecules and growth factors they need to survive or that make them do certain things the topic would also look at what substances different cell types make and what the function of the cells are biochemistry is the study of the chemical reactions that occur in a biological organism there are many thousands of chemical reactions that occur in every one of you cells all the time every reaction that is catalysed by an enzyme for instance would be the sorts of things that biochemists look at for example working out all those reactions in crebs cycle that you use to convert glucose into atp molecular biology is the study of the genes inside a cell cell biology tends to be about the proteins in a cell whereas molecular biology is about the genes that are expressed you would look at how different genes are regulated and which are switched on in what circumstances genetics is about how the genome affects the individual ie how the set of genes you have affects your phenotype i have a friend who is a geneticist and she is studying how different genes give rise to beta thalassaemia a type of blood disorder i hope this helps a bit regina · 2 years ago0 0 comment catabolism is the process of breaking down large molecules into smaller units while anabolism is the opposite since it takes the small molecules and builds it into more complex molecules robo · 9 years ago0 0

tends to be the structure and function of proteins and the methods for studying these such as x ray crystallography nmr etc molecular biology is similar to biochemistry in that it deals with the structure and function proteins but less on how to study them but it also deals with genes much more strongly molecular biology and biochemistry can both deal with how genes are expressed in cells but molecular biology takes genes further by considering genetic approaches to things  eg genetic engineering and how to study genes genetics would cover most of the same genetic parts of molecular biology but also includes a nonmolecular part  eg population genetics evolutionary genetics etc cellular biology is just the biology of a cell this takes aspects of biochemistry molecular biology and genetics and applies it to the cell instead of focussing on individual genes and proteins it would deal with how a combination of them results in a particular outcome for the cell for example cell signalling would be discussed which is a biochemical process the cell cycle protein targetting and cell structure are other examples of cell biology topics the different compartments of cells would also be discussed in cellular biology eg the nucleus endoplasmic reticulum golgi etc it really depends on where youre studying it though different places will have different approaches to each subject

simpler ones anabolism together with catabolism are the two series of chemical processes in cells that are together called metabolism anabolic reactions are divergent processes that is relatively few types of raw materials are used to synthesize a wide variety of end products this results in an increase in cellular size or complexity—or both anabolic processes produce peptides proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids these molecules comprise all the materials of living cells such as membranes and chromosomes as well as the specialized products of specific types of cells such as enzymes antibodies hormones and neurotransmitters catabolism the opposite of anabolism produces smaller molecules used by the cell to synthesize larger molecules as will be described below thus in contrast to the divergent reactions of anabolism catabolism is a convergent process in which many different types of molecules are broken down into relatively few types of end products the energy required for anabolism is supplied by the energyrich molecule adenosine triphosphate atp this energy exists in the form of the highenergy chemical bond between the second and third molecule of phosphate on atp atps energy is released when this bond is broken turning atp into adenosine diphosphate adp during anabolic reactions the highenergy phosphate bond of atp is transferred to a substrate a molecule worked on by an enzyme in order to energize it in preparation for the molecules subsequent use as a raw material for the synthesis of a larger molecule in addition to atp some anabolic processes also require highenergy hydrogen atoms that are supplied by the molecule nadph although anabolism and catabolism occur simultaneously in the cell the rates of their chemical reactions are controlled independently of each other for example there are two enzymatic pathways for glucose metabolism the anabolic pathway synthesizes glucose while catabolism breaks down glucose the two pathways share 9 of the 11 enzymatic steps of glucose metabolism which can occur in either sequence ie in the direction of anabolism or catabolism however two steps of glucose anabolism use an entirely different set of enzymecatalyzed reactions there are two important reasons that the cell must have separate complementary anabolic and catabolic pathways first catabolism is a socalled downhill process during which energy is released while anabolism requires the input of energy and is therefore an energetically uphill process at certain points in the anabolic pathway the cell must put more energy into a reaction than is released during catabolism such anabolic steps require a different series of reaction than are used at this point during catabolism second the different pathways permit the cell to control the anabolic and catabolic pathways of specific molecules independently of each other this is important because there are times when the cell must slow or halt a particular catabolic or anabolic pathway in order to reduce breakdown or synthesis of a particular molecule if both anabolism and catabolism used the same pathway the cell would not be able control the rate of either process independent of the other slowing the rate of catabolism would slow the rate of anabolism opposite anabolic and catabolic pathways can occur in different parts of the same cell for example in the liver the breakdown of fatty acids to the molecule acetylco a takes place inside mitochondria mitochondria are the tiny membranebound organelles that function as the cells major site of atp production the buildup of fatty acids from acetylco a occurs in the cytosol of the cell that is in the aqueous area of the cell that contains various solutes although anabolic and catabolic pathways are controlled independently both metabolic routes share an important common sequence of reactions that is known collectively as the citric acid cycle or krebs cycle the krebs cycle is part of a larger series of enzymatic reactions collectively called oxidative phosphorylation this pathway is an important means of breaking down glucose to produce energy which is stored in the form of atp but the molecules produced by the krebs cycle can also be used as precursor molecules or raw materials for anabolic reactions that make proteins fats and carbohydrates despite the independence of anabolism and catabolism the various steps of these processes are in some ways so intimately linked that they form what might be considered an enzymatic ecological system in this system a change in one part of a metabolic series of reactions can have a ripple effect throughout the linked anabolic and catabolic pathways this ripple effect is the cells way of counterbalancing an
