answered some of msnbc’s questions about grand juries and how they work catch seema iyer esq online tackling legal questions every tuesday at 11 am et on msnbccom  what’s the difference between a grand jury and a regular jury a grand jury 12 to 23 people is a body that investigates criminal conduct federal state and county prosecutors utilize grand juries to decide whether probable cause exists to support criminal charges a regular jury 6 to 12 people – aka a petit jury – hears only trial cases a regular jury decides the facts the judge presiding over the trial decides the law a petit jury decides in criminal cases – whether the prosecution has proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt in civil cases – by a preponderance of evidence  which means 51  in criminal cases the decision must be unanimous how is the grand jury chosen and how does the grand jury process function grand jurors are chosen from the same group of people as trial jurors when you receive notice for jury service you could be called for either one the judge will ask very few questions unlike when selecting a petit jury when the judge and lawyers ask many questions grand jurors will only be excused “for cause” meaning they cannot be fair and impartial of course jurors in general are often excused for logistical reasons scheduling etc grand jurors are expected to serve anywhere from a month to a year on average in most cases it’s a few months and they sit a few days a week grand juries hear cases from prosecutors all day long and all different types of criminal cases usually the cases are felonies the grand jury physically sits in a college lecture type of room in the same building as the prosecutor’s office there is no judge present just court officers and grand jury clerks prosecutors will come in present evidence in the form of witnesses documents photos and videoaudio this is done often over the course of a day a week or longer in most cases the accused has an opportunity – not required by law unlike a jury trial – to testify but is only questioned by the prosecutor the defense attorney cannot question but the grand jurors can submit questions to the prosecutor to ask witnesses at the close of evidence the prosecutor reads legal instructions and the law to jurors the grand jury may then vote an indictment also known as “true bill” to vote an indictment you only need a quorum for example in the ferguson case quorum would have been nine out of 12 grand jurors most grand juries are 12 to 23 people in the cases of ferguson and staten island why did these cases go to a grand jury instead of the prosecutor charging the officers themselves when and why does a case go to a grand jury when a felony is committed here is what can happen1 without an arrest when you do not physically have the perpetrator or know who he or she is evidence can be presented to a grand jury the indictment is called a “no arrest indictment” which forms the basis of an arrest warrant so when the suspect is found and arrested he or she has already been indicted2 after a person is arrested the case is immediately – within a week unless time is waived – presented to a grand jury3 after a person is arrested he or she is not held in jail because the district attorney is investigating and unsure whether the case will be presented to a grand jury or reduced to a misdemeanor and a plea offer may be made thereby waiving a grand jury or the case will be dismissed4 there is no arrest you know who the perpetrator is and the case is presented to a grand jury an arrest only occurs if a grand jury indicts in the cases of ferguson and staten island both went to a grand jury because that is standard practice when a case involves a police officer it’s not the law just the practice what is commonly said is that “no one would ever be a police officer if it was otherwise” i believe these cases went to a grand jury because the accused was a police officer had qualified immunity and the incident occurred while the police officer was on duty what are the requirements for a grand jury to decide to indict someone the only requirement is that probable cause exists to support criminal charges against the accused person in essence the grand juror must feel there is enough evidence against the person to proceed to trial it is a very low standard you could have one witness a victim come in and testify without any corroborating physical evidence and get an indictment that is rare but it does occur in some cases of sexual assault with victims who don’t approach authorities until many years after an incident new york judge sol wachtler once famously said that a grand jury would “indict a ham sandwich” if it’s that common for a grand jury to indict why is it rare that police officers are charged with regard to police officers they have “qualified immunity” a police officer is allowed to use deadly force in many more circumstances than a lay person something the grand jury is instructed on a police officer is allowed to use a gun the incident occurred while they were engaged in official dutiesand because a police officer is trained in ”law” he or she can respond to criminal accusations far better than a lay person police officers will also have a team of lawyers coaching them because they are represented by union attorneys who are often former prosecutors since a police department is an agency of the prosecutor’s office there is an inherent conflict of interest imagine trying to indict your boss colleague or sibling in light of the outcry after the ferguson and staten island grand jury decisions is there any chance the law around grand juries would ever be changed or updated i hate to use this line but i think it would take “an act of congress” – perhaps state congressional action i think there is a possibility for reform around a new law that would state “if a police officer is accused of a crime a special prosecutor must be appointed to oversee the investigation”as a whole there really isn’t anything wrong with the grand jury system if you are asking whether the system would change in that there would be a standard arrest even if allegations involved a police officer i think not like i said no one would ever become a police officer if they were in fear of being arrested any time they discharged their weapon explore criminal justice eric
