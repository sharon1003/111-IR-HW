into a glorious showstopper and this pork masterpiece is perhaps the best example we can think of even the sight of it is delightful as it glazes over with a sheen in shades of rose and amber the garlicky adobo—thats the marinade not the commercial powder—is pushed into slits in the meat to penetrate to the deepest layers the outer layer rubbed on the roast forms a sticky crust of irresistible caramelization and the skin becomes a rich crunchy chicharrón the last pieces of which everyone will surely fight over share “garlicroasted pork shoulder ” on facebook share “garlicroasted pork

of 10 and followed the recipe to the letter because it was a larger roast that the recipe called for it may have been ok to roast a little longer if i wanted the meat to pull apart with a fork but i actually liked the meat holding together and serving slices and chunks everyone loved itwestsidecook from water mill ny  flag if inappropriate this is a terrific recipe the house smells like heaven  my guests raved about it simple to do make sure your follow the time for setting out the meat  letting it sit after cookingjaneco  flag if inappropriate logged into this site just to leave a review my review is strictly based on the method of cooking not necessarily the recipe although it sounds delicious due to the fact that i didnt have time to marinate etc i had a 6 lb bone in pork shoulder roast and i seasoned with powdered garlic powdered onion crushed bay leaves oregano and lots of salt and pepper i seared all four sides for at least 2 minutes the fat portion at the top i accidentally overdid and it was blackburnt but it turned out to be probably the best part of the cut once the roast was done so dont be deterred if you make that mistake followed roasting method but took mine out at about 175 degrees maybe 45 hours total at 325 degrees using this recipe the end result was absolutely insane on the delicious chart both in flavor and tenderness juicy and delicious absolutely zero toughness or grit to it even my husband who has a pork sensitivity threw it to the wind and almost ate half of the roast paid for it the next day i will be using this again and again and again the roast only cost us 11 and we ate it for 2 days  2 dinners and 2 lunches for two very hearty adultsgigiperr from irvine ca  flag if inappropriate definitely cut down the salt maybe by half i didnt even use the last teaspoon which would have been rubbed on top and the sauce while delicious was too salty its more noticeable on the second day when we were eating the leftovers also i wasnt thrilled with the oregano alone would either switch to thyme or use a mixture  may try herbes de provence that being said the prep was easy and once its in the oven its practically worryfree i didnt use a cut with the skin as were not crazy about the skin next time ill baste the roast a bit during the uncovered stage added a cup of water at a time not 12 and it was needed am also thinking of trying balsamic vinegar instead of white i was concerned that the garlic would be overwhelming but it wasnt oh and after i uncovered the roast i turned the oven down to 325 and let it go about 3 hours the meat just fell apart a perfect 10 on the forktender scale served with limepickled red onions which helped cut the richness buttered brussels sprouts and butternut squash roasted with ghee and just lightly sweetened with brown sugar to caramelize it mashed potatoes would be a good side as wellstringcat3 from phoenix az  flag if inappropriate a perfect recipe my guests had 3 servings i had never made a pork shoulder before i followed directions and the results were perfection crisp skin and tender meatgerrysherid from brooklyn ny  flag if inappropriate for these type of meat with lots of skinfat you

check stock looking forward to trying this recipe but im hoping to end up with more crakling than this picturewsckky from los altos ca  flag if inappropriate thank you for this recipe the most amazing favorable pork iv ever made i had a 10  piece and was only able to marinate for 6 hours cooked it at 325 for 3 hrs ea foil parchment and uncovered my garlic head was 13 12 cup pure mashed goodness so i added an extra 1 t ea vinegar and lemon additional to the recipe no additional salt only added 12 cup water twice during the uncovered cooking the drained juices were so rich i had to keep adding stock to cut the richness  i never let the hubby eat the skin this was so crackling i let him cathey56 from long islandny  flag if inappropriate i made a different pork shoulder recipe from this site using a low temperature 300 f oven and cooked a 6 lb roast for 45 hours very tendersucculent but the fennelrosemary rub was overwhelming and it needed salt i want to try this recipe sounds delicious for a pork shoulder which weighs 11 lb with bone if i cook it at 350 how long does it need to be in the oven it is better if made the day before and heated the next dayjedshell  flag if inappropriate the flavour is great the marinade is easy and for the flavor it was worth marinating over night the oven tempis waaaaaaay off 350 is way too high of a temp to slow cook something for 5 hours i ended up with a tough pork chop type situation i should have trusted my gut and put the oven at 250 i will make again but that oven temp is going downglamourousgeek from niagara falls  flag if inappropriate this pork shoulder came out ridiculously delicious ive never roasted a roast like this with the parchment paper and foil it was soooo good and i was amazed by the garlic flavor throughout the meat my husband who is not much of a pork lover enjoyed this very much thankssaraiam from san diego ca  flag if inappropriate couldnt find this roast with skin on anywhere tried whole foods draegers and the belcampo specialty meat market but all butchers said they dont have that cut with skin on any thoughts on how to adapt this recipe to a noskin roastmariaklecze from menlo park ca  flag if inappropriate i am a special fan of pork shoulder so let me clearly state that this is a good recipe for a good cut of meat that requires some careful handling to reach its full flavor potential at the same time i dont feel its really accurate to state 30 minutes active time i understand the contribution of each step in the recipe but while some of the steps only took a few minutes the entire efforts consumed far more time than i preferred there are longstanding cordon bleu recipes which deliver excellent results and far less time consumption still this one is nice however time does matter in many cases and time is a drawback to this recipe i hope this doesnt sound too harsh wabsci from carmel in  flag if inappropriate as a dominican american i have eaten this a million times but had never made it myself a 5 pound roast was the perfect size for us i did discard the skin and overcooked it but it was still delicious dominicans do not serve this with gravy thanks to this simple recipe i will now make it over and over again summer sandals from north florida  flag if inappropriatethis makes me nostalgic i made this like ten or twelve years ago takes me back to a different place and time an old childhood friend is visiting and wanted pork roast so gonna order this from the butcher and roast it using this recipe may tweak it a bit but this is a solid recipe and yes cuban sandwiches for a weeknelumvila from toronto ontario  flag if inappropriate i lived in miami for many years and made this the last time i visited family there i followed the recipe except for doubling the rub it turned out so well that a born and bred miamian said it was the best pork she had ever had if you know miami at all it is pork heaven with all of the different cuisines that use this versatile protein so double follow rest and reap the rewards great for cuban sandiches the next dayklukie  flag if inappropriate i made this with a smaller piece of meat under 4 pounds but used the whole amount of marinade and put it all in the crock pot for 8 hours just removed the skin pulled the meat off the bone and added any juices directly to the platter of meat it was fantastic will make this again and again a cook from new jersey  flag if inappropriate i did not have the exact same cut mine was a shoulder blade part of the shoulder i followed the recipe exactly adding extra time in the oven as i had more meat than the recipe called for i made very deep pockets under the skin so in the end it pulled itself off and rolled up a bit making it look very fancy and interesting i used pork from caw caw creek farm which produces amazing meat it is great any way you fix it but it came out perfectly flavored very easy recipe deliciousnikolinan from evans ga  flag if inappropriate good and very tender but i did not think it was anything special i could not even taste the garlic at all which was a big disappointment to this garlic lovin gal the oregano was overwhelming  way too much i will stick to my tried and true method and season the meat on all sides as well as under the fat note crock pot low for 6 hrs for about 45 lbs and was well done this will not crisp skin though handful from ada oh  flag if inappropriate tonight i made this for the second time first time i followed recipe exactly this time i used my rival roaster oven on our deck to avoid the heat in the house all day covered in parchment and foil and set in a 9x13 metal pan perfect results both times this time i finished it in the oven at 425 to crisp the skin better and put the removed skin back in at 475 upside down to cook the fat  superb for clarification the marinade you discard is really any pan drippings that may occur in the fridge ehilliar from norwood ma  flag if inappropriate easy oh so tasty recipe we make this regularly whenever my local market has this cut on special superb inexpensive meal i use a garlic press  easier to get the garlic to a pasty consistency i also cut the salt in half otherwise i found the pan juices far too salty to use with the meat and that was a shame love crisping the skin separately as suggested  yuma cook from larchmont ny  flag if inappropriate this was terrific i made it exactly the way the recipe called for except i did cut the fat layer into a flap per another reviewer it did shrink a bit but made it much easier to apply the marinade and poke holes in the meat i marinated it for 24 hours there was a small amount of liquid in the pan afterword which i tossed out i did not end up adding a lot of water only a half cup as there was so much fat that i used it for basting i had decided early on that i wasnt going to make gravy the meat was flavorful tender and delicious the fat was like candy crisp addicting i will definitely be working with this cut of meat more regularlylucy4676 from vermont  flag if inappropriate absolutely loved this easy and amazingly delicious my husband and i cant wait to make this again wjm228 from newton ma  flag if inappropriate the pork was good but the way the recipe was written was so unclear i had to improvise a lot it said to discard the marinade but i had no pools of marinate floating around so i didnt discard anything it said to add water as needed but in all i didnt need to add more than 34 cup to the pan the whole howtodealwith the juices part was written so crazily i didnt really know what they intended in the end i scraped the pan with some water over a burner but briefly then i poured it all into a pot and simmered there rather than in the roasting dish the way i did it worked out just fine i let the juices cool and scooped the fat off the top to save and use later for frying veggies nom nom based on user feedback i used far less salt than the recipe called for but i think if i had used it all it would have been really fine ill definitely make this again but next time ill add some thyme or another herb to the rub and ill use all the salt the recipe calls for i might also add some extra pepper or something red to give it a little tiny extra kick un quotidian from brooklyn ny  flag if inappropriate so i forgot to start early and had to do the hurryup version of this recipe after applying marinade i tented as instructed and put the roast right into the oven at 400 for 25 hours removed the tent turned oven to 350 for another hour husband raved i dont eat meat so cant confirm but all the garlic did make the house smell good we discarded the skin a cook from livermore ca  flag if inappropriate this is one of my favorites of all time after i made it the first time i craved it constantly it can however be hard to find this cut of meat it turns up once in a while at my local grocery store  never when i need it the one place you can always find it is at a mexican markethollybode from batavia il  flag if inappropriate
