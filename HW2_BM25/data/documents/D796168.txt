dividing by zero dont divide by zeroor this could happenjust kidding in truth dividing by zero is undefined dividing to see why let us look at what is meant by division division is splitting into equal parts or groups it is the result of fair sharing example there are 12 chocolates and 3 friends want to share them how do they divide the chocolates12 chocolates 12 chocolates divided by 3so they get 4 each 123  4dividing by zero now let us try dividing the 12 chocolates among zero people how much does each person get does that question even make sense no of course it doesnt we cant share among zero people and we cant divide by 0 another good reason after dividing can we multiply to get back again but multiplying by 0 gives 0 so that wont work once again dividing by zero gives us difficultiesimagine we could divide by zero okay let us imagine we can divide by zero and see what happens that means that things like 1 0 and 0 0 would behave like normal numbers try multiplying by zero so let us try using our new numbers for example we know that zero times any number is zero example 0×1  0 0×2  0 etc so that should also be true for 1 00 ×  1  0  0but we could also rearrange it a little like this0 ×  1 0   0 0 × 1  1 careful i am not saying this is correct we are assuming that we can divide by zero so 00 should work the same as 55 which is 1 arrggh if we multiply 1 0 by zero we could get 0 or 1 in fact we cant have both possibilites so we cannot define 1 0 to be a number so it is undefined so what is 00 00 is like asking how many 0s in 0 are there no zeros in zero at all or perhaps there is exactly one zero in zero or many zeros so 00 is indeterminate it could be any value in conclusion when we try to divide by zero things stop making sense that is all but wait  there is a special method where we get closer and closer to zero  just read limits an introductionto find out more division numbers index
