science  mathematics physics does the density of a wire affect its resistance i have responses saying both yes and no but i cant see how it wouldnt have any effect surely if there are more atoms in a certain amount of space the probability that an electron is going to knock into one of them is higher also how does atomic structure affect resistance update arent all meta atomic structures basically the same how come copper has a very low resistance while nichrome has high one follow 4 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer arent all meta atomic structures basically the same how come copper has a very low resistance while nichrome has high one  nichrome is a hybrid material with density 8400kgm3 while pure nickel has 8908 kgm3 due to the addition of chromium the pure nickel has a higher conductivity than the alloy resistance is due to collisions between electrons and ions during the flow of electricity a more accurate description is that the band structure of the material rather than the atomic structure of the atoms would affect the resistance in a metal electrons are in a sea of electrons called a conductivity band which helps the flow between a large chain of mater nonmetals with some exceptions are connected only by their valence bands and have virtually no conductivity band under standard conditions now perhaps instead of thinking of density we should invesigate the difference in electronic properties between an elemental conductor and an alloy the resultant resistance will be due to the combination of both chromium and copper and matthiessens rule applies the total resistivity of a crystalline metallic specimen is the sum of the resistivity due to thermal agitation of the metal ions of the lattice and the resistivity due to imperfections in the crystal now the reason why the alloy is more resistant than nickle is because a higher resistant metal chromium was added to it which makes the electrons less mobile in the alloy now lets try dealing with the pure element at different densities for a fair experiment one way to change the density of a material is through thermal expansionlowering the density and its effect on conductivity but we know joule heating then we find that on an iv curve the resistance becomes nonlinear because when heating the collisions between electrons and ions increase and the resistance will also increase the only other think i could think to do is to increase the pressure on the material but chances are this mechanical energy putting into the material will increase the internal energy due to thermodynamics anyway kevin b 路 10 years ago1 1 comment askers ratinganother way to pose this question is to ask if the diameter of a water hose has any affect on how much water can flow through itif lightening strikes a metal thread and it can only pass through the thread to go to ground then it will destroy the wire on its wayif the wire cannot dissapate the heat produced by the electron flow it will eventually heat up to the point of being destroyedchristo499 路 10 years ago0 0 comment no r resistance rhola where rho  resistivity how hard it is to get current to flow in the substanceand although rho is also used for density in physics they are not the same ok llength and a  cross sectional area fred source sphysics profgetfreducated 路 10 years ago0 0 commentno atomic structure decides the flow of electron through that materialso its resistancemanoj 路 10 years ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these want to build a free website hard drive full cloud storage need an electronic signature online education an option
