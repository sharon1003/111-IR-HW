field clout flight ski  novelty rounds forest field archery 3d field clout archery flight archery ski archery novelty archery rounds field archery rounds fita field there are two fita field rounds – marked round and unmarked round each round consists of 12 or 24 targets with 3 arrows shot at each target the field range is usually laid out in a forest with the targets arranged to provide the maximum variety and difficulty of shots as the terrain permits targets can be setup on the sides of hills down hills and up hills making the judgement of the actual distance to the target difficult

distance posts on each target all targets have to be shot in numbered order the coloured posts mark the shooting position for each target and should be marked with the number of arrows to be shot from each post for the marked round they will also have the distance marked on the post the colour of the post indicates which age division and bow type will shoot from that position eg u14 girls  boys will shoot from the blue posts u12 girls  boys will shoot from the white posts and most other divisions will shoot from the red posts for complete details of post assignments refer to the archery australia rule book usually there are two posts side by side so that two archers can shot at the same time with 4 archers at each target there can be targets setup so that the posts are laid out in a fan shape from the target and others may have posts laid out so each shot is closer to the target ‘walkup’ archers shooting in a group are also assigned a number or letter abcd so that the order of shooting at each target is rotated eg ab shot first then cd at the next target cd will shoot first then ab target faces the target faces used in fita field are black with a gold centre they have 5 scoring zones with the centre gold being divided again with an ‘inner gold’ for the compound bow division each scoring zone has a dividing white line for the black area of the target the scoring zones are worth 5 points for gold then 4 3 2 and 1 for the black scoring zones the compound division have to shoot inside the ‘inner gold’ zone to score 5 points the maximum score on each target is therefore 15 points 40cm target faces are arranged in a square of 4 faces on each butt and 20cm target faces are arranged in 4 vertical columns of 12 faces on each butt these target faces have to be shot in the correct order on the 40cm target faces of the first pair of archers the archer on the left will shoot at the top lefthand target and the archer on the right will shoot at the top righthand target the second pair of archers will use the bottom target faces in the same manner on the 20cm target faces of the first pair of archers the archer on the left will shoot at the faces in the lefthand column the archer on the right will shoot at the faces in the 3rd column from the lefthand side one arrow per target face shot in order from top to bottom of the 2nd pair of archers the archer on the left will shoot at the faces in the 2nd column from the left and the archer on the right will shoot at the faces in the 4th column from the lefthand side if an archer shoots their arrow into the wrong target face that arrow will not score any points before entering a field archery competition read all the rules because a mistake can be costly you could lose 15 points by a simple mistake of not shooting the posts in the right order so be aware of all directions and markings at each target and post fita forest field fita forest field round is similar to fita field except for

ground at long distance a clout round is 6 ends of arrows 6 x 6 arrow ends  36 arrows total a clout target is 15 metres in diameter it has a triangular clout flag usually gold in colour to mark the centre of the target at every 15 metres each side of the clout flag there are smaller flags used to mark scoring zone divisions yellow flags mark the edge of the 9 zone red flags the 7 zone blue flags the 5 zone black flags the 3 zone and white flags mark the outer edge of the 1 zone a clout cord is attached to the peg holding the clout flag so it can be rotated around the scoring zones the clout cord is marked off with the scoring zones so the value of each arrow lodged in the ground can be judged where the arrow shaft enters the ground is the position taken for the scoring value archers are assigned to pick up arrows inside the scoring zones while others may be assigned to move the clout cord around scoring and verifying scores each archer will be called to collect their arrows calling out their scoring value as they move outwards from the centre of the target the distances shot for clout are distance in metres180 165 145 125 100men’s u18 boys compound women’s u18 girls u16 boys

a full list of bow divisions for each distance refer to archery australia rule book special clout sights are allowed to be fitted to the bows the most common used are ‘mirror sights’ that act much like a periscope this type of sight allows the archer to aim directly at the clout flag while still holding the bow at an elevated angle so the arrow will travel the required distance spotting scopes are necessary to check where the arrow landed so sight adjustments can be made it is generally difficult to spot whether the arrows are in front or behind the centre of the target you can only be sure after walking up to the target to score because of the long distances shot wind can have a great effect on the arrow flight archery flight archery is all about shooting an arrow the longest distance so the range for a flight event will need to be very long a rifle range may be suitable if long enough otherwise the ground beside an airport may be required each archer is allowed to shoot 6 arrows each arrow must be marked with the archers name and be numbered recurve compound and freestyle bows can be used mechanical release aids are not allowed to be used instead a flipper or strap or thumb ring or hook may be used in freestyle division any type of bow may be used such as a foot bow so long as the archer does not receive outside assistance to shoot there are draw weight divisions in each age group men’s  u18 boys – unlimited 40 kg  33 kg and 25 kg women’s  u18 girls – unlimited 25 kg and 18 kg u16 boys  girls – 25 kg and 18 kg the flight shoot will usually be held as early as possible in the morning to avoid windy conditions after all archers have shot then everyone will walk forward to find the arrows each archer will tag their longest shot arrow so that it can be measured usually by a qualified person using electronic surveying equipment laser theodolitefor recurve and compound bows the distances shot may exceed 600 metres for freestyle bows the distances shot may exceed 1000 metres i think the current world record is in excess of 1800 metres  i will have to check what the current record is ski archery ski archery is a combination of nordic freestyle skiing and archery the competition is held over a 12km course for men and a 8km course for women during the course 12 arrows have to be shot at a distance of 18 metres the target has only one scoring zone so only hits count for each miss the athlete has to ski a penalty lap of 300 metres at the finish novelty rounds dartchery as the name implies it is darts played using archery equipment the ‘dartboard’ is a specific target face 122cm in diameter laid out with scoring zones exactly the same as for a dartboard three arrows are shot from a distance of 10 metres normal dart rules and games will be used for competition eg – two pairs of archers will compete on each target one archer from each pair will shoot their 3 arrows to score points after scoring the arrows the second archer from each pair will shoot the usual dart game played is to start with a score of 301 and shoot a score to finish on zero the last scoring arrow must be shot in a double points zone the number of dart games played will usually depend on the time taken to complete individual and team events can be played dartchery faces can be obtained from ‘action graphics’ to order write to  p o box 17 dalveen qld 4374 or email wand archery a wand target consists of a slat of soft wood or other material suitable to lodge arrows into 5cm wide and 2 metres high above the ground a wand shoot is 6 ends of arrows 36 arrows total

10cm above the ground and is placed level with the hole on the right side of the green away from the putting surface archers will shoot in groups of 4  3 to 5 may be allowed each archer will shoot their first arrow from the ‘tee’ position their next arrow will be shot from where the first arrow landed and subsequent arrow from where it lands to complete each hole the tennis ball must be dislodged or hit the par for each hole is the number of arrows shot plus any penalty’s an arrow landing in a bunker or within 1 metre of the tennis ball incurs 1 penalty stroke a lost arrow incurs 2 penalty strokes ‘doglegs’ must be followed on the golf course no archer is allowed to ‘tee off’ until the preceding group is on the next ‘tee’ the archer furthest from the hole will shoot first unless the angle of the shot dictates that it be taken for safety reasons the winner of the previous hole shall shoot first at the next tee no bow sights of any type are allowed on the bow aiming will have to be instinctive or use point of arrow method so practise prior to the event is highly recommended any type of arrow may be used except broadheads and the maximum diameter allowed is 10mm a typical set of arrows used would closely follow what the clubs a golfer would use for example to ‘tee off’ a carbon arrow would be used for maximum distance an aluminium arrow with a field point would be used for shorter fairway shots to get to the green an arrow fitted with a ‘judo point’ would be used to get close to the hole to stop the arrow skipping past and an arrow fitted with a ‘blunt point’ would be used to hit the tennis ball special ‘fluflu’ arrows can also be used for short distance shots these arrows have overlarge feathers wrapped around the shaft and will slow to a stop within a short distance due to wind drag shooting of arrows into the putting surface must be avoided if an arrow does land in the putting surface then it should be carefully withdrawn so as not to lift the turf the winner of the competition is the person with the lowest number of ‘strokes’ in case of ties then the last hole will be played again to decide the winner in past archery golf competitions especially when competing against a team of golfers it has been proven that to even up the scoring that each archer competing in the team event starts with  18 ‘strokes’ caution the maximum range of many bows will exceed the length of many of the holes on the golf course extreme caution must be taken regarding elevation of shots especially from the ‘tee’ archers must be aware of the capability of their bows when elevating shots and take careful regard for the safety of other persons who may be within range if an arrow overshoots arrows may also skip off the turf especially if the shot is at a low angle if unsure of the safety of a shot it is better to use a ‘judo point’ or ‘fluflu’ arrow to ensure it does not skip past further than the back of the green archery cricket unofficial round the rules for this game were first put together by mr steve dartell a past member of the grange company of target archers club an archery game played by two teams each shooting at their own target one team is the ‘batters’ the other team is the ‘bowlers’1 two top shooters to be team captains 2 team captains to select team members 3 ‘bowlers’ team to shoot a distance of 20 metres at an 80cm diameter target face ‘batters’ team to shoot a distance of 20 metres at an 122cm diameter target face 4 wickets are taken by the ‘bowlers’ shooting an arrow into each scoring zone on the target face starting with the 1 zone then 2 zone then 3 zone and so on until an arrow is shot into the 10 zone each zone must be shot consecutively each archer will shoot their 6 arrows to complete an ‘over’ then the next archer will take their turn a ‘runner’ may be used to collect the arrows at the end of each ‘over’ when an arrow hits the 10 zone then the ‘batters’ must stop shooting immediately 5 runs are scored by the ‘batters’ shooting only in the 1 to 6 zone on the target face each archer will shoot their 6 arrows to complete an ‘over’ then the next archer will take their turn a ‘runner’ may be used to collect the arrows at the end of each ‘over’ 6 a ‘batter’ will be dismissed if their arrow  misses the target face  stumped hits the red zone on the target face  lbw leg before wicket hits the gold zone on the target face  caught 7 one ‘bowler’ to watch ‘batters’ target and record fall of wickets 8 one ‘batter’ to watch ‘bowlers’ target to ensure correct order of wickets 9 the two teams will shoot at the same time ‘batting’ will stop immediately at the fall of the last wicket 10 arrows to be collected at the end of each ‘over’ or when a ‘batter’ is dismissed under rule no 6 11 team members are to remain in their allotted order to ensure everyone gets a turn 12 at the fall of the last wicket the ‘batting’ team will add their scores to make up the number of ‘runs’ for the ‘innings’ the teams will then swap targets for the ‘second innings’ the ‘batting’ and ‘bowling’ teams swap over the ‘batting’ team will take their turn as ‘bowlers’ and the ‘bowling’ team will take their turn at ‘batting’ the completion of the ‘second innings’ completes one game of cricket the team with the highest score most ‘runs’ wins archery cricket games can be more than two ‘innings’ long four ‘innings’ is more usual speed and accuracy is a factor for both teams the ‘batting’ team is trying to score ‘runs’ as quickly as possible while the ‘bowling’ team is trying to get wickets just as quick
