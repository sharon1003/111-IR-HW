answer to question 9118 submitted to ask the expertscategory radiation basics — photons the following question was answered by an expert in the appropriate field q as a medical physicist and a pet positron emission tomography user i wonder what happens to a positron when it goes through matter athe positron created by the transformation of a neutron to a proton a positron and a neutrino in the nucleus of a radionuclide that decays by the betaplus mode results in the emission of the positron from the nucleus with some kinetic energy the amount depending on the energy available from the decay process and how that energy is distributed between the positron and the neutrino in the case of the commonly used pet radionuclide 18 f the positron may have a maximum energy of 633 ke v the average positron energy is about 250 ke v the typical positron will expend most of its kinetic energy undergoing collision interactions producing ionization and excitation in atoms of the medium through which it passes when the positron has dissipated all of its kinetic energy it will annihilate with a conventional electron such an event produces two 511 ke v annihilation photons which carry energy away from the interaction site in opposite directions the 511 ke v is the exact energy of each of the annihilation photons if the positron was at rest having energy determined only by the temperature of its environment while it is true that elevations in temperature produce increased kinetic energies of atoms and constituents at the temperatures of typical concern the typical increases are so slight as to be insignificant in terms of any effect on the observed energies of annihilation photons in a lowatomicnumber medium such as soft tissue there will be a small amount of positron energy loss by bremsstrahlung xray production and by the process of inflight annihilation in the latter process the positron annihilates with a conventional electron and whatever excess kinetic energy the positron possessed at the time of annihilation gets transferred to one or both of the two annihilation photons that result when such an event happens it is likely that each of the annihilation photons will be left with different energies as an example if a 400 ke v positron annihilates in flight the 400 ke v of kinetic energy may be split between the resulting annihilation photons if 150 ke v goes to one photon and 250 ke v to the other the respective annihilation photons would have energies of 661 ke v and 761 ke v in addition since the photons must behave so as to conserve the forward momentum of the positron at the time of the annihilation event these photons will typically not be moving in opposite directions as is the case when the positron annihilation occurs after the positron has lost all of its excess kinetic energy it is approximately true that the average fraction of positron kinetic energy that is lost via inflight annihilation is about the same as the fraction of the kinetic energy that is lost by bremsstrahlung when the positron slows to rest considering our 400 ke v positron if we look up the bremsstrahlung radiation yield in water near soft tissue equivalent we find a value of 166 x 10 3  which represents the fraction of the positron energy that is lost on average as bremsstrahlung when the positron loses all its energy as it slows to rest we may use this as an estimate of the average fraction of the 400 ke v positron’s energy that is lost through inflight annihilation this would imply that about one out of every 600 positrons each of 400 ke v would interact via inflight annihilation thus this is not a very important process for many practical situations the annihilation photons produced by inflight annihilation would clearly not be useful in pet scanning since they are not generally emitted in directional opposition to each other and their energies are different such photons would have a small negative effect in increasing unwanted detection events in the radiation detectors thanks for an interesting question i hope this answer is sufficient for your purposes george chabot ph d chpanswer posted on 3 june 2010 the information posted on this web page is intended as general reference information only specific facts and circumstances may affect the applicability of concepts materials and information described herein the information provided is not a substitute for professional advice and should not be relied upon in the absence of such professional advice to the best of our knowledge answers are correct at the time they are posted be advised that over time requirements could change new data could be made available and internet links could change affecting the correctness of the answers answers are the professional opinions of the expert responding to each question they do not necessarily represent the position of the health physics society
