a dogs morning routine starts off a lot like ours a gaping yawn a long lazy streeeeeeetch  instagramleighkiyoko and then coffee and more coff  errr a fullbody shake instagramleighkiyoko so maybe we dont share the exact same morning ritual with our best friends but its tempting to imagine our dogs like to wake up the same way we do like angela adan a californiabased dog trainer who also happens to be into yoga my dog does some downward dog every time he wakes up from a nap adan tells the dodo he does a yawn and a downward dog its just his way of relaxing instagram photo by shiloh â¢ jan 21 2017 at 609pm utcbut of course dogs dont follow in our footsteps they follow those of their ancient predecessors like many of the reasons why dogs do the things they do the origins of the morning stretch  and often shake  can be traced back to a time when every day was a battle to survive instagram photo by aki morris â¢ aug 26 2016 at 128am utcdogs as hunters and fighters in an evolutionary sense never know what will happen when they get up to roam their territory paul rosenberg a veterinary chiropractor at pets in motion animal chiropractic tells the dodo stretching helps prepare for any hunt for food or brawl for territory that comes along instagram photo by charleightheboxer â¢ dec 30 2016 at 207am utcevolution favors the prepared rosenberg adds dont stretch and you risk successfully hunting and you starve get injured or killed in a fight and you are less likely to provide for your offspring or pack mates and the shake while not nearly as pronounced at that morning stretch some dogs do it when they first stir in the morning it may also be a way of loosening up and getting limber before tackling the days exertions instagram photo by kim baillie â¢ sep 20 2016 at 1020am utcthe reason why dogs shake when they get up is just like us jackie cameron dog trainer and founder of no kill kern tells the dodo they want to stretch out and they want to get their muscles ready for activity dogs are active beings when they get up they want to start moving its charging the system instagram video by annie and oliver â¢ oct 25 2016 at 1202am utcthe bottom line for dogs stretching and shaking is likely hardwired instinct we think we are the brightest ones and oftentimes we dont follow what our instincts are telling us lia marques a trainer with marleys mutts tells the dodo which is why dogs might not be so much copying humans when they stretch  but rather reminding us to to do it every day because its good for all of us good dog view the comments
