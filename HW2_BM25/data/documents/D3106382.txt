of all the materials that have been used through the ages paper has become the most widely employed around the world in fact the united states alone uses about 70 million tons of it each year1 but could you differentiate between the countless types thicknesses and weights of copier paper versus cardstock paper probably not understanding paper weight is not common sense and may be a bit confusing that’s why oki has provided this resource for those who need a general guide on how to choose the right paper for their specific printing needs below you will learn about the most common methods used to understand paper weight tools to help determine and distinguish between the various print media types and lastly you will find a paper weight conversion chart that provides a clear comparison of common media weights feel free to bookmark this page as a referencespecifying paper weights a digital caliper paper weight is an important component to consider when printing heavier media often conveys quality and provides durability unfortunately sorting through the various methods of labeling a paper’s weight is not always straightforward first there are three common methods for specifying paper weight and thickness u s basis weight bond book index cover tag points offset  metric weight gsm or gm2 and often interchangeable points or mils an actual caliper reading of the paper thickness the u s basis not basic weights are the most confusing simply because the same paper can yield different values based on the “basis weight” applied while manufacturing the paper and higher values don’t always equate to heavierthicker print media for example a sheet of 100lb text paper is actually much thinner than an 80lb cover stock the “basis weight” is defined as the weight of 500 sheets of paper in its basic unit uncut size which means before being cut to letter size or legal size the paper is weighed and categorized the most common sizes some of which you may recognize are bond text book cover index and tag an uncut sheet of bond paper is 17 x 22 inches while an uncut sheet of cover paper is 20 x 26 inches if 500 sheets of bond paper 17 x 22 inches weigh 20 lbs then a ream of paper cut to letter size will be labeled as 20 lb and if 500 sheets of cover paper 20 x 26 inches weigh 65 lbs then a ream of this paper trimmed to tabloid size would be marked as 65lb this may be a lot to grasp but don’t feel overwhelmed often professional printers don’t keep track of all the permutations based on experience from using a small subset they have a pretty good idea of what to expect when reaching for a 24lb bond versus a 60lb cover versus a 110lb index each media often serves a specific purpose below you will find the basic descriptions and some “realworld” examples of the core print media applications place your cursor over each image for a short explanation about each paper type
