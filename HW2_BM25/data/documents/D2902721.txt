dropping out of the 2000 olympic trials due to injury but began a comeback in 2005 which ended on august 1 2006   in my very first interview at nine years old i said i wanted to be an olympic gold medalist that was the first time i said it out loud in front of somebody other than my parents and it was kind of a seed that was planted in me because the local news team they actually considered me an olympic hopeful which i thought was the coolest thing a lot of these gymnasts at the elite level they put themselves through so much sacrifice because of that dream that olympic dream is what a lot of these girls want and its so tough now to make the team it always has been its difficult to make that olympic team everyones in it for different reasons but for me i certainly wanted that olympic dream that was my main goal i wanted a gold medal and i was going to stop at nothing and not let anyone no matter how much they shook me how much they broke me down i didnt want to let them win i didnt want to let those people harm me so much that i would not fulfill my destiny   id been competing at that elite level since i was 10 years old and it was never the competition that frightened me i loved gymnastics i was eager to compete i was hungry to go out there and be the best in the world and i had that determination there was never anything wrong with me competing at the elite level at such a young age i loved being the youngest and breaking records and for me that was a positive thing the hard part is the selfserving adults who wanted to use me as a means to an end and thats where the authority figure in your life especially since youre a minor needs to be watching over you and protecting you so it was never the fact that i competed at a young age that bothered me or anything like that i thrived off of that i loved it and i think in most cases its not a bad thing to compete early in your career at a high level i didnt have a lot of choices when youre in the sport at such a young age you have a lot of people guiding everything that you do from what you eat what time you need to sleep what your days going to be thats just how it is the coaches they make the rules a lot of my influence too was from my eastern european culture and i had eastern european coaches as well so i wasnt allowed to have a voice and i didnt particularly have one for a long time i had very nurturing coaches up until the age of 10 when i transferred and moved to the karolyi system i really liked the gym and i loved going to the classes i begged my parents to even stay extra hours so that i could play and just have fun so of course i did it because i loved it but then when i got to the karolyis i realized that these coaches were treating me very differently than i had ever been used to i was never brought into this kind of situation before where the coaches were weighing gymnasts in front of other people they would humiliate them about their weight they were belittling and verbally and emotionally abusive to the athletes their selfesteem was chipped away at and i saw gymnasts training on injuries that were not addressed to the point where a lot of them would be so hurt that they would never speak up in my case i collapsed before the olympics in the gym due to my stress fracture   i always was a hard worker that was never the problem i had extremely high discipline that was never the problem i was a straighta student that wasnt the issue it was always the treatment of the athletes a lot of people dont understand fully when youre in the gym you spend more time with your coaches than you do with your parents on a daily basis and over the course of 10 years that adds up to a great deal of time that these people are influencing your children they have to be cautious and know whats happening in the gym a lot of times children are scared to speak up against their coaches theyre afraid of also being ostracized by their teammates and their peers they speak out and other people will say well thats not true and they want to defend the coach im not the only one whos spoken out about this but there are athletes who have been afraid to say things for many many years and youll still find some athletes who never will say anything about that side of it because when youve been so emotionally and mentally and verbally abused a lot of times you start to form an alliance with your abuser most athletes they dont grow out of that i have to still please these people they start believing that it was for their own good   i had torn emotions my coaches i felt they werent proud of me because i had made an error and they were making it very clear by how they were treating me that they were not pleased with me and here was supposed to be the happiest moment of my life i had finally accomplished this gold medal of course now i look at it differently because i wont let them steal my joy anymore and i will not let them make me feel that i failed in any way ive chosen to view it differently and that comes with growth and maturity but at that moment when im taking people through the feeling how it really was yes i was scared because id lived so much of my childhood in fear of these very people who were supposed to be nurturing and caring and proud of me at this moment years later my dad said he was proud of me i never got an im proud of you or congratulations from my coaches ever now ive had distance and time to digest all of that had happened to me and i choose to look at it in a much different light and not allow that negativity and that poison to enter my life anymore   my parents didnt know anything about collegiate scholarships so they had accepted the national team training stipend the monthly stipend that i received after making the national team so i was ineligible for ncaa eligibility anyway that was it and it was all or nothing at that point because i was going to go to school but i was not going to be able to have a collegiate scholarship if the olympics didnt work out i always encourage young athletes to have a backup plan because theres a small window of opportunity and its important to have a backup plan because once the olympics are over its almost like whats next and youre not really prepared for whats next   i got injured at the olympic trials in 2000 i could not jump i could not walk on my leg properly i couldnt bend my knee i couldnt straighten it i knew right away im like nope this is not good i could feel it in my knee that i could not use it like i needed to use it it was unstable and when you feel that its devastating i had to have surgery on my knee and my shoulder i was dealing with a torn labrum for the entire year and i was getting cortisone shots in it just to make it to the olympics again so i was putting my body through a great deal and pretty much i just left after having surgery on my knee and doing the postolympic tour and then in january 2001 i had shoulder surgery i just left it was really unfortunate that i was leaving the sport in that way the truth is i didnt get the respect that i felt that i should have but at that point when i was injured i just kind of decided i cant go on right now because i need two more surgeries i needed to fix my knee and my shoulder and then figure out what i was going to do with my life   a lot of gymnasts feel like its just too much to stick around another four years and to put yourself through all this training and to put yourself through all these camps a lot of this stuff is very difficult on the body the mind and also all four years youre putting four years off of school and very few make it the olympics so sticking around another four years is very difficult to comprehend that was the last push for the olympics and now you just want to recover your mind and body and take a break everybody wants a break because its so intense there are two sides to it yes youre heartbroken because youve done this sport your whole life and its so hard to let it go youve invested so much into it—emotionally physically all your preparation everything youve ever done has revolved around this one sport especially for an elite level gymnast and yes there is a side of you that is a huge sigh of relief because now you can eat what you want you can go and enjoy personal activities with your friends a part of it is relief a part of it is heartbreaking and a part of it is what am i going to do with my life for so long youve dreamed and invested in one goal and youre not thinking of anything else youre not thinking of the future until youre finally at that point where you have to make those decisions i just wanted to find some peace within myself departing from the sport having a lot of the pain and the aches that i had when i left the sport and then departing the sport on an injury that was hard too but i think i had to deal with many different emotions at the time trying to figure out ok what do i really want how do i overcome all these feelings that i have inside of me for all thats happened in my career how do i understand it all and i couldnt understand it all at that point because i hadnt processed everything yet when its so fresh you just want to get through the next thing just get through this next surgery ok whats the next step ok get through the next surgery there were two surgeries and then after they healed i wanted to figure out ok what do i do with my life at that point i was like well ive always wanted to go to college that was something that was important i had met mike during that time and he encouraged me to go to school he was already at medical school and on his way to become a surgeon and i kind of just decided after a couple years thats what i needed to do   i thought i was going to leave the sport forever when i came out of it in 2000 after the olympic trials and the surgeries i did feel like ok well i really didnt want to end my career on an injury i never wanted to leave the sport this way that was difficult for me to leave the sport that i had invested so much of my life in and i was taught to never be a quitter i was taught to never leave something without finishing it so i felt that i did finish it in the best way that i could but unfortunately unforeseen mishap happened and i had to then figure out how do i depart this in the best way possible and thankfully mike entered my life and i was able to come back in my 20s and finish the sport in a better way i had found a peace within me there was inner peace with my decision to come back and it was all motivated and encouraged by my heartbreak because i left the sport not loving it like i used to and that broke my heart as well because i felt like i didnt leave the sport necessarily on my own terms i felt that i was too good to let go of the sport in that way where i just had to depart on an injury it was an unsettling within me coming back at age 24 i was really doing gymnastics because i found my passion and love for it again and my husband showed me that i could be at the elite level with all these younger kids and i could be competitive i could do it in a positive way that wasnt hurtful and harmful and i wanted to prove not only to myself but to other people as well that it could be done in a healthy way politics blocked me from competing at the u s nationals when i came back in 2006 but it doesnt mean that i left the sport in a way that wasnt proud of because i went out and i stood up for what i believed in it was certainly a moment in my life where i had such maturity and understanding of the sport all the politics it irritates me but i was at such peace that i did this and i did it the right way and you cant hurt me anymore i proved to everyone at the national team training camp that i was highly competitive with great routines and i know those girls there saw it i was really proud to be able to survive that camp and pretty much overcome and conquer a lot of those demons that i had from that karolyi ranch for a handy master schedule of every olympic event click here here is your handy olympic master schedule the olympics are crazy there are lots and lots of events at all hours of the day but if nbc has…read more rob trucks spent eighteen months talking to 49yearolds two of those interviews with former nhl goalie clint malarchuk and the late dave
