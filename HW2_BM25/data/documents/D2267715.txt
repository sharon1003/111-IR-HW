what is nondairy milk everything you need to knowposted by lindsay s nixon category faqi saw a ridiculous commercial on tv recently it was a mimic game show and the point of the commercial was that soy milk and other nondairy alternatives have a couple of ingredients while dairy milk only has 1 so you should pick dairy because its simple and has less ingredients eyes roll i took the commercial as a sign that the harms of dairy are getting out there and the dairy industry is getting nervous im sure if sales were as high as normal they wouldnt be running advertisements against their nondairy competitors nonetheless dairy isnt just one ingredient just because theyre not required to put what the cow was forcefed corn soy etc which invariably comes back out in their milk plus note the antibiotics and hormones the animal was also given also in the milk and anything else that is artificially added doesnt mean it didnt happen  but this isnt a rant on dairy because we all know how gross and bad for our bodies it is if you dont know this is a good start on why dairy is awful  i also recommend watching forks over knives now lets talk plantbased milk i have a video blog post what is nondairy milk  but the topic is worth a little more exploration when people ask me which one they should purchase my general answer is to find a plantbased milk you like and use it if you dont like soy milk thats fine try almond or rice or oat milk try different brands too there is a reason there are so many brands — they taste different you might also prefer sweetened over unsweetened the only milks i suggest avoiding are the coconut milkbased ones because they are so high in saturated fat and they dont always work well in cooking and baking and hemp milk because the earthy hemp flavor can be strong and not complementary to the flavors in your recipes you can also make your own rice milk very easily you can also make your own almond milk and oat milk easily but soy milk generally needs a machine what to look for when buying your nondairy milk1 make sure the plantbased milk you are using doesnt contain oil refrigerated milks tend to but shelfstable do not the shelfstable ones also tend to be cheaper and the great thing about them is you can stock up so you never run out in the middle of the recipe 2 if you trying to eat a lowfat diet you might want pick the brand with the lowest amount of fat per serving this tends to be rice or oat milk as soy and almonds both are fairly rich in fat naturally you can however find lowfat and fatfree soy milks we like west soys non fat soy milk but tend to buy unsweetened almond milk 3 pick the brand with the least number of ingredients 4 buy unsweetened if you can if you need your plantbased milk sweetened thats fine sugar is a scapegoat not the biggest concern a little sweetener in your plantbased milk is nothing to worry about — just make sure youre buying sweetened plain or vanilla not chocolate or another flavor which is basically a candy bar in a glass i predominantly use unsweetened almond milk in my cooking and baking but i dont drink it by the glass or eat cereal when i ate cereal i used sweetened fatfree soy milk scott used to drink plantbased milk by the glass when he was transitioning to a plantbased diet because he used to drink a lot of milk by the glass and habits are hard to break and he liked sweetened soy milk or sweetened almond milk i find most people coming off milk like sweetened almond milk the best but again we all have our own tastes finally about that commercial i can make rice milk and almond milk with just rice or almonds and water so i win on simplicity lolget a free vegan meal plan
