oil price analysis november 2016analysis from wood mackenzie“all five of the major oilproducers in region – iran iraq kuwait saudi arabia and the uae – will run a fiscal deficit in 2016 deficits will range from 4 of gdp in iran to 20 of gdp in both saudi arabia and iraq by our estimates given the size of fiscal deficits these economies face years in the red unless there is a sustained recovery in prices it will be 2020 before all are back in the black or running a fiscal surplus based on our expectation for the oil price to return to 85bbl real in 2020”“the key to fiscal sustainability is access to capital – either a cushion of reserve assets or the ability to issue government debt in international markets kuwait and the uae have vast reserve assets allowing them to comfortably sustain fiscal deficits well beyond 2020 while saudi arabia has a healthy cushion of reserve assets these are being eroded fast according to official data from the saudi monetary authority sama the kingdom burned through sar 716 billion 191 billion in reserve assets between august 2014 and september 2016 iran on the other hand has limited reserves but a relatively small deficit to finance indeed the 2016 shortfall could be covered eight times over by their reserves iraq is facing the greatest test having depleted most of the 18 billion iraq development fund iraq is relying on emergency loans from the imf and the central bank to purchase short dated government debt access to international capital markets is limited and the country’s debt stock is already elevated iraq cancelled an auction last year because of the high yield demanded by investors”“to stem the depletion of reserve assets saudi arabia issued 4 billion in local bonds and 175 billion in international bond markets this year abu dhabi issued 5 billion in bonds in april the first issue for seven years and even iran is considering debt issuance in international markets after a 14year

tribune the great transfusion in 20078 a colossal pyramid of us bank debt backed by real property collapsed when the burden of debt became too great for the us population to support as has been said if debt cannot be paid then it will not be paid and this debt has not gone away the visible wounds of the us economy – the damaged private banks – have now healed through being recapitalised but invisible internal bleeding continues into unsustainable and unrepayable property debt this requires a continuing transfusion of new dollars which have until recently been provided by the us federal reserve bank ‘fed’ in exchange for financial assets such as government bonds this fed economic policy of a programme of dollar creation and asset swaps is known as ‘quantitative easing’ or qe these dollars had to end up somewhere and apart from conventional investments new types of funds were created which enabled investors who feared inflation to invest in gold and commodities perhaps the most sought after commodity as a protection against inflation is and was crude oil a colossal amount of dollar lending – no one knows how much – was therefore made via investment banks to saudi arabia and possibly to other gcc nations by us funds in return for oil loans made through ‘prepay’ sale and repurchase agreements this simple chart shows how the us fed quantitative easing qe and twist programmes of dollar creation are almost perfectly correlated to the us wti crude oil benchmark price itself linked to the brentbfoe benchmark oil price it is clear that when the qe transfusion ended in late 2014 the us financial bubble in crude oil prices collapsed – as i predicted it would another macroeconomic effect has been that since the us dollar bleeding continued the dollar transfusion must necessarily come from somewhere else we therefore see the dollar exchange rate strengthening as dollars drain out of us creditor nations causing dollar shortages … mr alnaimi recently gave a major interview in relation to saudi oil market strategy perhaps the most widely reported remarks related to the new saudi strategy of maintaining market share even in the face of a decline in the oil price to 20barrel in my analysis mr alnaimi’s bullish posture is based upon the fact that saudi arabia can maintain market share simply by delivering crude oil into the market the economic value of which has already been presold to investors i believe that mr alnaimi’s confidence is based firmly upon saudi experience of monetising their reserves invisibly to the market for the last five years through the use of prepay credit the saudis and us have essentially turned the conventional oil market on its head market participants such as iran russia and venezuela wrongly believe that saudi arabia’s oil supply still actively determines the market price but the reality is that the saudis are now passively allowing the market price to determine supply the market price is in reality now set – based upon an easily manipulated crude oil benchmark price – by financial intermediaries who profit commercially from volatility on behalf of governments who profit politically from the economic damage caused to producers by massive swings in oil priceshttpwwweurotribcomstory2015111956521093full mees interview with saudi oil minister ali naimi21122014extract naimi he head of rosneft provided information about the russian oil industry in the end he said he could not make any reductions because their wells are old and if they reduce the wells will not come back up the minister confirmed that russia was not willing to cut mees is it true that if the price falls there are some fields in russia and elsewhere that cannot produce naimi the problem with old fields around the world is that they need continuous investment in new wells and they cannot shut in old wells because if they do they will not come back up so they are wary in that respect particularly in west siberia where they have been producing for a long time and the wells there are declining their production of around 10mnbd depends on high revenue which is no longer there that is the opposite of fields in the gulf which are still young we have a lot of scope to continue and our production costs are low – 4b or 5b at most there is a difference between drilling a well in our areas and drilling a well in other areas also brazil’s subsalt wells west african wells and arctic wells are high cost so sooner or later however much they hold out in the end their financial affairs will limit their production will this be in six months in one year two years three years god knows i say that the gulf countries and particularly the kingdom saudi arabia have the ability to hold out mees to what level would oil prices have to fall to halt the growth in us shale oil production and how long would prices have to stay there naimi shale oil rocks are not homogenous some areas have higher porosity than others areas that have good porosity can produce at 2030b but some places need 8090b to make it what is certain now is that they have begun to remove rigs you remove the rigs so you do not drill wells so how are you going to produce the other fact is that shale oil wells have 80 decline rates in the first year that is why they have to keep the rig drilling… mees but you have announced that you will have a budgetary deficit naimi a deficit will occur mees but what resources do you have in the country naimi we have no debt we can go to the banks they are full we can go and borrow money and keep our reserves or we can use some of our reserveshttpoilprocompost9223meesinterviewsaudioilministeralinaimi december 2014httpwwweiagovforecastssteodecember 2014

the production peaks were of the order 74 mbpd post 2009 peaks of the order 77 mbpd were achieved about 3 mbpd new capacity has been added in may 2011 there is a significant and curious excursion to lower production not accompanied by a fall in price this coincides with libya coming off line for the first time and the loss of 16 mbpd production it seems possible that this coincided with weak demand and the fortuitous loss of production cancelling weak demand leaving price unchanged the eia are always running a few months behind with their statistics these days not ideal in a rapidly changing world thus we do not yet have the data to see the recent crash in the oil price but we know the price has fallen below 80 and production is unlikely to be significantly changed so how do we explain production of roughly 77 mbpd and a price below 80”“figure 6 updates phil hart’s model to take account of the oil supply and price movements of the last 5 years capacity expansion is achieved by adding 3 mbpd to the former welldefined supplyprice curve blue arrow there is no apriori reason that this curve should hold in the new supplyprice regime but for the time being that is all i have to work with the red lines as described in the caption to figure 1 conceptually represent inelastic demand where high price marginally suppresses demand for oil the recent past has seen oil priced at 110 with supply running at about 77 mbpd as defined by the right hand red coloured demand curve reducing demand by about 1 mbpd brings the price below 80  bbl red

barrel of oil or approximately eight gallons bearing in mind that a single gallon has the equivalent energyof 200 to 300 man hours of labor this already seems like a small fortune but in what i am calling “the golden age of income” the affordability of oil increased so steadily that by the end of 1972 just before opec and thetroubles in the middle east began one hour’s work controlled 11 barrels over a fivefold increase the greatest surge of real wealth in u s history by the second oil shock of 1979 however oil affordability was back at anew low next began a quite different leg up far less smooth and this time driven by declining oil prices and despite increasingly modest increases in income per hour a new high in affordability was reached at 12 barrelsper hour worked at the astonishingly low price of 16 a barrel in 1999 at today’s dollar equivalent the final leg that i have been obsessing about now for six years was the great decline in affordability from 1999 until today that took affordability of oil back precisely to where we began in 1940″httpwwwgmocomwebsitecontentgmoqtly letter3q14fullpdf october 2014the chart above shows a conceptual description and

may 2012by imf extracts from global economy learns to absorb oil price hikes1 stronger demand the reason for the current price hikes differs from the past increases in the 1970s and 1980s were caused largely by sharp disruptions to world supply in contrast a prime reason for the increases since 2000 has been strongerthanexpected demand from emerging market economies 2 central bank policies central banks and economies have become more adept at dealing with price shocks in the 1970s and 1980s oil price rises triggered fears of inflation and workers would try to protect themselves by demanding higher nominal wage increases this had the effect of setting off wageprice spirals 3 recycling the benefits of oil profits the revenues from oil exports are flowing back to oilimporting economies this helps bring down interest rates for households and firms and so supports investment and growth in these economies 4 greater efficiency oil price shocks do not have the same impact as in the past because economies have become more efficient in the use of energy the amount of energy it takes to produce a dollar of income has been steadily declining for 40 years this decline in energy intensity is expected to continue 5 diversification countries have increasingly diversified their energy sources over recent decades they import energy from many more places than in the 1970s they also use more varied forms of energy this makes them less vulnerable to disruptions from any one supplier or source of energy oil supplies remain a concern despite the reduced impact of high oil prices in recent years large abrupt price changes remain difficult to absorb particularly if they come from supply disruptions recent geopolitical developments offer plenty of examples of such disruptions the impact of supply disruptions the effects of major supply disruptions can be particularly damaging under current conditions because there is limited spare capacity to increase oil production and inventory levels in importing countries are low this will compound the difficulties facing many households already reeling from the financial crisis with higher prices for gasoline and heating oil adding to the pain inflicted by high unemployment and low wages future supply disruptions may turn out to be costly not just because of the immediate loss of oil supplies but because of the fears they trigger about a more permanent loss response of oil suppliers the response by oil suppliers to higher prices has been slow despite many years of rising and high prices bringing additional oil capacity to the market remains a challenge for various reasons including geology geography technology and regulation liquidity trap simulations of the imf’s largescale models show that oil supply disruptions would reduce growth in the united states and europe an unwelcome prospect given already weak conditions in those economies an additional worry is that even oil price increases due to stronger demand from emerging markets may have negative shortrun effects in the current climate as the increased incomes and savings of oil exporters from the higher prices are not recycled immediately or fully into increased demand for goods produced by oilimporting countries httpwwwimforgexternalpubsftsurveyso2012num052512ahtm june 2012where are us gas prices going have you ever wanted to know where the average price of

caused by oil prices notably • crude oil expenditures should not exceed 4 of gdp • oil prices should not increase by more than 50 yearonyear • oil price increases should not be so great that a potential demand adjustment should have to reach 08 of gdp on an annual basis as shedding demand at this rate has generally been associated with recession

whereas historical oil price shocks were primarily caused by physical disruptions of supply the price runup of 200708 was caused by strong demand confronting stagnating world production although the causes were different the consequences for the economy appear to have been very similar to those observed in earlier episodes with significant effects on overall consumption spending and purchases of domestic automobiles in particular in the absence of those declines it is unlikely that we would have characterized the period 2007 q4 to 2008 q3 as one of economic recession for the u s the experience of 200708 should thus be added to the list of recessions to which oil prices appear to have made a material contribution
