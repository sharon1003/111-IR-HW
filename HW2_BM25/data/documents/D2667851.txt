disfigured by fillersare fillers a quickfix antiageing miracle or downright dangerous by claire coleman for the mail on sunday updated 1004 edt 15 june 2009view comments last week the british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons baaps published statistics revealing that almost a quarter of their members had seen patients for surgery to correct problems caused by permanent fillers  injectable gels used to add volume to the face and more recently the body demand for fillers has soared in recent years since surgeons realised that ageing causes our faces to lose their youthful plumpness its this thinning out  as much as wrinkles  that makes us look old seduced by the prospect of a quick relatively inexpensive and surgeryfree solution to ageing women rushed to have syringes full of synthetic compounds injected into their faces breasts and bottoms in a bid to plump up their problem areas in demand the popularity of fillers has soared as women have become seduced by the prospect of a quick relatively inexpensive and surgeryfree solution to ageing there are hundreds of fillers available  products such as restylane juvederm radiesse sculptra bioalcamid and macrolane are just a few  and while some are made from substances the body is able to breakdown over a period of months or years there is an issue with permanent fillers as the name suggests once injected while not a permanent solution to the ageing problem these substances do remain in the body permanently if they move patients can be left with unsightly lumps or bumps which are difficult to remove related

pretty harry potter actress is perfect pastels sparkle this summer with these shimmering share this article bad reactions to these fillers are also more common than many think and in the wrong hands the problems can include facial necrosis disfigurement nerve damage and anaphylactic shock the problem with a permanent filler is that youre introducing an alien substance into the body explains rajiv grover consultant plastic surgeon and honorary secretary of the baaps the body is designed to try to protect itself from this sort of thing and can initiate an immune response resulting in scar tissue or inflammatory nodules which appear as lumps under the skin mr grover suggests that one way to minimise the likelihood of an adverse reaction is to choose a filler similar to substances your body will recognise this is why temporary fillers like restylane  based on hyaluronic acid a naturally occurring substance in the body  are popular in fact more than 80 per cent of surgeons questioned by the baaps reported seeing no serious complications stemming from the use of temporary fillers while the issues with facial fillers tend to be cosmetic disfiguring rather than actually dangerous many surgeons have grave concerns about the new trend for body fillers especially with treatments that are injected into the breast tissue both the substance and the potential complications make it much more difficult to screen for breast lumps the precursors of cancers according to the baaps one of the biggest issues with using fillers is the lack of regulation currently the procedure falls under legislation governing medical devices rather than medicines themselves and therefore products simply have to receive a ce mark to be licensed for use in this country its just too easy for a product to come to market without any longterm testing and results explains mr grover to get a ce mark you can test your product on just ten to 20 people and only have to follow them for six months thats not rigorous enough when a product is being injected into the body in fact mr grover and his colleagues would prefer the uk to adopt the approach taken in the u s where fillers are treated as medicines and subjected to strict scrutiny before being used on patients as a result only six fillers are approved for use in the u s while in the uk more than 160 are available just as worrying is that because fillers are not considered drugs or medicines anybody who can get their hands on the product could administer it regardless of how little training theyve had consequently industry insiders insist that if you want fillers stick to those approved in the u s and ensure theyre administered by an experienced medical professional otherwise youre playing russian roulette  not only with your looks but potentially with your longterm health too• for more information contact the baaps on 020 7430 1840 or visit wwwbaapsorguk tried and tested bodyfirming creams click on an image to enlarge and scroll
