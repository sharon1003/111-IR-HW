organisations that offer expert advice on sn delayed myelination  is there anything to help bring it on a bit 21 postsadd message  reportmumgoingcrazy mon 06jul09 211131dd2 had an mri 3 weeks ago and although i dont have this in writing the geneticist has said that her immature brain is due to delayed myelination ive googled it lots and think i understand it now but apart from lorenzos oil i cant see how or what would bring it on a bit we give fish oils to dd2 already but maybe there is a certain type of fish oil that may be beneficial or something else does anyone have any advise for me i only found this out today its all very new to me add message  report pipin jo mon 06jul09 232737message withdrawn at posters request add message  reportmumgoingcrazy tue 07jul09 192519hi pipinjo what is a dan we do eye q as well though i dont think ive seen a difference since using it but figure it isnt going to do any harm i dont have any dx at the moment apart from dev delay and sensory processing disorder which i now believe to be down to the myelination delay hope you dont mind me asking but what does myelination depletion mean have the fish oils and vitamins helped your dc add message  reportsarah293 tue 07jul09 193536message withdrawn add message  reportmumgoingcrazy tue 07jul09 195240riven do you mean lots of stimulation as in socialising art therapy etc or something specifically to encourage the brain to lay down fibres add message  reportr3dh3d tue 07jul09 201505tbh you may find that delayed myelination is a bit like gdd  its a symptom not a disorder in itself dd1 has it we think because her underlying metabolic disorder means she is short of the substrate needed to lay down myelin absolutely sod all can be done about it without changing her dna but its presumably different in other cases so youll have more idea what might help if they can tell you why myelination is delayed also i think the range of normal for rate of myelination is wider than they used to think  they are now saying myelination will generally go on till 2 or 2 12 so though it may be an unusual feature in the mri it may or may not the the feature causing problems keep an open mind and keep pushing on any other anomolies as well re oils  i think the thing is variety tbh id get some different brands fish ones flax seed ones whatever and alternate a bit omega 3 seems to cover quite a bit of ground add message  reportmumgoingcrazy tue 07jul09 215444thank you the geneticist is meeting the radiographer with dd2s mri pictures tomorrow and then she will send me a full report of the findings but she did say on the phone that they dont have an underlying cause some bloods were taken when she had the mri for rare chromosome disorders so i guess these may flag something up im guessing this would detect a metabolic disorder would it why does varying the oils help thanks again add message  report pipin jo tue 07jul09 221710message withdrawn at posters request add message  report woooozle100 tue 07jul09 223202this is reminding me to restart with the oils my dd has probs in this area she has a rare chromosome disorder and metabolic issues which may be seperate  related looks as though it could be a seperate glycogen storage disease ive got my own suspicions otherwise tbh im not too concerned anymore about finding out shes 4 now it wont make any difference on how shes treated etc hope you get some answers soon well  brace yourself a bit cos sometimes the answers arent that at all  they just serve to throw up more questions glad at least you are getting fuller explanation now add message  reportsarah293 wed 08jul09 074007message withdrawn add message  reportr3dh3d wed 08jul09 083901mgc  bloods wont necessarily have tested for metabolic disorders there are so many of them and each test will be different as they are all flagged by the presence of different chemicals which the body cant process so its not as if there is a do metabolic tests box they tick  they would do each one specifically and usually only if they suspect it they all cost money im pretty sure your dd doesnt have what mine has as on average they die undiagnosed within 3 weeks but its one of the nastier ones from that pov there are plenty of others geneticist will have ordered the tests there will be a pink slip in the notes somewhere listing what was requested re varying the oils  well omega 3s are a group of oils each with slightly different chemical properties i think that a single source eg flax oil or fish oil will be likely to supply more of one subtype than another so varying it over the week would mean you cover more bases add message  reportmumgoingcrazy wed 08jul09 130504thank you everyone pipin ill look into the vitamins what is dan and how do i get hold of a good one ive googled it and come up with really random stuff also what treatments are good that are not offered on the nhs riven your post has really struck a cord what you get out is what you put in i do try to stimulate her as much as poss but you can always do more i guess pixie you are right i thought i wanted all the answers but more and more questions are arising and the fact that shes developing really well now apart from physically im tempted to leave her be r3d im off to the shops to vary dd2s oils re the flax seed oil this is probably a very stupid question but am i literally buying a bottle of it and giving her a spoonful each day or are there special kids ones add message  reportcyberseraphim wed 08jul09 130851i give ds1 fish oil i thought about flax oil due to possibly better taste  but my friend google said a childs body does not process it the way an adults body does so no benefit  however this information had nothing to do wiht brain development so may not be relevantadd message  report pipin jo wed 08jul09 185415message withdrawn at posters request add message  report woooozle100 wed 08jul09 205309mumgoingcrazy  oh that feeling of could do more is quite horrible really i did absolutely loads with dd  physio singing literally modelling how to play over and over and she still has sld it was hard yet a bit liberating to realise that whatever i did made v little difference in regards to that not to say it was worthless  i have a happy confident  sociable child that is very responsive dunno how much of that is down to what we did obv impossible to tell add message  report woooozle100 wed 08jul09 205911oh and ditto what r3d was saying about the metabolic tests there are loads loads loads tis a bit needle  haystack they need to have some idea what to look for dd went through 1 yr of numerous hormone tests now shes under metabolic team as well and they think they have an idea  theyve still said it could be 6 months before we get results sometimes samples are sent other side of the world for testing ours only going to sheffield mind add message  reportmumgoingcrazy thu 09jul09 190702i always feel i should be more even if i do therapy every minute of her waking day i think maybe i could have done this better or that better i beat myself up a lot re dd1 but with dd2 im on a constant guilt trip im guessing thats what happens when you have a kiddie with sn i just dont know how far i want to go with her tests im waiting for a more detailed report of the mri but as for other tests i dont know ill see what the paed says next time i see her bit confused by omega 3 at the moment is there some way of finding out which ones would be beneficial add message  report pipin jo thu 09jul09 203815message withdrawn at posters request add message  reportmumgoingcrazy fri 10jul09 193102well i have quite a stash of eye qs thanks to the 3 for 2s in boots so will keep on with these and i did happen to be in holland and barret today and bought some flax seed oil so figured i might give her a dribble of this too i must admit if i was loaded i might have looked into the lorenzo oil a bit more i wonder how much it worksadd message  reportfeelingbetter fri 10jul09 212651when i was expressing milk for ds during his early days on scbu his consultant advised me on what to eat to benefit dss poorly brain and to help me feel like i was doing something to help her list included flax oil spinach walnuts salmon no processed food at all  everything fresh very difficult to acheive whilst practically living at the hospital willing ds to live but i did it somehow not sure it helped but certainly did no harm apparently the all have naturally high levels of dhas add message  reportmumgoingcrazy sat 11jul09 193026thats brilliant thanks feelingbetter luckily she eats lots of salmon anyway but will sneak the others into her diet somehow it must have done something as your little ds beat all the odds and is lovely by the way i
