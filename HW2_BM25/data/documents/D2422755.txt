between economic development and economic growthdownload difference between economic development and economic growth introduction economic growth and development is often used interchangeably but there is a difference economic growth is an increase in the amount of the goods and services produced over a specific period of time generally economic development refers to policymakers actions which promotes the health political and social wellbeing of a specific area common areas of development includes literacy rates life expectancy unemployment and poverty rates economic development leads to the economic growth of a country economic growth is a narrower concept than economic development it is an increase in a countrys real level of national output which can be caused by an increase in the quality of resources by education etc  increase in the quantity of resources  improvements in technology or in another way an increase in the value of goods and services produced by every sector of the economy economic growth can be measured by an increase in a countrys gdp gross domestic product economic development is a normative concept ie it applies in the context of peoples sense of morality right and wrong good and bad the definition of economic development given by michael todaro is an increase in living standards improvement in selfesteem needs and freedom from oppression as well as a greater choice the most accurate method of measuring development is the human development index which takes into account the literacy rates  life expectancy which affect productivity and could lead to economic growth it also leads to the creation of more opportunities in the sectors of education healthcare employment and the conservation of the environment it implies an increase in the per capita income of every citizen economic growth does not take into account the size of the informal economy the informal economy is also known as the black economy which is unrecorded economic activity development alleviates people from low standards of living into proper employment with suitable shelter economic growth does not take into account the depletion of natural resources which might lead to pollution congestion  disease development however is concerned with sustainability which means meeting the needs of the present without compromising future needs these environmental effects are becoming more of a problem for governments now that the pressure has increased on them due to global warming economic growth is a necessary but not sufficient condition of economic development economic development is the sustained concerted actions of policy makers and communities that promote the standard of living and economic health of a specific area economic development can also be referred to as the quantitative and qualitative changes in the economy such actions can involve multiple areas including development of human capital critical infrastructure regional competitiveness environmental sustainability social inclusion health safety literacy and other initiatives economic development differs from economic growth whereas economic development is a policy intervention endeavor with aims of economic and social wellbeing of people economic growth is a phenomenon of market productivity and rise in gdp consequently as economist amartya sen points out “economic growth is one aspect of the process of economic development” 1 history economic development originated in the post war period of reconstruction initiated by the us in 1949 during his inaugural speech president harry truman identified the development of undeveloped areas as a priority for the west “more than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery their food is inadequate they are victims of disease their economic life is primitive and stagnant their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas for the first time in history humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people  i believe that we should make available to peaceloving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life… what we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing  greater production is the key to prosperity and peace and the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modem scientific and technical knowledge there have been several major phases of development theory since 1945 from the 1940s to the 1960s the state played a large role in promoting industrialization in developing countries following the idea of modernization theory this period was followed by a brief period of basic needs development focusing on human capital development and redistribution in the 1970s neoliberalism emerged in the 1980s pushing an agenda of free trade and import substitution industrialization in economics the study of economic development was borne out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on national product or the aggregate output of goods and services economic development was concerned in the expansion of people’s entitlements and their corresponding capabilities morbidity nourishment literacy education and other socioeconomic indicators 7 borne out of the backdrop of keynesian advocating government intervention and neoclassical economics stressing reduced intervention with rise of highgrowth countries singapore south korea hong kong and planned governments argentina chile sudan uganda economic development more generally development economics emerged amidst these mid20th century theoretical interpretations of how economies prosper 1 also economist albert o hirschman a major contributor to development economics asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the poor regions of the world primarily in africa asia and latin america yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models 8 it has also been argued notably by asian and european proponents of infrastructurebased development that systematic longterm government investments in transportation housing education and healthcare are necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in emerging countries comparison

growth is a more relevant economic development is more relevant metric for progress in developed relevance to measure progress and quality of life in countries but its widely used in all developing nations countries because growth is a necessary condition for development concerned with structural changes in the growth is concerned with increase in scope economy the economys output 12 economic growth and development we have started our discussion of development by addressing very broad issues relating to the concept of development however much of the literature and thinking about development focuses on economics indeed development and economic development have often been treated as synonymous concepts the economic development of a country or society is usually associated with amongst other things rising incomes and related increases in consumption savings and investment of course there is far more to economic development than income growth for if income distribution is highly skewed growth may not be accompanied by much progress towards the goals that are usually associated with economic development what characteristics are typically associated with economic development write down a list of features that in your view might distinguish an economically developed country from one that is not clearly not all developed countries exhibit all these characteristics in equal measure and some of you might even question the presence of certain items in the above list pointing perhaps to countries or regions within them in which for example crime and employment levels appear to be quite high or highlighting the fact that not everyone has access to good public services housing and so on some of these points are clearly open to debate for instance crime levels in the rural areas of many developing countries where most people live are often much lower than in some of the urban population centres of developed countries nonetheless the above list is probably fairly indicative of the characteristics that distinguish countries that are economically developed from those that are not economic growth from the answer to the previous question you will have noticed that the listed characteristics once again say more about goals than the processes or mechanisms for achieving them so what drives a country towards achieving these goals the orthodox view espoused by most governments most major international organisations and the economists that advise them is that a big part of the answer lies in economic growth however economic growth can follow many different paths and not all of them are sustainable indeed there are many who argue that given the finite nature of the planet and its resources any form of economic growth is ultimately unsustainable we shall leave these debates for later for now let us look at what exactly economic growth is and how it is measured economists usually measure economic growth in terms of gross domestic product gdp or related indicators such as gross national product gnp or gross national income gni which are derived from the gdp calculation gdp is calculated from a countrys national accounts which report annual data on incomes expenditure and investment for each sector of the economy using these data it is possible to estimate the total income earned in the country in any given year gdp or the total income earned by a countrys citizens gnp or gni gnp is derived by adjusting gdp to include repatriated income that was earned abroad and exclude expatriated income that was earned domestically by foreigners in countries where inflows and outflows of this sort are significant gnp may be a more appropriate indicator of a nations income than gdp there are three different ways of measuring gdp the income approach the output approach the expenditure approach the income approach as the name suggests measures peoples incomes the output approach measures the value of the goods and services used to generate these incomes and the expenditure approach measures the expenditure on goods and services in theory each of these approaches should lead to the same result so if the output of the economy increases incomes and expenditures should increase by the same amount figures for economic growth are usually presented as the annual percentage increase in real gdp real gdp is calculated by adjusting nominal gdp to take account of inflation which would otherwise make growth rates appear much higher than they really are especially during periods of high inflation shortterm versus longterm growth a distinction needs to be made between shortterm growth rates and longer term ones it is quite normal for shortterm growth rates to fluctuate in line with the business cycle this can be seen in the two figures in 121 representing gdp growth in the us between 1930 and 2003 121 us gdp 1930 to 2003 in billions of us at year 2000 prices us gdp growth rates percentage change on previous year 1930 to 2003 source unit author based on statistics from us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis according to the measures of gdp and growth shown here growth in recent decades has fluctuated between zero and 5 per annum clearly based on longterm trends growth rates exceeding 5 as measured here would seem to be unsustainable when politicians are talking about sustainable growth they are often referring to macroeconomic concerns relating to the cycle of boom and bust an economic boom involves high growth rates and is often accompanied by rising inflation it is often followed by a period of lower growth rates and recession bust sustainable growth in this context relates to stable growth rates that even out the fluctuations in the business cycle thus avoiding high peaks and the large troughs associated with recessions note that this is different from the issues that environmentalists typically focus upon when they discuss the sustainability of economic growth we shall say more on this later relationship between growth and development now take a moment to think about what gdp and gdp growth tell us about a countrys level of economic and social development do high levels of gdp necessarily correspond with high levels of development not necessarily it is not aggregate gdp that is important but gdp per capita countries like china and india have much higher levels of gdp than say singapore new zealand or belgium but few would suggest that the latter are economically less developed than the former if gdp growth is to translate into higher gdp per capita it has to outpace population growth assuming that it does is it reasonable to say that development is taking place bottom of form certainly statistics reveal that the most developed countries are those with the highest gdp per capita see easterly 2002 clearly though gdp per capita doesnt tell the whole story gdp per capita is calculated by dividing gdp by the population it says nothing about how incomes are distributed or spent growth in gdp per capita could result from growth in the incomes of richer groups in society with incomes of poorer groups remaining largely unchanged it coincides with spending patterns that are skewed towards the rich and which exclude the needs of the poor it doesnt necessarily follow that growth in per capita gdp will lead to a reduction in poverty or to broader social and economic development indeed there are those who argue rightly or wrongly that in many countries economic growth is associated with increasing levels of poverty rather than the reverse the relationship between economic growth and poverty is a hotly debated topic about which people are very divided some people highlight the negative effect of growth on low income groups stressing the need for new approaches to economic development that will allow the poor to benefit more from economic growth than they do at present others are more sanguine believing that the benefits of current models for growth will eventually trickle down to poorer groups in society if they are not already doing so much of the debate in this area revolves around the values and ideals of those engaged in it as well as the different theories on the subject it also hinges upon interpretations of the empirical evidence poverty and income distribution are hard to measure especially in developing countries where the capacity to gather and analyse data is often very weak consequently the strength of the statistical relationship between growth and poverty remains the subject of debate there is also controversy about the mechanisms by which economic growth may reduce poverty the timing of these and the policy implications gdp and purchasing power parity an additional problem with gdp as a measure of development occurs when one compares per capita gdp across countries this problem arises because one us dollar in the united states or europe for example does not buy the same amount of goods and services as it would do in say africa or asia for many goods and services one dollar will purchase significantly more in a developing country than it will in a developed one to overcome this difficulty economists often use purchasing power parity ppp dollars when making crosscountry comparisons of gdp these are dollars that are adjusted to account for the differences in purchasing power between different countries human development index the weaknesses inherent in the use of gdp as a measure of development has led to the creation of other measures the most well known of these is the human development index hdi published on a regular basis by the united nations development programme undp in its human development report the hdi is a composite index that rates countries according to their overall performance in relation to three criteria life expectancy education per capita gdp using ppp dollars as noted earlier these are related to fundamental freedoms to live and to participate in society undp publishes a number of different human development indicators many of which are composites of other weighted indexes the main indexes are human development index hdi human poverty index for developing countries hpi 1 human poverty index for selected oecd countries hpi 2 genderrelated development index gdi genderempowerment measure gem a diagrammatic overview of how these are calculated is shown in 122 122 calculating human development indicators economic development economic development is a term that economists politicians and others have used frequently in the 20th century the concept however has been in existence in the west for centuries modernization westernisation and especially industrialisation are other terms people have used while discussing economic development economic development has a direct relationship with the environment although nobody is certain when the concept originated most people agree that development is closely bound up with the evolution of capitalism and the demise of feudalism 3 mansell and when also state that economic development has been understood since the world war ii to involve economic growth namely the increases in per capita income and if currently absent the attainment of a standard of living equivalent to that of industrialized countries 4 5 economic development can also be considered as a static theory that documents the state of an economy at a certain time according to schumpeter 2003 the changes in this equilibrium state to document in economic theory can only be caused by intervening factors coming from the outside 6 growth and development dependency theorists argue that poor countries have sometimes experienced economic growth with little or no economic development initiatives for instance in cases where they have functioned mainly as resourceproviders to wealthy industrialized countries there is an opposing argument however that growth causes development because some of the increase in income gets spent on human development such as education and health according to ranis et al economic growth and development is a twoway relationship moreover the first chain consists of economic growth benefiting human development with the rise in economic growth families and individuals will likely increase expenditures with heightened incomes which in turn leads to growth in human development further with the increased consumption health and education grow also contributing to economic growth in addition to increasing private incomes economic growth also generate additional resources that can be used to improve social services such as healthcare safe drinking water etc by generating additional resources for social services unequal income distribution will be mitigated as such social services are distributed equally across each community thereby benefiting each individual concisely the relationship between human development and economic development can be explained in three ways first increase in average income leads to improvement in health and nutrition known as capability expansion through economic growth second it is believed that social outcomes can only be improved by reducing income poverty known as capability expansion through poverty reduction lastly social outcomes can also be improved with essential services such as education healthcare and clean drinking water known as capability expansion through social services john joseph puthenkalams research aims at the process of economic growth theories that lead to economic development after analyzing the existing capitalistic growthdevelopment theoretical apparatus he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom democracy and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future economic growthdevelopment of any nation depends on this emerging model as we witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the middle east he develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of micro knowledge and macro knowledge micro knowledge is what an individual learns from school or from various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently receive how to combine both these knowledge would determine further growth that leads to economic development of developing nations yet others believe that a number of basic building blocks need to be in place for growth and development to take place for instance some economists believe that a fundamental first step toward development and growth is to address property rights issues otherwise only a small part of the economic sector will be able to participate in growth that is without inclusive property rights in the equation the informal sector will remain outside the mainstream economy excluded and without the same opportunities for study goals in the united states project socrates outlined competitiveness as the driving factor for successful economic development in government and industry by addressing technology directly to meet customer needs competitiveness was fostered in the surrounding environment and resulted in greater economic performance and sustained growth economic development typically involves improvements in a variety of indicators such as literacy rates life expectancy and poverty rates gdp does not take into account other aspects such as leisure time environmental quality freedom or social justice alternative measures of economic wellbeing have been proposed more essentially a countrys economic development is related to its human development which encompasses among other things health and education these factors are however closely related to economic growth so that development and growth often go together due to globalization growth and development in those countries are interrelated to trends on international trade and participation in global value chains gvcs and international financial markets the last financial crisis had a huge effect on economies in developing countries economist jayati ghosh states that it is necessary to make financial markets in developing countries more resilient by providing a variety of financial institutions this could also add to financial security for smallscale producers 9 regional policy in its broadest sense policies of economic development encompass three major areas governments undertaking to meet broad economic objectives such as price stability high employment and sustainable growth such efforts include monetary and fiscal policies regulation of financial institutions trade and tax policies programs that provide infrastructure and services such as highways parks affordable housing crime prevention and k–12 education job creation and retention through specific efforts in business finance marketing neighborhood development workforce development small business development business retention and expansion technology transfer and real estate development this third category is a primary focus of economic development professionals one growing understanding in economic development is the promotion of regional clusters and a thriving metropolitan economy in today’s global landscape location is vitally important and becomes a key in competitive advantage international trade and exchange rates are a key issue in economic development currencies are often either undervalued or overvalued resulting in trade surpluses or deficits organization economic development organization economic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners the practitioners have two key roles one is to provide leadership in policymaking and the other is to administer policy programs and projects economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state regional or municipal level or in public–private partnerships organizations that may be partially funded by local regional state or federal tax money these economic development organizations function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth there are numerous other organizations whose primary function is not economic development work in partnership with economic developers they include the news media foundations utilities schools health care providers faithbased organizations and colleges universities and other education or research institutions international economic development council with more than 20000 professional economic developers employed world wide in this highly specialized industry the international economic development council iedc headquartered in washington d c is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping economic developers do their job more effectively and raising the profile of the profession with over 4500 members across the us and internationally serving exclusively the economic development community iedc membership represents the entire range of the profession ranging from regional state local rural urban and international economic development organizations as well as chambers of commerce technology development agencies utility companies educational institutions consultants and redevelopment authorities many individual states also have associations comprising economic development professionals who work closely with iedc development indicators and indices there are various types of macroeconomic and sociocultural indicators or metrics used by economists and geographers to assess the relative economic advancement of a given region or nation the world banks world development indicators are compiled annually from officiallyrecognized international sources and include national regional and global estimates gdp per capita income distribution literacy and education access to healthcare social security and pensions modern transportation european development economists have argued that the existence of modern transportation networks notably highspeed rail infrastructure constitutes a significant indicator of a country’s economic advancement this perspective is illustrated notably through the basic rail transportation infrastructure index known as brti index 10 community competition one unintended consequence of economic development is the intense competition between communities states and nations for new economic development projects in todays globalized world with the struggle to attract and retain business competition is further intensified by the use of many variations of economic incentives to the potential business such as tax incentives investment capital donated land utility rate discounts and many others iedc places significant attention on the various activities undertaken by economic development organizations to help them compete and sustain vibrant communities additionally the use of community profiling tools and database templates to measure community assets versus other communities is also an important aspect of economic development job creation economic output and increase in taxable basis are the most common measurement tools when considering measurement too much emphasis has been placed on economic developers for not creating jobs however the reality is that economic developers do not typically create jobs but facilitate the process for existing businesses and startups to do so therefore the economic developer must make sure that there are sufficient economic development programs in place to assist the businesses achieve their goals those types of programs are usually policycreated and can be local regional statewide and national in nature references statistics on the growth of the global gross domestic product gdp from 2003 to
