brain disorders image collection take the epilepsy seizure disorder quiz indicationsparenteral dilantin is indicated for the treatment of generalized tonicclonic status epilepticus and prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery intravenous dilantin can also be substituted as shortterm use for oral phenytoin  parenteral dilantin should be used only when oral dilantin administration is not possible see dosage and administration and warnings and precautions  dosage and administrationgeneral dosing information because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults in pediatric patients the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mgkgmin or 50 mg per minute whichever is slower as nonemergency therapy dilantin should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous dilantin oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous dilantin reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed because of the risk of local toxicity intravenous dilantin should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a largegauge catheter prior to the administration the patency of the intravenous iv catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline each injection of parenteral dilantin should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution dilantin can be given diluted with normal saline the addition of parenteral dilantin to dextrose and dextrosecontaining solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation treatment with dilantin can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion loading dose a loading dose of parenteral dilantin should be injected slowly not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mgkgmin or 50 mg per minute whichever is slower in pediatric patients infusion for infusion administration parenteral dilantin should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of dilantin in the solution no less than 5 mgm l administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated an inline filter 022 to 055 microns should be used parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution or container permit the diluted infusion mixture dilantin plus normal saline should not be refrigerated if the undiluted parenteral dilantin is refrigerated or frozen a precipitate might form this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature the product is still suitable for use a faint yellow coloration may develop however this has no effect on the potency of the solution for singledose only after opening any unused product should be discarded monitoring levels trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patients next scheduled dose peak levels indicate an individuals threshold for emergence of doserelated side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcgm l unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcgm l although some mild cases of tonicclonic  grand mal epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease or in those with hypoalbuminemia the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant see nonemergent loading and maintenance dosing  status epilepticus in adults a loading dose of 10 to 15 mgkg should be administered slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70kg patient the loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours in the pediatric population a loading dose of 15 to 20 mgkg of dilantin intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcgm l unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcgm l the drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mgkgmin or 50 mg per minute whichever is slower continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential the patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using dilantin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage other measures including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam or an intravenous shortacting barbiturate will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of dilantin if administration of parenteral dilantin does not terminate seizures the use of other anticonvulsants intravenous barbiturates general anesthesia and other appropriate measures should be considered intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours nonemergent loading and maintenance dosing because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous dilantin oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible in adults a loading dose of 10 to 15 mgkg should be administered slowly the rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mgkgmin or 50 mg per minute whichever is slower in pediatric patients slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram blood pressure and respiratory function is essential the loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous dilantin every 6 to 8 hours ordinarily dilantin should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis abscess formation and erratic absorption if intramuscular administration is required compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels an intramuscular dose 50 greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels when returned to oral administration the dose should be reduced by 50 of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected parenteral substitution for oral phenytoin therapy when treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible iv dilantin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose dilantin capsules are approximately 90 bioavailable by the oral route phenytoin is 100 bioavailable by the iv route for this reason serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when iv phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy the rate of administration for iv dilantin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mgkgmin or 50 mg per minute whichever is slower in pediatric patients when intramuscular administration may be required a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow continuing im absorption to minimize toxic symptoms see clinical pharmacology  serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form dilantin extended capsules and parenteral dilantin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin the free acid form of phenytoin is used in dilantin125 suspension and dilantin infatabs because there is approximately an 8 increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa dosing in patients with renal or hepatic impairment or hypoalbuminemia because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease or in those with hypoalbuminemia the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients dosing in geriatrics phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required see clinical pharmacology  dosing during pregnancy decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy and the dilantin dosage should be adjusted as necessary postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated see use in specific populations  because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction dosing in pediatrics a loading dose of 15 to 20 mgkg of dilantin intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcgm l unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcgm l the drug should be

of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate as nonemergency therapy dilantin should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous dilantin oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous dilantin reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed withdrawal precipitated seizure status epilepticus antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency including status epilepticus when in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction discontinuation or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises this should be done gradually however in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary in this case alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class serious dermatologic reactions serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis ten and stevensjohnson syndrome  sjs  have been reported with phenytoin treatment the onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days but can occur later dilantin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash unless the rash is clearly not drugrelated if signs or symptoms suggest sjsten use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered if a rash occurs the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms dress see drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms dressmultiorgan hypersensitivity  studies in patients of chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing sjsten and the presence of hla b1502 an inherited allelic variant of the hla b gene in patients using carbamazepine limited evidence suggests that hlab1502 may be a risk factor for the development of sjsten in patients of asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with sjsten including phenytoin consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for hlab1502 the use of hlab1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management the role of other possible factors in the development of

swelling in association with other organ system involvement such as hepatitis nephritis hematological abnormalities myocarditis or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection eosinophilia is often present because this disorder is variable in its expression other organ systems not noted here may be involved it is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity such as fever or lymphadenopathy may be present even though rash is not evident if such signs or symptoms are present the patient should be evaluated immediately dilantin should be discontinued if an

days after injection although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies skin grafting and in rare cases amputation because of the risk of local toxicity intravenous dilantin should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a largegauge catheter prior to the administration the patency of the iv catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline each injection of parenteral dilantin should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to

hypersensitivity to phenytoin its inactive ingredients or other hydantoins see warnings and precautions  sinus bradycardia sino atrial block second and third degree av block and adamsstokes syndrome because of the effect of parenteral phenytoin on ventricular automaticity a history of prior acute hepatotoxicity attributable to phenytoin see warnings and precautions  coadministration with delavirdine because of the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors clinical pharmacology epilepsy slideshow brain disorders image collection take the epilepsy seizure disorder quiz clinical pharmacologymechanism of action the precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltagedependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained highfrequency neuronal discharges pharmacokinetics absorption a fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration the drop is caused by slower absorption as compared to oral administration because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of dilantin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly however the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed as determined by urinary excretion of 5 phydroxyphenyl5phenylhydantoin hpph the principal metabolite as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood as phenytoin is highly protein bound free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal a shortterm one week study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the dilantin im dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose to avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots it is recommended that for the first week back on oral dilantin the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose onethird of the im dose experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcgm l unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcgm l distribution phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement elimination the serum halflife in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours metabolism phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 enzymes cyp2c9 and cyp2c19 excretion most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but more importantly by tubular secretion specific populations age geriatric population phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age 20 less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients lower or less frequent dosing may be required see dosage and administration  sexrace gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics renal or hepatic impairment increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported pregnancy it has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of prepregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery drug interaction studies phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 enzymes cyp2c9 and cyp2c19 phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drugmetabolizing enzymes

not to discontinue use of dilantin without consulting with their healthcare provider dilantin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus see warnings and precautions  potential signs of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms dress and other systemic reactions advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic dermatologic  hypersensitivity or hepatic reactions these symptoms may include but are not limited to fever sore throat rash ulcers in the mouth easy bruising lymphadenopathy facial swelling and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage and in the case of liver reactions anorexia nauseavomiting or jaundice advise the patient that because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician in addition advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use see warnings and precautions  effects of alcohol use and other drugs and overthecounter drug interactions caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physicians advice see warnings and precautions and drug interactions  inform patients that certain overthecounter medications eg cimetidine and omeprazole  vitamins eg

precautions  gingival hyperplasia advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications neurologic effects counsel patients that dilantin may cause dizziness gait disturbance decreased coordination and somnolence  advise patients taking dilantin not to drive operate complex machinery or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with dilantin use in pregnancy inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of dilantin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm including an increased risk for cleft lip andor cleft palate oral clefts cardiac defects dysmorphic skull and facial features nail and digit hypoplasia growth abnormalities including microcephaly  and cognitive deficits when appropriate counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using dilantin keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy see
