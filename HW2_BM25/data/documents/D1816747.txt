surgery lapa lipid tests lipid tests follow citydatacom founder on our forum or lech mazur definition lipid tests are routinely performed on plasma which is the liquid part of blood without the blood cells lipids themselves are a group of organic compounds that are greasy and cannot be dissolved in water although they can be dissolved in alcohol lipid tests include measurements of total cholesterol triglycerides highdensity lipoprotein hdl cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein ldl cholesterol lipid tests may also be performed on amniotic fluid which is the fluid that surrounds the fetus during pregnancy prenatal lipid tests include tests for lecithin and other pulmonary lung surfactants that cover the air spaces in the lungs with a thin film purpose blood tests the purpose of blood lipid testing is to determine whether abnormally high or low concentrations of a specific lipid are present low levels of cholesterol are associated with liver failure and inherited disorders of cholesterol production cholesterol is a primary component of the plaques that form in atherosclerosis and is therefore the major risk factor for the rapid progression of coronary artery disease cad high blood cholesterol may be inherited or result from such other conditions as biliary obstruction diabetes mellitus hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome in addition cholesterol levels may be increased in persons who eat foods that are rich in saturated fats and cholesterol and who lead a sedentary lifestyle low levels of triglyceride are seen in persons with malnutrition or malabsorption increased levels are associated with diabetes mellitus hypothyroidism pancreatitis glycogen storage diseases and estrogens diets rich in either carbohydrates or fats may cause elevated triglyceride levels in some persons although triglycerides are not a component of the plaque associated with atherosclerosis they increase the viscosity thickness of the blood and promote obesity which can contribute to coronary disease the majority of cholesterol and triglyceride testing is performed to screen persons at increased risk of coronary artery disease amniotic fluid tests lipid tests are performed on amniotic fluid to determine the maturity of the fetal lungs these tests are performed prior to delivery to ensure that there is sufficient pulmonary surfactant to prevent collapse of the lungs when the baby exhales breathes out description cholesterol screening can be performed with or without fasting but it should include tests of total and hdl cholesterol levels the frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the patients risk of developing cad adults over 20 with total cholesterol levels below 200 mgd l should be tested once every five years people with higher levels should be tested for ldl cholesterol levels and tested at least once per year thereafter if their ldl cholesterol is 130 mgd l or higher the national cholesterol education program ncep suggests further evaluation when the patient has any of the symptoms of cad or if she or he has two or more of the following risk factors for cadhigh blood pressurehistory of cigarette smokingdiabeteslow hdl levelsfamily history of cadage over 45 years men or 55 years womenmeasurements of cholesterol and triglyceride levels are routinely performed in all patients measurement of pulmonary surfactants lecithin is the principal pulmonary surfactant secreted by the alveolar cells of the lung lecithin and the other surfactants prevent collapse of the air sacs when the baby exhales during the first half of gestation the levels of lecithin and another lipid known as sphingomyelin in the amniotic fluid are approximately equal during the second half of pregnancy however lecithin production increases while the sphingomyelin level remains constant infants born prematurely may suffer from respiratory distress syndrome rds because the levels of pulmonary surfactant in their lungs are insufficient to prevent collapse of the air sacs tests for rds are called fetal lung maturity flm tests the reference method for determining fetal lung maturity is the ratio between lecithin and sphingomyelin in the amniotic fluid or the ls ratio precautions tests for triglycerides and ldl cholesterol must be performed following a 12hour fast acute illness high fever starvation or recent surgery lowers the blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels if possible patients should also stop taking any medications that may affect the accuracy of the test amniotic fluid is collected by a process called amniocentesis  this procedure is usually performed after the 30th week of gestation to evaluate the maturity of the babys lungs a miscarriage spontaneous abortion may occur as a consequence of this procedure although its overall incidence following amniocentesis is less than 1 possible complications of amniocentesis include premature labor and placental bleeding the fluid that is withdrawn may be contaminated with blood or meconium a darkgreen material in the intestines of a fetus which may interfere with some fetal lung maturity tests preparation patients who are scheduled for a lipid profile test should fast except for water for 12 to 14 hours before the blood sample is drawn if the patients ldl cholesterol is to be measured he or she should also avoid alcohol for 24 hours before the test when possible patients should also stop taking any medications that may affect the accuracy of the test results these drugs include corticosteroids  estrogen or androgens oral contraceptives some diuretics  antipsychotic medications including haloperidol some antibiotics  and niacin antilipemics are drugs that lower the concentration of fatty substances in the blood when these medications are taken by the patient blood testing may be done frequently to evaluate liver function as well as lipid levels aftercare aftercare following blood lipid tests includes routine care of the skin around the needle puncture most patients have no aftereffects but some may have a small bruise or swelling a washcloth soaked in warm water usually relieves any discomfort in addition the patient can resume taking any prescription medications that were discontinued before the test care after amniocentesis requires that the clinician monitor the patient for any signs of infection or possible injury to the fetus some things to look for are fever vaginal bleeding or vaginal discharge the patient may feel sick and there may be some cramping she should be advised to rest and avoid strenuous activity if the mother appears to be going into labor she should be given supportive care she may be given medications known as tocolytic agents to prevent the premature birth of the baby risks the primary risk to the patient from blood tests of lipid levels is a mild stinging or burning sensation during the venipuncture with minor swelling or bruising afterward although amniocentesis is much safer in the third trimester and is less risky when it is performed with the guidance of ultrasound technology does present a risk of miscarriage and fetal injury the mother should be monitored for any signs of bleeding infection or impending labor results the normal values for serum lipids depend on the patients age sex and race normal values for people in western countries are usually given as 140–220 mgd l for total cholesterol in adults although as many as 5 of the population have a total cholesterol higher than 300 mgd l among asians the figures are about 20 lower as a rule both total and ldl cholesterol levels rise as people get older normal values for hdl cholesterol are also age and sexdependent the range for males between 20 and 29 years is approximately 30–63 mgd l for females of the same age group it is 33–83 mgd l normal values for fasting triglycerides are also age and sexdependent the reference range for adult males 20 to 29 years is 45–200 mgd l for females of the same age group it is 37–144 mgd l as with cholesterol the normal range rises with age since a persons diet and lifestyle affect normal values which are determined by the interval between the 5th and 95th percentile of the group it is more helpful to evaluate cholesterol and triglycerides from the perspective of desirable plasma levels the desirable values defined by the nation cholesterol education program ncep in 2001 are as follows total cholesterol less than 200 mgd l 200–239 mgd l is considered borderline high and greater than 240 mgd l is high hdl cholesterol less than 40mgd l is low ldl cholesterol less than 100 mgd l is optimal nearoptimal is 100–129 mgd l borderline high is 130159 mgd l high is 160–189 mgd l and very high is any value over 190 mgd l total cholesterol hdl ratio under 40 in males 38 in females fetal lung maturity tests low levels of surfactant in amniotic fluid are denoted by an ls ratio lower than 20 or a lecithin level lower than or equal to 010 mgd l lung development can be delayed in premature births and in babies whose mothers have diabetes patient education nurses should explain the results of abnormal blood lipid tests to patients and advise them on lifestyle changes patient education is important in fetal lung maturity testing the situation faced by the expectant parents may be very
