gourd growing season photo courtesy of helen olena few if any gourd growers in the northeast can sustain a farm on gourds alone but for those looking to expand or diversify operations there could be a profitable niche market for craftready gourds while most are tightlipped with their gourd growing tips and secrets others like those associated with the pennsylvania gourd society pags who depend on successful crops to support their cottage craft industries are more open meadowbrook farms gourd crop at the end of its season photo courtesy of helen olena helen olena a master gardener from mohnton pa who takes a scientific approach to gourd growing is one of the most helpful and advanced growers in the region she’s written a reoccurring feature called “focus on growing” for the pags’ quarterly newsletter gourd vibrations since the newsletter’s inception in 2005 she’s using heattreated seeds to reduce pathogen transfer and she has a notill patch that’s three years in the making for which she’s using past cover crops as mulch she may even venture into the world of mycorrhizae beneficial organisms that aid plants in the uptake of nutrients gourds in the midst of the growing season photos courtesy of bonnie adams unless otherwise noted a larger grower eli smucker’s gourd farm in kinzers pa where every june the pags hosts its annual gourd fest has recently changed some of his gourd growing practices to incorporate olena’s advice for example he used to plant direct seed in the spring but now he starts some of his plants indoors he didn’t originally handpollinate but he does now “i’m not claiming it was only advice from me” olena says “he well may have heard this same advice from others”olena a former biology teacher and environmental educator began growing gourds in 2002 as a retirement hobby she grows about 1000 gourds on an average of 25 plants a season and opened a small business in 2005 selling craftready gourds to artists and hobbyists she has taught pags gourd growing classes and has also taught at longwood gardens in kennett square pa how to grow gourds gourds need a 16 to 18week 112 to 126day growing season generally from the middle of may to late september for the majority of the crop to successfully dry gourds are not hardy plants so that may necessitate starting plants indoors as olena does in midapril she germinates her seeds between damp paper towels on covered ceramic plates suspended over seedling heat mats “this way in a matter of a few days growers know what will germinate and what won’t” she says “this allows you time to restart additional seeds without missing too much time”gourds—there are as many as 150 varieties with names like long handle dipper chinese bottle canteen and kettle—prefer not to have their roots disturbed so use individual pots and avoid undivided flats where the roots might tangle when olena’s seeds germinate she transfers them to 5inchtall pots a halfhour before planting she dampens the soilless mix thoroughly then fills the pots to 75 inch from the top and lays two or three seeds on the mix covering with additional soilless mix about two to three times the thickness of the seed she presses down gently then waters gently by misting “the seeds will germinate more quickly if kept warm say about 75 to 85 degrees” says olena who has written a planting primer on the pags web site  wwwpagourdsocietyorg  “move them to a light source as soon as the seedlings emerge if your plants become ‘leggy’ they are not getting enough light”the seedlings are dicotyledonous meaning there are already two leaves within each seed these are whitish when they emerge then quickly turn green the next leaves are true leaves then fertilization can begin dilute it as much as 50 percent and fertilize every two weeks gradually increasing the concentration until it’s as recommended switch to a fertilizer without nitrate once the vines begin to blossom for one seedling per pot thin the weaker seedlings by cutting them pulling may disrupt the other seedling’s roots once there are four leaves after about two weeks acclimate the plants to the outdoors by increasing halfhour increments each day in a sheltered spot “growers should keep tabs on the soil temperature in the spring” olena says “i wait to plant until the soil temperature is at least 60 degrees three days in a row first thing in the morning in zone 6 this is usually the end of may”she also recommends having the soil in the intended patch tested then amended as necessary she first tills as early as march or whenever the soil is workable “you cannot just fertilize the area and hope for the best” she says “if the p h soil acidity or alkalinity isn’t right the nutrients may be unavailable to the plant”plant in black plastic to warm the soil and take care to cover the young plants on cooler nights space the young gourd plants anywhere from 2 to 7 feet apart depending on trellis use gourds may also grow on fences but only in full sun and close to a watering source mulch with straw if the plants are not trellised gourd plants need 14 to 16 hours of light per day if your gourd plants are leggy and weakstemmed once in the ground the plant’s earlymorning water pressure prephotosynthesis may cause the stem to split open“you may notice once the plant has about 12 true leaves that it appears to rest” olena cautions “growth is happening underground to establish the root system”the male flowers will appear first they are on the main vine the flowers of hardshelled gourds blossom in the evening and are white ginger summit in her book “gourds in your garden” recommends nipping the end of the vines when they grow to about 10 feet long or they reach the top of a trellis to keep each plant a manageable size and encourage lateral branches where the female flowers—and future gourds—develop“if you notice these tiny gourdlike growths but they don’t seem to be growing pollination might be a problem” olena says “you can always remove the male flowers just after they open and tap and brush them over the female flowers”gourds should get a minimum of 1 inch of rainfall a week throughout the growing season it’s normal for the leaves to wilt in the hottest part of the day but they should recover by evening or they need more water“previous advice to nip young gourds off the vine in august because of the lack of time to mature is now only true for larger gourd types” olena says “smaller gourds can still mature if the fruit set doesn’t occur until midaugust or so because killing frosts are generally later now”in september the vine’s productive stages wind down the first frost kills the vines but allow the gourds to remain in place until the stem that connects the gourds to the vine is brown and dried some growers leave gourds outside until after the first snow others harvest and move them into a shed or barn for drying and cleaning smucker lets his crop overwinter before harvesting in midapril then he tills the ground and repeats the process rotating his gourd fields with his corn and hay tips and best practice gourd growing sites should be rotated away from cucurbits even peppers and tomatoes allowing two years of noncucurbits before gourds are planted again olena advises never bring gourds into the house to dry the thin outer epithelium gets moldy naturally therefore it’s important to protect yourself from mold spores when storing and cleaning gourds“a small number of gourd plants when carefully tended watered and handpollinated can be more productive than acres of gourds cared for more casually” olena says smucker who farms 50 acres in all has a 10acre gourd plot he’s gradually augmented an acre at a time the last three or four years he’s built his crop and clientele which is strictly the craft market one he says is expanding and to a lesser extent a fall decorative market he sells direct to an established list shipping and selling from the farm most of the success and failures result from trial and error says smucker who uses his own seeds as well as those of several seed houses “if you’re a farmer it’s not that hard” he says the author has been
