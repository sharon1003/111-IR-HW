strep is the cause a rapid strep test or a throat culture is needed a doctor cannot tell if you have strep throat just by looking at the throat a rapid strep test involves swabbing the throat and running a test on the swab to quickly see if group a strep is causing the illness if the test is positive doctors can prescribe antibiotics medicine that kills bacteria in the body if the rapid strep
