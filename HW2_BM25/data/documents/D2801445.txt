defibrillatorsby chris woodford last updated june 29 2017 c harging five hundred clear weve all watched it happen on er dozens and dozens of times but its still relatively uncommon to see the same thing in real life when someone collapses with a cardiac arrest their heart can go into a kind of quivering limbo called fibrillation one of the most effective ways to get it going again is with a sudden powerful electric shock—and thats the lifesaving job a defibrillator does equipment like this used to require hours of training but now portable fully automatic defibrillators are being installed in public places so even amateur firstaiders can administer them with minimal instruction lets take a closer look at how these handy little gadgets workphoto ready for action you cant save a life with a defibrillator if there isnt one around to use thats why many more of these units are now popping up in public places this is a wallmounted unit on a railroad station in england what happens in a cardiac arrest photo conventional cpr heart massage and artificial respiration can be invaluable but may not be enough to save a patient without defibrillation photo by suzanne m day you might not think of yourself as having lots of muscles but theres one superpowerful muscle in your body you absolutely depend on the tireless blood pump in your heart if your heart stops beating properly and blood stops flowing your brain starts to lose its oxygen supply and you can die within five minutes thats why people who suffer cardiac arrest when their heart stops or goes into a dangerously abnormal rhythm need emergency medical treatment cpr cardiopulmonary resuscitation can help maintain the flow of oxygen to the brain but getting the heart restarted and working normally often requires defibrillation with an electric shock what is a defibrillator as the name suggests defibrillation stops fibrillation  the useless trembling that a persons heart muscles can adopt during a cardiac arrest simply speaking a defibrillator works by using a moderately high voltage something like 200–1000 volts to pass an electric current through the heart so its shocked into working normally again the patients heart receives roughly 300 joules of electrical energy about as much as a 100 watt incandescent lamp uses in three seconds the kind of defibrillator you see on tv consists of an electric supply unit and two metal electrodes called paddles that are pressed very firmly to the patients chest using insulating plastic handles so the person using them doesnt get a shock too the important thing is getting the current to flow through the heart so where the paddles are applied is crucial one way of applying them is to put one paddle above and to the left of the heart and the other slightly beneath and to the right another method involves placing one paddle on the front of the body and the other round the back in order for the electric current to flow properly and to reduce the risk of skin burns the electrodes have to be applied close enough together they must also make good electrical contact with the skin so a solid or liquid conducting gel is usually applied to the patients chest first in units designed to be used by lesstrained people in public places sticky selfadhesive electrode pads are often used instead of paddles for safety and simplicity once the pads are stuck on the operator can stand well clear of the patients body and that reduces the risk of their getting an electric shock photo two different ways of applying the charge 1 conventional

increases the more quickly defibrillation is used data from a study of 1732 cases in north carolina by c m hansen et al 2015 you might have noticed that there are lots more defibrillators in public places than there used to be—and there have been calls for them to be as commonplace as fire extinguishers the reason is simple if someone collapses with a cardiac arrest immediate defibrillation even by an untrained bystander following stepbystep instructions dramatically increases the chance of survival compared to delayed defibrillation when the emergency medical services eventually arrive a 2014 australian study found the survival rate to be 45 percent compared to 31 percent very favorable outcomes have also been found in studies in osaka japan  los angeles california  and elsewhere types of defibrillators photo a portable external defibrillator packed away in an ambulance photo by charles larkin sr courtesy of us air force the units youre likely to see in railroad stations and other public areas are called automated external defibrillators aeds and theyre designed to be used with little or no training they have selfadhesive electrode pads and a builtin computer that automatically analyzes the patients heart rhythm to figure out whether a shock will help them defibrillation doesnt work if the heart has stopped beating altogether and if so what level of shock is appropriate the units you see in tv hospitals and ambulances that feature handheld paddles and gel applied to the skin are usually manual external defibrillators with these devices the doctors nurses or paramedics have to figure out themselves whether defibrillation will help and also what shock voltage or energy level to use semiautomated defibrillators can work either automatically or in a manual override mode if the doctor prefers patients who suffer regular problems with their heart rhythm sometimes have an internal defibrillator permanently implanted into their chest a bit like a pacemaker or worn on the surface of their skin under their clothes units like this constantly monitor the heart rhythm and deliver a shock whenever its needed
