engage the integrated design processthe wbdg aesthetics subcommittee updated 10172016overview within this page overview emerging issues additional resources the broad obligations and opportunities of architecture were summarized by the ancient roman architect vitruvius in the prescription that buildings should provide commodity firmness and delight commodity addresses the spatial and functional utility of a building firmness addresses the buildings ability to resist natural forces starting with gravity delight relates to the sensory and associative pleasures buildings can provide—their meaning when the forms of architecture were limited by materials and construction methods aesthetic principles were narrowly defined by the successors to vitruvius in the modern era many more forms are possible and the selection or invention of those forms can give a much wider range of meaning choosing traditional forms is of course possible and can follow or violate the principles of the many styles of architecture which followed roman classicism selection of such a style shows an intention of continuity with the life and buildings of the period selected and misinterpretation of principles can be seen as exercising bad taste modern architecture proposed a break with stylistic traditions and invented what have become new ones—some derived from precedent movements like the bauhaus others from the work of influential architects like frank lloyd wright le corbusier and mies van der rohe others found possibilities in vernacular architecture construction methods or abstract new forms the selection of specific forms conveys meaning to us whatever choice is made a glass building can for example mean transparency and honesty while an opaque building means privacy and concealment tall buildings have always been expressions of power colorful buildings can mean levity and whimsy the buildings activities can be shown or concealed as can the means by which the building operates like structure and mechanical systems new developments in architectural tools including sustainable design the emergence of building science and building information modeling bim all lead to new insights in the design and construction processes with aesthetics often revisited as necessity is the origin of invention scarcity can also inspire with a lack of quality large timbers for framing coupled with rising costs for steel and concrete new production techniques developed around laminating timbers together in large plates the crosslaminated timber clt framing system as it is known increased in both popularity and acceptance as an alternative to traditional methods of construction the impact on aesthetics can be seen in the large expanse and planes of wood layers that convey strength and delight

response to this openness designers agree that aesthetically successful architecture comes from an integrated approach by correctly formulating a projects purpose seeking inspiration in programmatic requirements and engaging in teamwide design reviews an architect most effectively arrives at a solution that is as delightful as it is costeffective securesafe sustainable accessible and functionaloperational in much of contemporary architecture the notion of expressive exteriors becomes tempered by new materials such as high performing glass that conveys literal openness in an age of digital communication via the internet or alternative roofing technologies that can extend the livable areas to the top of buildings proving a green space that can hold storm water and offer new amenities returning to vitruvius one can conclude that his three standards of architecture reinforce one another good architecture achieves useful humane and economical results and a building expresses those qualities regardless of style a fully integrated building promises to be durable in way that vitruvius may not have envisioned it will inspire a community to find ways to use it even when the original program is no longer relevant with an eye to integration an architect makes aesthetic decisions in full collaboration with the client building users other consultants and the public therefore it is important for the client and building users to be well informed about the possibilities of architecture they can assist the design team in conceiving a building that meets the most needs one way to become acquainted with the possibilities of an architectural commission is to study a number of buildings of the same type in addition this branch of the wbdg will help those not familiar with architectural design terminology to understand the basic process techniques and language by which architectural concepts become reality understanding the language and elements of design architects use specific terminology to describe fundamental elements of a building and to assess its design quality a clients fluency with this vocabulary improves the architects application of the elements it represents engage the integrated design process an integrated design process interlaces the multiple disciplines that inform a building a series of steps can provide an orderly flow to this dialogue and the full and constructive participation of all members of the design and delivery team will ensure the best results the design awards programs of professional societies the federal
