stadium received its first approval 12 the initial agreement known as a term sheet outlines some of the basic finance construction and operating commitments for baseball stadium 12 the sarasota county

smith stadium in sarasota without raising the tax itself 13the mechanism behind the change is perhaps best understood by imagining the 5 percent tax as five pennies levied on every dollar spent on hotel stays or shortterm rentals 13 each of those “pennies” are divided and distributed to fund certain projects and the tax raises about 20 million a year 13 by shifting the assignments of those “pennies” the county will now dedicate about 15 percent of the annual collections — estimated at 33 million — to pay back borrowing for both the braves and ed smith stadiums plus capital improvement
