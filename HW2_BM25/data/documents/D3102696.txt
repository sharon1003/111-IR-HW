public schools may discipline pupils for their online speech spoken offcampus a federal appeals court ruled monday in two longrunning cases testing student speech in the online world however in the cases decided monday the 3rd u s circuit court of appeals said pennsylvania school districts overreacted and breached the first amendment rights of two students by disciplining them for mocking their principals online using computers that were off the campus the philadelphiabased appellate court cautioned that not all offcampus student speech was protected it based that conclusion on a 1969 supreme court ruling that held student expression may not be suppressed unless school officials reasonably conclude that it will materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school in that landmark case the supreme court said students had a first amendment right to wear black armbands to protest the vietnam war but that precedent which addressed oncampus speech is now being applied to students offcampus online speech four decades later â€“ a conclusion that some members of the court noted was wrong the u s supreme court meanwhile has not squarely addressed the studentspeech issue as it applies to the digital world and mondays decisions might give the justices fodder to do so in one of the cases decided monday the appeals court reversed itself from a year ago and said the school went too far in suspending for 10 days a 14yearold junior high student she mocked her principal with a fake my space profile the 2007 profile insinuated the principal was a sex addict and pedophile in the same case last year the 3rd circuit applied the 1969 supreme court precedent and used it against the student identified in court documents as j s the 3rd circuit had noted that teachers in the blue mountain school district complained that the profile disrupted the classroom because students were talking about the profile rather than paying attention in class we decline to say that simply because the disruption to the learning environment originates from a computer located off campus the school should be left powerless pdf to discipline the student the threejudge circuit panel had written a year ago fast forward to monday the court which had vacated that decision so it could rehear the case en banc with 14 judges ruled 86 that there is no dispute that j ss speech did not cause a substantial disruption in the school  pdf judge michael chagares wrote the dissent said the majority applied correct precedent but reached the wrong conclusion while i agree with the majoritys apparent adoption of the rule that offcampus student speech can rise to the level of a substantial disruption i disagree with the courts application of that rule to the facts of this case the majority misconstrues the facts in doing so it allows a student to target a school official and his family with malicious and unfounded accusations about their character in vulgar obscene and personal language judge michael fisher wrote for the dissent five judges wrote separately that the court should abandon the 1969 precedent tinker v des moines independent community school district because it does not pertain to online speech in the other case decided monday which was also a rehearing of different yearold ruling the court upheld its previous threejudge decision that hermitage school district in pennsylvania breached the first amendment rights of a senior the student justin layshock was suspended for 10 days for creating a mock profile of his principal on my space which said he took drugs and kept beer at his desk the court ruling 140 said we need not now define the precise parameters of when the arm of authority can reach beyond the schoolhouse gate because as we noted earlier the district court found that justins conduct did not disrupt the school  pdfphoto euthmanflickr see also rulings leave online student speech rights unresolved court vacates online studentspeech rulings students facebook tirade against teacher is protected speech student who created facebook group critical of teacher sues court cyberbullying threats are not protected speech student sentenced to 15 years for you tube terror video progay sites filtered from tennessee students
