history connersville is named for settler john conner older brother of william conner an early indiana settler and politician there was also at least through 1795 connerstown a small shawnee village near lancaster ohio named for johns father richard conner whitewater valley and preeuropean inhabitants  editthe whitewater river valley was created by the late wisconsin glaciation ending 13600 years ago fayette county was at the southern fringe of the glaciation at that time the ice age was punctuated by several prolonged warm periods during which the glaciers disappeared entirely from the temperate latitudes and a climate similar to today or even warmer prevailed the flood waters produced resulted in lakes breaching of the lakes resulted in rivers and streams carving the hills and valleys we see today in the northwest territory during the latter half of the 18th century the miami indians were dominant in the region but the potawatomi and shawnee had a significant presence delaware indians displaced from their eastern homelands by european settlement migrated west and settled along the forks of the whitewater river the geological aspects of the whitewater river valley contributed to early settlement after defeat of the delaware indians by gen anthony wayne at fallen timbers in 1794 followed on august 3 1795 by the treaty of greenville ohio ceding most of ohio and a sliver of southeastern indiana to the united states the valley running south and southeasterly from east central indiana to the ohio river valley provided a convenient conduit for migration through fort washington cincinnati from points east settlements on the ohio river and settlers from kentucky to northern and central indiana territory squatters engaged in agriculture and trading were occupying federal lands well before land sales in indiana territory began in 1801 an indian trail paralleled the river from the ohio valley northward to the forks then went along the east fork to eli creek thence taking a northwesterly direction passing through what was later connersville and then on to the delaware villages strung along the white river from north of presentday indianapolis to modern muncie conners post  editjohn conner brother william and others arrived in the whitewater valley in 1802 establishing a fur trading post in an unpopulated area near what was later to become

the trading post known as conners post was relocated 20 miles 32 km north on the whitewater river junction with an indian trail between the ohio river 70 miles 110 km to the southeast and hunting grounds to the north according to research by j l heineman the trading post was located in the middle of what is now eastern ave at the west end of charles st at that time the region was inhabited by delaware indians in 1809 the famous from the indian viewpoint infamous treaty of fort wayne was signed by the terms of which the land locally known as the twelve mile purchase was ceded by the indians to the government this tract included a strip twelve miles 19 km in width lying west of the 1795 greenville treaty line which ran from the midpoint of the indianaohio border southwest to the ohio river cutting off a thin wedge of southeastern indiana the strip included most of fayette county except the extreme northern portion part of later  new purchase  sales of public land by the united
