you are here home  geyser heatpumps geyser heatpumps hi temp geyser heatpump the most energy efficient way to heat water todayheating geyser water is typically the largest cost of energy in home today an average south african family will spend r5000 or more to heat water every year the hi temp geyser heatpump is a heat pump that is designed specifically to heat your geyser water to 55’c using hardly any energy the hi temp geyser heatpump is connected to any existing electric gas oil or propane water geyser in any home or business it makes use of a renewable energy source – the ambient air temperature in a garage roof basement or utility room is drawn in through the condensor to heat the water the hi temp geyser heatpump is up to 370 efficient as compared to 6095 for traditional water heating systems this means that for every 1 unit of energy required to operate the hi temp geyser heatpump 37 units of energy are generated from the ambient air to heat the water in laymens terms this means for every r100 you spend on electricity you get r370 worth by using renewable energy source the electricity the heat pumps shown here are retrofitted to existing geysers and can heat 1 or 2 geysers in certain cases up to 3 geysers can be heated with one heat pump while kwikot geysers are recommended most geyser types can be used oil gas or propane usage is significantly reduced which means lower running costs fewer emissions smaller carbon footprint and a safer and healthier environment for all heating capacity 45 k wmaximum input power 11 k wnoise 49 d bmaximum water temp 5560
