son and the lord was born from the virgin mary she is also known as marry some people refer to her in different ways but anyways i think its about how people are singing this song worshiping god and jesus following the star to the manger were they find baby jesus in his bed of hay they sing bowing to the new born child as he is their king the only son of god himself in living flesh right before them they raise their hands singing still as the baby smiles soon growing up he had worshipers everywhere so many he couldnt count them all finally the day comes where he is hung onto a cross sacrificing his life for us all us being the foolish people we are today judging people for being them selfs and hurting people close to us he cleaned us of all our sins and so we made this song praising him the son of god marry and joseph we give him thanks the thanks we hope he hears as we sing this song for him up in heaven with his holly father god add your replyb  5brian gillow dec 25 2014 at 442 am im not christian but this beautiful song i believe handel the composer was inspired by god i dont know what god is but i do have a feeling that if jesus existed he was inspired too by this same force this song is so uplifting it is amazing such a simple song  yet so powerful the feel of it it burst out at you from the very beginning just slams away at you joy to the world the lord has come i do wish he would come back and save us from ourselves but i fear its just wishful thinking1 replyu  2unregistered dec 25 2016 at 516 pm the lord has come and established his kingdome in the
