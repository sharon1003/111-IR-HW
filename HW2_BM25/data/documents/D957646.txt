18 6 8heat pump sequence of operation  every electricalmechanical piece of equipment has a sequence of operation while some manufacturers of heat pumps vary slightly with their heat pump sequence of operation the overall sequence of operation for a heat pump is the same for most manufacturers so unless you have a special type of heat pump they are out there – the acadia heat pump is designed for extreme cold weather temperatures up north like canada the sequence of operation for your heating equipment should be very similar to what is described here this is the basic operation of a heat pump like you will find in conventional heat pumps heat pump sequence of operation trane heat pump in automatic operation on a call for heat the thermostat switch closes this energizes the compressor contactor and the blower motor in the air handler the compressor contactor closes and the compressor turns on along with the condenser fan motor the refrigerant inside the refrigeration circuit begins to flow the refrigerant in the condenser absorbs heat from the outside air the refrigerant is transferred indoors to the evaporator coil where the blower is energized the fan speed is typically slower for heating than it is for air conditioning so the blower inside the air handler most likely has a multispeed blower or an ecm blower motor and is controlled to a slower speed than when the air conditioning is on heat pump sequence of operation  industry differences there is only a slight difference in the operation if you own a rheem or a ruud heat pump system as the blower motor fan and the compressor contactor are energized so is the reversing valve all other manufacturers energize the reversing valve in the cooling mode the reason most manufacturers energize the reversing valve in the cooling mode is that if the valve fails they want the valve to fail to the heating cycle as heating is more important than cooling from the air conditioner heating the air the refrigerant passes through the evaporator coil while the blower is blowing air across the coil where the heat is transferred from the refrigerant and coil and into the air the air flows through the duct work and is delivered into the spaces via the diffusers the air recirculated and pulled back to the air handler through the return where the filter is located this process heats the air providing heat into your home or business the thermostat is located near the return when the thermostat senses the temperature is at the set point it breaks the switch inside the thermostat to turn off the heat the compressor contactor inside the condensing unit deenergizes and the compressor shut down along with the condenser fan motor the blower continues to run on a time delay and when the time expires the blower shuts down that is the operation without including the defrost cycle defrost cycle on colder nights when the heat pump runs for an extended period of time the heat pump will collect frost simply because it typically operates below the dew point and so the humidity will accumulate in the form of frost or ice on the condenser coils related link heat pump troubleshooting advice  delve deeper and learn more about hvac opens in a new windowthis ice needs to be defrosted regular readers who read the heat pump pages here at high performance hvac will know the defrost cycle method is typically on a timer when the heat pump runs for a specified time the defrost cycle will kick in and thaw out or defrost the frost or ice on the condenser coils the time interval in the defrost cycle is manually set by the hvac installation technician when the unit is installed and will vary from region to region heat pump sequence of operation  defrost and backup heating methods when the defrost cycle energizes the reversing valve switches mode to the airconditioning mode this switches the whole heat pump system into an air conditioner in the cooling mode this is necessary to defrost the condenser coils it is counteracted through heating strips by the defrost control the defrost control energizes the backup electric heat so the heat pump continues to provide heat this timed cycle ends after a certain amount of time as determined by the manufacturer of the heat pump everything switches back to normal heat pump mode there are also heat pumps that have gas or oil furnaces for the backup heat it works the same as with the heat strips described above except instead of electric heat strips providing the heat the gas or oil furnace provides the heat these systems are referred to in the hvac field as dual fuel systems and are considered more efficient than heat pumps with electric heat strips for backup heat heat pump troubleshooting if you are troubleshooting heat pump problems you will want to break things down into groups is it a control problem or is it a mechanical problem mechanical problems include refrigerations issues airflow issues and mechanical parts control problems include relays the heat pump thermostat and anything in the control circuitry of the system understanding the heat pump sequence of operation will help you identify the issue quicker therefore solving the

by 4 plus degrees when defrost cycle down it does go back to heating my question should the heat handler be putting out cold air at a high speed reply high performance hvac heating and coolingon february 12 2016 at 516 pm the answer is no but that is relative to what you have for cooling tonnage and the back up heat source in the air handler also there could be a problem with the heating inside the air handler call a professional to check it out remember there is high voltage inside the air handler and i never recommend making a repair yourself unless you have been trained in it replygrat on march 2 2016 at 146 am yes defrost means your unit is running in air conditioning mode to take the heat from your house to melt the ice on the outdoor unit however your auxiliary heat is supposed to come on to counteract the cooling of the defrost cycle what kind of auxiliary heat do you have reply don morse on november 10 2016 at 833 pm when in “heat” mode my 2001 ruud heat pump outdoor unit fan will not come on when the condenser comes on i get heat okay but i’m just worried about the fan not coming on the outdoor temp was 66 degrees and the inside thermostat was set to 73 degrees i also do not have the blue auxiliary light on at the thermostat so i assume that the unit is functioning properly should the outdoor unit fan come on when the condenser operates reply high performance hvacon november 12 2016 at 1002 am maybe you are catching the heat pump in defrost mode as many manufacturers shut the condenser fan motor off when the systems goes into defrost mode with a heat pump you could still have heat even if the condenser is not functioning the heat will come from the secondary source usually electric heat strips or a gas furnace if you have dual fuel however it is far cheaper in certain conditions to have the condenser provide heat for you it would not hurt to have a specialist look at it to make sure you don’t have a bad condenser fan motor or bad control board however i would check to make sure that the condenser fan motor issue you are describing is happening all the time or is only happening when it is in defrost most systems including ruud used a timed method for calling for defrost it depends on what the time interval was set to by the installer or start up guy when the system was installed most settings on defrost control boards are can be set to 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes or 120 minutes reply geoff duncan on january 17 2017 at 713 pm at the end of a heating cycle of my lennox heat pump system the compressor shuts off first and then the variable speed air handler spins up to full speed for about 20 seconds before spinning down to off this is extremely annoying as the system has run practically noiselessly for the cycle and then revs up at the end also creating a draft of lower temperature air i understand the principle of other systems i have experienced that run the air handler at the “same” speed at the end to expel all the warm air in the supply ducts before turning off but i can’t get anyone to tell me if the lennox system’s sequence of operation is supposed to behave the way it does or not all the technician says is “everything seems to be operating normally” how can i be sure reply high performance hvacon july 1 2017 at 117 pmyou will have to find a certified lennox dealer and ask for their lead tech sometimes they will answer your question on the phone but sometimes they will want to visit which will likely result in a service call you could also call lennox and ask for someone in the tech department and ask them the same question reply acmitchell on november 23 2017 at 325 am i have a rheem system and i had the blower motor replaced in july 2017 my question is should the system be running cool air when in heat mode last winter the system would come on when the temp in house reached the temp the thermostat was set to but now it just runs and runs and doesn’t shut off until i manually lower it by 2 degrees i have also programmed my thermostat to keep electric bill down but the settings are within reason 6972 degrees thank you reply high performance hvacon november 25 2017 at 1222 am sounds as if you could have another issue that needs to be looked at by a technician it should not just run and run unless the temperatures are extremely low and there is a high load on the system replyc clark on march 6 2018 at 500 pm why does anyone think that it’s better for a reversing valve to fail so you still have heat if your system is anyway done right you would still have your backupaux heat but in warm weather if your rv fails your cooling is lost and there is no backup for that i finally got it right when i switched to a rheem seems that the manufacturers could offer a choice of which type rv you would like depending on where you live reply high performance hvacon march 6 2018 at 738 pm because heat is far more important to survival than air conditioning in most cases it is how they also do it for commercial systems if anything fails it fails to heat reply wstavenger on march 30 2018 at 726 pm i have a 2014 trane xl14 dual fuel heat pump package system the unit works ok in heat mode but recently 80 degree day when i placed the thermostat in cooling mode the outside compressor stayed on for only 45 seconds the compressor and condenser fan quit but the blower continued to operate after about 2 minutes the unit tried to start again but tripped in about 10 seconds i powered everything down and then connected a multimeter in ac volt mode across the low coolant pressure switch i restarted the unit and observed 0 volts across the switch until the compressor electrical contactor deenergized at which time i observed 24 volts across the pressure switch i also noted 24 volts to the reversing solenoid coil resistance read good could the reversing solenoid be stuck causing the low coolant pressure switch to open and shutting down the unit or would a low freon charge cause the problem in cooling mode only as the unit still works in heating mode reply high performance hvacon april 4 2018 at 1114 pm sorry without looking at it myself i cannot answer your question one problem can cause several things not to work and yes a heat pump will heat in heating mode but not cool in cooling mode if you have a lowpressure problem with the refrigerant reply wstavengeron april 5 2018 at 815 am hello thanks for the reply it looks like the expansion valve is bad according to a technician that looked at the problem he put the unit in heat mode and said the gauge pressures “looked text book” and that the expansion valve is a main component when the unit is in ac mode the tech also said that if it gets below 30 degrees i should not use the heat pump because in the defrost mode the unit would switch into ac and would probably trip off again thanks for your replyreply submit a comment your email address will not be published required fields are
