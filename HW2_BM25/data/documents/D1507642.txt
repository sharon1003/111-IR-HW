holes the recipe for homemade ant killer is three parts sugar to one part borax this means that one cup of sugar can be used with ⅓ cup of borax mix these ingredients in a bowl to be sure all lumps are crushed and loosened add enough tap water to make the mixture thick and pasty without being runny around ¼ to ⅓ cup of water should be sufficient to attain this consistency using a fork or whisk stir the water into the mix and then add approximately ¼ cup of syrup to the mix this should create a thick goo which will be irresistible to any household ant once you have created your mix fill each container about halfway so that the yummy aroma will draw the ants right to it place the traps in strategic spots where you have determined ants may have found an entrance or exit around your house or
