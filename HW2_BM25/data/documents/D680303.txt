anxiety disorder amphetamineinduced bipolar disorder amphetamineinduced depressive disorder amphetamineinduced psychotic disorder amphetamineinduced sexual dysfunction amphetamineinduced sleep disorder amphetamine intoxication amphetamine intoxication delirium amphetamine withdrawal amphetamineinduced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder unspecified stimulantrelated disorder either prescription or illegally manufactured amphetamines can induce these disorders prescription amphetamines are used frequently in children and adolescents to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and they are the most commonly prescribed medications in children the dose of adderall xr dextroamphetamine sulfate dextroamphetamine saccharate amphetamine aspartate monohydrate amphetamine sulfate needed to produce toxicity and psychiatric symptoms in a child is as low as 2 mg a typical dose is 2540 mgd in adults narcolepsy adhd of the adult type and some depression can be treated with amphetamines although they are controlled substances abuse is possible especially in persons with alcoholism or substance abuse the substance 34methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma is a popular recreational stimulant commonly referred to as ecstasy which was manufactured legally in the 1980s 2 mdma has the desired effects of euphoria high energy and social disinhibition lasting 36 hours the drug is often consumed in dance clubs where users dance vigorously for long periods the drug sometimes causes toxicity and dehydration as well as severe hyperthermia several other amphetamine derivatives are para methoxyamphetamine pma 25dimethoxy4bromoamphetamine dob methamphetamine crystal methamphetamine crystal meth or tina and 34methylenedioxyamphetamine mda crystal meth is the pure form of methamphetamine and because of its low melting point it can be injected in a webbased survey of 1006 individuals who admitted mephedrone use which is the largest survey todate results showed that users consider mephedroâ€™es effects to compare best with those of mdma the appeal of mephedrone for these individuals is in its availability low price and reliable purity 3khat  catha edulis forsk is the only known organically derived amphetamine it is produced from the leaves of the qat tree located throughout east africa and the arabian peninsula the leaves of the tree are chewed extracting the active ingredient cathinone and producing the desired effects of euphoria and unlike other amphetamines anesthesia in the midwestern united states methcathinone the synthetic form of cathinone has been produced illegally since 1989 after a student at the university of michigan stole research documents and began to illegally manufacture the drug methcathinone is relatively easy to produce and contains the same chemicals found in overthecounter otc asthma and cold medicines paint solvents and thinners and drain openers eg drano its addiction potential is similar to that of crack cocaine amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders are conditions resulting from intoxication or longterm use of amphetamines or amphetamine derivatives such disorders can also be experienced during the withdrawal period from amphetamines the disorders are often selflimiting after cessation though in some patients psychiatric symptoms may last several weeks after discontinuation some individuals experience paranoia during withdrawal as well as during sustained use amphetamine use may elicit or be associated with the recurrence of other psychiatric disorders people addicted to amphetamines sometimes decrease their use after experiencing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations furthermore amphetamines can be psychologically but not physically addictive the symptoms of amphetamineinduced psychiatric disorders can be differentiated from those of related primary psychiatric disorders by time if symptoms do not resolve within 2 weeks after the amphetamines are discontinued a primary psychiatric disorder should be suspected depending on the severity of symptoms symptomatic treatment can be delayed to clarify the etiology amphetamineinduced psychosis delusions and hallucinations can be differentiated from psychotic disorders when symptoms resolve after amphetamines are discontinued absence of firstrank schneiderian symptoms including anhedonia avolition amotivation and flat affect further suggests amphetamineinduced psychosis symptoms of amphetamine use may be indistinguishable from those associated with the cocaine use amphetamines unlike cocaine do not cause local anesthesia and have a longer psychoactive duration amphetamineinduced delirium follows a reversible course similar to other causes of delirium and it is identified by its relationship to amphetamine intoxication after the delirium subsides little to no impairment is observed delirium is not a condition observed during amphetamine withdrawal mood disorders similar to hypomania and mania can be elicited during intoxication with amphetamines depression can occur during withdrawal and repeated use of amphetamines can produce antidepressantresistant amphetamineinduced depression of interest lowdose amphetamines can be used as an adjunct in the treatment of depression especially in patients with medical compromise lethargy hypersomnia low energy or decreased attention sleep disturbances appear in a fashion similar to mood disorders during intoxication sleep can be decreased markedly in withdrawal sleep often increases a disrupted circadian rhythm can result from late or high doses of prescription amphetamines or from chronic or intermittent abuse of amphetamines individuals who use prescription amphetamines can easily correct their sleep disturbance by lowering the dose or taking their medication earlier in the day than they have been insomnia is the most common adverse effect of prescription amphetamines unspecified stimulantrelated disorder is a diagnosis assigned to those who have several psychiatric symptoms associated with amphetamine use but who do not meet the criteria for a specific amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorder case study a 36yearold white male who works as a real estate agent arrives at your office depressed disheveled and slightly agitated he is very guarded and reluctant to talk about his work history or relationships after a period of time he describes how his coworkers are manipulating his clock to read 911 and the police drive by with their sirens on every day at 420 he refuses to open his mail because he read secondary messages by rearranging letters he admits to spending most of his time at home alone fixing his computer sometimes all night long his sleep cycle is reversed on the weekends he is depressed most of the time isolated lost 25 lbs in the last 3 months and has pale skin only when asked about the burn mark on his hand did he admit to smoking some t on further questioning he disclosed a 5month period of crystal methamphetamine use references pathophysiology the pathophysiology of amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders is difficult to establish because amphetamines influence multiple neural systems in general chronic amphetamine abuse may cause psychiatric symptoms due to inhibition of the dopamine transporter in the striatum and nucleus accumbens the longer the duration of use the greater the magnitude of dopamine reduction methamphetamine has been suggested to induce psychosis through inhibiting the dopamine transporter with a resultant increase in dopamine in the synaptic cleft 4amphetamineinduced psychosis often results after increased or large use of amphetamines as observed in binge use or after protracted use prescription amphetamines induce the release of dopamine in a dosedependent manner low doses of amphetamines deplete large storage vesicles and high doses deplete small storage vesicles this increase in dopaminergic activity may be causally related to psychotic symptoms because the use of d2blocking agents eg haloperidol often ameliorates these symptoms amphetamineinduced psychosis has been used as a model to support the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia in which overactivity of dopamine in the limbic system and striatum is associated with psychosis however negative symptoms commonly observed in schizophrenia are relatively rare in amphetamine psychosis mdma causes the acute release of serotonin and dopamine and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin into the neuron mdma has neurotoxic properties in animals and potentially in humans reports suggest that mdma use is associated with cognitive neurologic and behavioral abnormalities as well as hyperthermia but these reports are confounded by the association with other factors eg heat exertion poor diet other drug use serotonergic damage has been suggested to lead to cognitive impairment delirium caused by amphetamines may be related to the anticholinergic activity as observed in different classes of drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants benzodiazepines sedatives and dopamineactivating drugs rapid eye movement during the first phase is decreased during intoxication and a rebound elevation of rapid eye movement occurs during withdrawal this effect eventually alters the circadian rhythm and results in sleep disturbances references epidemiology frequency united states psychosis delirium mood symptoms anxiety insomnia and sexual dysfunction are considered rare adverse effects of therapeutic doses of prescription amphetamines dextroamphetamine has a slightly increased rate of these adverse effects because of its increased cns stimulation data about the frequency of amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders are unreliable because of comorbid primary psychiatric illnesses intravenous iv use occurs more frequently in people of low socioeconomic status than in those of high socioeconomic status the rates for past month use of methamphetamine did not change from 2011 to 2013 remaining at approximately 02 however this does represent a nearly twofold increase from the percentage of the population surveyed who had used in the last month in 2010 01 in 2013 an estimated 144000 people became new users of methamphetamine which is consistent with the new user initation rates of the preceding five years 5postmarketing studies of amphetamines prescribed to children and adolescents revealed a total of 865 unique case reports describing signs andor symptoms of psychosis or mania with nearly half reported in children 10 years or younger 6international the first amphetamine epidemic occurred after world war ii in japan when leftover supplies intended to counteract fatigue in pilots were made available to the general public this even resulted in many cases of amphetamine psychosis of interest both german and american troops used these preparations during world war ii as did japanese kamikaze pilots khat which is primarily used in ethiopia for cultural and religious purposes has been well studied a housetohouse survey of 10468 adults showed a lifetime prevalence of khat use of 557 daily use occurred among 174 and 80 indicated they used khat to increase concentration during prayer 7 khat dependency has been associated with people of muslim religion and with people of low socioeconomic status khat is also used to cope with the trauma of war in somalia one study showed that 364 of somali combatants used khat 1 week prior to being interviewed mortalitymorbidity the drug abuse warning network dawn annual medical examiner data for 2005 showed 10 of all drugrelated hospital emergency department visits were stimulantrelated dawn data indicated that 26 of all drugrelated deaths in oklahoma city were due to methamphetamine making it the citys most frequent drugrelated cause of death in 1998 in high doses prescription amphetamines can produce cardiovascular collapse myocardial infarction stroke seizures renal failure ischemic colitis and hepatotoxicity death related to mdma can occur from malignant hyperthermia which leads to kidney failure and cardiovascular collapse heart attacks seizures subarachnoid and intracranial hemorrhage and strokes may also result in death the rate of suicide and accidents can increase during periods of toxicity and withdrawal in high doses prescription amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives increase sexual arousal and disinhibition increasing the risk of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases memory impairment can result after longterm use of high doses of amphetamines because of damage to serotoninreleasing neurons in the emergency department patients with amphetaminerelated disorders are one third more likely than patients with cocainerelated disorders to be transferred to an inpatient psychiatric ward this difference may partly be because amphetamine withdrawal lasts longer then cocaine withdrawal and amphetamines are more psychogenic than cocaine amphetamine withdrawal is consistent with a major depressive episode though lasting less then 2 weeks and involving decreased energy increased appetite craving for sleep and suicidal ideation race sex and agerelated demographics amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders most commonly occur in white individuals with iv use amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders most commonly occur in men with a maletofemale ratio of 341 with noniv use amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders occur equally in men and women amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders most frequently occur in people aged 2039 years who are inclined to abuse amphetamine derivatives at rave parties and dance clubs adolescents have developed a method for abusing prescription amphetamines in which prescription tablets are crushed into a powder and inhaled nasally references history amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders can be confused with psychiatric disorders caused by organic medical neurologic andor psychological etiologies the causes of amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders usually can be determined by assessing the patients history and the familys genealogy the dsm5 provides criteria helpful for determining if the patient is in a state of intoxication or withdrawal the criteria helps clinicians distinguish disorders occurring during intoxication eg psychosis delirium mania anxiety insomnia from those occurring during withdrawal eg depression hypersomnia developmental history the developmental history provides information about the patients in utero exposure to medications illicit drugs alcohol pathogens and trauma as children patients may have had prodromal symptoms of psychiatric disorders such as social isolation deteriorating school performance mood liability amotivation avolition anhedonia sleep disturbances sexual paraphilias poor interest psychomotor retardation demoralization social isolation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors delinquency truancy educational failure early use of drugs and alcohol oppositional behavior associated with conduct disorder and participation in the rave party scene are developmental behaviors that suggest an amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorder psychiatric history two issues are emphasized determine whether a psychiatric disorder or symptoms ever occurred when the patient was not exposed to amphetamines determine whether the patient ever had a psychiatric disorder or symptoms similar to the present symptoms in relation to any other drug or medication recent history the patients history of amphetamine abuse is the most important factor and is determined by asking the following questions when did the patients amphetamine use start how often does the patient use amphetamines how much does he or she use is the patient currently intoxicated or in withdrawal from amphetamines does the patient frequently attend rave parties has the patient recently increased his or her amphetamine use or started to binge substance abuse history potentially abused substances include the following alcohol marijuana cocaine lysergic acid diethylamide lsdotc sympathomimetics steroids family history a family history of a psychiatric disorder may suggest a primary psychiatric disorder a diagnosis of amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorder might still be possible if the patient has no family history of psychiatric disorder dsm criteria for intoxication and withdrawal the dsm5 criteria for stimulant intoxication are as follows a recent ues of an amphetaminetype substance cocaine or other stimulant b clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes eg euphoria or affective blunting changes in sociability hypervigilance interpersonal sensitivity anxiety tension or anger stereotyped behaviors impaired judgment that develop during or shortly after use of a stimulant c two or more of the following signs or symptoms developing during or shortly after stimulant use tachycardia or bradycardia pupillary dilatation elevated or lowered blood pressure perspiration or chills nausea or vomiting evidence of weight loss psychomotor agitation or retardation muscular weakness respiratory depression chest pain or cardiac arrhythmias confusion seizures dyskinesias dystonias or coma the signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder including intoxication with another substance the dsm5 criteria for stimulant withdrawal are as follows a cessation of or reduction in prolonged amphetaminetype substance cocaine or other stimulant use b dysphoric mood and two or more of the following physiologic changes developing within a few hours to several days after criterion a fatigue vivid unpleasant dreams insomnia or hypersomnia increased appetite psychomotor retardation or agitation the signs or symptoms in criterion b cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational or other important areas of functioning the signs or symptoms are not attributable to another general medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance references physical full physical and neurologic examination should be performed initially assess patients for medical stability and then for level of danger during physical examination assess the patient for medical complications of amphetamine abuse including hyperthermia dehydration renal failure and cardiac complications during neurologic examination assess the patient for neurologic complications of amphetamine abuse including subarachnoid and intracranial hemorrhage delirium and seizures mental status examination should emphasize delusions hallucinations suicide homicide orientation insight and judgment and affect the mental status examination can be very different for intoxication and psychosis a mental status expected for a patient with amphetamine intoxication is as follows appearance and behavior unusually friendly scattered eye contact buccal oral gyrations excoriations on extremities and face from picking at skin overly talkative and verbally intrusive 8speech increased rate thought process tangential circumstantial over inclusive and disinhibited thought content paranoid no suicidal or homicidal thoughts mood anxious hypomanic affect anxious and tense insight and judgment poor orientation alert to person place and purpose perspective of time is disorganized a mental status expected for a patient with amphetamine psychosis is as follows 9 10appearance and behavior disheveled suspicious paranoid difficult to engage and poor eye contact speech decreased and rapid thought process guarded and internally preoccupied thought content paranoid possible auditory hallucinations no suicidal or homicidal thoughts mood anxious affect paranoid and fearful insight and judgment poor orientation has no concept of purpose though understands place and person perspective of time is disorganized a mental status for a patient withdrawing form amphetamines is as follows appearance and behavior disheveled psychomotor slowing poor eye contact pale appearance to skin speech decreased tone and volume thought processes decreased content guarded thought content no auditory visual hallucinations suicidal thoughts present but no homicidal thoughts mood depressed affect flat and withdrawn insight and judgment poor orientation oriented to person place and purpose references causes causes may include the following amphetamine intoxication binge pattern use and longterm exposure comorbid psychiatric disorders such as depression psychotic disorders and anxiety disorders abuse of other substances such as alcohol otc sympathomimetics and illicit drugs dehydration which can result in electrolyte imbalances and renal failure potential for serotonin syndrome in those prescribed serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors references differential diagnoses cannabisrelated disorders cocainerelated psychiatric disorders delirium depression hallucinogen use hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis hypothyroidism inhalantrelated psychiatric disorders insomnia opioid abuse phencyclidine pcprelated psychiatric disorders schizophrenia toxicity heroin toxicity mushroom wernickekorsakoff syndrome laboratory studies the purpose of the workup is to exclude complications of amphetamine abuse and other causes of psychosis and altered mental status laboratory evaluation should include the following tests fingerstick blood glucose test cbc determination determination of electrolyte levels including magnesium amylase albumin total protein uric acid bun alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels urinalysis stat urine or serum toxicology screening to exclude acetaminophen tricyclic antidepressants aspirin and other potential toxins individuals who abuse drugs may ingest a substance called urine luck or pyridinium chlorochromate pcc to produce invalid results on urine drug screens pcc alters the results for cannabis and opiates but elevates levels of amphetamines blood test for an alcohol level if the patient appears intoxicated hiv and rapid plasma reagin rpr tests references imaging studies in the presence of neurologic impairments ct or mri helps in evaluating for subarachnoid and intracranial hemorrhage references other tests perform ecg to evaluate for cardiac involvement perform eeg if a seizure disorder is considered possible use of the brief psychotic rating scale bprs beck depression scale violence and suicide assessment and other measures may be helpful if persistent psychiatric conditions are noted neuropsychological testing can be beneficial to assess levels of psychosocial and neurologic function to guide treatment and to assess the need for placement results of projective testing such as the rorschach test and the thematic apperception test can help in clarifying thought disorders during amphetamine intoxication the minimental state examination mmse can be helpful in measuring cognitive change references histologic findings repeated exposure to amphetamines is theorized to alter the morphology of dendrites in the prefrontal cortex and in the nucleus accumbens amphetamines may increase the length of dendrites for longer than 1 month these alterations may help explain the behavioral cravings and psychosis that longterm abuse of amphetamines produces references medical care initial treatment should include medically stabilizing the patients condition by assessing his or her respiratory circulatory and neurologic systems the offending substance may be eliminated by means of gastric lavage and acidification of the urine psychotropic medication can be used to stabilize an agitated patient with psychosis because most cases of amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders are selflimiting removal of the amphetamines should suffice induced emesis lavage or charcoal may be helpful in the event of overdose the excretion of amphetamines can be accelerated by the use of ammonium chloride given either iv or orally po amphetamine intoxication can be treated with ammonium chloride often found in otc expectorants such as ammonium chloride quelidrine baby cough syrup romilar and pvtussin the recommended dose to acidify the urine is ammonium chloride 500 mg every 23 hours the ingredients in otc cough syrups vary and the clinician should become familiar with 1 or 2 stock items for use in the emergency department ammonium chloride quelidrine an otc expectorant can be used in the absence of liver or kidney failure administer iv fluids to provide adequate hydration if the patient is psychotic or if he or she is in danger of harming him or herself or others a highpotency antipsychotic such as haloperidol haldol can be used exercise caution because of the potential for extrapyramidal symptoms such as acute dystonic reactions and neuroleptic malignant syndrome agitation also can be treated cautiously with benzodiazepines po iv or intramuscularly im lorazepam ativan and chlordiazepoxide librium are commonly used administer naloxone narcan in the event of concurrent opiate toxicity use caution to avoid precipitation of acute opioid withdrawal in a patient who has used high doses of opioid on a longterm basis betablockers such as propranolol inderal can be used in the event of elevated blood pressure and pulse they also may be helpful with anxiety or panic psychiatric hospitalization may be necessary when psychosis aggression and suicidality cannot be controlled in a less restrictive environment if serotonin syndrome is suspected stop all ssri and snri medications references consultations consultations with a neurologist internal medicine specialist psychiatrist or social services may prove helpful consult a psychiatrist for inpatient substance abuse treatment or further psychiatric stabilization social services coordinate outpatient services such as alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous meetings and sober houses and provide appointments some large metropolitan areas have groups that specifically focus on crystal methamphetamine abuse in the gay population references activity patients intoxicated with amphetamines are dangerous and their activity should be limited eg no driving until their symptoms have resolved references medication medication summary antipsychotics benzodiazepines opiate antagonists betablockers expectorants adsorbents medication summary several psychiatric conditions can be associated with amphetamine intoxication and withdrawal all of which may require different management strategies however amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders are typically selflimited and usually remit on their own amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders occur most often during intoxication therefore treatment should focus on controlling medical and psychiatric symptoms while eliminating the offending substance medical therapy involves stabilizing agitation and minimizing psychosis gastric lavage directly removes the amphetamines before they have an opportunity to be absorbed medication and charcoal eliminate amphetamines from the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems if the induced disorders persist and interfere with the patients social and occupational functioning treatment should be related to the remaining psychiatric symptoms antidepressants such as sertraline zoloft fluoxetine prozac paroxetine paxil and citalopram celexa can be used to treat depression antimanic agents such as valproic acid depakote carbamazepine tegretol and lithium carbonate can be used to treat mania anxiety can be treated with nonbenzodiazepine drugs such as betablockers and antimanic agents data from recent studies suggest typical antipsychotics haloperidol thioridazine thorazine etc may increase amphetamine and cocaine cravings in patients with dual diagnoses of amphetamine and cocaine abuse typical antipsychotics should be used for acute stabilization with the intention of switching to an atypical antipsychotic drug eg risperidone quetiapine olanzapine aripiprazole and ziprasidone for longterm use some evidence suggests that naltrexone might be helpful in treating those addicted to amphetamines 11for the purposes of this discussion specific treatment of amphetamine toxicity is reviewed for further information please refer to the articles on depression substanceinduced mood disorder depressed type bipolar affective disorder schizophrenia anxiety disorders and sleeping disorders references antipsychotics class summary haloperidol haldolthiothixene navanehaloperidol haldoldosing interactions etc clinical context provides rapid sedation of agitated anxious patient available po and im allowing for flexible emergency administration references thiothixene navanedosing interactions etc clinical context blocks postsynaptic blockade of cns dopamine receptors inhibiting dopaminemediated effects po and im forms allow for rapid tranquilization references class summary clinicians should select a highpotency antipsychotic that is available in tablet liquid and im forms for administration in emergency situations antipsychotics help control psychotic symptoms and provide rapid tranquilization of the agitated and psychotic patient references benzodiazepines class summary lorazepam ativanchlordiazepoxide librium libritabs mitranlorazepam ativandosing interactions etc clinical context provides rapid onset and efficacy in sedating aggressive patient flexible administration in emergency situation references chlordiazepoxide librium libritabs mitrandosing interactions etc clinical context depresses all levels of cns including limbic and reticular formation possibly by increasing activity of gammaaminobutyric acid gaba activity major inhibitory neurotransmitter references class summary these drugs are primarily used to sedate agitated patients availability in po iv and im forms allowing the drug to be used in emergency situations caution must be used in the violent aggressive patient because benzodiazepines may cause disinhibition references opiate antagonists class summary naloxone narcannaloxone narcandosing interactions etc clinical context used to treat concurrent opiate toxicity consider in patients with altered mental status due to opiate overdose poorly absorbed po route and should be administered im or iv available in iv im and sc forms use caution to avoid precipitating acute opioid withdrawal in patient using opioids long term references class summary these drugs inhibit the action of opiates references betablockers class summary propranolol inderalpropranolol inderaldosing interactions etc clinical context antihypertensive agent useful in psychiatry to treat anxiety and impulse control often well tolerated with minimal effect on hemodynamics of blood pressure and pulse references class summary propranolol inderal is useful in patients who are agitated anxious and hyperarousable because of amphetamines they are temporarily used until the amphetamine is eliminated from the patients system for some patients anxiety can be prolonged and nonaddictive betablockers may be helpful references expectorants class summary ammonium chloride quelidrineammonium chloride quelidrinedosing interactions etc clinical context commonly used as otc expectorant acidifies urine at high doses safe and easy to use references class summary expectorants are used to acidify the urine and increase amphetamine excretion when intoxication from amphetamines has resulted in psychiatric and medical complications these agents are available in po form and the patient must be able to swallow or receive a nasogastric tube references adsorbents class summary activated charcoal suspension actidoseaqua instaqua liquidcharactivated charcoal suspension actidoseaqua instaqua liquidchardosing interactions etc clinical context bottles and tubes use long after amphetamine ingestion can reduce systemic levels by adsorbing amphetamines recirculating through gastric mucosa references class summary these agents given through a nasogastric tube into the stomach absorb intentionally and accidentally ingested substances to prevent their further absorption into the systemic circulation references further outpatient care the patient should be monitored closely for recurring psychosis depression mania anxiety sleep disturbances and relapse of amphetamine abuse psychiatric followup care should occur within at most 2 weeks of the initial evaluation to ensure compliance depending on the complications of amphetamine abuse in the specific patient consider a followup examination with a neurologist and an internal medicine specialist references further inpatient care admit the patient for observation in the event of mania severe depression psychosis delirium or if he or she is suicidal or homicidal a patient who is in a state of delirium should be placed in a quiet cool not cold dimly lit not dark room and if uncontrollable placed in restraints references inpatient  outpatient medications if psychosis persists after the offending substance is eliminated use of an atypical antipsychotic risperidone quetiapine olanzapine aripiprazole ziprasidone may be considered no single atypical antipsychotic has been proven to be more beneficial than the others in managing prolonged amphetamineinduced psychosis antimanic agents may be continued if mania persists longer than 2 weeks antidepressants can be useful if depression persists for 2 weeks after withdrawal antidepressants alone may not be as effective as other options in amphetamineinduced depression due to neuronal damage medication regimens for treatmentresistant organic mood disorders are the applicable approach if anxiety persists longer than 2 weeks consider the use of nonbenzodiazepine drugs medications such as betablockers valproic acid carbamazepine or gabapentin have shown promise in patients with substance abuse who also have anxiety sleep medication may help patients adjust their circadian rhythm and can be used for approximately 12 weeks if sleep medication is required for long periods a referral to a sleep clinic is recommended references transfer if psychiatric conditions persist causing social and occupational impairment inpatient treatment may be required medical or neurologic complications require treatment in an inpatient medical or neurologic unit references deterrenceprevention abstinence prevents disorders and is the primary treatment relapse prevention occurs though patient education individual psychotherapy appropriate medical treatment of continuing psychiatric illness eg major depression panic disorder and attendance at substance abuse meetings mandatory weekly urine drug screens help prevent relapse or expose relapse early so that aggressive treatment intervention can be pursued if psychiatric conditions arise during prescription amphetamine use for adhd lower doses may be tried andor nonamphetamine treatments can be pursued such as bupropion wellbutrin desipramine venlafaxine effexor or clonidine please refer to the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder article for a full discussion of treatment options early medication treatments have been tried with desipramine and lithium 12 aripiprazole vs methylphenidate vs placebo 13 bupropion 14 and naltrexone 15the most recent published study at the time of this review assessed the efficacy of extendedrelease methylphenidate the intentiontotreat analysis failed to demonstrate statistical difference between extendedrelease methylphenidate n40 compared with placebo n39 the authors noted that the study was limited by significantly higher dropout rates in the placebo arm 16currently there are no medications that are routinely prescribed as standardofcare or approved by the fda for the treatment of amphetamine use disorder references complications complications include an increased risk of the following psychosis depression anxiety disorder sleep disturbance memory impairment medical complications neurologic complications abuse of another or several substances psychosocial impairment affect dysregulation and aggression 17if amphetamine abuse and amphetaminerelated psychiatric disorders occur in the context of 1 or more personality disorders the amphetaminerelated disorder is more difficult to successfully treat than it is in other contexts references prognosis the patients prognosis depends on the severity of psychiatric impairment and on the medical complications overall the prognosis is good if the patient abstains from drug use after the initial psychiatric impairment occurs the prognosis worsens if personality disorders are present references patient education instruct the patient to abstain from alcohol and illicit drugs especially because dual diagnosis is a real issue the only effective treatment is abstinence patients should be in a support group the family must be educated about the patients addiction and its dangers refer the patient for psychosocial counseling hospitalize the patient if he or she is suicidal or homicidal refer the patient for substance abuse counseling helpful web sites include the following crystal meth anonymous national institute on drug
