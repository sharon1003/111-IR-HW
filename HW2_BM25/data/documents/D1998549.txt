mustangs and camaros have faced off at stoplights and drag races for four decades—give or take a few model years but recently with the chevy camaro and dodge challenger rising from the ashes to take on the stalwart stang the folks at ford have added fuel to the muscle car conflict or rather theyve increased the mustangs fuel efficiency along with its power output—for both available engines the specsim most proud of our v6 says dave pericak mustangs chief engineer its the first car ever to get over 300 hp and over 30 mpg he says although the v6powered camaro comes close at 304 hp and 29 mpg fifteen years ago the 1996 svt mustang cobra—a car endowed with a supercharged 46liter modular v8—broke the 300hp barrier with 305 hp while achieving 26 mpg thanks to the advent of what ford calls twin independent variable camshaft timing tivct however the 2011 mustangs 37liter v6 22995 develops 305 hp up from last years measly 210 and 280 ftlbs of torque up from 240 while averaging 31 mpg on the highway not too shabby for a base model in premium trim our v6 test car came with all the standard creature comforts you would expect in a passenger car and then some leather power seats sirius satellite radio a splitfolding rear seat options included comfort and security packages and a 331ratio limitedslip axle step up to the gt 30495 base price and the big news is the v8 engines 5liter displacement the uglyassin 1980s foxbodied mustangs relied on gigantic 50 fender badges to maintain their street cred whereas the 2011 model gets by on its looks and on its personality yes big shiny fender badges still proclaim the allaluminum fourvalve dohc v8s displacement but the new fiveoh also makes use of variable valve timing and a ramair intake to boost power output from last years 315 to a much more respectable 412 hp and still manages to achieve an epa rating of 26 mpg on the highway gt premium adds a premier twotone interior with red leather the security and comfort packages rearview camera brembo brake package and a 373 axle ratio as tested the gt topped out at 39550 including the destination and delivery charges delivering power from either engine to the rear wheels is a choice of sixspeed manual or sixspeed automatic gearbox sorry no paddle shifters the drive equipped with the wonderfully precise shortthrow manual shifter the v8 will get you from zero to 60 mph in 49 seconds and the v6 will do it in 55 both will do a quarter mile in the 13second range despite the presence of brembo brakes the gt still took an extra 4 feet to slow from 60 mph compared to the v6 car due to the gts 3605lb curb weight which is approximately 150 lbs heavier thats still respectably quick but the v8 seems a lot faster due to its husky wail which is routed directly to the cabin via a plastic tube connected to the air intake when you hit the gas pedal you can hear where that premium fuel goes its a gratifying sensation when the v8 reaches its peak of 390 ftlbs of torque at 4250 rpm—and engine noise is always just a downshift away the bad news the mustangs top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph and it may now be parentally limited to 80 mph yes my key the electronic babysitter introduced on the ford focus has migrated over to a fun car it gives parents the peace of mind that their child is not going to do something stupid pericak says fords my key can be programmed to turn down the radio volume or mute it altogether if you dont fasten your seatbelt it wont allow you to disable traction control or electronic stability control either which makes it exceedingly difficult to do donuts or smoky burnouts advertisement  continue reading below but even with traction control active its easy to make the tires p25540r19s squeal like a stuck pig while the engine harmonizes with its demonic wail drop into sixth gear at 60 mph in traffic and the gt lopes along quietly at 1800 rpm as wind easily drowns out the exhaust steering is firm and uses electronic yaw sensors roll sensors and steeringwheel angle sensors to maintain a straight course down the road an onboard computer determines how much input you give the steering and you no longer have to correct to keep the car going straight if youre on an uneven road or a crowned highway and let go of the steering wheel most cars will drift off the road pericak explains even if there are high cross winds the mustangs computer will pick that up and compensate for it we can dial this in exactly the way we want pericak explains we control the speed the direction everything running through some switchbacks near los angeles the steerings electronics are impossible to discern from a conventional hydraulic system in fact the chassis improvements to both cars have further moved the mustang into allaround sportscar territory order the performance package on the v6 car and it mimics the gts precise moves the handling is tight and the ride firm but its far from uncomfortable out back theres a solidrear axle a throwback in todays era of independent setups but it stays glued to the road and never hops when traversing midcorner bumps we found ourselves pushing the highpowered gt hard confident that it would stay on our intended line and impressed by how few midcorner corrections were required it feels on par with sports cars from germany and thats a big compliment whats most striking is how ford managed to further civilize the car without removing the visceral character especially in the gt road impacts make muted thumps inside the cabin and interior noise on the highway is nearly nonexistent the mustang is meant as a daily driver after all for 2011 ford also added small insets on both side mirrors to open up the field of view and effectively eliminate blind spots collapsible rear headrests also improve rearward visibility and the effect is an open cabin a rearview camera is optional which like the available navigation system pericak points out is not offered on the camaro the bottom line even with performance that rivals last years gt its hard to take mustangs v6 seriously after driving the v8 if you want decent mileage buy a ford focus honda insight or toyota prius but if you are in the market for a serious muscle car life begins at 50
