handinhand to repair or replace most of the damages to your car its important to know the difference and make sure youre adequately covered what is comprehensive coverage what is collision coverage difference between collision vs comprehensive do i need them how much do they cost what is comprehensive insurance comprehensive car insurance covers damages from an act of god or events that are not caused by a car driving into something else an act of god can include things like damage from a heavy tree branch falling on your car since you have no control over when or why a tree branch would fall on your car this kind of accident would be covered under your comprehensive policy types of damages covered under comprehensive auto insurance below are a couple examples of accidents and mishaps excluding fenderbenders natural disasters storms tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes hailstorms fire civil commotions explosions vandalism and theft damage from impacts with animals such as a deer note a crash from swerving to avoid animals will likely fall under collision broken or shattered windows and windshield falling objects acts of terrorism policies typically use vague language when referring to acts of terrorism but they are generally insured by the comprehensive portion of your policy for example if there is an act of terror and you need to make a claim on your car that can only be made if you have comprehensive coverage since some circumstances are out of our control comprehensive insurance is certainly important to have in your policy what is collision insurance whether your vehicle is involved in a crash with another vehicle or rammed into a fixed structure you can rely on collision insurance to offer you coverage most car crashes and auto accidents fall under this kind of insurance policy the following list includes a few examples of crashes that would be covered by collision insurance you crash into another car or another car crashes into you while youre parked you drive into a stationary object such as a tree streetlight or pole you crash into a ditch or a pothole your car flips over a hitandrun if you cant use uninsured motorist coverage while there are a couple of benefits of collision insurance the main one is that you can file a claim and receive reimbursement regardless of who was at fault collision claims usually get processed faster than property damage claims because the insurance company does not have to spend time investigating who was atfault another benefit is that you only deal with your own insurance company rather than another insurer with less incentive to pay for your claim collision insurance can also be used toward your rental car in most cases which can spare you from having to buy rental car insurance the difference between comprehensive and collision insurance the key difference in collision vs comprehensive coverage is that to a certain extent the element of the car drivers control as we have stated before collision insurance will typically cover events within a motorists control or when another vehicle collides with your car comprehensive coverage generally falls under acts of god or nature that are typically out of your control when driving these can include such events as a spooked deer a heavy hailstorm or a carjacking lets use the aftermath of superstorm sandy as an example to illustrate the differences between collision and comprehensive within that storm lets consider two events that might have happened 1 a heavy tree branch fell on your car or 2 you swerved to avoid a falling tree branch and wound up crashing into a tree in the first event you had no control over when or why a tree branch would fall on your car this kind of accident would get reimbursed under your comprehensive policy in the second situation you were driving the car and ultimately swerved into the tree which makes it a collision and collision insurance therefore pays for the damages events like the hypothetical ones stated above are why its important to differentiate between the two types of coverage do you need collision and comprehensive insurance collision and comprehensive insurance ensure you wont be on the hook for any costly car damage so for the most part we recommend that most drivers have both even if you have property damage liability it isnt helpful in this scenario because it doesnt pay for your cars repairs get both coverages if you lease or finance your car your car is less than 10 years of age your car is worth more than 3000if you lease or finance your car you may actually be required to have collision and comprehensive insurance your leasing agent will want to protect their investment and to ensure there are sufficient funds to allow the vehicle to be repaired by the driver if your car is worth more than 3000 andor is less than 10 years old wed also suggest both collision and comprehensive coverage too our estimates suggest drivers can buy comprehensive and collision insurance for an average of 600 to 700 per year however the cost may be higher for some cars so you would spend 3000 to 3500 in premiums over five years if your car is currently worth less than 3000 you will have spent more on insurance than your car is worth you can obtain the estimated value of your car from sites like kelley blue book and edmunds once you have both the value and a quite for coverage you can determine whether collision insurance will be worth it collision claims are usually a bit higher than comprehensive ones according to the insurance information institute iii but both are above 1000 on average in 2015 about 6 of drivers with collision insurance filed a claim that was on average worth 3350 while 273 filed a comprehensive claim that was worth 1671 getting just comprehensive insurance there is a case to be made for getting just comprehensive and not collision insurance even if your car is not valuable comprehensive covers you for a lot more perils than does collisionincluding most importantly against theft regardless of the value of your car having it stolen is a major inconvenience even if your car is worth only 2000 at the time of the theft and your insurer gives you 1500 that sum would go a long way in buying yourself a new vehicle as we discuss in more detail below comprehensive insurance generally costs no more than 200 per year so a 1500 reimbursement would make the coverage valuable how much do collision and comprehensive coverage cost to calculate the added cost in purchasing comprehensive andor collision coverage we looked at
