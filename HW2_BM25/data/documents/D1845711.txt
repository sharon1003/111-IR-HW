confidentiality is it safe to talk talking to a therapist online is probably as safe as talking to one in person both are very confidential and neither is 100 perfect how to keep your online therapy safe can you be anonymous we might as well admit it up front this is an imperfect world therapists consider it a sacred duty to protect your confidentiality but confidentiality can be compromised even in the best of circumstances internet email is not a 100 secure means of communication but to be fair it is probably at least as safe as visiting a therapist in an office very rarely accidental breaches of confidentiality happen in office settings someone you know might see you entering or leaving your therapist’s building staff members might see your file and sometimes walls and doors are not as soundproof as one would hope but therapists take very seriously their responsibility to protect your privacy and confidentiality and they do everything in their power to safeguard your interactions whether in person or online no credentialed psychotherapist would ever reveal to anyone the fact that you are corresponding with them let alone what you are corresponding about important exception they are required by law to break confidentiality if necessary to protect you or someone else from imminent danger of harm recently some large etherapy clinics and a few private practitioners have begun to offer an increased level of security on their websites to better protect you they use secure webbased messaging systems instead of regular email these secure web pages are similar to ecommerce or to the technology that banks use to let you access your accounts online if it’s safe enough for banks it’s probably safe enough for your therapy on these sites instead of sending regular email to your therapist you log on to a secure web page and send a message via a passwordprotected secure form how to keep your online therapy safe in the highly unlikely event that someone finds out about your correspondence it would probably be because of an inadvertent erroryoumade you might compromise your privacyif someone else has access to your computer and is able to read

more about payment methodscan you remain anonymous you may be drawn to the idea of consulting a psychotherapist via the internet because it feels more private you may wish to be anonymous in your contact with the therapist especially if you plan to discuss a sensitive or embarrassing topic there are still plenty of etherapists who will allow you to remain anonymous until you feel comfortable revealing your identity to them but more and more etherapists are insisting that you give them your name street address and phone number before they will talk with you why they have a professional

you so you will find most etherapists now ask or even require that you give your name street address and telephone number also remember that trust is mutual just as you want to be sure of a
