supposed anger at having been abandoned by her but of course she wasnt abandoned she was given up for adoption and the network and producers were rightly concerned that we might be sending the message that phrase that soap writers dread either that adopted children were hateful and full of rage or that their adoptive parents were neglectful or otherwise inadequate enough to instill this smoldering resentment of being adopted in their kids i need not go on 25patrick mulcahey on carly 1999 officially former head writers claire labine 1993–96 and robert guza jr 1996–2000 2002–11 along with script writers karen harris and patrick mulcahey are said to have created the character of carly 25 26 in 1999 writer patrick mulcahey noted that the character had been somewhat of a work in progress at first mulchey explained that she was different from most characters because we were afraid of her the character was quite a big deal and very important to the series—so important that one writer even quit over it the pitfalls are obvious mulcahey said and i imagine bob guza the headwriter promised wendy riche the executive producer and abc that we had no intention of falling into them the scribe continued however the writers themselves had no clue who the character was supposed to be that may sound like a horrifying confession but in daytime a successful character is always a collaboration between the writers and the actor mulcahey said the writers discussed who they felt carly as a character is and that the actor finds certain other decisions have to be made and makes them sparks fly between the actor and another actor we see whats happening onscreen and start playing around with it in the writing thats how a character takes shape 25 the variety of actresses that auditioned for the role implied that there was not any set direction for the character 2 brown spent the first few months of her tenure crafting a backstory to explain her characters actions 27 according to her backstory the character was scripted as being born on november 5 1973 in jacksonville florida to the 16 year old prostitute bobbie  jacklyn zeman and immediately placed up for adoption because bobbie could not care for her 28 29 the child is adopted by virginia  lois nettleton and her husband frank benson in pensacola florida as caroline leigh benson 30 31 32 frank eventually walks out on his
