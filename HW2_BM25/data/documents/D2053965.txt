of any age and at any stage in a serious illness whether that illness is curable chronic or lifethreatening palliative care can enhance your level of comfort and help you achieve the highest possible quality of life you can receive palliative care while you are undergoing treatments that may cure or reverse the effects of your illness in fact palliative care can help you cope with aggressive treatments by managing your pain and symptoms hospice care is a type of palliative care for people who are terminally ill if the disease runs its normal course when medical treatments cannot offer a cure hospice provides care comfort and support for persons with lifethreatening illnesses and their families14 question do i have to be in a hospital to receive palliative care answer no most hospitals usually provide some palliative care services but there may be other health care providers in your area with palliative care services these may include nursing homes assisted living facilities or your own home by a home care agency some hospices also provide non endoflife palliative care in your home please note that some types of palliative care services are not available in every county across new york state you can ask your health care practitioners about the palliative care services available in your area or search for providers using the following links get palliative care capc or hospice and palliative care association of new york state hpcanys15 question can you explain how palliative care is paid for does my insurance cover palliative care answer most insurance plans including medicare and medicaid cover medical services that are considered palliative care some plans also cover supportive services ask to speak with a social worker or call your health plan if you have questions about your healthcare coverage16 question is palliative care available for children answer yes it is available for children although serious illnesses do not occur as often in children as in adults some children develop serious potentially lifethreatening diseases these children like adults can receive palliative care at any stage of their illness whether that illness is potentially curable chronic or lifethreatening the approach to palliative care for children may be different than for adults but the goal is the same to relieve suffering in patients and their families throughout the course of their illness whether or not it is curable17 question what makes palliative care for children different than palliative care for adults answer just as medical care for children differs from such care for adults so too does palliative care the basic principles are the same relief of physical emotional social and spiritual suffering but the way that relief is provided may differ for example the doses and types of medications used to relieve pain and other symptoms in children may be different another important distinction is that children are very resilient and even when they have a disease that cannot be cured they are often able to handle therapies aimed at controlling the disease therefore many children receive diseasetargeted care and palliative care that is care aimed at keeping them comfortable at the same time neither parents nor children have to choose one or the other because children and families of children who receive palliative care have different needs than adults these children ideally should receive that care from pediatric professionals in addition to their pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists they may benefit from nurses and nurse practitioners who are trained in caring for chronically ill andor serious ill children child life specialists trained professionals who focus on childrens comfort can help children to express themselves through play music and art therapists with pediatric experience are very effective in doing the same thing likewise pediatric social workers chaplains school counselors psychologists and psychiatrists can also help children and their families all of these pediatric palliative care team members can also work with and provide comfort to siblings of ill children as well as their parents perhaps the most challenging aspect of providing palliative care for children is that many people expect children to be healthy and when a child has a serious illness family friends and even doctors nurses and other medical personnel are not quite sure what to do or say so a big part of palliative care for children and their families is being able to communicate clearly and effectively with parents about what is happening what the road ahead might hold and perhaps most importantly how to explain things to the child who is ill and hisher siblings18 question how do i talk to my child about hisher illness and treatment answer this is certainly one of the very biggest challenges in taking care of a child with a serious illness how much should we tell him how do i answer her scary questions who can guide me children are like adults in that every child is different and therefore the approach to talking to them must be individualized as a general rule children do best when information is shared with them but how that information is shared and who shares it will depend on their personalities how they handle difficult information their actual age their stage of development and how much they want to know if you are uncertain how to explain hisher illness and care to your child and most parents are some people who could guide you include your pediatrician other healthcare workers involved your childs care or perhaps a trusted teacher clergy or family member19 question where can i find palliative care services for my child answer many of the larger childrens hospitals in the state have pediatric palliative care teams for those families who live in rural areas or who do not know of a nearby team it would be wise to ask your childs pediatrician where you might find the right people to provide palliative care services the pediatrician might know of a hospitalbased team or even a homebased team if not sometimes home health agencies can help with childrens comfort with the assistance of the pediatrician20 question do the palliative care information act and the palliative care access act apply to children answer yes they do apply to children the department is aware that lifelimiting illnesses and terminal illnesses are far less common in children than in adults the department also recognizes the unique challenges of discussing palliative care with parents of children with lifelimiting illness as well as with the children themselves in addition it may be particularly challenging to predict life expectancy in children with lifelimiting illnesses and hence difficult to know just when such discussions should take place that said these laws do apply to children who have advanced diseases or terminal illnesses ie their parents must be offered the opportunity to learn about their childs prognosis about the range of supportive care and treatment options available to the child the risks and benefits of these options and the childrens legal rights to comprehensive pain and symptom management at the end of life given the fact that few children in the general population have life limiting andor terminal illnesses some pediatric practitioners may not be comfortable conducting these difficult conversations if that is the case your pediatrician should consult with a pediatric palliative care subspecialist or refer you to one in addition the pcaa requires that certain health care providers including hospitals nursing homes and home care agencies facilitate access to appropriate palliative care consultation and services including associated pain management consultations and services the department acknowledges that pediatric palliative care services may not be as readily available as palliative care services for adults your pediatrician or health plan may be able to connect you with a pediatric subspecialty group21 question must children themselves be informed of their palliative care options and right to access palliative care services answer this cannot be answered with a simple yes or no since there is such variability in childrens ages and developmental stages clearly a 2yearold child cannot be informed nor could a 10yearold with a severe developmental delay generally a 17yearold with normal cognitive status should be informed the challenge is the many children in between – the normal 12yearold child or the precocious 8yearold child as a general guideline sharing information with a child about his or her diagnosis prognosis and treatment and palliative care options is appropriate if the child has the ability to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of hisher disease and trajectory of that disease and the nature and consequences of treatment and palliative care options you should discuss with your physician your childs ability to understand these issues and how much information should be shared with him or her if you object to your child being offered information aabout diagnosis prognosis and treatment options you should discuss your conerns with your physician and health care team
