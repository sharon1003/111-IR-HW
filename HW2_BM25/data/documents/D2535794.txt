67k 81k 96 82kshares recently a few of my kids woke up coughing they told me their chests felt weird and that it felt strange when they inhaled sounded just like chest congestion did i run to the store and buy a popular vapor rub no commercial vapor rubs are typically petroleum based and add camphor which has been synthetically derived from the oil of turpentine and menthol which is typically synthetically made i decided to make my own vapor rub containing natural essential oils that contain complex compounds that not only knock out symptoms but can also help the body heal itself so i whipped up some vapor rub for coughs and chest congestion using my 5 musthave essential oils and favorite multipurpose ingredients why whipped because whipping the oils together requires no extra heating which means less dishes and less clean up the result is a light silky body butter that rubs in quickly just what you need for chest congestion essential oils for coughs and chest congestion peppermint essential oil is antibacterial analgesic it soothes pain and antiinflammatory it’s also cooling and refreshing thanks to its menthol content eucalyptus essential oil is antimicrobial and a great expectorant making it a good oil to use for respiratory issues lavender essential oil is very soothing and can help promote peaceful sleep something that’s a bit difficult with chest congestion lemon essential oil isn’t just for gunk that’s stuck on surfaces it’s also a great oil for slowing wheezing colds cough and other upper respiratory problems tea tree essential oil is antimicrobial making it a good addition to this rub if the chest congestion is the caused by some sort of pathogen pretty impressive right individually these essential oils are awesome but together they make a powerful combination to help clear up chest congestion whipped vapor rub recipe ingredients  supplies¼ cup room temperature coconut oil  find organic coconut oil here¼ cup room temperature shea butter

be sure to label what you’ve madestore in a cool dark place my whipped butters typically last for a few months – longer if you scoop it out with a clean utensilhands to use this rub doesn’t pack the same punch as a commercial vapor rubs instead it seeps in slowly with a very mild tingling feeling just apply a small amount to the chest during a cold or when you have a cough you can also apply the rub on your upper and middle back as well apply every couple of hours if you rub it into your hands you can also cup your hands over your nose and inhale deeply a few times because the oils are diluted in the carrier oils i feel confident using this on my childrens’ chests and backs the youngest of which is 3 if you’re using it on small babies though only apply a very small amount to the bottoms of their feet and put socks on them even though it won’t have the same effect as rubbing it on their chests the essential oils will still be absorbed into their feet and provide therapeutic benefits please be sure to only use 100 pure essential oils  precautions even though essential oils are natural they must still be used with caution why because they are so concentrated and powerful that’s also why it’s so important to use 100 pure therapeutic grade oils check out our essential oil faq for more tips on buying essential oils if you are pregnant or nursing check with your holistic healthcare provider before using essential oils only use a very small amount on the bottoms of the feet on infants under 6 months of age 67k 81k 96 82kshares about nina nelson nina is a writer student

vapor rub for chest congestion tina october 30 2013 at 653 am once again this site never ceases to amaze me i grew up on the commercial vapo rub products but i love this diy my family knows if it’s something we can make ourselves we no longer buy it from the store very happy to add this to our growing list paula adams october 30 2013 at 748 am i grew up with vicks vapo rub my step mother advocated eating it i drew the line there i love the idea of making my own but really hope i don’t need to use it  nancy keeler october 30 2013 at 1054 am oh yes paula i used to remember directions to the effect of swallowing a “pearlsized” bit of vaporub back in the ’60s and i did it not knowing the dangers of mineral oil and petroleum products barb murphy october 30 2013 at 837 am i have made my own also but did use camphor i love how it smells reminds me of the kind i used as a kid i have been careful to purchase the white camphor which is steam distilled…mrh even sells it so i am confused are you saying that all camphor is synthetically derived nina nelson october 30 2013 at 1039 am there is natural camphor and synthetic camphor from what i’ve read the commercial vapor rub companies use synthetically derived camphor nancy keeler october 30 2013 at 1100 am i need a diy recipe for camphophenique i’ll have to investigate the natural camphor susan smolinski november 15 2013 at 925 pm

whipped butters typically last for a few months longer if you scoop it out with a clean utensilhands anastasia october 30 2013 at 1017 am do you think it would be safe enough for a year old nina nelson october 30 2013 at 1044 am if i still had a oneyearold i would use it on them i would definitely use it on their feet and then put socks on and then i would do a small test spot on their chest to make sure they don’t have any kind of reaction justin ridgers october 30 2013 at 1112 am a lot of natural homemade lotions salves and whatnot contain coconut oil i’m highly allergic to coconut oil and many other tropical fruit based oils what would you recommend as an alternative to coconut oil for people with allergies nina november 1 2013 at 231 pm i’m sorry to hear that justin i would increase the shea butter to 34 c and whip in 14 of a liquid oil like jojoba olive almond avocado etc that way it should still be nice and light so it absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel greasy rose fagerness october 31 2013 at 1211 am do you have any similar recipe for aging skin – wrinkles and dry skin deb october 31 2013 at 530 am hi – i’m excited to try this recipe is there anything to use in place of the shea butter until i can order some thanksamy october 31 2013 at 1131 am love this recipe i have a question though i have a succulent plant that was named “vicks vapor rub plant” plectranthus tomentosaand i was wondering if you knew anything about it or its medicinal properties karen simpson october 31 2013 at 1236 pm thanks so much for sharing this i will make sure to have all of these ingredients on hand for when cold season hits — although it seems like it already has michelle october 31 2013 at 804 pm question some say you can use vicks vapor rub for your toenail fungus do you think this homemade stuff would work for that nina november 1 2013 at 232 pm i think it would help i’ve used a number of the included essential oils in an antifungus recipe i’ve made in the past and that helped a lot melinda november 6 2013 at 1015 am love this site i have one question though…is there a substitution i can use for the shea butter my son has a fatal tree nut allergy and we cannot use shea alyssa november 11 2013 at 329 pm first off i want to thank everyone who is involved with this site it is fantastic nina thanks for all your wonderful ideas and input into this cyber world both here and your blog as a mother of young children new to the world of eo i made this up right away for my very small almost 3 year old and my 4 month old i have used small amounts on the littlest feet then after testing it with my oldest used some on her chest this site and your blog has inspired me on this new journey of using eo but now i’m so confused on what is safe for children and especially infants i have tried to compare multiple lists from multiple sites there are a few across the board that seem to be safe do you know of a list or book that i can be confident using essential oils with the little ones i understand the importance of safety with eo especially since sites like mountain rose herbs say not to use essential oils on babies or infants thank you for your time it is appreciatedsande november 13 2013 at 244 pmhi  do you suggest a substitute for coconut oil used in the vapor rub allergic to coconut thankyousande november 13 2013 at 246 pmsorry
