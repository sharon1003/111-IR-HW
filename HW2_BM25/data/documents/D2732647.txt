tumor and tumor of pregnancy 1 2 is a vascular lesion that occurs on both mucosa and skin and appears as an overgrowth of tissue due to irritation physical trauma or hormonal factors 3 4 it is often found to involve the gums the skin and nasal septum and has also been found far from the head such as in the thigh 5contents  hide 1 signs and symptoms11 clinical presentation12 associated conditions2

ranging from redpink to purple and can be smooth or lobulated younger lesions are more likely to be red because of the high number of blood vessels older lesions begin to change into a pink color size commonly ranges from a few millimeters to centimeters though smaller or larger lesions may occur  medical citation needed a pyogenic granuloma can be painful especially if located in an area of the body where it is constantly disturbed pyogenic granulomas can grow rapidly and will often bleed profusely with little or no trauma they may exude an oil like substance causing the surface to be damp this is especially true if the granuloma is located on the scalp  medical citation neededpyogenic granulomas may be seen at any age and are more common in females than males in pregnant women lesions may occur in the first trimester with an increasing incidence up until the seventh month and are often seen on the gums epulis granulomatosum is a variant of pyogenic granuloma that forms only on gingiva and is often seen forming in a recent extraction socket pyogenic granulomas appear on the gingiva in 75 of cases more often in the maxillary than mandibular jaw anterior areas are more often affected than posterior areas it can also be found on the lips tongue and inner cheek poor oral hygiene or trauma are usually precipitating factors one study has suggested a correlation between pyogenic granulomas and bartonella seropositivity 6 however this association has been questioned by others 7 the microscopic appearance of a pyogenic granuloma consists of highly vascular granulation tissue inflammation is present the lesion may have a fibrous character if it is older and the surface may have ulcerations pyogenic granulomas rarely occur in the conjunctiva cornea or connective tissue of the eye following minor local trauma grossly these mass lesions resemble those occurring at more common sites the relationship of these lesion to lobular capillary hemangiomas of skin and oropharyngeal mucosa commonly referred to as pyogenic granuloma is uncertain  citation neededassociated conditions  editdue to its overwhelming incidence on the gingiva the condition is often associated with two other diseases though not because they occur together instead the three are associated with each other because they appear frequently on gingiva— peripheral giant cell granuloma and peripheral ossifying fibroma detailed analysis can be used to distinguish these conditions 8diagnosis  editthis section is empty you can help by adding to it april 2017prognosis and treatment  editprognosis is usually good however recurrence may happen with rate up to 16 presence of myxoid structures in the pyogenic granuloma may be the main cause of recurrence 9although pyogenic granulomas are not infectious or malignant treatment may be considered because of bleeding or ulceration frequently pyogenic granulomas are treated with electrodesiccation cauterization and curettage excision though laser treatment using pulsed dye laser or co 2 laser is often effective 10 11several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of topical application of the betaadrenergic antagonist timolol in the treatment of pediatric pyogenic granuloma 12there is usually no treatment if the pyogenic granuloma occurs during pregnancy since the lesion may heal spontaneously recurrent bleeding in either oral or nasal lesions may necessitate excision and cauterization sooner however if aesthetics are a concern then treatment may be pursued as well usually only minor surgery may be needed along with a dental cleaning for oral lesions to remove any calculus or other source of irritation for nasal lesions nosepicking should be discouraged history and terminology  editpyogenic granulomas were first described in 1897 by two french surgeons antonin poncet and dor who named these lesions botryomycosis hominis 13the name pyogenic granuloma is misleading as it is not a true granuloma in actuality it is a capillary hemangioma of lobular subtype which is why such a lesion is prone to bleeding 4 additionally it is also not truly pyogenic  pus producing as the cause is hormonal or traumatic and has no association with infection or pus production gallery  editsee also  edittrumpeters wart list of cutaneous conditions references  edit james william d berger timothy g et al 2006 andrews diseases of
