great basin desert click on images for a larger versionoverview the great basin desert covers a large area of land bounded by the sierra nevada  cascade mountain range to the west and the rocky mountain range to the east between these large mountain ranges are a series of valley floors basins with elevations of about 1200 metres 4000 foot these basins are interspersed by smaller mountain ranges running north to south so the typical scenery in this desert region is of broad flat plains or shallow slopes bounded by mountain ridges two scenes typical of the great basin desert left a community dominated by big sagebrush middle distance with other shrubs such as snakeweed in disturbed sites close to a road where this photo was taken note the snow lying in november right salty area dominated by scattered saltbush plants the valley floors have deep soils resulting from thousands of years of mountain erosion but these valleys receive little rainfall most of precipitation occurs as winter snow the combination of hot dry summers and cold winters results in a characteristic vegetation dominated by aromatic perennial shrubs such as various forms of sagebrush  artemisia species this vegetation type is dominated by one species big sagebrush and is known as the great basin sagebrush zone in the wetter more northerly parts there is an increasing proportion of grasses giving rise to a vegetation type termed sagebrush steppe in other scattered regions of this desert where the soil particles are very fine there are permanent lakes eg the great salt lake or temporary lakes called playas these areas and the surrounding lands can have a high salt concentration caused by the evaporation of water such areas are dominated by various types of saltbush  atriplex species giving a vegetation type known as saltdesert shrub a saltpan where the white appearance of the soil is caused by salt deposits such saltrich areas support only a few scattered plants saltbush note the tyre tracks of vehicles in the foreground near the main road other plants and animals of the great basin desert compared with the other deserts of north america the great basin desert has a rather restricted range of plants and animals for example the only major cactus is the plains pricklypear a lowgrowing spreading species see prickly pears apart from the sagebrush and saltbush species other frequent shrubs include mormon tea  ephedra species and a range of smallleaved shrubs greasewood blackbrush snakeweed etc none of these plants is highly favoured by the larger grazing or browsing animals such as mule deer and pronghorn antelope these animals do occur in the great basin desert but prefer to eat grasses in the desert steppe regions by selectively eating the grasses and smaller herbs these animals and grazing livestock tend to increase the dominance of sagebrush ecological threats one of the major ecological threats to the sagebrushdominated great basin ecosystem is the introduction and spread of alien invasive species the most important of these is an annual grass cheatgrass brome  bromus tectorum  which was introduced in the late 1800s and early 1900s from eurasia and the mediterranean region  probably as a contaminant in imported seed this plant now dominates large areas of sagebrush steppe and is highly valued by ranchers because it provides the main source of spring forage for livestock however it has largely replaced a range of native perennial grass species and equally important the large amount of dry herbage that it produces at the end of its short growing cycle leads to severe fire risk in many areas the incidence of intense wildfires has increased from once every 60100 years to once every 35 years the intense heat destroys sagebrush and the native perennial grasses and often prevents sagebrush from reestablishing because it does not regenerate quickly after fires in contrast cheatgrass brome produces abundant seeds each year and rapidly reestablishes after fires from its seedbank in the soil click here for a full account of this plant its ecological impact and the potential measures for controlling it desert biome great basin desert north american deserts gallery sonoran desert ecological processes gallery mojave desert cactus gallery chihuahuan desert mammal gallery baja california desert human impact gallery bird and reptile gallery bruchid beetles saguaro cactus soil crusts harris hawk nitrogenfixing trees alluvial fans bajadas coyote creosote bush nurse plants yucca
