generally good the median american was taking home 41392 at the end of last year up 17 from last year and slightly outpacing inflation but that headline number alone doesnt really tell the whole story as you might expect the data gets much more interesting when you start investigating certain variables like ones age and sex to get a better idea of how you compare to your peers check out the graph below which breaks down earnings by specific age groups for both men and women median american salary by age and sex in 20142024 2534 3544 4554 5564 65women men source bureau of labor statistics share median american salary by age and sex in 2014  create infographics there are two huge and important takeaways from this data younger workers earn less and women earn less lets go over what each group can do to neutralize this comparative disadvantage and still achieve financial independence younger workers still have one big advantage its makes sense that the more experience you have in your field the higher your salary will be no one should be too surprised to see the typical 24yearold earning about 45 less than her 55yearold colleagues but theres a terrible irony to the situation in general money saved and invested when youre 24 will be worth a lot more upon your retirement than money put away when youre 55 thats because it will have three more decades to compound to get an idea for what im talking about lets consider two scenarios in our first we have sarah  a hardworking 24yearold who somehow manages to put away 200 per month every month until the age of 30 after that she is no longer able to save as the additional costs of raising a family and now only working parttime take a financial toll our second subject is tim who didnt pay much attention to saving for retirement until he hit age 55 he has had aboveaverage earnings his whole career but usually spent all of that money in short order now that hes 55 he gets serious and starts putting away a whopping 1500 per month  far more than sarah did even after inflation assuming both of them earn the sp 500s historical return of about 9 who will have more money when they hit 70 surprisingly sarah willthe importance of time with your investments  create infographics this leaves us with one hard and fast conclusion be extra mindful of your spending and saving during your early working years sarah only saved for seven years but it ended up making a huge difference in the long run if nothing else make sure you do everything you can to get your maximum employer match in your 401 k or 403 b plan  if it is offered to you females earn less but save and invest more most of the time by the end of 2014 the median female worker was earning 37596 while her male counterpart was pulling in 45500 but theres a crazy irony here as well most working women have more in savings than men thats because women participate in workplace savings programs at higher rates than men and save more of their salaries than men for instance 79 of women earning between 50000 and 75000 per year participate in such programs  versus 60 for men  and sock away an average of 72 of their salary  versus 67 for men the same general pattern holds true across all income levels according to vanguard in fact for all income levels except those over 100000 per year the median female has more saved than the median male thats an impressive feat to say the least and the most obvious explanation for the difference among the highest earners is that men rarely take time off of work to help raise families  which means that they get the promotions that accompany such high salaries earlier in their careers that gives their investments more time to compound women earning over 100000 can help offset their savings shortfall by taking a more aggressive stance in how they invest their dollars although this usually means more volatility in the short term it can create greater returns over the long run what you save now matters in the end what you are able to save  and invest  right now will make a huge difference in how prepared you are for retirement if you are younger save and invest whatever you have you have a crucial advantage on your side time and if you are a woman keep up the impressive saving and investing habits if youre a high earner who wants to keep pace with your male counterparts consider taking a more aggressive investing approach and if youre behind on your retirement savings  man or woman young or old  we might have found just thing to help fool contributor brian stoffel is glad his first
