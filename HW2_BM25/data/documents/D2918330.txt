homework week 54 why is a 99 confidence interval wider than a 95 confidence interval12 a person claims to be able to predict the outcome of flipping a coin thisperson is correct 1625 times compute the 95 confidence interval on theproportion of times this person can predict coin flips correctly whatconclusion can you draw about this test of his ability to predict the future15 you take a sample of 22 from a population of test scores and the mean of yoursample is 60 a you know the standard deviation of the population is 10 what is the 99 confidence interval on the population mean b now assumethat you do not know the population standard deviation but the standarddeviation in your sample is 10 what is the 99 confidence interval on themean now18 you were interested in how long the average psychology major at your collegestudies per night so you asked 10 psychology majors to tell you the amountthey study they told you the following times 2 15 3 2 35 1 05 3 2 4 a find the 95 confidence interval on the population mean b find the 90confidence interval on the population mean100 what is meant by the term “90 confident” when constructing a confidence interval for a meana if we took repeated samples approximately 90 of the samples would produce the same confidence intervalb if we took repeated samples approximately 90 of the confidence intervals calculated from those samples wouldcontain the sample meanc if we took repeated samples approximately 90 of the confidence intervals calculated from those samples wouldcontain the true value of the population meand if we took repeated samples the sample mean would equal the population mean in approximately 90 of thesamples106 suppose that a committee is studying whether or not there is waste of time in our judicial system it is interested inthe mean amount of time individuals waste at the courthouse waiting to be called for jury duty the committee randomlysurveyed 81 people who recently served as jurors the sample mean wait time was eight hours with a sample standarddeviation of four hoursai¯  ii s x  iii n  iv n – 1  b define the random variables x andin wordsc which distribution should you use for this problem explain your choiced construct a 95 confidence interval for the population mean time wastedi state the confidence intervalii sketch the graphiii calculate the error bounde explain in a complete sentence what the confidence interval means116 a quality control specialist for a restaurant chain takes arandom sample of size 12 to check the amount of soda served in the 16 oz serving size the sample mean is 1330 with asample standard deviation of 155 assume the underlying population is normally distributed what is the error bounda 087b 198c 099d 174130 on may 23 2013 gallup reported that of the 1005 people surveyed 76 of u s workers believe that they willcontinue working past retirement age the confidence level for this study was reported at 95 with a ±3 margin of errora determine the estimated proportion from the sampleb determine the sample sizec identify cl and αd calculate the error bound based on the information providede compare the error bound in part d to the margin of error reported by gallup explain any differences between thevaluesf create a confidence interval for the results of this studyg a reporter is covering the release of this study for a local news station how should she explain the confidenceinterval to her audience
