the green sea turtle is commonly seen near shore in hawaii about hawaiis sea turtles hawaii is the home to five species of sea turtles see column at right olive ridleys loggerheads and leatherbacks are usually only encountered in deep offshore waters but its common for snorkelers and divers on all the islands to see the honu green sea turtle in near shore waters green sea turtles however nests in the northwestern hawaiian islands a remote protected area where they thrive unfortunately honu greens are suffering from a disease called fibropapillomatosis this herpesfamily virus causes the growth of white to blackish cauliflowerlike tumors these grow on the soft tissues of the turtle’s body internally and externally and inhibit foraging breathing mobility and digestion it is unclear what causes this disease but research is ongoing worldwide to find a cure to some the hawaiian name for hawksbill sea turtles is ea but for others they are known as honuea hawaiian hawksbill turtles nest on the main hawaiian islands predominately on the big island of hawai‘i however a few hawksbills and green sea turtles also nest on maui each year due to their rarity hawksbills are watched over very carefully and are a primary subject for hwfs research projects in 1993 and 1996 two eggladen hawksbills and numerous hatchlings were killed by cars while trying to cross north kihei road from the adjacent nesting beach in response hwf was formed volunteers patrolled the beaches nightly and in 1998 constructed a sand fence to help keep turtles off the road this began the first systematic monitoring and research of this species on maui since then much has been learned about hawksbills nesting hatching and foraging behaviors 2004 sea turtle symposium proceedings pdf 477 kb 2009 turtle

hwf researches and protects nesting hawksbill sea turtles on maui hwf has helped to restore hawksbill nesting habitats through conservation efforts and a public awareness campaign hwf initiated a volunteer beach watch program called “the dawn patrol” now a usfws program installed and continuously repairs a fence to promote dune restoration and tracks nesting female turtles by radio and satellite during nesting season hwf volunteers spend all night and day monitoring nests for weeks at a time to ensure emerging hatchlings reach the ocean safely hwf also leads beach cleanups by

green sea turtles but it is important that people or dogs dont scare the turtles back into the ocean the presence of people doesnt allow for turtles to rest imagine if someone was standing next to you when you were trying to sleep hwf recommends staying 15 feet 5 meters away and don’t block their access either to or from the ocean please avoid making loud noises and please do not use flash

starvation if the hook doesn’t allow the turtle to close its mouth limb amputation if the line gets wrapped so taught that it cuts through the skin and bone or drowning if the line or hook gets caught on the reef and prevents the turtle from surfacing to breathe along with noaa hwf is documenting these incidences to quantify this problem which will hopefully lead to solutions assisting turtles in these situations isnt easy or safe so we advise that you do not attempt a rescue yourself safety first please send us the information turtles location hook or line description size of turtle behavior and any pictures hwf accesses expert noaa veterinary advice on these situations as we certainly dont want to do more harm than good if safe conditions allow it as good samaritans we can search for the

lighting fixtures can be retrofitted to become turtle safe coastal lighting deters nesting females from coming ashore to nest and disorients hatchlings when they are navigating to the sea this is a serious problem but can be corrected quite easily and inexpensively the leilani kai resort and the kealia resort are great examples of successful projects follow these coastal lighting guidelines keep outdoor beachfront lighting turned off during the nesting and hatching season maydecember in hawaii place security lighting on motion sensor switches to keep lighting off when not needed draw curtains soon after dark or apply dark window tinting to windows visible from the beach if lights must be used reduce lights pointing directly onto beaches and near shore waters by lowering shielding recessing andor redirecting light sources minimize the number and wattage of outdoor lights replace existing lights with those that emit less detrimental lights to sea turtles the best lights to use are low pressure sodium vapor lamps which emit a pure yellow light yellow incandescent light bulbs commonly called bug lights are also preferable if they are kept at low wattage avoid fluorescent mercury
