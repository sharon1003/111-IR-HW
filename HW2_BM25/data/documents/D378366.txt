conjunctivitis conjunctivitis also called pink eye is a common highly contagious eye infection that often is spread among children in day care centers classrooms and similar environments teachers and day care workers also are at increased risk of pink eye when they work in close quarters with young children common infectious conjunctivitis types often have viral or bacterial origins infants also can acquire conjunctival eye infections gonococcal and chlamydial conjunctivitis during birth when a mother has a sexually transmitted disease other viral eye infections viral keratitis besides common pink eye other viral eye infections include ocular herpes which occurs with exposure to the herpes simplex virus fungal keratitis this type of eye infection made worldwide news in 2006 when a contact lens solution now withdrawn from the market was linked to an outbreak among contact lens wearers the fungal eye infection was associated with fusarium fungi commonly found in organic matter this and other fungi can invade the eye in other ways such as through a penetrating injury caused by a tree branch acanthamoeba keratitis contact lens wearers are at increased risk of encountering parasites

united states an eye infection known as trachoma related to chlamydia trachomatis is so widespread in certain underdeveloped regions that it is a leading cause of blindness flies can spread the infection in unsanitary environments and reinfection is a common problem trachoma typically infects the inner eyelid which begins to scar scarring then causes an inturning of the eyelid and eyelashes begin to brush against and destroy tissue on the cornea with resulting permanent blindness good hygiene and availability of treatments such as oral antibiotics are essential to controlling trachoma endophthalmitis when an eye infection penetrates the eyes interior as with bacterial endophthalmitis blindness could result without immediate treatment often with potent antibiotics this type of infection can occur with a penetrating eye injury or as a rare complication of eye surgery such as cataract surgery any time the eyes globe is penetrated and injured significantly there is a 4 to 8 percent risk of endophthalmitis  mold that penetrates the eyes interior also can cause endophthalmitis though rarely with most cases reported in tropical regions reporting eye infections had a bad

lower eyelids to create a stye or chalazion when infection invades the eyes tear glands inflammatory conditions such as dacryostenosis and uveitis can result infection also can lead to inflammation and blockage of the eyes tear drainage system and cause dacryocystitis infection can be an underlying cause of a corneal ulcer which resembles an abscess on the eye if left untreated a corneal ulcer can lead to severe vision loss more serious eye infections can penetrate the deeper interior portions of the eye to create sightthreatening conditions such as endophthalmitis with orbital cellulitis infection found in and around the soft tissue of the eyelids represents an emergency because the condition can spread if left untreated eye infection treatments fortunately most common bacterial eye infections clear up particularly with prompt treatment such as prescription antibiotic eye drops or ointments and compresses many common viral eye infections resolve on their own in cases of severe viral eye infections an antiviral eye drop may be prescribed some viral eye infections require careful administration of steroid eye drops to reduce related inflammation depending on the underlying

eyelids and before handling contact lenses at home if any family members have a red eye or a confirmed eye infection keep their bedding and towels clean and dont let them share these items with anyone
