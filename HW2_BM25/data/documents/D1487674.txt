people commonly confuse the types of coils within their air conditioning system when it comes to the condenser coil and evaporator coil they are every similar in the way that they both take the heat from the matter however each has its own specific purpose here the exact purposes of each of the coils condenser coils – the condenser coils are a series of tubes that are filled with a refrigerant the condenser coils then remove the heat from the extremely hot gaseous refrigerant it then turns the refrigerant into a liquid before it exits the condenser coils the whole purpose of the condenser coils is to change the state of matter of the refrigerant from gaseous matter to liquid matter before it has to enter the evaporator coils evaporator coils – the evaporator coils absorb the heat when air is passed through the air conditioning system the coils look like a series of pipes the warm is brought through the evaporator coils and it absorbs the heat once the heat is absorbed its sends the cool air back into the home through a series of air ducts however there are three different types of evaporator coils and each of them with their own specific purpose to make all the coils work together different types of coils1 vertical evaporator coil is used to work with the upward and downward flow of air it also condenses the heat to take any extra water out and drain it to lower the humidity of the home’s air as the vertical evaporator coil cools it2 cased evaporator coils are coils that have a protective outer covering and are the most common in north american homes these coils handle the upward and downward air flow the coils use a coolant to attract the warm air to have only the cool air stay then the cool air returns to the home through the ducts3 uncased evaporator coil are similar to the cased evaporator coils however they are not cased the uncased evaporator coils are the most unique because they can be adapted to specific conditions since the technician can reform the shape to make it fit in a specific device these are the most unique coil the condenser coil and the evaporator coil each have their own purpose even if they may appear similar they have their own specific purpose to make the air conditioning system work correctly
