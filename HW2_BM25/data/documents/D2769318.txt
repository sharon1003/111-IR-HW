unlikely foods with health benefits an increasing body of research has found that drinking coffee—even four or more cups per day in some instances—provides health benefits and a 13year study of 402260 aarp members conducted by the national cancer institute which was published may 17 in the new england journal of medicine concluded that devoted coffee drinkers were associated with a reduced risk of early death by up to 16 percent“this is perhaps the most compelling because the study was so large” says robert davis at emory university’s rollins school of public health and author of “coffee is good for you from vitamin c and organic foods to lowcarb and detox diets the truth about diet and nutrition claims” he noted that the study was observational so it doesn’t prove cause and it effect

less likely according to a 2011 report in the archives of internal medicine3 memory improvement coffee can help with both long and shortterm memory in a 2005 study presented at the radiological society of north america researchers found that consuming two cups of caffeinated coffee improved shortterm memory and reaction times interestingly a 2007 study found that women  but not men  who were 65 or older who drank more than three cups of coffee each day performed better on memory tests and were less likely to show memory decline than those who drank just one cup a day although researchers have known for some time that coffee can decrease the risk of alzheimer’s disease researchers at the university of south florida in 2011 found that a distinctive interaction between caffeine and coffee might be why they recommend drinking four to five cups daily starting in middle age to increase gcsf granulocyte colony stimulating factor which is decreased in alzheimer’s patients and improves memory in mice4 less risk for diabetes studies suggest that coffee drinkers are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes with those putting away four or more cups daily 50 percent less likely a january 2012 report in the journal of agricultural  food chemistry might explain why it attributes the effect to compounds in coffee that block h iapp a polypeptide that can result in abnormal protein fibers which are found in people with type 25 decreases cancer risk coffee consumption has been associated with decreased risk of breast endometrial prostate and liver cancers and those linked with obesity estrogen and insulin a 2008 swedish study found that drinking at least two to three cups a day reduced the risk or delayed the onset of breast cancer a 2011 study in breast cancer research

loss  an average of 17 pounds in obese adults during a 22week period researchers didn’t think it was the caffeine rather they credited the chlorogenic acid which might reduce glucose absorption7 lower risk for parkinson’s disease the journal of the american medical association in 2000 found that the caffeine intake associated with coffee translated into a lower risk of developing parkinson’s a 2010 study found that drinking two to three cups of coffee daily can mean up to a 25 percent less chance of developing the disease8 antioxidative properties harvard researcher edward giovannucci in research published in cancer epidemiology biomarkers  prevention noted that coffee has more antioxidants than most vegetables and fruits in fact a 2005 study found that coffee is the no 1 source for
