delrin delrin af blend is a unique thermoplastic material for use in moving parts in which low friction and long wear life are important it is a combination of ptfe fibers uniformly dispersed in delrin acetal resin this combination offers better wear characteristics than unfilled delrin delrin af blend supplied as a 21 blend of delrin af100 and delrin 150 resins has excellent slidingfriction properties bearings made of delrin af blend can operate at higher speeds while exhibiting reduced wear these bearings are also essentially free of slipstick behavior because the static and dynamic coefficient of friction are closer than with most plastics delrin af blend retains 90 of the strength that is inherent in unmodified delrin acetal some properties are changed due to the addition of the softer ptfe fiber the natural color of delrin af blend is dark brown please select from the drop down menus in the area below and you may browse by design material or application depending on your need if you know exactly what you are looking for you can simply type what product name you want in the search box ex acetal or nylonto help you find the right product we offer the following optionsfilter by materialfilter by industryfilter by applicationfilter by designsearch our catalogcall us at 1 8887685759 to talk with one of our expert products 16title description acetal rod  13 af blendacetal af blend has excellent slidingfrictionwear properties acetal sheet  13 af blendacetal af blend has excellent slidingfrictionwear properties acetal rod  blackacetal is a tough stable engineering thermoplastic acetal sheet  black extrudedacetal is a tough stable engineering thermoplastic delrin ®sheet  blackdelrin offers an excellent balance of properties that bridge the gap b  acetal rod  naturalacetal is a tough stable engineering thermoplastic acetal sheet  natural extrudedacetal is a tough stable engineering thermoplastic delrin ®sheet  naturaldelrin offers an excellent balance of properties that bridge the gap b  acetal sheet esd naturalesd acetal contains no carbon fibers or powders and is for clean room  ertalyte ®tx pet sheetinternally lubricated with enhanced wear and resistance properties ver  noryl rod  black medical grademedical grade noryl is an excellent material for medical devices ertalyte ®pet sheetpet featuring excellent dimensional stability and superior wear chemi  turcite rod  aselflubricating engineered thermoplastic turcite rod  xturcite ® x is a selflubricating engineered thermoplast  uhmw sheet  black reprocessedreprocessed uhmw is recommended for less demanding applications versus  uhmw ipx 2000 sheet  advanced wear technologyipx 2000 is an advanced engineered polyethylene that has greater bene
