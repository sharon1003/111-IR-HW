fertilized an egg during that time best of luckmommyallie · 8 years ago1 1 comment askers rating for the best answers search on this site httpssmarturlima d4ep yes a girl can get pregnant after her period it all depends on when a girl ovulates when an egg is released which usually happens on average 14 days after her period began but this number is different in all women and sperm can survive a few days in the body of a women maybe 2 or 3 days so there could be a chance that egg and sperm can meet usually the time right before a girls period is when its least likely to conceive joann · 2 years ago0 0 comment it isnt impossible for a girl to become pregnant on her period however this is the most unlikey time to concieve a child it can happen though if you are trying to get pregnant the best time to have sex is 14 days into the girls menstural cycle in other words 14 days from the beginning of the girls period if you are not trying to get pregnant i suggest you always use a condom as well as another method of birth control just becuase it is highly unlikely to get a girl pregnant when she is on her period it is not impossible i think she should do a test if her next period is late hope this is helpful for you rachel · 8 years ago3 0 comment when you cant get pregnant and things look good from the outside it can be extremely frustrating the first thing to consider is how long have you been trying about 80 of couples will get pregnant after six months of trying and about 90 will be pregnant after 12 months of trying to get pregnant anyway this is a great method to get pregnant fast source shttpstrimd0urranonymous · 3 years ago0 0 comment if you are wondering how to get pregnant fast then you have come to the right place because this article will discuss 5 things you absolutely must know if your desire is to conceive that dream child 1 it is very important that both you and your partner get a medical check up to be certain that you are able to have children this will be very reassuring for you and believe me you will need this especially if things dont happen as quick as you expect it to 2 make love as often as possible especially right after your menstrual cycle and for the next 20 days after even better still make love every single day until your next period you may be wondering why 20days this is because that time frame would include the fertile window for most women the general thinking is that most women ovulate release an egg on day 14 but i can assure you that this is certainly not the case i recently got pregnant using the methods i am discussing with you here and it turns out when i went for my dating scan that i ovulated on the 8th day hard to believe isnt it well it is true i have always had short menstrual cycles lasting between 20 and 22 days so if want to know how to get pregnant fast and your menstrual cycles are shorter or longer than the so called average of 14 days then you need to know precisely when you ovulate as a very general rule of the thumb just subtract 14 from the length of your menstrual cycle so for example if your menstrual cycle is 24days in length then you are likely to ovulate on 2414 day 10 the most accurate method though is to use your cervical mucus fluid which tends to become stretchier thinner and egg white in appearance when you are most fertile 3 if you really want to get pregnant fast then it is important that you avoid all forms of lubrication eg ky jelly and vaseline research has shown that most storebought lubricants damage the sperm there is a natural alternative and it is the egg white which is extremely sperm friendly 4 improve the quality and quantity of your cervical mucus apart from using it to predict your most fertile days your cervical fluid also serves 2 important functions a it provides nourishment mobility and medium in which your partners sperm can thrive and live b it provides an alkaline medium which protects the sperm from and otherwise acidic vagina so what are some of the things you can do to improve your cervical fluid make you sure eat foods high in vitamin a drink plenty of water and take plain robitussin 5 if you really want to know how to get pregnant fast then take a look at the medications you may be taking certain medications affect fertility and you need to be aware of them so that you can stop using them and look for alternatives that will not affect your chances of conception example include anabolic steroids cimetidine used in treating ulcers antihypertensive drugs specifically calcium channel blockers antidepressants just to mention a few to discover many true proven tested and accurate facts tips secrets and the single best way to get pregnant at any age in just 8 weeks visit

arousal is what it comes down to if you ejaculate once even twice before actual intercourse that might help you out what i always tell guys to do is to lay on their partner penetrate but do not thrust just remain in this position and take time to cuddle kiss talk dirty whatever else then slowly work your way towards thrusting and if you feel yourself start to want to blow stop even pull out if you have to then take time to go down on her more foreplay and such the resume sex stopping before you get to that point of no return in time practicing this method you should be able to recognize your levels of arousal and control your orgasms and teach yourself to last as long as you want the issue is purely a mental one in most cases and it is all about self control and being able to recognize your physical responses to sex and cognitively be able to control them chances are if you are turned on enough as long as you can last a few minutes that should be long enough if you orgasm once in many men they may need to cool down for a minute but they can still get an erection and have sex a second third or even more times after that if the problem is severe enough my advice is that you see an actual sex therapist and maybe try taking ssri antidepressants if you do get on pills like that dont use that as a cure all and it might work too well and prevent you from orgasm altogether if you do go that route use them as part of therapy and still consult an expert you can over come pe and learn to last as long as you want thougharnold · 1 year ago0 0 commentyes i got pregnant on my period
