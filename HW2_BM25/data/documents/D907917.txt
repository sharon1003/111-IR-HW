funky fuel tank how do i really know how much gas in in my tank powerfuelfordgasolinemercurysablefueleconomyfogus57 20140109 140308 utc 1hey guys i have a dilemma i own a 2000 mercury sable same thing as a ford taurus and there’s something fishy about my fuel tank the owner’s manual car spec websites and dealer documents all state that it has an 18 gallon fuel tank however even when i brim the tank after driving around on e i can never get past 13 gallons into the tank yesterday i drove 25 miles after the fuel light came on and the gas pump quit pumping at 129 gallons and i only managed to get 131 in after that this is supposed to be an 18 gallon tank so what gives is my fuel level sensor malfunctioning and i’m driving around with 5 more gallons than i think i have is there something inside my gas tank ever since watching the show border wars i speculate that there is either a bundle of cash or maybe some weed in the tank i bought the car used even though 5 gallons is not that much having a 13 gallon tank in a 14 year old car where the mpg has dropped drastically over the years can be a pain anyone have any ideas or ways i can get to the bottom of this issue thanksvdcdriver 20140109 163739 utc 2it is very possible that the gas tank is dented and as a result has less than its specified capacity you might want to get underneath the car in order to see if the tank is dentedoblivion 20140109 164745 utc 3i suspect that you may have a smaller tank maybe the production run changed and a smaller tank was used on some maybe it was replaced before you got the car maybe the car came with different size tanks and the 18gallon was an option that yours doesn’t have it would have to be quite the dent in the tank to lose 45 gallons of capacity possibly a dealer or maybe there’s even a website that can decode your vin and tell you what the car actually shipped with i guess the only other way to really tell would be to run it bone dry and refill it but that’s not really a good idea for many reasons i would probably just stop worrying about it and pretend you actually have a 15gallon tank busted knuckles 20140109 173144 utc 4i think your tank level float is miscalibrated the sensor is a simple variable resistor with a long thin rod and a float on the end the rod can bend and throw off the tank level sensor the only way to know for sure is to run the tank near empty then lower it to see how much is still in it or see how far you can run on an empty tank until you run out of gascigroller 20140109 183113 utc 5any of the above noted possibilities is plausible i don’t know your level of mechanical savvy but if you really wanted to get to the bottom of it pun accidental you could wait until the fuel light comes on disconnect a fuel line rig it to a gas can and energize the fuel pump and pump the tank dry once you know its empty see how much gas you have in the can put it back in then fill up on a completely different note its not normal for fuel economy to drop drastically unless there are things that need attention if a car is kept in good shape it’s fuel economy should remain pretty stablelion9car 20140109 191719 utc 6i agree with cigroller how much has your fuel economy dropped are you uptodate on all maintenance is the checkengine light onmissileman 20140109 200401 utc 7i agree with all the possible problems with your gas tank and i will add one more if it’s a used car then someone could have changed the gas tank for any number of reasons whitey 20140109 201829 utc 8fogus57cigroller is right that fuel economy doesn’t decline over the life of the car unless there is something wrong that needs to be fixed i drive a 16yearold car with 251000 miles on the odometer and i just checked my fuel economy on the last trip i took my fuel economy was better than the epa estimate that was on the sticker when i bought the car 15 years ago don’t top off your tank you wrote “…the gas pump quit pumping at 129 gallons and i only managed to get 131 in after that” why did you add the additional 02 gallons after the pump stopped if you top off your tank often you might have damaged your evaporative emission system the charcoal canister through which your gas tank vents this might explain why the pump stops before you fill the tank completely do you have an illuminated “check engine” light i’m betting you do this might or might not be related to this fuel tank issuefogus57 20140110 063312 utc 9i really appreciate all the responses guys thank you so much cigroller the car runs great no check engine light i’m all up to date with the necessary maintenance and i just had an oil filter change about 500 miles ago i’m griping about fuel economy because i’ve been driving the car in an extremely hilly town that requires me going up a lot of hills with the automatic trans the car doesn’t get to up shift as soon as it usually would on flat terrain and i find my self in the 2500  3000 rpm range which is higher than than usual shift point fuel economygov says city driving should return 17 mpg but when i last calculated it i was getting about 12 mpg i try to keep my foot out of it too so i’m not burning gas that way busted knuckles i have thought about draining the tank and seeing where she cuts out but i don’t want to bring any of the sludge thru the fuel filters when the tank gets sucked dry oblivion the car is model year 2000 and was manufactured in 200 i know the sable  taurus was refreshed for that year mechanically and cosmetically and platform that it was revised upon had been in production since 1996 the fuel tank for the generation before mine was 16 gallons still leaving 3 gallons unaccounted for whitey i know i cringed when i topped the tank off and i assure you i never pump more gas in after it stops pumping i did it this time to see exactly how many gallons i could get into it before i posted this discussion so i guess my options are to run it dry and see if i do have 5 extra gallons check to see if the tank is replaced or maybe take it to a shop to check it out unfortunately i am not that mechanically savvy i’m open to any suggestions that you all have thanks a bunch cigroller 20140110 064006 utc 10you won’t hurt anything by running the tank dry  but i would do it into a container instead of waiting to just run out of gas on the road someplace i can’t tell you for the sable but there’s usually a hot wire under the hood someplace pull a fuel line run a jumper from the battery and let the pump pump the fuel out into a gas can that’s if you really want to know i would still look at things that might be pulling down the fuel economy hills or no what goes up must come down it can’t be uphill all of the time and as much as you’re getting terrible gas mileage up you’ll be getting great mileage coming down i’m not saying it will all even out to what you’d get on flat terrain but 12mpg is pretty low for that car coolant temp sensor thermostat old tired o2 sensorsoldtimer11 20140110 073045 utc 11i think hills and cold weather easily account for the difference between 15 and 12 mpgoldtimer11 20140110 073330 utc 12as for what goes up the hill must come down coming down the hill you are using your brakes and turning all that energy you used going up into heat going downcigroller 20140110 074552 utc 13oldtimer11 even 15 is pretty low for a sable and whether you have to use your brakes a lot when you come down depends on how you drive but it also doesn’t change the fact that if you do a lot of downhill coasting or nearcoasting you get wildly high gas mileage  whether you have to use your brakes or not so if you just climbed 14 mile while hammering it you might be getting 5mpg or something but on the way back down  well idk all of the instant economy computers maxed out at 99mpg but i sometimes have some fun on trips looking at these things and its frequently showing 99mpg on a downhill  whether i apply the brakes or not gravity is gravity if i was the op i would continue to look into the fuel economy and if he’s getting as good as it gets then so be it but i wouldn’t just sit around making assumptions mayday 20140110 082623 utc 14can you rule out the teenage neighbor with a siphon be a shame if a locking gas cap would fix all your problems and i suppose its unfair of me to pick on teenagers but that sounds like something i might of done a few years or decades ago whitey 20140110 181942 utc 15cigroller “hills or no what goes up must come down”then how did my grandfather walk to school uphill both ways pvt public 20140110 183036 utc 16i don’t know about anyone else but i would rather the gauge read empty and still had 5 gals in the tank than reading 14 tank with only 1 gal in the tankkengreen 20140111 012828 utc 1718 gallons was an option but 16 was the norm so i’d be highly curious about the dented theory georgesanjose1 20140111 064601 utc 18it seems like this puzzle has to be caused by one of these three things the tank doesn’t have the capacity the op thinks it does the tank isn’t completely empty when the op thinks it is the tank isn’t completely full when the op thinks it is it seems like if you drive the car until it stalls bc out of gas that’s about the best you can do for number 2 for number 3 it is possible the venting system isn’t allowing you to fully fill the tank maybe the vent line which normally goes to the purge valve or canister could be disconnected temporarily to see if it is possible to fill the tank more this could all be damagaing to the car or be dangerous by the way as running the tank out of gas can pull in debris into the fuel filter and injectors can damage the cat and gas fume or gasoline itself could spill out if you disconnect any venting hoses maybe better to just live wit busted knuckles 20140111 090147 utc 19just a bit offtopic but i’ve been hearing this crap about running the tank low and the pump pulling crud from the bottom hate to burst your bubble but every fuel pump i’ve replaced in all efi cars pull gas from the bottom of the tank it is already pulling crud full tank half tank or near empty i have yet to see a tank with a load of crud at the bottom of it some debris sure but not a good load of silt the fuel filters however are a much different story my 2 cts rant over thanksoldtimer11 20140111 092119 utc 20cigroller you do realize that if you get 5 mpg going up the hill and 99 all the way down your average is less than 10 mpg also the op stated the epa city was 15 i have never had a car that bettered it’s city rating around town highway ratings i have beaten on the road but not citynext page →
