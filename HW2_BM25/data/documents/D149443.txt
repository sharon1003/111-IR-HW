home  garden lesson one the price the contractor quotes is an estimate by caitlin kelly feb 22 2007edel rodriguez in a recent letter to her readers dominique browning the longtime editor of house  garden magazine wrote about the agony of renovation but suggested her experience was so painful that she preferred not to give details “i’m still in shock and not ready to talk about it” she wrote it’s a little chilling if she can’t survive a renovation unscathed who can few endeavors seem more challenging than renovating one’s home whether a 300squarefoot studio or a mansion 30 times that size having accurate information about what to expect would probably make things easier while many consumers could guess the price of a flatscreen tv or a dishwasher few could easily estimate the cost of even the simplest renovation to anticipate and understand costs those considering renovations should appreciate the importance of geography labor is much higher in the northeast than in the midwest said bruce woolf founder and owner of quaker road associates a building and remodeling company in chappaqua n y related coverage five smart moves and five big mistakes feb 22 2007insurance costs are also higher in the northeast insurance for workers’ compensation and liability necessary no matter how minor the job can cost contractors as much as 30 percent more in the northeast than it does in the midwest he said“the price of materials doesn’t drive the cost of the project so much as the price of qualified labor” he said “my highestpaid employee makes 90000 per year”competition is also a factor in markets where many wealthy people want to renovate a 30000 or 50000 kitchen is competing for labor with someone else’s 100000 bathroom said lee j stahl president of the renovated home a manhattanbased remodeling company even a moderately priced contractor is “shooting at the highest star” and may shirk the work on your home as deeper pockets beckon even in the middle of a job that translates into very different costs per square foot depending on where you live renovation experts say it is extremely difficult to accurately compare costs regionally because of such variations to get the most uptodate assessment of local costs it is best to ask local contractors and salespeople at building supply stores about rates one extensive source of detailed data including the estimated resale value of each renovation is the web site for remodeling magazine remodelinghwnet data may be found by clicking on “special features” and in that pulldown menu “cost versus value” the site reports that in 2006 an upscale bath renovation cost an average of 43050 in the pacific states 35212 in the south atlantic region and 36868 in the mountain states while the national average was 38165 contractors and homeowners alike agree on one point get everything in writing but don’t haggle do not contractors warn nickel and dime the people you hire to tear your home apart and don’t automatically take the low bid because that could be a signal that the contractor is very inexperienced and perhaps not up to the job“they’re going to ask to be paid professionally” said mr stahl whose crew of 28 designers and 20 workmen is booked five months in advance typically on projects worth 100000 or more “if they’re behaving like a professional they expect to be paid like a professional”edel rodriguez dean bennett president of a 12yearold design and construction firm in castle rock colo a denver suburb said customers need to realize that complexities are revealed as jobs go along and that costs increase “most people don’t understand the tasks time and intricacies involved in building a wall let alone larger projects” he said “estimate prices and multiply by 15 times for a truer figure”mr bennett warned of exceptionally low or high pricing “contractors should always be upfront with what they charge” hourly or by project he said watch for markups on materials know what the markup is and monitor it if you have hired someone who charges a 20 percent markup on each item for example ask to review invoices so you can see for yourself what the contractor paid and what you are paying“i show every client every invoice and every week they get a running total” he said “it’s a more upfront way to do business”“you want an understanding of what’s happening and where your money is going” he said “a lot of contractors will bill their time plus materials i prefer that because no one’s trying to get away with anything by buying cheaper materials and marking them up in order to make their profit”to keep a contractor working and motivated mr bennett suggested weekly invoicing and payment mr woolf whose chappaqua business has a fulltime staff of 12 agrees that clients need to be aware of costs but should not underestimate them “the biggest mistake a prospective client makes going into a project is not having a realistic budget” he said “clients often have a preconceived notion of what something ‘should’ cost they are wrong it’s always more”“you’re not buying a commodity item” he added “different builders have different overheads profit margins and place a different value on their work a plumber charging 2000 to 3000 has a shop a license and insurance” mr woolf said “he owns trucks and he has payroll plus don’t forget the cost of materials”homeowners should learn what’s involved in a renovation lee stahl said “if your budget has no flexibility become the most educated person on the planet” he said “take a community college class understand the work the nuts and bolts of it”he and others highly recommend the videos and books produced by the television shows “this old house” and “hometime” carl heldmann a longtime contractor is the author of “be your own house contractor” which has sold 300000 copies and offers sample contracts and a glossary in english and spanish even the tightest budget can accommodate 500 worth of education mr stahl said if you can’t afford a mistake learn how to avoid one some homeowners — if they have the expertise — undertake as much of the work as possible themselves to save money ken golub a chicago public school teacher who has spent 50000 remodeling his 100yearold house near wrigley field estimates that he has saved another 50000 by doing much of the painting plastering and wood stripping himself tasks like those are more easily undertaken than plumbing or electrical work which contractors say should be left to professionals last summer mr golub excavated and installed his own patio a job quoted at 8000 he did it for 4000 by renting heavy equipment like a jackhammer and soil compactor from home depot “it was backbreaking work” he said the worst renovations are crippled by indecision mr woolf said that on one job the client demanded so many revisions that “the cost of the changes was astronomical”“the job went from 350000 to over 500000” he said a version of this article appears in
