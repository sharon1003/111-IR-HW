fashionedposted by old mr boston  0637pm 71506use bar sugar sprite tastes better with everythingposted by trayce2671  0139am 72006i think almost all drinks requiring water or whatever taste much better with sprite old fashionedsposted by marlene  0946am 90906my dad always used old overholt rye whiskey when making these and instead of water he used lemon and lime soft drink these are the greatest niceposted by rune lancer  0626pm 102906ahhh finally someone posting the real traditional recipe to an old fashioned people who top off their cocktails with soda water should not be allowed to mix in the first place a sweeter alternativeposted by 0ption  0306am 121706omit water top off with ginger ale old fashioneds should not be stirredposted by b kleinricht  0952pm 121806i was always taught to not stir an old fashioned the beauty of the drink is to begin with the whiskey and finish with the sweet and bitter combination at the end of the drink old fashionedposted by scott w  1254am 10307this was grandpas favorite drink and one i enjoy very much i use essentially the same recipe but i dont muddle the cherry just use it as a final garnish use only enough water to dissolve the sugar then add bitters and muddle w orange slice then add the bourbon  ice when i make them the glass is just over half full if youre only satisfied with a full glass then by all means double up the recipe but for gramps sake please dont fill it with soda water agreeposted by laura  1244pm 11907for some reason very few bartenders can make these i should forward this recipe to the idiot that made mine last night with lots of ice and seltzer in a nice cognac glass argyumposted by me  0631pm 21407this is the greatest recipe ever whatposted by bob  0313pm 33007thats not the original recipe the original recipe had no mushed cherry or orange its a lemon peel and you should never use soda old fashionedposted by jenni  0126pm 40607i prefer my old fashioned sour instead of sweet with brandy very tastyrecommend waterposted by bill spain  0729am 52007my favorite cocktail when made correctly good luck finding a bartender that will why on earth would you want to make it sweeter with sprite just seems it would wreck the flavor of a good bourbon id suggest trying this recipe with labrot  grahams woodford reserve or the always reliable knob creek i also suggest that you do muddle the cherry as the flavor of bourbon and cherry is a classic combo patienceposted by laura  1001pm 60107i liked thie recipe quite a bit and will make mine accordingly from this day forward i am a newer bartender myself and find all the negative comments about bartenders that dont make old fashioneds properly to be disgraceful have we lost all sense of patience in my bar book it actually says not to muddle and to top with soda  point being that drinks can be made so many different ways and not all bartenders are taught all of them if your bartender doesnt make you your drink the way you like ask them to make it according to your specifications the good ones wont be offended and you might just make every future old fashioned drinker a little happier by passing on your knowledgesimple syrupposted by some dude  0959pm 72907this is one of my favorite cocktails ive tried it several different ways and this one is pretty close to the best as with any good cocktail it provides a good frame for the liquor and enhances its natural characteristics while reducing its harshness i personally use simple syrup instead of sugar and water and delay adding the cherry until after the muddling mangled cherry corpse floating in your drink is not that appealing and soda water should never come anywhere near your old fashioned its a real shame that there are bartender guides that still include soda in their recipes patience reduxposted by steve  0744pm 90107thank you laura for posting what i wanted to say to all these old fashioned drinkers who are sooo dissatisfied though apparently unable to communicate with a bartender what it is they would like different about their drink best old fashioned recipeposted by j jeffrey donahue  0122am 90907is the one at this site with 1 oz of sweet vermouth added dont laugh try it the added sweetness neatly balances the drink under no circumstances should club soda ginger ale perrier or anything else that sparkles be added if your bartender serves you a sparkling old fashioned you have been cheated the best way to get an old fashioned you like is to perfect your own recipe then instruct the bartender on how to make your old fashioned this will avoid you being served a bourbon  soda when you order an old fashioned also ascertain whether the bar has angostura bitters when you order relatively few bars stock angostura bitters anymore and you cannot make an old fashioned without angostura bitters if your bar does not have angostura bitters order some other drink besides an old fashoned add sweet vermouth  get a manhattanposted by jr  0828pm 120807i agree that sweet vermouth goes great with this however that drink is distinctly known as a manhattan minus the muddled orangemuddle muddle toil and troubleposted by tomcat  0904pm 120907i muddle without the cherry and add later soda yes but just enough to top off no more than 1 oz at least 3 oz of kentucky bourbon early times has a nice bite that offsets the sweetness and please have at least 3 or 4 vermouth additive  posted by captain stubing  0912pm 120907if you do that all you have is a skewed manhattan while its an excellent drink i believe an old fashioned should be left without it however i fully agree with everyone that if one is ordered and its not to your liking send it back ive made an acquiaintance of many by talking to them about cocktail preparation has anyone used powdered sugar and water in lieu of simple syrup i prefer to enjoy my evening cocktail at home and dont use simple syrup enough for it not to spoil it lasted about 3 months but i went to use it and finally saw mold better than the one in my bookposted by seaking  0545pm 121107i make an old fashioned with simple syrup and do not muddle oranges or cherries i dont want bits of things in my drink instead i peel an orange over the glass and express the oils into it and add the orange peel and cherry last also i add a dash or two of regans orange bitters of course dont forget the
