in his early fifties doran is a cautious pensive and subtle man 3 4 he is prone to think long on the matters before him weighing every word and every action 4 5 he has a bad case of gout which has recently left him unable to walk instead having to rely on his wheeled chair or a palanquin to move around he appears to be much older than he is in truth his body is soft and shapeless and the gout has swollen and reddened the joints of his knees toes and hands he covers his legs and feet with a blanket blocking the sight of his gout 6 7 due to his gout he only travels in a palanquin 6 8 and is rarely seen in public as he does not want to appear weak in the eyes of his enemies 6while his bannermen might consider him weak 5 6 7 doran has been focused for years on getting revenge for the murder of his sister elia and her two young children during the sack of kings landing during roberts rebellion in 283 ac 3 7because of the early deaths of his siblings olyvar and mors the multiple miscarriages his mother suffered and the difference in age with his surviving siblings elia and oberyn doran was raised alone 2 6 he still has a deep affection for his sister and had a good relationship with his younger brother as well history early life doran was the first born child of his parents and thus heir to his mother the princess of dorne for years he was an only child as his mother had several miscarriages 2 while he would have four siblings mors and olyvar both died in the cradle doran spent several years of his childhood at the water gardens and by the age of nine he was a squire to lord gargalen at salt shore while there his mother gave birth to his sister elia as elia had been born one month premature doran was convinced that his sister too would die as their brothers had done before but she survived a year later dorans brother oberyn was born 6as a young man doran took a tour through the free cities he visited volantis and next went to norvos where he met his future wife lady mellario 3 they fell in love and mellario returned to dorne with doran where they were betrothed and would soon after marry areo hotah escorted mellario and entered the service of house martell 6 in 273 ac when his mother her consort and dorans two younger siblings traveled through the south of seven kingdoms on a quest to find suitable matches for elia and oberyn doran stayed behind as castellan of sunspear with mellario 9 although mellario was high born enough to become his wife most marriages between nobles in westeros are political a love match is very uncommon 10 in 276 ac doran and mellarios first child arianne was born 11 around 279 ac doran inherited the rule of dorne 12an unknown amount of time after his siblings had traveled to find suitable marriage candidates dorans brother oberyn fought in a duel with lord edgar yronwood due to oberyns high birth and young age the two men had agreed to duel until first blood both men were injured but when oberyns cuts healed and lord edgars festered eventually resulting in his death it was whispered oberyn had fought with a poisoned blade 8 doran acted swiftly sending oberyn into temporary exile 13prince of dorne dorans sister elia martell was betrothed to crown prince rhaegar targaryen in early 279 ac and wed him a year later 14 she had two young children by rhaegar rhaenys and aegon 15 when rhaegar disappeared with lyanna stark in 282 ac not long after aegons birth it started a chain of events leading to roberts rebellion 16 in which the north and several houses from the stormlands and the vale of arryn later joined by several houses from the riverlands fought against the iron throne and house targaryen 17 doran was furious about the way elia had been treated by rhaegar and as a consequence was slow to lend any aid to the targaryens 2 after rhaegar returned from the south to kings landing doran agreed to send ten thousand dornishmen to fight in the loyalist army under the command of his uncle prince lewyn martell of the kingsguard 18 19 understanding that elia as the wife to the crown prince would one day become queen and that her son aegon would one day be king 2however rhaegar died at the battle of the trident 20 as did dorans uncle lewyn 21 and king aerys ii targaryen believing that lewyn had betrayed rhaegar on the trident refused to send elia and her children to dragonstone alongside his own wife queen rhaella targaryen and their son viserys 18 not long after during the sack of kings landing elia and her children were brutally killed by ser gregor clegane and ser amory lorch men from the lannister host 20 22 the new king robert i baratheon was accepting of their deaths 4 as a consequence dorans brother oberyn attempted to raise dorne for the exiled viserys during the year after the rebellion but the new hand of the king lord jon arryn traveled to sunspear to return prince lewyns bones and spoke with doran ending all talks of rebellion 4prince doran martell holding a halfpeeled blood orange by tommy arnold © however doran desired revenge for the deaths of elia and her children as well and for this purpose worked closely together with his brother oberyn for years planning on destroying all that lord tywin lannister holds dear before killing him as well 7 to this end oberyn traveled to braavos where ser willem darry had fled to with viserys and daenerys targaryen a secret pact was made with oberyn signing for dorne and with the sealord of braavos as a witness betrothing dorans daughter arianne to the exiled king viserys 3 23doran also sent his son quentyn born in 281 ac 24 to serve lord ormond yronwood as a page and later squire 25 quentyns fostering was done to make peace with the yronwoods as enmity between the two houses had arisen after the death of lord edgar yronwood 8 however this caused another strain on dorans marriage to mellario although they had married out of love their marriage had not been very happy mellario had not been able to get used to the dornish customs which were so different from the norvoshi customs 10 26 as such mellario did not approve of quentyns fostering which is not common in norvoshi culture believing her son to be much too young at the time 25 when doran after sending quentyn to yronwood planned to send arianne to tyrosh to serve as the cupbearer to the archon of tyrosh which would have enabled her to meet her betrothed in secret mellario threatened to harm herself should doran steal another one of her children not wanting to hurt his wife doran thus kept arianne in dorne 3 doran and his wife had a third child trystane who was born in 287 ac 27 however doran and mellarios marriage continued to deteriorate and she would never forgive doran for sending quentyn away eventually she went back to norvos 25while he had planned to tell arianne about her betrothal to the last targaryen heir when she was sixteen he decided to keep the secret from her due to her spirited and willful nature 3 unbeknownst to doran however arianne had read a letter doran had been writing to quentyn in which he mentioned that quentyn would inherit the rule of dorne from doran 3 5 thus she had come to believe that dorans coolness towards her was due to the fact that he wanted to disinherit her and name quentyn his heir instead when doran suggests numerous aged suitors to her including lord walder frey lord ben beesbury lord gyles rosby and lord estermont  whilst declining more agematched suitors like ser edmure tully and willas tyrell  it only strengthened her beliefs 3 25 in truth doran had feared that it would be suspicious if he was not seen trying to arrange a betrothal for arianne and had only made the suggestions he had because he had known she would reject every single one 3doran eventually became afflicted with gout in 298 ac when still capable of walking albeit with a stick doran moved from sunspear to the water gardens two years later however dorans gout has become far worse and he is no longer able to walk but instead is usually confined to a wheelchair not wanting his enemies to know how feeble he has grown he remained at the water gardens where he is far away from curious eyes 6 at the water gardens the summer home of the martells he prefers to watch the children at their play sitting quietly on the terras amongst the orange trees he only sees his trusted courtiers and advisors 6 summoning his brother oberyn twice every fortnight and his daughter arianne twice a year 5recent events prince doran by jacqui davis © a game of thrones

chamber doran martell reveals to tyene obara nymeria areo hotah and his daughter that cerseis invitation is an ambush according to a friend at the court of king’s landing the party would be ambushed
