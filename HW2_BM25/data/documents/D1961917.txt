january 1 2016the hof case for trevor hoffman comments 0trevor hoffman is one of the many deserving candidates on this years hall of fame ballot getty imagesin three years mariano rivera will be eligible for election into the hall of fame he wont be unanimous because weve learned that no one is ever unanimous but hes a lock to be voted in on his first try chances are hell be named on at least 95 percent of ballots  an unprecedented total because no primary reliever has ever finished with more than 86 percent of votes thats the way it should be rivera is quite clearly the greatest reliever who ever lived his career era is 205 meaning he was 105 percent better than the leagues adjusted average during his career good enough for first place alltime you can make a legitimate argument that no athlete in any sport has ever dominated his position more than rivera why is all of this relevant now in 2016 well trevor hoffman is eligible for the hall of fame and well learn his firstballot fate when results are released wednesday hes a closer too  a historically brilliant one in fact and as a closer dominance within his position is of critical importance because closers simply do not have the same impact on games as everyday position players or starting pitchers back to rivera he could very well end up being the historical anomaly that prevents hoffman from being elected this year and thats just not fair to hoffman according to bbhoftrackercom a website that tallies votes from all writers who have made their ballots public hoffman has been named on 64 percent of ballots as of the new year thats an impressive total but not quite the 75 percent necessary for election the websites numbers also tend to be a bit high as the writers who choose not release their ballots tend to be the same writers who are stingiest with their votes chances are hoffman isnt getting elected this year though trends tell us that if he finishes above 50 percent hes due for election sometime soon and while hoffmans numbers dont stack up with riveras no player at any position in any team sport has ever had numbers that stack up with the dominance of rivera if rivera never existed  bear with me here i hate hypotheticals too but this one serves a purpose  heres where hoffman would stack up among relievers with 1000 innings pitched• saves 601 first • save percentage 888 first • era 287 seventh • era 141 third • batting average against 211 first • whip 106 first • kbb 369 first • strikeout rate 258 percent firsttheres no question hoffman gets inducted immediately hes the only other pitcher in the top 10 in all eight of these critical categories  and hes not just top10 hes right at the very top in most of them sure the role of closer has changed through the years to a oneinning job but its hard to make an argument against hoffman as the best relief pitcher of alltime  if you eliminate rivera of course and thats the point theres no other position where a player so headandshoulders above his contemporaries is not in the hall excluding ped cases pete rose and shoeless joe look i understand the arguments against hoffman he didnt pitch enough innings…this is both true and untrue no he didnt pitch the innings of a goose gossage but he wasnt supposed to it isnt his job to eat innings hoffman is being unfairly penalized for simply doing the job he was asked to do shutting down the opposition for one inning thats not to mention the fact that he threw 1089 13 innings in his career  a number thats more than enough for a reliever its 186 more innings than billy wagner  also on the ballot and receiving serious consideration  and 47 more than bruce sutter who was inducted in 2006 hoffmans numbers are better than sutters in an era with more offense hes just a closer how much impact does he really have war does not paint a pretty picture for hoffman hes worth about 28 wins according to baseball reference  only four wins ahead of sutter who owns the lowest war of any player in the hall closers the argument goes are like kickers in the nfl they can only impact a game as much as their team puts them in the position to do so i dont disagree with that statement but no kicker in nfl history ran out to hells bells and a raucous ovation every time he took the field like it or not closers are an integral part of the sport kickers are not nearly as volatile as closers can be making a good closer so much more valuable than a good kicker as it happens hoffman is one of the best ever but other positions with a greater impact should be getting more recognition…i cant argue with this one there are players who have excelled at other positions who arent yet in the hall of fame as starting pitchers mike mussina and curt schilling clearly had a greater impact on games and posted numbers worthy of the hall they arent in edgar martinez is perhaps the most apt comparison he too excelled at a position that has long been shunned by hall voters for its impact on games hoffman was more dominant for a longer period of time at his job than edgar was at his but nonetheless martinez isnt in if your argument against hoffman is that there are other more impactful players worthy of induction ahead of him i cant dispute that notion the voting process after all only allows for 10 players to be selected on each ballot  regardless of how many hallworthy candidates are actually on that ballot but those other hallworthy players shouldnt preclude hoffman from being worthy himself his numbers his legacy and his dominance within his position prove very clearly that he
