pack of chips for example is manufactured and packaged lays by fritolay then sold to people through retail outlets walmart any grocery shop restaurants in between however there are a few key operatorsalso known as distributors that serve to move the product from manufacturer to market some are retail distributors the kind that sell directly to consumers end users others are known as merchant wholesale distributors they buy products from the manufacturer or other source then move them from their warehouses to companies that either want to resell the products to end users or use them in their own operations i hope you are cleared with who are the key people and what they do so now lets answer your concerns do i need to first talk to every shopkeeper to sell the products i’m distributing to him answer no it depends on what product are you selling distribution sales can be divided into 3 categoriesa b2b selling you got to talk to other businesses who need your products may be its a raw material to their business or they use as a bundled product b2b sales is a peculiar beast within the world of sales the sales process within the b2b world is slowmoving and requires lots of discussions and decisions are often based on logic and the considered needs of a company the sales and service cycle of the buyerseller relationship is often long and continuous and can last for years if not generationsb b2c selling the b2c world on the other hand is a fastmoving machine that runs on emotions and whatever’s on the latest fad right now it is highly in tune with social movements and subcultures and takes it cues from the high fashion industry and other inspirations that seemingly pop up at random operating a b2c trading and distribution company means that you’ve got to be fast on your feet and change near instantaneously you can gain customers quickly but also lose them just as fastc e commerce with the advent of the internet selling digitally has become commonplace it is a new sales channel that trading and distribution companies use to get their products out in front of an even wider audience2 so i will sell on the wholesale price  you will buy at wholesale prices and sell again in wholesale price  by keeping the margin of 20–30a product of 100 you buy at 60 from manufacturer and sell it to retailers  customers at 80 so you make the margin profit of 20 for each sale am i clear do i make sense3 can i start distribution for products more than one for the start sure thing yes go ahead but my suggestion is to stick for 1 at first once u see the success move to others specially start cross and up selling on your base product i hope i have explained you in detail fyi we recently wrote a mega 5000 word guide on how to start a distribution

kajaria lives in kolkata west bengal india answered feb 19 2017im going to talk about the edible oil industry as thats what i have some experience in lets take a company like fortune adani wilmar the distributor usually receives a 3–5 margin in the edible oil industry suppose the company sells the product at ₹100 to the distributor and the distributor sells it to the retailer his price after margin would be 103₹ if we take a 3 margin many companies also add maybe a25 extra margin if this is the case then the distributor bears the cost for any damages or leakages which is covered by the25now coming to selling the product in the retail markets the area of each distributor is clearly demarcated by each company there are two ways that selling could go a the distributor provides the salesman in this case you pay the salesman to go into the markets and sell the product your distributorship interacts with the retailers directly b the company provides the salesman in this case it is the companys responsibility to increase the reqch to retailers and to sell the products the products will be sold and orders would be given to you then you must create a bill and deliver them there are multiple other factors to consider when taking a distributorship such as how much credit should be given to retailers and how much are you willing to invest the credit you receive from the company may depend on that please note that this is for the edible oil industry and may be different for other products as for how many products to start with id suggest begin with one so that you can understand the nuances of the business16k views · view upvoters prasad sawant proud indianthen goan by heart answered dec 1 2014the distribution business is good but you need to make a good survey of
