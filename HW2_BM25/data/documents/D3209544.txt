the byzantine empire when the use of religious images or icons was opposed by religious and imperial authorities within the eastern church and the temporal imperial hierarchy the first iconoclasm as it is sometimes called lasted between about 726 and 787 the second iconoclasm was between 814 and 842 according to the traditional view byzantine iconoclasm was started by a ban on religious images by emperor leo iii and continued under his successors it was accompanied by widespread destruction of images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images the western church remained firmly in support of the use of images throughout the period and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the eastern and western traditions in what was still a unified church as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of byzantine political control over parts of italy iconoclasm greek for breaker of icons medieval greek εἰκονοκλάστης equivalent to greek εἰκονο icono icon  κλάστης  breaker is the deliberate destruction within a culture of the cultures own religious icons and other symbols or monuments usually for religious or political motives people who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any person who breaks or disdains established dogmata or conventions conversely people who revere or venerate religious images are derisively called  iconolaters   εἰκονολάτρες  they are normally known as  iconodules   εἰκονόδουλοι  or iconophiles  εἰκονόφιλοι  these terms were however not a part of the byzantine debate over images they have been brought into common usage by modern historians from the seventeenth century and their application to byzantium increased considerably in the late twentieth century the byzantine term for the debate over religious imagery iconomachy means struggle over images or image struggle iconoclasm has generally been motivated theologically by an old covenant interpretation of the ten commandments which forbade the making and worshipping of  graven images  exodus 204 deuteronomy 58 see also biblical law in christianity  the two periods of iconoclasm in the byzantine empire during the 8th and 9th centuries made use of this theological theme in discussions over the propriety of images of holy figures including christ the virgin or theotokos and saints it was a debate triggered by changes in orthodox worship which were themselves generated by the major social and political upheavals of the seventh century for the byzantine empire traditional explanations for byzantine iconoclasm have sometimes focused on the importance of islamic prohibitions against images influencing byzantine thought according to arnold j toynbee 2 for example it was the prestige of islamic military successes in the 7th and 8th centuries that motivated byzantine christians to adopt the islamic position of rejecting and destroying devotional and liturgical images the role of women and monks in supporting the veneration of images has also been asserted social and classbased arguments have been put forward such as that iconoclasm created political and economic divisions in byzantine society that it was generally supported by the eastern poorer nongreek peoples of the empire 3 who had to constantly deal with arab raids on the other hand the wealthier greeks of constantinople and also the peoples of the balkan and italian provinces strongly opposed iconoclasm 3 in recent decades in greece iconoclasm has become a favorite topic of progressive and marxist historians and social scientists who consider it a form of medieval class struggle and have drawn inspiration from it reevaluation of the written and material evidence relating

arguments6 art7 reaction in the west8 see also9 notes10 references11 further reading background  edit19thcentury italian painting the iconoclasts by domenico morelli christian worship by the sixth century had developed a clear belief in the intercession of saints this belief was also influenced by a concept of hierarchy of sanctity with the trinity at its pinnacle followed by the virgin mary referred to in greek as the theotokos birthgiver of god or meter theou mother of god the saints living holy men women and spiritual elders followed by the rest of humanity thus in order to obtain blessings or divine favour early christians would often pray or ask an intermediary such as the saints or the theotokos or living fellow christians believed to be holy to intercede on their behalf with christ a strong sacramentality and belief in the importance of physical presence also joined the belief in intercession of saints with the use of relics and holy images or icons in early christian practices 4believers would therefore make pilgrimages to places sanctified by the physical presence of christ or prominent saints and martyrs such as the site of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem relics or holy objects rather than places which were a part of the remains or had come into contact with christ the virgin or a saint were also widely utilized in christian practices at this time relics a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period provided physical presence of the divine but were not infinitely reproducible an original relic was required and still usually required believers to undertake pilgrimage or have contact with somebody who had the use and abuse of images had greatly increased during this period and had generated a growing opposition among many in the church although the progress and extent of these views is now unclear images in the form of mosaics and paintings were widely used in churches homes and other places such as over city gates and had since the reign of justinian i been increasingly taking on a spiritual significance of their own and regarded at least in the popular mind as capable of possessing capacities in their own right so that the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave it makes known its wishes  it enacts evangelical teachings  when attacked it bleeds  and in some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force  5 key artefacts to blur this boundary emerged in c 570 in the form of miraculously created acheiropoieta or images not made by human hands these sacred images were a form of contact relic which additionally were taken to prove divine approval of the use of icons the two most famous were the mandylion of edessa where it still remained and the image of camuliana from cappadocia by then in constantinople the latter was already regarded as a palladium that had won battles and saved constantinople from the persian  avar siege of 626 when the patriarch paraded it around the walls of the city both were images of christ and at least in some versions of their stories supposedly made when christ pressed a cloth to his face compare with the later western veil of veronica and turin shroud  in other versions of the mandylions story it joined a number of other images that were believed to have been painted from the life in the new testament period by saint luke or other human painters again demonstrating the support of christ and the virgin for icons and the continuity of their use in christianity since its start the events of the seventh century which was a period of major crisis for the byzantine empire formed a catalyst for the expansion of the use of images of the holy and caused a dramatic shift in responses to them whether the acheiropoieta were a symptom or cause the late sixth to eighth centuries witnessed the increasing thinning of the boundary between images not made by human hands and images made by human hands images of christ the theotokos and saints increasingly came to be regarded as relics contact relics and acheiropoieta already were as points of access to the divine by praying before an image of a holy figure the believers prayers were magnified by proximity to the holy this change in practice seems to have been a major and organic development in christian worship which responded to the needs of believers to have access to divine support during the insecurities of the seventh century it was not a change orchestrated or controlled by the church the events which have traditionally been labelled byzantine iconoclasm may be seen as the efforts of the organised church and the imperial authorities to respond to these changes and to try to reassert some institutional control over popular practice the rise of islam in the seventh century had also caused some consideration of the use of holy images early islamic belief stressed the impropriety of iconic representation earlier scholarship tried to link byzantine iconoclasm directly to islam by arguing that byzantine emperors saw the success of the early caliphate and decided that byzantine use of images as opposed to islamic aniconism had angered god this does not seem entirely plausible however the use of images had probably been increasing in the years leading up to the outbreak of iconoclasm 6 one notable change came in 695 when justinian ii put a fullfaced image of christ on the obverse of his gold coins the effect on iconoclast opinion is unknown but the change certainly caused caliph abd almalik to break permanently with his previous adoption of byzantine coin types to start a purely islamic coinage with lettering only 7 this appears more like two opposed camps asserting their positions pro and anti images than one empire seeking to imitate the other more striking is the fact that islamic iconoclasm rejected any depictions of living people or animals not only religious images by contrast byzantine iconomachy concerned itself only with the question of the holy presence or lack thereof of images thus although the rise of islam may have created an environment in which images were at the forefront of intellectual question and debate islamic iconoclasm does not seem to have had a direct causal role in the development of the byzantine image debate  citation neededthe goal of the iconoclasts was to restore the church to the strict opposition to images in worship that they believed characterized at the least some parts of the early church theologically one aspect of the debate as with most in christian theology at the time revolved around the two natures of jesus iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the messiah at the same time but separately because an icon which depicted jesus as purely physical would be nestorianism and one which showed him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature which was monophysitism all icons were thus heretical reference was also made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the mosaic law but the nature of biblical law in christianity has always been in dispute however no detailed writings setting out iconoclast arguments have survived we have only brief quotations and references in the writings of the iconodules sources  editargument about icons before the emperor in the skylitzis chronicle a thorough understanding of the iconoclast period in byzantium is complicated by the fact that most of the surviving sources were written by the ultimate victors in the controversy the iconodules it is thus difficult to obtain a complete objective balanced and reliably accurate account of events and various aspects of the controversy 8 the period was marked by intensely polarized debate amongst at least the clergy and both sides came to regard the position of the other as heresy and accordingly made efforts to destroy the writings of the other side when they had the chance leo iii is said to have ordered the destruction of iconodule texts at the start of the controversy and the records of the final second council of nicaea record that books with missing pages were reported and produced to the council 9 many texts including works of hagiography and historical writing as well as sermons and theological writings were undoubtedly improved fabricated or backdated by partisans and the difficult and highly technical scholarly process of attempting to assess the real authors and dates of many surviving texts remains ongoing most iconoclastic texts are simply missing including a proper record of the council of 754 and the detail of iconoclastic arguments have mostly to be reconstructed with difficulty from their vehement rebuttals by iconodules major historical sources for the period include the chronicles of theophanes the confessor 10 and the patriarch nikephoros 11 both of whom were ardent iconodules many historians have also drawn on hagiography most notably the life of st stephen the younger 12 which includes a detailed but highly biased account of persecutions during the reign of constantine v no account of the period in question written by an iconoclast has been preserved although certain saints lives do seem to preserve elements of the iconoclast worldview 13major theological sources include the writings of john of damascus 14 theodore the studite 15 and the patriarch nikephoros all of them iconodules the theological arguments of the iconoclasts survive only in the form of selective quotations embedded in iconodule documents most notably the acts of the second council of nicaea and the antirrhetics of nikephoros 16the first iconoclast period 730–787  editthe torture and martyrdom of the iconophile bishop euthymius of sardeis by the iconoclast byzantine emperor michael ii in 824 in a 13thcentury manuscript an immediate precursor of the controversy seems to have been a large submarine volcanic eruption in the summer of 726 in the aegean sea between the island of thera modern santorini and therasia probably causing tsunamis and great loss of life many probably including leo iii interpreted this as a judgement on the empire by god and decided that use of images had been the offence 17the classic account of the beginning of byzantine iconoclasm relates that sometime between 726 and 730 the byzantine emperor leo iii the isaurian ordered the removal of an image of christ prominently placed over the chalke gate the ceremonial entrance to the great palace of constantinople and its replacement with a cross fearing that they intended sacrilege some of those who were assigned to the task were murdered by a band of iconodules accounts of this event written significantly later suggest that at least part of the reason for the removal may have been military reversals against the muslims and the eruption of the volcanic island of thera 18 which leo possibly viewed as evidence of the wrath of god brought on by image veneration in the church 19leo is said to have described mere image veneration as a craft of idolatry he apparently forbade the veneration of religious images in a 730 edict which did not apply to other forms of art including the image of the emperor or religious symbols such as the cross he saw no need to consult the church and he appears to have been surprised by the depth of the popular opposition he encountered 20 germanos i of constantinople the iconophile patriarch of constantinople either resigned or was deposed following the ban surviving letters germanos wrote at the time say little of theology according to patricia karlinhayter what worried germanos was that the ban of icons would prove that the church had been in error for a long time and therefore play into the hands of jews and muslims 21patriarch germanos i of constantinople with icons supported by angels this interpretation is now in doubt and the debate and struggle may have initially begun in the provinces rather than in the imperial court letters survive written by the patriarch germanos in the 720s and 730s concerning constantine the bishop of nakoleia and thomas of klaudioupolis in both sets of letters the earlier ones concerning constantine the later ones thomas germanos reiterates a proimage position while lamenting the behaviour of his subordinates in the church who apparently had both expressed reservations about image worship germanos complains now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter 22 in both cases efforts to persuade these men of the propriety of image veneration had failed and some steps had been taken to remove images from their churches significantly in these letters germanos does not threaten his subordinates if they fail to change their behaviour he does not seem to refer to a factional split in the church but rather to an ongoing issue of concern and germanos refers to the emperor leo iii often presented as the original iconoclast as a friend of images germanos concerns are mainly that the actions of constantine and thomas should not confuse the laity at this stage in the debate there is no clear evidence for an imperial involvement in the debate except that germanos says he believes that leo iii supports images leaving a question as to why leo iii has been presented as the archiconoclast of byzantine history almost all of the evidence for the reign of leo iii is derived from textual sources the majority of which postdate his reign considerably most notably the life by stephen the younger and the chronicle of theophanes the confessor these important sources are fiercely iconophile and are hostile to the emperor constantine v 741775 as constantines father leo also became a target leos actual views on icon veneration remain obscure but in any case may not have influenced the initial phase of the debate during this initial period concern on both sides seems to have had little to do with theology and more with practical evidence and effects there was initially no church council and no prominent patriarchs or bishops called for the removal or destruction of icons in the process of destroying or obscuring images leo is said to have  confiscated valuable church plate altar cloths and reliquaries decorated with religious figures  20 but he took no severe action against the former patriarch or iconophile bishops in the west pope gregory iii held two synods at rome and condemned leos actions and in response leo confiscated papal estates in calabria and sicily detaching them as well as illyricum from papal governance and placing them under the governance of the patriarch of constantinople 23ecumenical councils  editleo died in 741 and his son and heir constantine v 741–775 was personally committed to an antiimage position despite his successes as an emperor both militarily and culturally this has caused constantine to be remembered unfavourably by a body of source material which is preoccupied by his opposition to image veneration in 754 constantine summoned the council of hieria in which some 330 to 340 bishops participated and which was the first church council to concern itself primarily with religious imagery constantine seems to have been closely involved with the council and it endorsed an iconoclast position with 338 assembled bishops declaring the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvationnamely the incarnation of christ and contradicted the six holy synods    if anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself etc    let him be anathema this council claimed to be the legitimate seventh ecumenical council 24 but its legitimacy is disregarded by both eastern and western traditions as no patriarchs or representatives of the five patriarchs were present constantinople was vacant while antioch jerusalem and alexandria were controlled by muslims and rome did not send a representative an icon of the seventh ecumenical council 17th century novodevichy convent moscowthe iconoclast council of hieria was not the end of the matter however in this period complex theological arguments appeared both for and against the use of icons constantine himself wrote opposing the veneration of images while john of damascus a syrian monk living outside of byzantine territory became a major opponent of iconoclasm through his theological writings 25it has been suggested that monasteries became secret bastions of iconsupport but this view is controversial a possible reason for this interpretation is the desire in some historiography on byzantine iconoclasm to see it as a preface to the later protestant reformation in western europe in which monastic establishments suffered damage and persecution  citation needed in opposition to this view others have suggested that while some monks continued to support image veneration many others followed church and imperial policy  citation neededthe surviving sources accuse constantine v of moving against monasteries having relics thrown into the sea and stopping the invocation of saints monks were forced to parade in the hippodrome each handinhand with a woman in violation of their vows in 765 st stephen the younger was killed and was later considered a martyr to the iconophile cause a number of large monasteries in constantinople were secularised and many monks fled to areas beyond effective imperial control on the fringes of the empire 25constantines son leo iv 775–80 was less rigorous and for a time tried to mediate between the factions when he died his wife irene took power as regent for her son constantine vi 780–97 though icon veneration does not seem to have been a major priority for the regency government irene called an ecumenical council a year after leos death which restored image veneration this may have been an effort to secure closer and more cordial relations between constantinople and rome irene initiated a new ecumenical council ultimately called the second council of nicaea which first met in constantinople in 786 but was disrupted by military units faithful to the iconoclast legacy the council convened again at nicaea in 787 and reversed the decrees of the previous iconoclast council held at constantinople and hieria and appropriated its title as seventh ecumenical council thus there were two councils called the seventh ecumenical council the first supporting iconoclasm the second supporting icon veneration unlike the iconoclast council the iconophile council included papal representatives and its decrees were approved by the papacy the eastern orthodox church considers it to be the last genuine ecumenical council icon veneration lasted through the reign of empress irene s successor nikephoros i reigned 802–811 and the two brief reigns after his the second

museum  emperor leo v the armenian instituted a second period of iconoclasm in 815 again possibly motivated by military failures seen as indicators of divine displeasure and a desire to replicate the military success of constantine v the byzantines had suffered a series of humiliating defeats at the hands of the bulgarian khan krum in the course of which emperor nikephoros i had been killed in battle and emperor michael i rangabe had been forced to abdicate 26 in june 813 a month before the coronation of leo v a group of soldiers broke into the imperial mausoleum in the church of the holy apostles opened the sarcophagus of constantine v and implored him to return and save the empire 27soon after his accession leo v began to discuss the possibility of reviving iconoclasm with a variety of people including priests monks and members of the senate he is reported to have remarked to a group of advisors thatall the emperors who took up images and venerated them met their death either in revolt or in war but those who did not venerate images all died a natural death remained in power until they died and were then laid to rest with all honors in the imperial mausoleum in the church of the holy apostles 28leo next appointed a commission of monks to look into the old books and reach a decision on the veneration of images they soon discovered the acts of the iconoclastic synod of 754 29 a first debate followed between leos supporters and the clerics who continued to advocate the veneration of icons the latter group being led by the patriarch nikephoros which led to no resolution however leo had apparently become convinced by this point of the correctness of the iconoclast position and had the icon of the chalke gate which leo iii is fictitiously claimed to have removed once before replaced with a cross 30 in 815 the revival of iconoclasm was rendered official by a synod held in the hagia sophia leo was succeeded by michael ii who in an 824 letter to the carolingian emperor louis the pious lamented the appearance of image veneration in the church and such practices as making icons baptismal godfathers to infants he confirmed the decrees of the iconoclast council of 754 michael was succeeded by his son theophilus theophilus died leaving his wife theodora regent for his minor heir michael iii like irene 50 years before her theodora presided over the restoration of icon veneration in 843 on the condition that theophilus not be condemned since that time the first sunday of great lent has been celebrated in the orthodox church and in byzantine rite catholicism

theological arguments however remain in evidence because of the need in iconophile writings to record the positions being refuted debate seems to have centred on the validity of the depiction of jesus and the validity of images of other figures followed on from this for both sides the main points of the iconoclast argument were iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image eg painting or statue that was intended to represent jesus or one of the saints the epitome of the definition of the iconoclastic conciliabulum held in 754 declaredsupported by the holy scriptures and the fathers we declare unanimously in the name of the holy trinity that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the christian church every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters if anyone ventures to represent the divine image χαρακτήρ kharaktír of the word after the incarnation with material colours let him be anathema  if anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself let him be anathema for iconoclasts the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype of the same substance which they considered impossible seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life thus for iconoclasts the only true and permitted icon of jesus was the eucharist the body and blood of christ according to orthodox and catholic doctrine any true image of jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed and his human nature which is possible but by making an icon of jesus one is separating his human and divine natures since only the human can be depicted separating the natures was considered nestorianism  or else confusing the human and divine natures considering them one union of the human and divine natures was considered monophysitism  icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an inappropriate innovation in the church and a return to pagan practice satan misled men so that they worshipped the creature instead of the creator the law of moses and the prophets cooperated to remove this ruin but the previously mentioned demiurge of evilgradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of christianity 31it was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition of which there was a written record opposing religious images the spanish synod of elvira c 305 had declared that pictures are not to be placed in churches so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration 32 and some decades later eusebius of caesaria may have writren a letter to constantia emperor constantines sister saying to depict purely the human form of christ before its transformation on the other hand is to break the commandment of god and to fall into pagan error 33 bishop epiphanius of salamis wrote his letter 51 to john bishop of jerusalem c 394 in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are opposed    to our religion 34 although the authenticity of this letter has also long been disputed and remains uncertain 35 however as christianity increasingly spread among gentiles with traditions of religious images and especially after the conversion of constantine c 312 the legalization of christianity and later that century the establishment of christianity as the state religion of the roman empire many new people came into the new large public churches which began to be decorated with images that certainly drew in part on imperial and pagan imagery the representations of christ as the almighty lord on his judgment throne owed something to pictures of zeus portraits of the mother of god were not wholly independent of a pagan past of venerated mothergoddesses in the popular mind the saints had come to fill a role that had been played by heroes and deities 36iconophile arguments  editthe chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks mansur  john of damascus  who living in muslim territory as advisor to the caliph of damascus was far enough away from the byzantine emperor to evade retribution and theodore the studite abbot of the stoudios monastery in constantinople john declared that he did not worship matter but rather the creator of matter he also declared but i also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me as if filled with divine energy and grace he includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images the wood of the cross and the body and blood of jesus this distinction between worship and veneration is key in the arguments of the iconophiles the iconophile response to iconoclasm included assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of god had been superseded by the incarnation of jesus who being the second person of the trinity is god incarnate in visible matter therefore they were not depicting the invisible god but god as he appeared in the flesh they were able to adduce the issue of the incarnation in their favour whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them they also pointed to other old testament evidence god instructed moses to make two golden statues of cherubim on the lid of the ark of the covenant according to exodus 2518–22 and god also told moses to embroider the curtain which separated the holy of holies in the tabernacle tent with cherubim exodus 2631 moses was also instructed by god to embroider the walls and roofs of the tabernacle tent with figures of cherubim angels according to exodus 261 further in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons essentially the argument was that idols were idols because they represented false gods not because they were images images of christ or of other real people who had lived in the past could not be idols this was considered comparable to the old testament practice of only offering burnt sacrifices to god and not to any other gods regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition  parádosis sanctioned in catholicism and orthodoxy as authoritative in doctrine by reference to basil the great etc  and pointed to patristic writings approving of icons such as those of asterius of amasia who was quoted twice in the record of the second council of nicaea what would have been useful evidence from modern art history as to the use of images in early christian art was unavailable to iconodules at the time much was made of acheiropoieta icons believed to be of divine origin and miracles associated with icons both christ and the theotokos were believed in strong traditions to have sat on different occasions for their portraits to be painted iconophiles further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council not imposed on the church by an emperor thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to god the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them emperors had always intervened in ecclesiastical matters since the time of constantine i as cyril mango writes the legacy of nicaea the first universal council of the church was to bind the emperor to something that was not his concern namely the definition and imposition of orthodoxy if need be by force that practice continued from beginning to end of the iconoclast controversy and beyond with some emperors enforcing iconoclasm and two empresses regent enforcing the reestablishment of icon veneration art  edit14th century miniature of the destruction of a church under the orders of the iconoclast emperor constantine v copronymus the iconoclastic period has drastically reduced the number of survivals of byzantine art from before the period especially large religious mosaics which are now almost exclusively found in italy and saint catherines monastery in egypt important works in thessaloniki were lost in the great thessaloniki fire of 1917 and the grecoturkish war 1919–1922 a large mosaic of a church council in the imperial palace was replaced by lively secular scenes and there was no issue with imagery per se the plain iconoclastic cross that replaced a figurative image in the apse of st irenes is itself an almost unique survival but careful inspection of some other buildings reveals similar changes in nicaea photographs of the church of the dormition taken before it was destroyed in 1922 show that a preiconoclasm standing theotokos was replaced by a large cross which was itself replaced by the new theotokos seen in the photographs 37 the image of camuliana in constantinople appears to have been destroyed as mentions of it cease 38reaction in the west  editthe period of iconoclasm decisively ended the socalled byzantine papacy under which since the reign of justinian i a century before the popes in rome had been initially nominated by and later merely confirmed by the emperor in constantinople and many of them had been greekspeaking by the end of the controversy the pope had approved the creation of a new emperor in the west and the old deference of the western church to constantinople had gone opposition to icons seems to have had little support in the west and rome took a consistently iconodule position when the struggles flared up pope gregory ii had been pope since 715 not long after accompanying his syrian predecessor pope constantine to constantinople where they successfully resolved with justinian ii the issues arising from the provocative antiwestern decisions of the quinisext council of 692 which no western prelates had attended of the delegation of 13 gregory was one of only two noneasterners it was to be the last visit of a pope to the city until 1969 there had already been conflicts with leo iii over his very heavy taxation of areas under roman jurisdiction 39see also
