organic fertilizer mixes animal manures from cows pigs chickens etc this one shouldn’t shock anyone i think we’ve all walked by a yard that had the tell tale odor of “fresh manurebased fertilizer” did you know though that the manure you buy at your local gardening store may contain livestockgrade hormones and antibiotics that can be readily absorbed by the plants you are growing“ … minnesota researchers planted corn green onion and cabbage in manuretreated soil in 2005 to evaluate the environmental impacts of feeding antibiotics to livestock six weeks later the crops were analyzed and found to absorb chlortetracycline a drug widely used to treat diseases in livestock… ”from organic farming supporting factory farms feather meal feather meal is made from the ground feathers of birds such as chickens raised for consumption it is partially hydrolyzed under high heat and pressure and then ground up growers use this byproduct for its high nitrogen levels despite the fact that plants cannot easily absorb it in this form other misuses animal feed bone meal bones are stripped dried and ground it is used for its high phosphorus and calcium content despite the fact that bone meal is dangerous to breathe and has been suggested as an agent for spreading creutzfeldtjakob disease cjd the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy “mad cow disease” to humans“ do you feed your roses with bone meal not a good idea says the world’s foremost expert on a group of rare diseases found in animals that sometimes make their way into humans breathing in the dust from contaminated

hydrolysate after the human grade “edible” portions of fish are removed the remaining fish parts guts bones cartilage scales meal etc are ground up this mix often has high acid based preservatives added to it to keep the contents from putrefying the fish parts used can also contain heavy metals and toxins that the fish absorbed during its life time fish emulsion emulsion is fish hydrolysate that has had the oils removed and proteins denatured and simplified by heating it is used for its nitrogen phosphorus and potassium content other misuses farmed animal feed companion animal food human consumption urea carbamideif the word “urea” makes you think of urine then you’re right it is a waste product created by digested protein filtered out by the kidneys and excreted from the body in urine these days urea is mostly created synthetically for commercial use by mixing ammonia and carbon dioxide but it can still be animal derived the same antibiotic and hormone implications of manure may also apply to animal derived urea some of the impurities found in synthetic urea such as biuret can also impair plant growth so it’s best to avoid this product all together other misuses rock salt for deicing cigarettes nairveet other hair removal agents pretzels yes really skin creams flameproofing agents tooth whitening products dish soaps dyes animal feed and more blood meal blood meal is made from dried blood that is literally scraped from the slaughterhouse floor even those farmers that use it admit that it is dangerous to breathe and can carry a number of harmful pathogens warning

organic fertilizers this list is intended as a resource rather than a list of specific recommendations if you choose to use soy cotton or alfalfa meal we would highly recommend finding an organic source as conventional sources of these crops are usually heavily sprayed and genetically modified green manures nitrogenfixing crops you might have to spend a small amount of money to get this crop growing but it’s worth the reasonable investment fastgrowing plants such as wheat oats rye vetch or clover can be grown as ‘green manure’ crops before your standard planting and then tilled into the garden as you ready the beds green manure crops absorb and use nutrients from the soil that might otherwise be lost through leaching then return the nutrients into the soil when they are tilled under the root system of cover crops also helps improve the soil structure and prevent erosion vetch peas broad beans fava beans and crimson clover are known as nitrogenfixing crops because they are particularly good at bringing this nutrient back into the soil when they are tilled into the bed adding cover crops to your garden during fall and winter will also help reduce weed growth alfalfa meal flax seed meal cottonseed meal and soya meal all excellent sources of nitrogen epsom salts an excellent source of magnesium seaweed fresh liquid or mealoften used for its trace elements seaweed is best when harvested fresh from the sea as opposed to washed up and sitting on beaches some veganic gardeners use bulk kelp meal or spirulina instead which are sources of potassium and trace minerals vegan organic fertilizers to use sparingly while all of the fertilizers below are stockfree and valuable they are obtained through mining so we use them very sparingly or not at all they are good soil amendments though so if there is a particular deficiency in your soil which these products will rectify attempt to use them in small quantities lime a source of calcium and magnesium it is also used to help break up heavy clay soil calcium is essential for strong plant growth and aids in the intake of other nutrients lime can be used to raise the p h level if your crop requires this gypsum hydrated calcium sulfategypsum adds calcium to the soil without raising the p h dolomite a finely ground rock dust and prized source of calcium and magnesium rock phosphate prized for its high phosphorus content the primary mineral in phosphate rock is apatite note rock phosphate was something we used in shangrila when we first started our gardens because we were just learning about different veganic inputs and it seemed like the soil needed phosphorus we have stopped using it since learning more about its extraction through strip mining which produces massive amounts of toxic byproducts and devastates animal and plant habitats not to mention the fact that many mining operations involve unjust labor practices and working conditions rock dusts or stonemealcontaining a blend of different powdered rocks when mixed with the soil its mineral content is slowly released revitalizing overworked soils and stimulating microbial activity green sand used as a soil amendment and fertilizer it has the consistency of sand but 10 times the moisture absorption green sand is mined from deposits of minerals that were originally part of the ocean floor it is a natural source of potash along with iron magnesium silica and as many as 30 other trace minerals it may also be used to loosen heavy clay soils rock potashpotassium potassium enhances flower and fruit production and helps ‘harden up’ foliage making it less susceptible to disease rock potash is very slowacting it may take years to fully release its minerals because the potash is released gradually as the mineral weathers it is usually used when preparing the soil for planting wood ash contains some potassium phosphate and trace amounts of micronutrients such as iron manganese boron copper and zinc it can have an alkalizing effect on the soil which many plants do not like so use it sparingly…if you’re interesting in simplifying the process and picking up a premade fertilizer blend then i’ve listed a number
