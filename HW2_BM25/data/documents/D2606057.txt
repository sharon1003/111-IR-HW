bedding she gradually won over the military doctors at least enough to gain their cooperation she used significant funds raised by the london times she soon focused more on administration than on actual nursing but she continued to visit the wards and to send letters back home for the injured and ill soldiers it was her rule that she be the only woman in the wards at night that earned her the title the lady with the lamp the mortality rate at the military hospital fell from 60 percent at her arrival to a mere 2 percent six months later florence nightingale applied her education and interest in mathematics to develop statistical analysis of disease and mortality inventing the use of the pie chart she fought a nottoowilling military bureaucracy and her own illness with crimean

nightingales pioneering work the first organized attempt to mitigate the horrors of war to prevent disease and save the lives of those engaged in military service by sanitary measures and a more careful nursing of the sick and wounded was made by a commission appointed by the british government during the crimean war to inquire into the terrible mortality from disease that attended the british army at sebastopol and to apply the needed remedies it was as a part of this great work that the heroic young englishwoman florence nightingale with her army of nurses went to the crimea to care for the sick and wounded soldier to minister in hospitals and to alleviate suffering and pain with a self sacrifice and devotion that has made her name a household word wherever the english language is spoken in the armies of france the sisters of charity had rendered similar services and even ministered to the wounded on the battle field but their labors were a work of religious charity and not an organized sanitary movement source of this excerpt the western sanitary commission a sketch st louis r p studley and co 1864cite
