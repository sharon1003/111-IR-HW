julie walraven says may 9 2011 at 528 pm whew brad that was deep i think ethics are valuable in every profession and in every type of social media many people seem to think that they don’t have to be ethical in social media that’s why you have so many people out there pushing products that have nebulous value and worse people who use social media to gain advantage of data via hacking accounts if everyone operated all of the time from an ethical perspective they wouldn’t have so many issues i mostly popped by to encourage you i saw your comment on jason alba’s blog because i must have also commented some time ago on the same post new bloggers need to be read so do those of us who have been around for awhile after awhile you know that there will be up and down days but in the early days you really want to know that someone read what you wrote reply brad merrill says may 9 2011 at 739 pm thanks for dropping by julie i appreciate it ethics is such a wide open topic i had to take a business ethics course in college and i know we just scratched the surface over the course of the quarter and that was before the advent of the internet as we know it today and all that entails by the way after i saw your comment i clicked through on your link and saw your post for today perfect timing i just opened a twitter account over the weekend i will be reading and digesting who knows there maybe some commentsquestions there too as to business ethics and social media that deserves further exploration – probably multiple posts but i want to mix things up so i don’t get in a rut and do every post on the same topic reply julie walraven says may 10 2011 at 503 am follow me there too brad i’ve been in social media for a fairly long time compared to some people hopefully i can can lead you to other resources and new contacts reply pingback jason alba al – buh» blog archive » starting a new blog blog post critique frank de george says july 6 2012 at 717 am in the fall of 2011 i was presenting an overview of the finance major to a group of honors students who had been accepted into the college of business and economics but had not yet declared their major i would have the students for three 50 minute sessions monday wednesday and friday as i do in all of my business classes i began monday’s session by explaining that the objective of every forprofit business is to make money for the owners of the company now and in the future and that the only way to accomplish this objective is to create value i then went on to illustrate the creation of value by purchasing a piece of paper for 001 i generally have to turn away offers of a free piece of paper from students who missed my opening premise and then reject prices of 025 010 and 005 before agreeing to pay the 001 once the class acknowledged that the specific piece of paper in question has a value of 001 no more and no less i proceeded to write on the piece of paper finishing with bold strokes that left no doubt that i had signed my name to the paper i then folded the paper and offered it to the class i let the bidding rise until a young man who we shall call john offered 100 for the paper i accepted john’s 100 and surrendered to him the folded paper john proceeded to open the paper smile refold the paper and place it in his pocket neither john nor i disclosed the contents of the paper to the class on wednesday i returned to class and asked john if he was ready to return the paper he told me that he had sold the paper to which i responded “great i love capitalism what did you get 150 175” much to my surprise the young man sitting next to john we will call him michael spoke up and said in a noticeable disgusting tone “no he got five bucks” i then handed michael 200 and he returned to me the paper i then read to the class what was written on the paper the holder of this piece of paper will be entitled to receive 200 from de george in the honors student orientation class on wednesday october 19 2011 signed frank a de george recognizing that a magnificent teaching opportunity had just been handed to me i delayed my planned discussion on the capital allocation process financial markets and careers opportunities in finance to ask the class a very simple question was it ethical for john to sell the paper to michael for 500 reply brad merrill says july 6 2012 at 751 pm great story frank and it really does illustrate what we are talking about replyhttptinyurlcommaricane31390 says january 27 2013 at 849 pm regards for writing “what is ethical behavior  brad w merrill” i personallymight absolutely wind up being coming back for more reading and commenting here shortly i am grateful consuelo replyjocuri online cu vampiri si varcolaci says april 5 2013 at 447 am i think everything said was very reasonable however think on this suppose you added a little content i ain’t suggesting your information isn’t solid but what if you added a post title to maybe grab a person’s attention i mean what is ethical behavior  brad w merrill is kinda vanilla you should look at yahoo’s home page and note how they create post titles to grab viewers interested you might add a video or a pic or two to get people excited about what you’ve got to say in my opinion it might bring your posts a little bit more interesting replyincentive stock options tax rate says april 23 2013 at 1145

selfcentered thank you bradreply
