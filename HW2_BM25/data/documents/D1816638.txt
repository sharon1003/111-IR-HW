racemic mixtures and enantiomeric excess prev section page 1of 2next page racemic mixtures a solution in which both enantiomers of a compound are present in equal amounts is called a racemic mixture or racemate racemic mixtures can be symbolized by a dl or  prefix in front of the substances name since enantiomers have equal and opposite specific rotations a racemic mixture exhibits no optical activity therefore it is impossible to tell a racemic mixture apart from an achiral substance using polarimetry alone note that the terms chiral and optically active should not be confused it would be incorrect to say that a racemic mixture is achiral chirality is a property of individual molecules optical activity is a property of solutions a racemic mixture consists of chiral molecules but it has no net optical activity the process by which a racemic mixture is formed from chiral materials is called racemization one way to do this is to mix equal amounts of enantiomeric substances from this point of view it may be puzzling that racemic mixtures are important after all what are the chances of obtaining any mixture in which two enantiomers are present in exactly equal amounts it turns out that racemic mixtures actually occur with considerable frequency racemic mixtures are often formed when achiral substances are converted into chiral ones this is due to the fact that chirality can only be distinguished in a chiral environment an achiral substance in an achiral environment has no preference to form one enantiomer over another resolution of racemates the separation of enantiomers poses a special problem for chemists enantiomers have the same boiling points melting points solubilities etc so many of the techniques used to separate other compounds dont work on racemic mixtures the answer to this problem is to separatee nantiomers in a chiral environment where they interact differently one technique is to use a chiral resolving agent this technique relies on the fact that while enantiomers have identical physical properties diastereomers generally have different properties for example suppose we wanted to separate the enantiomers of 2hydroxylpropionic acid we add as the resolving agent an enantiomerically pure amount of r2phenylethylamine the two enantiomers interact with r2phenylethylamine to form two distinct salt species that are diastereomers of each other the diastereomers can then be crystallized separately figure  separation via formation of diastereomeric salts another technique is to use chiral chromatography in this process the racemate is run through a column that is filled with a chiral substance the enantiomers will interact differently with the substance and will then elute or filter through the substance at different rates these techniques are also applied to mixtures of enantiomers beside racemic mixtures for example to purify a species from small amounts of its enantiomer reactions that produce enantiomeric excess how important is it for chemists to isolate pure enantiomers in some applications the chirality of a molecule is unimportant in many cases however the chirality of a molecule is crucial to its function this is especially true in biological systems where a molecule might have a function vastly different from that of its enantiomer biological systems are chiral environments here are a few examples prev section page 1of 2next page
