vws dung beetle the car that leaves nothing to waste thanks to its methane gaspowered engine by daily mail reporter updated 1248 edt 7 august 201047view comments a car powered by methane gas has been created by a team of british engineers the vehicle named the biobug is run reliably on biogas which is produced from human waste at sewage works across the country excrement flushed down the toilets of just 70 homes is enough to power the pioneering vw beetle car for 10000 miles  the equivalent of one average motoring year this conversion technology has been used in the past but the biobug is britains first car to run on methane gas without its performance being reduced full speed ahead the converted beetle car that runs on methane gas that is a byproduct of treating human waste the vehicles improved reliability means that its makers believe it can blow away electric cars and pave the way for a green motoring revolution mohammed saddiq of sustainable energy firm geneco which developed the prototype promised that drivers wont know the difference he said previously the gas hasnt been clean enough to fuel motor vehicles without it affecting performance related articlesprevious 1 next electric car odyssey around europe by battery in the tom hanks goes green as he cruises around la in his electric share this articlehowever through using the latest technology our biobug drives like any conventional car and whats more it uses sustainable fuel wessex waters recycling manager sean hill stands beside the biobug which has a top speed of 114mphwe thought it would be appropriate that the poopowered car should be the classic vw beetle bug because bugs naturally breakdown waste at sewage works to start the treatment process which goes on to produce the energy at the moment we are using waste flushed down the toilets in homes but it wont be long before the energy will also be generated through the treatment of food waste if you were to drive the car you wouldnt know it was powered by biogas as it performs just like any conventional car it is probably the most sustainable car around the biobug is a conventional 2 litre vw beetle convertible which has been modified to run on both conventional fuel and compressed methane gas enlarge power ranger how the dung beetle car gets from a to bthe car which has a top speed of 114mph is started using unleaded petrol but automatically switches to methane when the engine is up to temperature if the methane tank runs out the biobug reverts back to petrol around 18 million cubic metres of biogas is produced from human waste every year at wessex waters sewage treatment works in avonmouth bristol the gas is generated through anaerobic digestion  where bugs which are starved of oxygen break down biodegradable material to produce methane however before the gas can be used to power vehicles it must undergo biogas upgrading where carbon dioxide is removed to improve performance the biobug does 53 miles per cubic metre of biogas which means that just one sewage works could power 95400000 miles per year saving 19000 tonnes of co2 lord rupert redesdale chairman of the anaerobic digestion and biogas association believes that the biobug could prove to be the future of green motoring he said this is a very exciting and forwardthinking project demonstrating the myriad benefits of anaerobic digestion biomethane cars could be just as important as electric cars and the water regulator ofwat should promote the generation of as much biogas as possible through sewage works in the fight against climate change geneco which is a sustainable energy company owned by wessex water plans to convert its fleet of vehicles if the biobug trial proves to be successful advertisement share or
