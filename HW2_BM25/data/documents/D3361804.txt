wall to support the ceiling joist have you figured out why it rotted out you need to know that info before hand and do something to fix that before fixing the plate when posting in forums letting us

the shower down to studs in order to change the tile but then to surprise found out i need to fix my frame due to this water damage its a outside wall stucco is on the outside and there is a little window in the wall where you see the triple 2x4 thanks attached images last edited by jemhunter 05312013 at 0851 pm 05312013 0924 pm  5funfool member join date oct 2012location albuquerque nmposts 719

much more convenient actually a temp wall is just a bunch of cheap 2x4 and supports the structure you are working on while replacing the rotten wood a jack is great but a jack does not support a wall  it is a jack and it supports or lifts at one point 2x4s are cheap and great for temp walls for support when done with them all dried out and twisted and make great chicken coops the following user

for me if that is a telepost they are ok and in certain instances i have used them they do put all the weight on one spot and can crushbendgo through a floor depends on circumstances05312013 1135 pm  7jemhunter member join date may 2013posts 119 rewards points 73view jemhunters album this is a shower room and it has another parallel to it the 2 walls are 3ft apart is the temporary wall also a wall parallel to it how close should it be can my shower wall serve as a temporary wall its might not be feasible to have the wall ve close because my trusses are rotten and it might not a good idea to have them as support thanks06012013 0100 am  8maeling member join date dec 2011location b c canada posts 2693 rewards points 2260view maelings album floor trusses would be my first thing to fixthe

maeling floor trusses would be my first thing to fixno chit those are in bad shape if youre unfamiliar with setting up a support wall then it might be a very good idea to call in a professional contractor to help you on this that looks like pretty severe damage id have serious reservations about where any interior temporary supports could be installed it may not be possible to support it from the exterior to perform the repairs necessary because heres the thing a typical temporary wall goes a few feet inside the wall that needs supporting problem is the trusses under that floor look to be damaged enough to possibly make using that kind of support a big problem youd be talking about putting a lot more weight farther inside on a truss that already has problems at the ends think of the old straw that broke the camels back saying right now youve only got the weight of the floor on those damaged trusses the wall and structure above are not bearing down on the trusses if you put up a temporary wall inside that room youd be moving the weight from the outside to the inside trusses and potentially cause them to fail i gather theres a crawl space below this area if thats the case then a temporary wall would have to be built on something put down at the ground level and built up from there or even if theres a basement below thered have to be a support area suitable for carrying a new point load you cannot just rest a post on the soil or the basement slab as that could just punch through it as the weight was put upon it this is one of those areas where you really do need to consider calling in the pros or at the very least a structural engineer to come up with a plan last edited by wkearney99 06012013 at 0803 am  the following user says thank you to wkearney99 for this

correct about the trusses all trusses are designed to be carry load be supported at the nodes where the individual pieces come together as mr kearney correctly noted you could be supporting the temporary wall between truss nodes which requires a very careful analysis of the strength of the truss even if you bring the temporary wall far enough out from the wall so the wall sits over a truss node you still need to analyze the truss for loading capacity at the point of support your floor trusses are designed to support distributed floor load typically around 30 or 40 pounds per square foot but they are not designed to support point loads such as a temporary wall supporting the house above the truss manufacturer should in theory be able to tell you if the truss can support additional load in this case i would be surprised if they said yes given the poor condition of the trusses plus truss manufacturers are not likely to perform structural analysis unless you pay them you may need to hire an independent engineer to do the analysis alternative is to support the wall from the outside as has been previously discussed06012013 0947 am  12wkearney99bill kearney join date apr 2009location bethesda md usaposts 2003 rewards points 1174view wkearney99s album thanks daniel i wasnt thinking about how trusses even in good shape arent designed to handle a new point load along a different part of their span good to keep in mind06052013 0753 pm  13jemhunter member join date may 2013posts 119 rewards points 73view jemhunters album thank you all for the warnings i have the same concerns as well and i am working on reenforcing the trusses i was wondering if i have to setup the temp wall at all 1 the wall to repair is an outside wall of a shower room the shower has an inside wall parallel to it which is 3ft apart you can see part of the wall in the bottom right corner of the 1st picture i think the temp wall would be similar is 3ft too far to support it if i have to setup the temp wall i would probably put it over the metal plates which is the strong point of the trusses and that will be 1ft appart from the inside wall 2 right now i dont think this bottom plate is supporting it at all the plate is rotten the plate is installed on top of the subfloor which is decomposing and spongy i think the wall is hanging to its top plate instead and i can see about a 12 sag in the 2nd picture you can see at least 2 horizontal studs that i believe is holding the wall in place right now and supporting the roof do you think i can replace the bottom wo a temp wall is it worth to fix the 12 sag which i need to jack up the top plate a bit thoughts thanks attached images06052013 0811 pm  14jemhunter member join date may 2013posts 119 rewards points 73view jemhunters

probably put it over the metal plates which is the strong point of the trusses and that will be 1ft appart from the inside wall i am not so sure those trusses look quite damaged i would say your first order of business is to repair the floor trusses its going to be a real pain to repair them since you cant really do any cut and replace my first inclination is to use a two prone approach first looks like the damages are on the top side of these members you may be able to use some liquid wood epoxy i mean the good ones like rot doctor or abatron that are formulated specifically for structural wood repair i have used them and they do work and pour right into the damaged areas and let it penetrate and set into the voids next i would cut triangular shaped plywood and sandwich the trusses on both sides fastened with premium glue and 8d or 10d nails quote originally posted by jemhunter2 right now i dont think this bottom plate is supporting it at all the plate is rotten the plate is installed

lower piece come up a little or the upper piece come down a little remove advertisements sponsored links diychat roomcom advertisement
