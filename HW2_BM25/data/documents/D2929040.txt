trunk which isn’t a given for a sports car should i buy the ford mustang there are a lot of reasons to buy the mustang including its belowaverage starting price despite its high value there are still

price for the mustang gt fastback the lowest trim that offers a v8 is around 35000 if you want the highperformance shelby gt350 good luck the highest shelby trim starts at nearly 65000 making it one

ford mustang versus the competition which is better ford mustang or chevrolet camaro the mustang’s ageold rival the chevrolet camaro is another sports car that sits near the top of our class rankings these two deliver similar performance and both have engine options ranging from turbofours to highhorsepower performanceoriented v8s inside the mustang features more premium materials more comfortable seats and more trunk space than the camaro the camaro has a few more standard and available features but that’s its only real edge the mustang’s base price is also a bit lower these two are close in many ways but the mustang is the better buy overall which is better ford mustang or dodge challenger the dodge challenger is a true muscle car unlike the mustang it doesn’t offer a turbofour engine and if dodge had its way it’d probably even scrap the v6 the challenger is about pure power which is why it offers a range of v8 engines that have nsfw horsepower ratings the demon trim tops the list with 840 horsepower which might actually melt your skin off when you put the hammer down on the flip side the mustang delivers more dynamic handling and gets better fuel economy it has a more upscale interior but the challenger has more spacious seats and an adultfriendly back seat the mustang’s rear seats are barely kidfriendly the dodge has the larger trunk and more standard features in the end the mustang costs less and is the better car overall unless you need more rearseat space or just have to have the highest horsepower ratings it’s the car to buy compare the mustang camaro and challenger »mustang performance mustang engine you wanna go fast ricky bobby would approve of the ford mustang it provides multiple engine options all of which make for an enjoyable driving experience the base engine is the eco boost turbofour but don’t be fooled by its low cylinder count it puts out 310 horsepower and moves quickly of course it doesn’t compare to the 460horsepower v8 powering gt models even the gt is put to shame by the 526horsepower v8s you’ll find in the performanceoriented shelby gt350 models mustang gas mileage pretty good for a muscle car the mustang can’t hang with the fuel economy ratings of the mazda mx5 miata or toyota 86 but it matches up well with other muscle cars like the camaro and challenger mustang eco boost models get 21 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway while gt models get 15 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway the chevrolet camaro’s turbofour engine is slightly more fuelefficient than the mustang’s but the chevy requires premium gasoline because of that the ford will save you about 300 per year in gas money it’ll also save you about 150 per year compared to the base dodge challenger which has a v6 mustang ride and handling don’t be afraid to cut loose the mustang is an agile beast that’s perfect for tackling winding roads but it provides that athleticism without neglecting ride quality the suspension soaks up road imperfections well and the sharp steering and solid road grip contribute to the buttoneddown feel you get while driving read more about performance »mustang interior how many people does the mustang seat most mustang models seat four people the shelby gt350r seats two the front seats are comfortable and have enough support for enthusiastic driving and visibility is good from the driver’s seat the rear seats are puny and should be reserved for people you don’t like much mustang and car seats the mustang has two full sets of latch carseat connectors the tether anchors are easy to use but the lower anchors are set deep in the seats and require a lot of force when attaching car seat straps mustang interior quality the mustang’s interior is one of the nicest you’ll find in a nonluxury sports car materials quality is mostly excellent and the styling provides an attractive look mustang cargo space the mustang has a good amount of cargo space for the class regardless of body style the fastback coupe has more than 13 cubic feet of trunk room and the convertible has more than 11 cubic feet in either model you’ll have enough room for about eight pieces of carryon luggage or two or

is which engine you want as that will go a long way toward helping you pick a trim eco boost models feature an energetic and powerful turbofour that has ample power for all driving situations but gt models feature a beefy v8 that might be a better fit for more spirited drivers the highperformance shelby gt350 models have the strongest engines in the lineup but you really don’t need the power that they provide unless you plan on taking your car to the track once you’ve picked an engine you are presented with a binary body style choice fastback coupe or convertible not available with gt350 models the fastback has a little more trunk space and will save you several thousand dollars but it can’t offer the thrill of cruising with the top down finally you can pick between the standard eco boost or gt models or the premium premium models cost a bit more but they’re worth it for most buyers in addition to having more standard features premium models offer driver assistance and
