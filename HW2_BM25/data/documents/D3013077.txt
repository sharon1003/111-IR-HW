what if squirrelflight had chose ashfur over brambleclaw authors note there are many charcters in this that never existed and there are many plotholes sorrycontents  showprolougue edit squirrelflight felt as thought she was facing off in battle against shadowclan she was except she had to choose brambleclaw or ashfur how do i do this she asked herself finally she turned to the toms i choose ashfur she whispered brambleclaw was shocked how could she choose that piece of fox dung he stalked away grumbling ashfur jumped up this was the best day of his lifesix moons later squirrelflight was in the nursrey leafpool was standing over her relax squirrelflight it will hurt more if you squirm squirrelflight rolled her eyes but she knew her sister was right ashfur padded in he looked over at the two please star clan let them all live he thought after a few minutes there were three healthy kits sitting at his paws a ginger shecat who looked just like her mother but with ashfurs eyes a tom with squirrelflights eyes and a gray speckled coat a small tortishell shecat with leafpools amber eyes squirrelflight licked them i name the ginger shecat firekit for her grandfather the tom shall be graykit and the tortishell will be olivekit leafpool left them alone to be with their kits ashfur and squirrelflight smiled happily and didnt notice the dark brown tabby growling at them chapter 1 edit olivekit was jumping around trying to convice her mother to let them leave the nusrey come on mom i wanna play with stormykit and willowkit squirrrelflight gave her a glance no olivekit stormykit and willowkit are 3 moons old and your siblings are still asleep olivekits ears drooped and slunk into the back corner ashfur padded in with a smile he always came to greet them in the morning hello olivekit would you like to come exploring olivekit jumped up yes but squirrelflight said i cant go until graykit and firekit wake up ashfur smiled if you come with me she wont mind a bit come on i want to show you the camp olivekit padded after ashfur throughout the camp all the warriors seemed so big she hoped she would become big like them one day they headed back to the nursrey and olivekit was about to go inside when a dark tabby stepped out hello olivekit my name is brambleclaw and i might have been your father he laughed and stalked away olivekit was confused dad why did he say that he could have been my dad ashfur looked at his daughter it was truly no harm to tell her well olivekit when brambleclaw was a young warrior he fell in love with squirrelflight she picked meand he has been jealous ever since be careful of him he might want to hurt you with that ashfur padded into the warriors den olivekit padded into the nursrey wondering why in the name of starclan would brambleclaw want to hurt a kit little did she know a dark shape was watching her every move firekits eyes snapped open something was wrong where were the others she stood up and peered around the nursrey graykit was still there and ferncloud was snoozing but the others were gone olivekit squirrelflight where are you ferncloud stirred firekit where are foxkit and icekit she looked worried when i didnt answer oh star clan she yowled shadow clan has come and stolen them graykit perked his ears shadow clan is attacking he mumbled sleepily no mousebrain i replied ferncloud is just panicing graykit wasnt convinced stormykit and willowkit are gone too he yowled sorreltail is probably outside with them i muttered squirrelflight stuck her head in have you seen olivekit or any of the other kits ashfur leaped in no scent of them squirrelflight are there foxes about graykit shivered he is such a wuss squirrelflight ran out trying to contain her worries ashfur voiced her worst fears they are going to die suddenly willowkit and stormykit ran in ferncloud ran over where have you been sorreltail must be out of her mind with worry stormykit looked nervous but willowkit spoke up brackenfur was showing us the lake ferncloud shook her head and went back to her nest stormykit muttered her kits are still with brackenfur at the lake they two of them went back to their dens firekit was getting bored so she snuck outside graykit tagged along are you sure we should do this he asked firekit rolled her eyes and started looking around some more suddenly a dark shape lunged out and grabbed her and graykit by the scruff of their necks they were dragged off until they were thrown into a dark den now shut up growled an unfriendly voice olivekit was crouching in the far corner firekit and graykit cuddled with her trying to figure out what was going on meanwhile back at camp squirrelflight was panicking leafpool confirmed her and ashfurs thoughts something has stolen them then her eyes darkened and uttered squirrelflights worst fear and brambleclaws not in camp graykit shivered how did he let firekit talk him out of leaving camp how would they get home now i want squirrelflight he whispered you are such a wuss replied firekit olivekit shook her head how do we get out of this mess firekit widend her eyes olivekit do you recognize the cat that dumped us here olivekit shook her head graykit huddled up in a ball the dark shape loomed over them well you three might have been my kin if your mother hadnt thought a piece of foxdung was better olivekit gasped brambleclaw how could you shut up fruit was the reply its time for me to get revenge on squirrelflight and ashfur ill start by killing their kits he cackled firekit lunged up not in your life you traitor she yowled with starclans strenth she pinned him down and scratched his belly he yowled in pain and skid to the side so thats how you wanna play it huh fine you can have the slow and painful death he darted so fast with his claws unsheathed preparing to scratch her till she was a rat he was completely ruthless he jumped in the air planning to land on firekit so fast that there was no time for her to get away graykit couldnt stand it anymore he jumped out of the hole and leaped upon brambleclaw get away from my sister brammbleclaw whirled around you might fight with the power of starclan but i have the blood of tigerstar on my side he leaped at graykit and slit open his throat with one long claw firekit and olivekit stood shocked brambleclaw growled at them and unless you want to be next get in the hole and shut up the two sisters hid in the hole hoping squirrelflight would find them back at thunderclan camp firestar was sending out patrol after patrol after patrol to find the kits ashfur was trying to keep calm but squirrelflight was in a total panic attack how would she survive brackenfurs patrol said that the kit scent was completely gone squirrelflight fainted ashfur scrambled to his paws i must find them he ran out of camp squirrelflight jumped up to follow him she raced as fast as her legs could take her suddenly brambleclaw jumped out of the bushes squirrelflight yowled im going to kill you chapter 2 edit brambleclaw dived out of the way whats with you squirrelflight he mewed you know what its about she yowled ashfur leaped in between them stop he cried maybe brambleclaw is just in the wrong place at the wrong time we dont know it was him that stole our kits with that he raced away squirrelflight followed but not with out raking her claws down brambleclaws side squirrelflight and ashfur raced towards the windclan border i can smell them yowled ashfur they reached the hole firekit poked her head out of the hole squirrelflight ashfur is that you squirrelflight let out a huge sigh of releif where are the others olivekit poked her head up im here with firekit but graykit is dead squirrelflight fainted again what happend asked ashfur olivekit got nervous when ashfur asked this um you see brambleclaw came and tried to kill us he actually killed graykit hes over there olivekit shivered ashfur picked up graykits body and brought it over to firekit olivekit and squirrelflight my son murmurmed ashfur ashfur carried graykits body back to camp squirrelflight and the kits followed olivekit was horrified what would brambleclaw do to us now firestar knew that even thought graykit was dead he deserved a dying warrior ceromony at least he could be a warrior in starclan he would be rememberd forever firestar opened his mouth to speak i ask my warrior ancestors to look down on this kit he has learned the warrior code and given up his life in the service of his clan let star clan receive him as a warrior he will be known as grayleaf sandstorm turned to stare awkwardly at him what asked firestar sandstorm turned away without another word he deserved his name we dont know how he died but judging from the marks on him and firekit he died saving her ashfur said nothing about brambleclaw thats when it dawned on me when i said brambleclaw it kinda sounded like brnlefaw he must of thought i was crazy and why was sandstorm mad at firestar what was wrong with calling him grayleaf from now on you will be known as stormypaw i stared at stormypaw and willowpaw they were so lucky why did they get to be apprentices before olivekit and i as if to read my thoughts olivekit mewed stormypaw and willowpaw are 3 moons older than us we will be apprentices soon 3 moons had passed since the death of our brother grayleaf he might have been a complete wuss but he was still our kin squirrelflight was still mourning his death ashfur was over it but he was still sad brambleclaw hadnt done anything to us thank starclan but he was still planning something olivekit and i knew it was him who killed grayleaf but ashfur and squirrelflight would never belive us tonight was the gathering stormypaw and willowpaw were going they promised to tell us all about it though i couldnt belive we wernt going in fact we were still kits squirrelflight told us that we would be apprentices soon but i wanted to be an apprentice now ferncloud was heading to the gathering too i thought about following her but it didnt work like that she would scent me a long way off olivekit was asleep in the corner i then got the idea to put a fire ant in her nest but she would find it willowpaw rushed into the nursery with details about the gathering i smiled willowpaw was so kind firekit and i would be apprentices in a few dawns firekit was pestering me about it day and night i dont know where i got my quietness from but it wasnt from squirrelflight or ashfur they loved talking maybe i got it from leafpool squirrelflights sister who happens to be our medicine cat leafpool is so awesome i want to be a medicine cat instead of a warrior leafpool doesnt have an apprentice so maybe i could be a medicine cat that would be so fun id rather treat wounds and sort herbs that go on patrols or fight battles firekit says i am very boring i poked my head out of the nursery firestar lept onto the highledge would all the cats old enough to catch their own prey gather beneath the highledge for a clan meeting i bolted outside this had to be firekits and my apprentice ceromony firestar looked down at myself and firekit squirrelflight sat next to ashfur near the front this was going to be awesomefirestar spoke leafpool has decided to take on an apprentice until she recives her warrior name olivekit you will be known as olivepaw leafpool spoke up cats of thunderclan as you know i will not be around forever so its time i took an apprentice i have chosen a cat who has shown honesty and loyalty your next medicine cat will be olivepaw olivepaw do you accept the post of apprentice to leafpool i do then at the halfmoon you must travel to the moonpool to be accepted by star clan before the other medicine cats the good wishes of all thunderclan will go with youfirekit you have reached the age of six moons and it is time for you to be apprenticed from this day on until you receive your warrior name you will be known as firepaw your mentor will be brambleclaw i hope brambleclaw will pass down all he knows to you firepaws eyes widend what she screamed firestar pretended not to hear brambleclaw you are ready to take on an apprentice you had received excellent training from myself and you have shown yourself to be brave and loyal loyal sure i thought you will be the mentor of firepaw and i expect you to pass on all you know to her firepaw olivepaw firepaw olivepaw cried everyone i tried to be happy but something was stirring in my mind would my sister make it out alive chapter 3 edit leafpool sat next to me in the den i had only been an apprentice for one sunrise but i felt like i knew everythingleafpool turned to me mousefur has a toothache and longtails eyes are acting up berrypaw got stung by a bee what should we do i smiled blackberry leaves for berrypaw chewed into a pulp celandine for longtail and alderbark for mousefur leafpool nodded take these to them i quickly did so being medicine cat apprentice was way more fun than being a warriori am not a timid cat i like adventure i love new places i hate my mentor how could firestar do this to me brambleclaw nearly killed me and now he is my mentor i will rip out his throat in revenge for killing my brother poor grayleaf at least i know that hes safe in starclan he came to olivepaw in a dream she said that he told her to tell me that he was safe in starclan  i told her to tell him that i was going to kill brambleclaw eventually brambleclaw wasnt very happy about being my mentor either he told me to hunt when i asked him what we should do he stayed in camp and didnt do anything useful i had to sneak out with stormypaw and willowpaw so i could get training brambleclaw was completely useless i hate him i scratched up a stick pretending it was brambleclaws neck i gave up after a while and padded over to the fresh kill pile there sat brightheart hello she mewed brightheart is overly friendly i think the only cats she has ever hated in her life are tigerstar and daisy i was exploring the lake shore when i came across a stick covered in strange markings was it a sign from starclan what would firepaw say what did this stick mean i looked up as olivepaw raced into camp she was carrying the stick i scratched earlier oh no i thought olivepaw found the stick and now she thinks its a sign from starclan she ran to me firepaw look what i found by the lake when i was collecting marigold she rolled the stick in front of me well olivepaw actually i protested meekly isnt this awesome only a few sunrises into my training and ive already recived a sign from starclan she was so excited i decided to let her belive that it really was a sign i didnt want to upset her im gonna show leafpool she called and ran into the medicine cat den my sister is a mouse brain i ran into the den leafpool had been putting away some rasberry leaf look what i found its a sign from starclan leafpool looked at the stick olivepaw you have just started you training are you sure this is a sign i glared at my mentor do you doubt starclan leafpool shook her head i put the stick in the back of the den i paced over to brambleclaw can we go out for training today brambleclaw shook his head go hunt i stormed away what was his problem i was resting in my den after catmint collecting and was about to fall asleep when i heard a shout from the entrance olivepaw come here i raced out leafpool sat by the entrance she was panting and clearly tired next to her sat a small black kit i found her while out herb collecting leafpool collasped to the ground in exasution firestar walked over to the entrance a kit we must take care of her i nodded it would be heartless for a clan not to take in a kit what kind of rouge would just abandon her kit like this leafpool stood up squirrelflight do you have any milk left my mother nodded i will suckle her squirrelflight picked up the kit and carried her to the nursery i led leafpool back to the medicine cat den were there any more kits with her i asked leafpool shook her head does she have a name leafpool shook her head again i went to see squirrelflight the kit was asleep next to her i leaned in does she have a name squirrelflight nodded leafpool asked if we could call her hollykit i agreed i nodded hollykit thats a lovely name squirrelflight suddenly looked concerned olivepaw will you and firepaw treat hollykit as though she was your sister i purred of course i would yes i then went to talk to firepaw she was excited its like having grayleaf back almost i purred firepaw laughed and went back to the apprentices den i returned to the medicine cat den when sleep came i walked out of the apprentices den to see leafpool and olivepaw leaving camp where are you going i asked olivepaw beamed im going to moonpool tonights the halfmoon so we get to see all the medicine cats from the other clans i grinned at her if she could have a good day then so could i i padded over to brambleclaw train me he laughed why would i waste my time training you he turned away i followed him do it he didnt reply train me or i will tell firestar what you did to my brother he froze you wouldnt dare i stuck my face into his my tail twitching i will my hiss was threatening he let out a low growl fine meet me at the training hollow he raced out of camp you wont always get your way brambleclaw with a smirk i trotted into the training hollow i waited for brambleclaw it wasnt until sunhigh when he approachedalright lets get down to the basics we trained until sunset i had found my courage at sunset brambleclaw looked at me no more after this he growled you got your way once not twice i narrowed my blue eyes you will train me tomorrow i will be the best warrior his amber eyes became dazed yes firepaw came his monotone reply i smirked thats much better chapter 4 editthen when they show signs of retreat show no mercy brambleclaw growled olivepaw listened in awe but showed no signs she wasnt gonna show this mangy fleabag she loved the feel of blood on her claws for her wussy brothers death she planned on killing brambleclaw during her night vigil as a warrior heh that would show himand i killed ash fur in a battle with shadow clan  and hyponotised squirrelflight into loving him again i fucking hate you all bye bitchesthe end categories brightys fanfics fanfictions add category
