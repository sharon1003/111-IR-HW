relay the main symptoms of a bad fuel relay is either the vehicle is not getting fuel causing it to not start or the fuel pump staying on causing the battery to drain when the part starts to fail you may be able to get it running again after trying to start it multiple times the part usually deteriorates rapidly from that point until the vehicle will not start if the pump is stuck on you will hear the buzzing of the fuel pump coming from the rear of the vehicle where the fuel pump is located in this case the pump will remain on until battery is drained below are similar complaints we have heard first it took a few tries to get it started would the push start now it will not start at all it tries to turn over but takes about 15 minutes in order to do so the vehicle shut off while driving and took multiple tries to get it to start back up i replaced the expensive battery in my car only to find it dead 10 days later after a full charge it died yet again my grand cherokee acts like it is out of gas my dodge caravan stalls out and is difficult to start back up removing your tipm if you do not feel comfortable doing the above ask a mechanic to remove the tipm and then send it to usstep 1

battery terminal remove the cable from the battery make sure that the cable does not come in to contact with the battery terminal while you are working on the vehicle step 2 open the lid of the tipm and remove the nut do not lose the nut once the nut is removed take the cable off of the bolt and move it out of the way step 3 unclip the tipm you can use a flat head screwdriver to unclip each clip one at a time there are 4 clips total you may have to do one side at a time and nudge one side up then move over to the other side gently pull upwards on the tipm step 4 unplug all connections on the bottom of the tipm the connectors are color coded they have a rotating clamp on each connector there is also a small black release button on most of the connectors holding the clamp in place press this down and then rotate the clamp on each connector which should eject it off of the tipm pay close attention to this step as you will need to reinstall them when you receive your repaired tipm back

nc and sc most of the rest of the eastern us will have a two business day delivery time the two day shipping time region goes as far west as chicago little rock and new orleans however upstate ny ri massachusetts vt nh and maine are three business days we may on occasion take longer due to circumstances beyond our control for example we close if it snows for folks from the north i know this is hard to understand but it is true fortunately we only get snow perhaps once every other year why did this part go bad there are relays on the circuit board which fail we are not sure why these parts are failing so early many vehicles get a faulty tipm in the 4050000 mile range can absolute computers troubleshoot the tipm no we simply replace the relays on the board the board is not easy to get to it requires careful disassembly once we have the circuit board out we replace the relays on the board the fuel pump relay is the only issue we fix if your tipm has other issues please do not send it to us we have no way of testing it or repairing it it should be noted that if the relays have failed it is usually obvious to our technicians after the disassembly is completed we replace the components that typically fail with new components and then reassemble the tipm how hard is it to replace the part taking the tipm apart is the difficult part areas of it are glued together and there are also fragile pins on the inside once we have it disassembled we desolder the old parts replace them and then reassemble the entire tipm if you have experience with replacement of surface mount components on computer boards then the actual replacement of the component s is straight forward however without our equipment or experience desoldering removing throughhole smd components is difficult and you will likely ruin your part by experimenting on it what if the repair does not fix my problem if your dodge durango jeep grand cherokee or dodge caravan has 40000 – 50000 miles on it and is suddenly experiencing one of the problems listed above it is most likely your tipm we will know when we disassemble your tipm if your fuel relay is going bad or not if we repair your unit and your vehicle still does not work call us we are very reasonable strive to keep everyone happy and will issue refunds at our discretion all of the tipms we have repaired to date are working perfectly will this need to be repaired again at 100000 miles since it initially failed at 50000 miles we replace the bad relay with a brand new part we use the identical part we are not sure if the original parts were faulty or if the parts are inadequate for the vehicle or perhaps some other design flaw causes this problem the repair may be permanent or you may need to have the tipm repaired again does this repair come with a warranty no we replace the fuel relay on the tipm’s circuit board we have no way of knowing how this part was designed judging by the many complaints we’re seeing online we have no interest in providing a warranty the old relay will be properly removed a new one will be properly installed and your tipm will be shipped back since 2001 we have handled tens of thousands of repairs this involves someone else doing the disassembly and reassembly the refund discussed above would be the only option offered if the tipm repair is not satisfactory how much is a replacement
