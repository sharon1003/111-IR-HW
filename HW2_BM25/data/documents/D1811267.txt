blood tests  lab analysis how it works and what you need to know by ryan andrews share blood tests aka blood work can show us obviously what’s in our blood and by extension what’s in our bodies that’s because blood gives us insight into what we can’t see from the outside in this article we outline how it works and what you need to know what is blood work blood is a transport system for the body we carry all kinds of things in the approximately 5 litres of blood that circulates constantly through our system blood tests aka blood work can show us what’s in our blood — and by extension what’s in our bodies blood can also show us changes in our bodies that we might not be able to see from the outside — such as our blood sugar levels or nutritional status thus we can use blood work to assess overall health and it can give us a much more accurate and objective snapshot of wellness than “gee i think i had some veggies yesterday” or “i feel fat today” how is blood work done we get blood for testing from capillary skin puncture finger stickdried blood samples blood drawn from an artery blood drawn from a vein most commonbone marrow aspiration what happens to blood after it’s drawn blood is analyzed in a lab the blood is put into a centrifuge and spun until it separates reference ranges then technicians compare results to a “reference range” the reference range is the range of expected values for each test listed expected ranges used in lab analyses include 95 of the “healthy” population so 95 of healthy people would have lab values within these ranges this range varies depending on the lab region eg us vs eu and type of blood component a number above or below this reference range can give valuable diagnostic information about body systems high and low values are especially useful when taken in context with other symptoms lifestyle factors and tests variation in results and ranges lab values vary for each person and must be assessed relative to other factors while reference ranges are established after testing a large number of healthy people everyone is slightly different blood analyses vary based on time of year posturepositioning foodfluid intake stress medicationsupplement use alcohol smoking exercisephysical activity general tests blood work the tests the basic test a general lab ordered by a physician is typically called smac20 sma20 or chem20 this basic test looks at 20 different parts of the blood including levels of certain minerals proteins etc this test is standard and should be done although it’s not very telling of one’s overall health profile beyond the basic smac20 there are many different blood tests you can request highlighted below are some of the most useful tests cardiovascular tests test what it is higher with lower with total cholesterol cholesterol is necessary for building brain and nerve cells along with various hormones too much of it floating around the blood is associated with cardiovascular disease cvd some experts claim that if you keep this under 150 mgd l – you’ll be “heart attack resistant” cholestasis nephritic syndrome chronic renal failure hypothyroidism alcoholism a diet high in cholesterol and fat obesity pregnancy myeloproliferative disease eg polycythemia vera thrombocytosis myelofibrosis chronic myelogenous leukemia hyperthyroidism malnutrition some lung diseases warmer months sitting versus standing certain drugs estrogen medications low density lipoprotein ldlthis compound carries cholesterol to body cells from the liver small dense ldl levels have a strong association to cvd overeating and most folks overeat processed fats sugars and refined grains hypothyroidism nephrotic syndrome multiple myeloma hepatic obstruction anorexia nervosa diabetes renal failure porphyria pregnancy androgen use tangier disease hyperthyroidism anemia reye’s syndrome inflammatory joint disease estrogen use apoplipoprotein a  bthese are surface proteins of lipoprotein particles apo a is the main component of hdl apo b is the main component of ldl apo a not significant apo b diabetes hypothyroidism renal failure hepatic disease cushing’s syndrome apo a diabetes renal failure diets very high in polyunsaturated fat smoking some drugs genetic diseases apo b malnutrition plantbased diets high polyunsaturated fat diets some drugs genetic diseases lipoprotein a lp athis is another subfraction of cholesterol high levels of this are associated with premature heart disease postmenopausal women africanamerican race renal failuredisease estrogen depletion hypothyroidism diabetes not significant – levels might be slightly lower with niacin use high density lipoprotein hdlthis compound carries cholesterol from cells back to the liver there is a strong relationship between hdl and cvd the ratio of total cholesterol to hdl is considered a better predictor of heart disease than total cholesterol or ldl the goal is to have a ratio of 51 or lower in men 441 in women an optimum ratio is 351 or lower in men 341 or lower in women lots of exercise for many years estrogen use low levels of alcohol consumption diabetes cholestasis renal failure obesity sedentary behavior certain drugs insulin resistance triglycerides fat in the blood levels predict the body’s ability to metabolize fat when triglycerides are under 100 the ldl calculation is usually inflated the triglyceride to hdl ratio might be the single best predictor of heart disease risk a ratio above 41 is cause for concern the goal is a ratio of 21 the lower the better cvd liver disease alcoholism renal disease hypothyroidism pregnancy birth control medications smoking obesity diabetes gout anorexia nervosa a recent meal with fat malnutrition hyperthyroidism some lung diseases strenuous exercise a lean body creactive protein crpa marker for low grade inflammation useful in predicting cvd pain fever infection inflammatory bowel disease arthritis autoimmune disease not significant – can be an indication that inflammation is decreasing homocysteine an amino acid found in small amounts in the blood resulting from the synthesis of cysteine from methionine only cleared from the body with adequate blood levels of vitamin b12 b6 and folate elevations of homocysteine are associated with cvd folic acid deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency vitamin b6 deficiency heredity older age kidney disease male gender certain medications not significant liver function tests test what it is higher with lower with alkaline phosphatase if the bile duct is blocked cholestasis this enzyme gets backed up and spills into the bloodstream values can help to evaluate bone health since elevated levels show active bone growth or inflammation due to damaged or healing bones if elevated in conjunction with ggt we have a liver issue younger age fatty liver pregnancy obstructive jaundice liver disease diabetes alcohol consumption eating a fatty meal gallbladder conditions bone growth damaged bones paget’s disease vitamin d deficiency not significant may indicate celiac disease malnutrition scurvy or magnesiumzinc deficiency ggta cholestatic liver enzyme if the bile duct is blocked cholestasis this enzyme gets backed up and spills into the blood stream evaluates liver and gallbladder function but is also found in kidneys helpful when alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated high alcohol intake various liver disorders stress excess body fat exercise some drugs if ggt and alkaline phosphatase are elevated it’s likely a liver disorder if ggt is low and alkaline phophatase is elevated it’s likely a bone disorder instead of a liver disorder otherwise low ggt isn’t significant astsgotan enzyme found mainly in the liver heart and muscles – organs with high metabolic activity liver damage heart damage muscle damage high body fat diabetes mononucleosis pregnancy hypothyroidism shock some drugs azotemia dialysis vitamin b6 deficiency altsgptenzyme found mainly in the liver damage to the liver from alcohol inflammation increased body fat mononucleosis some drugs heart attack aspirin strenuous exercise not significant bilirubin this is a normal yellow fluid metabolic byproduct of red blood cell breakdown that must be cleared by the liver bile flow impairment carcinoma liver disease high levels of red blood cell breakdown prolonged fasting anorexia nervosa niacin supplementation some forms of anemia note exposing a blood sample to 1 hour of sunlight can decrease bilirubin rare and not significant note foods with lots of orange color carrots yams can increase the yellow hue in serum and falsely increase bilirubin levels if tested with a spectrophotometer ammonia the end product of protein metabolism the liver normally removes ammonia via portal vein circulation with conversion to urea levels in our blood dramatically influence acidbase balance and brain function reye’s syndrome liver disease gut hemorrhage renal disease inborn errors of metabolism excessive protein intake some drugs intense exercise smoking alcohol constipation gut infection not significant kidney function tests test what it is higher with lower with creatinine this is a metabolic byproduct of muscle metabolism that must be filtered by the kidneys since muscle creatine breaks down into creatinine someone with more muscle will have abundant creatine and potentially higher creatinine levels when there is disordered kidney function the ability to excrete creatinine diminishes impaired kidney function along with high bun obstruction of the urinary tract muscle disease shock heart failure dehydration rhabdomyolysis high meat diet hyperthyroidism decreased muscle mass inadequate protein intake pregnancy low levels usually aren’t cause for concern bun blood urea nitrogenurea is a waste product of protein metabolism eliminated from the body through urine feces and perspiration bun is a measure for kidney function because if filtration in the kidneys can’t keep up with elimination kidney function is likely diminished various kidney diseases heart failure urinary tract obstruction gut hemorrhage diabetes with ketoacidosis steroid use circulatory disorders high animal protein intake intense exercise salt or water depletion from sweating diarrhea vomiting pregnancy liver failure acromegaly celiac disease syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone siadh malnutrition creatininebun ratio this provides more information about potential kidney problems increased ratio with normal creatinine occurs in salt depletion dehydration heart failure catabolic states gut hemorrhage high animal protein intake increased ratio with elevated creatinine occurs in obstruction of the urinary tract ketoacidosis prerenal azotemia decreased ratio with decreased bun occurs in tubular necrosis malnutrition dialysis siadh pregnancy decreased ratio with elevated creatinine occurs in some drug use rhabdomyolysis muscular folks who are developing kidney failure thyroid tests test what it is higher with lower with tshthe thyroid has large hormone storage potential and a slow rate of turnover tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland and stimulates thyroid gland function leading to the release of t3 and t4 tsh secretion is regulated by t3 and t4 feedback inhibition and is stimulated by thyrotropinreleasing hormone released from the hypothalamus this test is the most sensitive for primary hypothyroidism an underactive thyroid advanced age amphetamine abuse an overactive thyroid corticosteroid use too much thyroid replacement medication tsh tends to go down later in the day free t3 triiodothyroninethe fraction of t3 that exists unbound in the blood hyperthyroidism high altitude t3 toxicosis hypothyroidism late stage pregnancy total t3 triiodothyroninet3 has three iodine atoms attached and more metabolic action than t4 but the effect is short lived this test is helpful for diagnosing t3 toxicosis and hyperthyroidism not useful for diagnosing hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism t3 toxicosis thyroid medication use heroin use estrogen use pregnancy iodine deficiency goiter hypothyroidism anabolic steroid use aspirin niacin use fasting malnutrition free t4 thyroxinethis only makes up a small fraction of total t4 free t4 is unbound and available to tissues it’s metabolically active hyperthyroidism heparin use hypothyroidism treated with t4 hypothyroidism chronic illness pregnancy total t4 thyroxinet4 has four atoms of iodine attached this test shows the total amount of t4 consisting of t4 bound to carrier proteins and unbound t4 available to cells bound t4 is inactive hyperthyroidism high estrogen levels from pregnancy birth control use estrogen replacement hepatitis lymphoma heroin use excessive iodine intake steroid use liver disease hypothyroidism aspirin nephritic syndromer t3 reverse t3if the body is under stress it may convert t4 into r t3 reverse t3 an inactive form of t3 r t3 can also bind to t3 receptors blocking actual t3 this allows the body to “turn down” energy levels t3 and r t3 have an inverse relationship when there is more of one there is less of the other r t3 test results can be indicative of wilson’s syndrome reproductive function tests test what it is higher with lower with testosterone responsible for the development of male secondary sex characteristics and sex drive in both men and women secreted by testes ovaries and adrenal glands exists in serum as both unbound free and bound unbound is active testosterone levels are subject to diurnal variation with a peak in the early morning for men anabolic steroid use cancer of the testes for women hyperthyroidism adrenal tumors androgen resistance ovarian tumors hirsutism polycystic ovaries some drugs virilization hilar cell tumors for men hypogonadism klinefelter’s syndrome hypopituitarism liver disease some drugs down syndrome advanced age alcohol abuse some drugs for women menopause ovarian failure igf1a growth factor produced by the liver and muscles directly in response to growth hormone igf1 can help evaluate pituitary function and diagnose situations related to growth hormone production increased growth hormone production puberty pregnancy pituitary tumors obesity deficiency or insensitivity to growth hormone decreased pituitary function advancing age anorexia nervosa malnutrition diabetes kidney disease

of prostate cancers are missed by this lab alone prostate cancer prostate enlargement not significant carbohydrate tolerance tests test what it is higher with lower with fasted insulin insulin is a hormone secreted by the pancreas in response to increases in blood sugar usually following a meal pancreatic tumors type 2 diabetes acromegaly cushing’s syndrome obesity most common cause diabetes medications birth control medications type 1 diabetes hypopituitarism diabetes medications fasted glucose blood sugar high values will occur if someone isn’t fasted beyond that a true high fasted blood sugar indicates insulin resistance if you are fasted and your blood glucose is above 126 mgd l you have diabetes diabetes cushing’s disease stress acromegaly pituitary adenoma hemochromatosis

with25hydroxyvitamin d 25 ohdthe amount of vitamin d that has been produced in the body from sun food and supplements the halflife is 15 days this lab can help indicate bone defects low levels are associated with immune disorders cvd and some cancers excessive supplementation or consumption from food dietary insufficiency125 oh2dthis lab is not a good indicator of vitamin d status as it has a short half life of only 15 hours and levels in the blood are regulated tightly by hormones and minerals 125 oh2d only starts to decline when a severe deficiency of vitamin d is present vitamin b12also known as antipernicious anemia factor necessary for red blood cell production tissue repair dna synthesis nervous system development leukemia renal failure liver disease polycythemia vera heart

very high levels are associated with heart rhythm abnormalities kidney failure excessive intake of high potassium foodssupplements fluid loss from medications diuretics diarrhea vomiting chloride electrolyte regulated by the kidneys and adrenal glands a high or low level usually corresponds to a high or low level of sodium or potassium iron this mineral is necessary for red blood cells and is the basis of hemoglobin iron can be lost through the intestinal and urinary tract and through the menstrual cycle lost iron must be replaced in the diet iron losses in men and postmenopausal women are very low all iron blood test results can be altered by alcohol consumption estrogens birth control antibiotics aspirin and testosterone levels also change with the time of day hemolytic anemia iron

wilson’s disease siadh xanthinuria mishaps with blood draws if blood is drawn from your arm after the tourniquet is on for several minutes values can be skewed because cells will concentrate in the lower arm if the needle used is too small it can cause red blood cells to break leading to a skewed analysis if the puncture site isn’t sanitized – infection can result if you tense up excessively during a blood draw you can experience extensive bruising at the site summary and recommendations getting annual blood work with a physician is a good idea for preventative health this way you can observe trends and catch potential health problems before they spiral out of control note if you want to track your health trends over time make sure to request a copy of your lab results and keep
