details last updated 19 march 2018preview she was a name in our family database but nobody knew much about her family tradition said her mother and stepfather took her to chicago where she grew up and became a professional nurse it was rumored that she had been baptized into the lds church i it was also rumored that she had joined the rlds church ii in a family genealogy her cousin audentia smith anderson indicated that she was “living unmarried in independence missouri” in 1929 iiiinitial investigation showed that much of what we had on our record was wrong we had the year 1932 for her death and we assumed she died in independence jackson county missouri but research showed no death or burial record for her there a search in ‘findagravecom’ showed that she had died in holden johnson county missouri not independence it provided a death year but not a day it also falsely indicated she was buried in the holden cemetery we needed to find her obituary i contacted community of christ historian ron romig who responded with a few notes gleaned from their archives that were helpful i enquired about an obituary which might tell of a funeral who officiated who spoke etc a search in the community of christ archives disclosed that no obituary was ever published for alice fredericka in the saints’ herald ivlachlan mac kay then director of historical sites for the community of christ discovered the record of her burial in mound grove cemetery independence v and provided a map showing the exact location of her grave not far from that of joseph smith iii’s with this much information the committee decided to see what would be required to get permission to mark her grave with an appropriate monument frances orton chairperson for the advisory committee of the joseph smith sr family foundation agreed to take on the project permission was granted and the memorial program was held on august 8 2011 see report of that event with pictures following the timeline and new detailed bio below this timeline and bio below while this new bio does not resolve all our questions solid documentation from both lds and rlds church records and extensive review of the u s census records

search of our longlost cousin alice fredericka smith the only child of frederick granger williams smith and anna annie marie jones was born 27 november 1858 in nauvoo hancock co illinois her father frederick a son of the martyred prophet joseph smith born 20 june 1836 in kirtland geauga co ohio was eight when his father was killed in june 1844 and elevenandahalf when his widowed mother emma hale smith married lewis c bidamon at nauvoo in december 1847 vi frederick grew to manhood in nauvoo alongside his adopted sister julia murdock smith older brother joseph smith 3 rd and younger brothers alexander hale smith and david hyrum smith their lives were shadowed but not blighted by the tragedy of their father’s death as they were tightly bonded as a family worked hard and became responsible young adults frederick perhaps the most sensitive of the family was noted for his gentle and cheerful nature anna marie’s parents william and alice anderson jones had moved to nauvoo anticipating working on the proposed warsaw to rockford railroad which failed to come to fruition vii that failure led to her parents leaving the area within a few years and may have contributed to the unfortunate events that befell anna marie and frederick’s relationship we know nothing of frederick and anna’s courtship perhaps the couple even eloped anna maria born 7 apr 1841 at steubenville jefferson county ohio was only 16 years of age when she married 21yearold frederick granger williams smith 13 september 1857 in steuben jefferson ohio a year later 27 november 1858 anna marie gave birth to little alice fredericka in nauvoo it was determined that frederick should manage the smith farm a few miles east of nauvoo in senora township the couple lived at the farm until december 1861 on christmas day joseph iii went out to the farm to visit his brother and see how they were doing to his great dismay he found frederick alone desperately ill in a cold house without water available to him or any wood to burn anna had left a few days before christmas taking threeyearold alice fredericka with her without telling anyone she was leaving joseph did what he could to make frederick more comfortable then went to fetch his mother joseph and his mother moved frederick to the mansion house in nauvoo where emma could nurse him properly alexander and his wife elizabeth who had married in may 1861 moved to the farm to take care of things there in spite of emma’s nursing skill and desperate efforts frederick continued to waste away from a debilitating illness in his lungs their adopted sister julia living with her husband john middleton in st louis missouri wrote loving letters begging him to get well his younger brother david hyrum then 17 years of aged helped all he could to comfort the sick man frederick died 11 april 1862 only 26 years of age in his memoires dictated in 1913 joseph iii expressed his feelings of disgust that “annie” had left frederick in such a desperate situation without letting the family know she was going one can speculate but cannot comprehend her behavior perhaps she was overwhelmed with caring for a sick husband in the primitive circumstances at the smith farm perhaps she intended to return but was delayed for some unknown reason little alice fredericka was about three when her father became ill and her mother took her away trying to track alice’s location in the first years after her mother left the nauvoo area has proved almost impossible we assumed anna took little alice and went to her parents—but where were they unfortunately the trail seemed to be lost because there is no census until 1870 in that census we did find that alice’s parents were living in pilot grove illinois which is a little less than 20 miles northeast of nauvoo but alice and her mother are not found in their home in 1870 according to joseph iii memoirs “annie widow of frederick g w smith married william john creen in quincy illinois in about 1866” viii this marriage is also noted in anderson audentia smith ancestry and posterity p 578 william john creen was born 1843 in statun germany ix so far we have not been able to find the record of their marriage joseph iii noted that anna and william creen returned to nauvoo at some point expecting to get some inheritance from fredericks estate joseph iii suggested they check the country records which they did they found that frederick had owned nothing and left nothing but debts after that date not determined william and anna creen eventually moved to chicago taking little alice fredericka with them and did not return to nauvoo again assuming the creens took alice to chicago we looked for them there but failed to find them in the 1870 or 1880 census the first sighting we found is in the 1900 u s census chicago cook illinois “alice f smith age 39” living in the household of william j creen with wife alice’s marital status in this census is listed as ‘single’ and her occupation is nurse a sisterinlaw emma jones wife or widow of anna’s brother and her daughter jessie a jones are also living in the household according to family tradition alice grew up and became a professional nurse we found this confirmed as she is listed as a nurse in several census records since she became a professional nurse we expected to find her name in nursing school records we discovered that the illinois training school of nursing opened in cook county illinois in 1881 x thinking that alice fredericka who would have been about 23 at this time may have attended that school we tried to check on student records unfortunately the records concerning students for that school are sealed so there is no way to verify her status there we found that alice’s mother anna creen died in chicago illinois 11 october 1901 xiin the 1910 u s census we find alice listed as “alice f fenest stepdaughter age 50” living in the household of w j creen who is head of household alice has no occupation listed with this change in name we wonder about a marriage husband but her marriage status is listed as single we have not yet found any record of her marriage to fenest anytime between 1900 and 1910 all future census indicate that she seems to have gone back to using her smith name search for her marriage to fenest turned up nothing the fenest name never comes up again in regard to her during all the years since her mother took her away from nauvoo alice fredericka was apparently lost to the smith family until 1910 in a letter written by joseph smith iii to his nephew elbert a smith joseph tells elbert that john henry smith a cousin from utah member of the council of twelve lds church in utah found her in chicago and told him about finding her independence mo january 5 1910dear brother and nephew elbert a smith   my brother frederick has a daughter in chicago whose address i obtained from president john henry smith who met her there her name ought to go on the clan list and she ought to receive an invitation to attend a family gathering i will try to get in touch with her with her address  ” xiias well as telling joseph iii about alice fredericka being in chicago john henry had apparently told the lds church people in chicago about her john henry smith died in 1911 so did not participate in the conversion which came to alice fredericka several years later lds church records indicate alice fredericka smith was baptized and confirmed a member of the lds church’ in chicago 6 january 1915 by a m taylor and she was confirmed the same day by g e elsworth xiii her lds membership was brief cousin elbert a smith found her in june 1915 and alice fredericka smith was baptized into the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints 12 june 1915 xiv see copy of clipping from the saints herald independence mo 6161915 in this article in the herald elbert as senior editor is reporting his own actions indicating he baptized alice and confirmed her a member of the reorganized church of latter day saints during his stay in chicago in june 1815 this was to him a great triumph and the contents of this news article was repeated almost verbatim in “the history of the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints” volume 7 p 71 xvafter her rlds baptism alice and her stepfather continued to live in chicago for a period of time perhaps mr creen suffered ill health or some misfortune so alice had to quit working and take care of him they seemed to have fallen upon hard times having to sell some of their furniture to provide for their necessities david dowker a member of the rlds church in the chicago area prevailed upon the rlds bishop james f keir to issue her a check for 25 about 1917 alice and mr creen moved to independence missouri where he died 21 january 1918 he was buried in mound grove cemetery after her stepfather’s death alice fredericka seems to have gone back to chicago at least for a time we find her living in ward 13 cook chicago illinois according to the 1920 u s census taken 12  13 january here she is listed as “alice f smith age 60 single she is living in the household of jessie jones a cousin” also living there with her cousin jessie jones jessie’s mother emma whose last name is now day also george curtis a roomer alice’s occupation is listed as ‘nurse’ and she is apparently employed as such at that time we cannot determine exactly when she moved back to independence to stay a typescriptcopy of a handwritten letter from alice f to rebecca weld who lived in lamoni iowa found in the community of christ archives xvi was provided by rlds historian ron romig according to romig this letter was written from on the letterhead of the independence sanitarium van horn boulevard independence missouri xvii it is dated “may 20” no year is given but romig guessed at the year being 1920 or 1922 we know she was in chicago for the 1920 census and we know that rebecca weld married charles nolan in lamoni ia in december 1921 alice refers to rebecca’s husband without naming him from the context of her letter it is obvious alice fredericka is in perilous physical condition my dear cousin rebecca you will think i have forgotten all about you and your dear good letter but that came when i was so very sick i could not write so the reason of my long silence at the time audie was here i could sit in the wheel chair and on nice warm days i was well wrapped put out on porch for two or three hours about four nights ago i had a relapse and have been desperately ill again i could hardly do anything for myself my boudy sic so swollen and inflamed just laid on pillows my eyes  in a terrible condition specialist ordered hot packs and lighted bulb laid on my eyes day and night for a week the nurses had to feed me and do everything for me so you can imagine my condition i am just able to sit up two or three hours in a chair filled with pillows  blankets i can just hold this pencil so i can write my hands will not close and are drawn to one side my feet swell i have never taken one step for nine weeks not allowed on my feet dr harrington cannot operate on tonsils or do anything for me he is afraid sic to on account of my condition  heart he will have to wait until later on so you see i have had a very serious time i was in bed six weeks in unreadable text not expected to live past the time so i have been sick in bed nearly four months quite a poor old me now dear i must close i get so tired i just could cry sometimes but that is silly so i laugh and put on a brave front i was so pleased to hear from you and hope to receive more letters in the future my love to your dear good mother best regards to husband now you know the reason for my long silence please let me hear from you again very soon with lots of love cousin alice f audie who is mentioned in this letter obviously refers to audentia smith anderson a daughter of joseph smith iii another cousin to alice fredericka from the context of the letter audentia must have visited alice at the sanitarium perhaps she informed cousin rebecca weld of alice’s location and circumstances alice’s condition must have improved allowing her to live away from the sanitarium in 1929 according to the biographical information written by her cousin audentia smith anderson at the time her book was published “alice fredericka smith was a professional nurse in chicago for many years is living unmarried in independence” xviiiagain we finally find her listed as smith alice f in the 1930 census for independence jackson county missouri taken april 21 this record indicates she was now 71 “widowed” and living as a “boarder” in the household of james c stanchan 25 and his 13yearold daughter it is interesting that in this census she lists herself as “widowed” other than the 1910 use of the surname of fenest which is the only indication of her having married at any time and in the 1820 census she was listed as alice f smith with the marital status of ‘single’ it is all very strange further research must be done to determine who mr fenest may have been and a marriage record needs to be found if one exists regardless of anything else there is no indication she ever had any children born to her it is important for this fact to be established because several times we have received messages from individuals who believe they are descendants of joseph smith jr claiming that lineage supposedly from alice fredericka smith we had always believed she had never married until she turned with a different last name in that census once again alice f had no children the location of her 1930 residence at 2836 w lexington ave independence is of interest it also strikes particular interest to notice that the census taker for this page was none other than reginald a smith the youngest son of joseph smith iii ad alice’s cousin reginald was a young man who would marry in 1931 later he become a wellrespected educator in the independence area we have no way of knowing whether he knew she was his cousin or even if she knew he was her relative xixwas there a funeral for alice fredericka who officiated who spoke or performed music as stated earlier when i enquired for an obituary in the community of christ archives for this granddaughter of joseph and emma smith i was told there was never one published in the saints’ herald shocked at that discovery i asked “why not” i was informed that unless the family turned one in there would not be any we are left to wonder why is it that nobody from the family took note of her passing many of her cousins were living in and around independence all through the period of her suffering audentia was living in independence until her own death in may 1963 emma smith kennedy lived in independence cared a great deal for shutins and herself had to go to the sanitarium for a number of years until her death in 1960 another cousin vida smith yates a copious writer and family spokesperson had a daughter inez smith davis who compiled a comprehensive history of the reorganized church lived in missouri as well it is in her files in the archives we find the record that describes alice’s rlds baptism it is just hard to understand how these individuals so dedicated to history of the smith family and the rlds church and her own cousins missed writing an obituary for alice fredericka or reporting her death in the saints’ herald in retrospect we do not know when alice fredericka went to the saints’ home in holden and we do not know for certain the cousins did not visit her in today’s travel on highway 91 from independence to holden takes about an hour but if we consider the times it is possible they were simply unable to keep in close contact it would certainly have taken considerably longer in the cars available in the 1930s to make the 100 mileroundtrip not to mention that in the wake of the great depression that lasted from october 1929through the 1930s it’s possible nobody had money for gasoline as i contemplate these factors perhaps we can understand how alice fredericka fell out of their notice in all my research i found nothing indicating that alice fredericka was ever reunited with her grandmother emma who died in 1879 alice would have been about 21 at that time it would seem she was truly lost to the family until she was found in 1910 forgotten until 1915 then lost again until now memorium on 8 august 2011 a large group of smith family and friends gathered in mound grove cemetery for a memorial service placing of her stone monument and dedication of her grave it was quite an emotional experience to be there songs were sung prayers offered and the hearts of dozens of smith family members turned in loving remembrance toward this longlost cousin“rest in peace dear little lost cousin alice fredericka we have found you at last we will see that you are not forgotten”  pictures are from kimberly jo smith’s collection gathered by her grandfather artur marion smithat first it was believed alice fredericka was buried in holden missouri but there was no record of her grave in the holden cemetery then we discovered she was actually buried in mound grove cemetery independence missouri lachlan mc kay a cousin and also director of historical sites for the community of christ provided a map of the graves in mound grove the map indicates alice fredericka is buried in lot 49 space 1 her grave was unmarked in order for the smith family to place a memorial stone on her grave we first had to attempt to find out who owns the lot now and get permission the records found by lachlan mac kay indicated that at the time of her burial the lot was owned by thomas king eva bell king is buried in space 2 which is next to alice’s grave we have no idea what connection alice may have had with the kings frances orton chairman for the joseph smith sr advisory committee took care of the correspondence and contract regarding permission to place the stone in mound grove on the lot where alice is buried lachlan mac kay tried to locate someone from that family to obtain the needed permission but found that the contact information was not working a contract was prepared by the community of christ church giving the smith family permission to have the stone placed on the lot where alice fredricka smith is buried the contract also stipulated that should representatives of the owners king family request it the smith family will remove the stone from that location all this paper work was exchanged signed by frances orton as chairman of the joseph smith sr family foundation advisory committee ijames long a descendant of hyrum smith who was employed at that time at hallmark stone company of fenton mo arranged to have the granite monument made james not only did the stone work but he drove the marker from st louis to independence mo so it was set in place and ready for the family gathering in
