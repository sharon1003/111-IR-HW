publishing group lyrics powered by lyric find add your thoughts59 comments view by highest rated most recent oldest first7 my interpretation i think this song is about falling in love with someone who is ultimately toxicharmingkilling you the protagonist is someone who is selfdestructive almost reminiscent of someone with severe borderline personality or a masochist she passionately falls in love with some she has such a strong attachment to yet this person is also her demise its a dark love story the title of this song conjures up imagery of beauty and darkness paganism is mysterious and at time dark a direct antithesis to poetry a light and delicate art form in the beginning she is pedaling through the dark currents and finds an accurate copy a blueprint of herself this is her saying that through this dark current a euphemism for her selfdestructive activities and behaviors ex a drug addict at a party prostitution etc she finds her soulmate someone just as dark twisted and broken as her swirling black lilies totally ripe a secret code carved yet again the imagery of darkness black is matched with something as delicate and soft as love lilies the secret cove carved is their instant connection that only the two soulmates can understand he offers a handshake crooked five fingers they form a pattern yet to be matched reinforces the idea that she has met her twin flame the love of her life she has never met somebody like this heshe is yet to be matched on the surface simplicity but the darkest pit in me its pagan poetry pagan poetry on the surface their love her identity who she isit is all kept simple people only see the surface they dont know the darkness that lies within her her selfdestructiveness their toxic relationship its a beautiful darkness like pagan poetry morsecoding signals signalsthey pulsate wake me up and wake me up pulsate from my hibernating the illusion is beginning to deteriorate she can no longer keep the facade she has let out on the surface she is battling a side of her that is trying to convince her that he is good for her that their caustic relationship isnt engulfing them into a dark abyss it is as if she had been asleep and hibernating this entire time then we get to the cathartic finale  i love him i love him i love him its important to note the tone of her voice as well as the eerie harp music in the background does she love himof course she does right this is a guy who has amplified this darkness selfdestructiveness with in her and she has most likely done the same to him its conflicting she is madly in love with a man that any sane person would know is ultimately destructive for her this timeim gonna keep me all to myself this portion in particular when coupled with the repetitive  i love him i love him i love him almost sounds like a woman in a domestic abuse relationship i mean think about how many women arewere still in love with the very same man that is also verbally humiliating them feedingsupporting their drug addictions alienating them violently abusing them or even trying to kill them one can say she suffers from stockholm syndrome she loves him and clearly has gotten back with him hence the this time other people advised her to stay away from warned her that he is dangerous that he is leading her down the wrong path but she didnt take heed to their warnings like a moth to a flame there is an otherworldly bond between her and him and she wont let anyone stop them she is going to keep it to herself she wont seek help she wont tell her friendsshe loves him too much and at last the final line and he makes me want to hurt myself again  which is just gutting she is bound by the forces of love to a man that will ultimately be the end of her her death its a pretty dark and twisted song but then again that why i love bjork ilikegreen on february 05 2015 link1 reply log in to reply5 my opinion only you know what is the truth and where it leads you to send you to the actuality blue printshe knows she loves him above all the its soooo clear acurate copy but he cant give her what she wants because all he offers is a friendship handshake she anknows as well it is not what they both wantits fakelike a fake hand shake crooked handshake a hand shake suppose to mean its an honest deal closerbut its crooked from him and she loves himsooo much eileenwo on october 22 2010 link1 reply log in to reply3 general comment this song conjures memories of nathaniel hawthorne’s the scarlet letter for those of you have read it then you’ll understand my post for those of you who have not read the novel it is not horribly difficult to parallel the two like several of you have mentioned the song is of two paramours i’ll use diction which appears in hawthorne’s text which share a very strong bound as the text explicates björk’s lover has the ability to wake her up with out himself being present “ morse coding signals…they pulsate…and wake me up…from my hibernating” this is very similar to the bond which hester prynne and arthur dimmesdale share they are able to sense each others feeling and share the same suffering and guilt but just like björk’s imagery gets across the state of pain which she feels for her lover stating that the “darkest pit” in her is her pagan poetry or forbidden love hester fits the “darkest pit” metaphor as well for she goes through this conflict of knowing that it is wrong for her to love dimmsdale more than she loves godi had to throw in the protestant message in due to the fact that it is hawthorne’s writing it gives the motive of why hester suffers björk never accomplishes that it would be rather interesting to find out why the love hurts her finally hester like björk go through their manly urges of wanting to “hand themselves over” though the lyrics never clarify if björk goes on with her urges and becomes romantically entangled with him  i am sure that she does in the novel dimmsdale declares his sin to the whole colony having fathered hester prynne’s daughter  only to die later but not before declaring that he loves hester new wave witch i really like your body art comparison it sure makes a lot of sense when you apply it to the video carlous on january 09 2005 link no replies log in to reply2 general comment at the end she is saying and he makes me want to hand myself over both times not hurt myself again if you watch the video she is clearly mouthing those words rainbow injection on june 10 2007 link no replies log in to reply2 general comment to me it sounded like forbidden love and the pain of loving someone who doesnt love you and maybe someone youre not allowed to love as a gay person this reminds me a lot of how my love for other men is often frowned upon almost as if it was forbidden sometimes it does feel like pagan poetry  humanbeef on july 15 2007 link1 reply log in to reply2 my interpretation the speaker and her lover are so deeply in love that verbal communication is unnecessary and their pleasure is almost painful ferrariguy90 on august 11 2010 link no replies log in to reply2 my interpretation one of bjorks most enigmatic songs this one pagan poetry is concerned with the poetry of a relationship that pulls one out of hisher isolation and loneliness that darkest pit the narrators lover understands her on an emotional level who possesses the blueprint to her heart and who understands the secret code carved on it too and she completes him just as well as he does her the five fingers on his hand matched and completed with her own its a relationship that looks like any other with nothing extraordinary on the surface surface simplicity but it has an intense power an intense almost religious power which saves her from her despair of course pleasures in me isnt really an effective substitute for heart but i wanted to avoid the sexual connotations in that first paragraph the sexual undertones are of course ever apparent in this piece and the music video contains explicit sexual imagery how does this affect the interpretation the poetry in the title then mainly refers to the orgasmic highs the narrator reaches with her lover  a transcendent sexual and spiritual connection this gives a whole new  sexual  meaning to the code and blueprint mentioned earlier as well as surface simplicity and darkest pit thats poetry nuclearheadache89 on august 19 2012 link2 replies log in to reply1 general comment this song is about an insanely strong attraction between lovers they become so attracted to each other they become attatch and able to converse without saying a word when they touch hands they can feel their vains pulsating morse code to each other that unravels all the pleasure deep inside but outside they are just simply holding hands or something like that smiley75220 on may 03 2004 link no replies log in to reply1 general comment mmmm i love this song i did not know the the term pagan poetry had been used else where ill try not to think of it that way and pretend its existence is rooted from this song i think intense emotions are simply lovely which is why i enjoy this song because thats what it seems to be about i love being overwhelmed with emotion because what would the point of existence be if one did not over indulge emotionally  deja vous silly little girl on december 19 2004 link no
