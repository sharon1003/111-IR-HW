windsurfer99ie joined 1 jul 2007messages 2thanks received 0country im planning a diy loft conversion project i plan to strengthen the ceiling joists by sistering with wooden joists the ceiling joists are 45 by 15 whilst the floor joists in the house are 7 by 2 actual measurements from my knowledge of beams joists the stiffness varies with the width and the cube of the height on this basis i calculate that theoretically i would need to sister five 45 x 15 together to achieve the same effect as a 7 by 2  given that i plan to use the space for storage only i consider that it would be sufficient to sister two 45 x 15 on to each existing ceiling joist i do not have sufficient space to install full length joists so i plan to concentrate on the central half of the span only the section most likely to sag and the section carrying most of the additional weight i plan to glue and bolt the joists together using large washers to avoid damaging the wood i would welcome any comments on this planwindsurfer99ie 1 jul 2007 1deluks joined 23 feb 2005messages 6795thanks received 328location surrey country the existing joists will support sod all they are normal size for a roof truss which is designed only to hold up a roof so you are only strengthening the middles and leaving the ends as they are this will mean that the centres will not sag correct but also means that the ends will be under even more stress than ever likely to break at the point where they bear onto the walls this is an even bigger problem than sag think about it deluks 1 jul 2007 2windsurfer99ie joined 1 jul 2007messages 2thanks received 0country thank you for your advice and i want to preface my response by saying that i agree with what you say and that i intend to follow your guidance ive seen plenty of joists sag but i have yet to see any that have sheared off at the points where they meet the walls i understand this to be because beams joists are generally able to withstand shear forces that are many times greater than the weights that are placed on them but that they are often not substantial enough to cope with the bending moment caused by the weight however since we are talking about the roof over my head im not going to put this to the test  i had a builder look and he wants to put in new 7 by 2 joists can anybody tell me whether it is standard practice to embed these in the walls  i am concerned that he will just sister against my existing joists and thereby provide a solution that is little better than mine and is still susceptible to the problem that deluks describeswindsurfer99ie 2 jul 2007 3bigall joined 12 jul 2004messages 16740thanks received 1181location surrey countrywindsurfer99ie said i had a builder look and he wants to put in new 7 by 2 joists can anybody tell me whether it is standard practice to embed these in the walls  i am concerned that he will just sister against my existing joists and thereby provide a solution that is little better than mine and is still susceptible to the problem that deluks describes you must support the 7x2 seperatly as a seperate structure otherwise your reducing the strength down to below 30 percentbigall 2 jul 2007 4deluks joined 23 feb 2005messages 6795thanks received 328location surrey countrywindsurfer99ie said i am concerned that he will just sister against my existing joists and thereby provide a solution that is little better than mine and is still susceptible to the problem that deluks describes if he does this dont pay him 7x2 sounds a lot better but only if the spans are the same as the other floors in the house longer distances require even deeper joists deluks 3 jul 2007 5micheal joined 5 feb 2010messages 1thanks received 0location london countryhi there i just require some advice on my loft basically i got my loft converted like a month ago and the builders who did my loft now seem to me that they have done a dodge job because they have used wood instead of steel to hold the stress of the roof basically they have used 2 7x2 joist and bolted them together and put it wall to wall and then they put joist hangers on theses and put rougly 1315 7x2 joist and on top of that my new floor is on it my concern is that will the 2 7x2 joist carry the wait of my whole roof the only information i knw is that the length from wall to wall is 18ft so the span is 18ft i think and now the beams 2 7x2 joist have bended and are now resting on the existing joist basically the old joist in my loft which are 4x2 i knw this is trouble becuz my celling could start craking soon so is there any suggestion plzzzz thank you i would really appreciate the advicemicheal 5 feb 2010 6bigall joined 12 jul 2004messages 16740thanks received 1181location surrey countrystructural engineer required pronto you should have complied with building regs with several visits during the build from the bco building control officerthen he signes it off on completionbigall 6 feb 2010 7
