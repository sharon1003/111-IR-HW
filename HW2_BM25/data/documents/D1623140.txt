violinists towels cellos performance violins classical music why does this violinist use a towel when playinghttpyoutubeh eb pighrs ea8 answers jamin hoffman im a music conductor arranger and performer answered mar 8 2016most violinists like to use and should use according to many violin teachers some sort of shoulder pad between the violin and their shoulder to keep the violin in the correct playing position and to protect the shoulder from the hard wood of the instrument my wife is a violinist and has worn through some of her clothes in the collarbone area there are lots of different styles of commercially made shoulder pads but many people have found that a towel or even a folded handkerchief or small sponge works best for them furthermore if you look at the area where the chin meets the neck of many professional violinists youll see what is often referred to as a violin hickey where the pressure of the chin rest has bruised the skin and broken some capillaries there i know many violinists who say this is avoidable and dont have one but i also know a lot who are a bit proud of it because they feel it shows how much they practice734 views · view upvoters

cello but rather a violin the one that hillary hahn is playing unless youve spotted one of the section cellos using a towel  many violinists that i know use some sort of cloth over their chinrest in order to improve comfort and absorb perspiration it most likely also protects the instruments varnish from some wear and helps to prevent the instrument suddenly shifting around in performance13k views · view upvoters · answer requested by quora user kevin shui hu violinist answered mar 8 2016many of the answers to this question correctly observe that the towel absorbs perspiration and prevents varnish damage and slippage very importantly though it also adds a tiny bit of distance between the violin and the body  the angles that the violin is held at make a surprisingly big difference in sound quality and color and placing too much of the body against the instrument can absorb sound and negatively impact sound production875 views · view upvoters dana fletcher violinst

periods of time can make you quite sweaty it can also assist in keeping the violin in place since a shiny varnished violin isnt the easiest to grip with your shoulder and chin i use a small rag when i play too since the chinrest isnt all that comfortable14k views · view upvoterspromoted by sheet music direct play more pay less with pass unlimited online sheet music450000 pages of premium sheet
