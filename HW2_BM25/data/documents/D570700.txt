oilseed crops for biodiesel production farm energy april 04 2014do you know that energy in the oil from oilseed crops algae restaurant waste oil and animal fat can serve as a biodiesel feedstock this article explores many feedstocks that make oil which can be used in biodiesel production harvesting soybeans in nebraska photo f john hay extension educator university of nebraskalincoln extension contents oilseed crops for biodiesel production soybeans rapeseed and canola mustard camelina castor bean safflower and sunflower warm climate feedstocks jatropha potential oilseed crops in addition to oil seed crops biodiesel can be produced from used and waste oil animal fats algae feedstock yields and prices for biodiesel oilseed crops for biodiesel production biodiesel can be produced from a wide variety of oilseed crops and animal fats in europe rapeseed oil is the major biodiesel feedstock in the united states soybeans are the dominant biodiesel feedstock soybeans soybeans produce approximately 15 gallons of oil per bushel u s farmers produced a recordbreaking yield in 2009 of 44 bushels per acre this translates to an oil yield of 66 gallons per acre soybean oil is a coproduct with soybean meal a popular highprotein feed for animals although soybeans do not produce as much oil per acre as other crops such as canola or rapeseed soy oil is the most popular oil in the united states it is commonly grown as a rotation crop with corn the united states has an established infrastructure to process soybeans into oil and meal rapeseed and canola rapeseed and canola produce about 75 to 240 gallons of oil per acre they are excellent rotation crops because they have deep root systems that scavenge well for water and nutrients these crops use planting and harvesting equipment similar to what is used for smallgrain production and the meal commands high prices in the feed market camelina seeds left and canola seeds mustard mustard a relative of canola and rapeseed has also been shown to be an excellent cover crop with high potential as a biodiesel feedstock although it produces less oil than canola it is drought tolerant grows well on marginal soils and contains compounds that act as natural fumigants against soil pathogens camelina camelina is a relative of mustard and rapeseed camelina can potentially be grown at a lower cost compared to rapeseed because it does not require as much fertilizer or pesticides researchers in the pacific northwest have been growing and studying camelina sunflower field in full flower in vermont photo vern grubinger professor university of vermont extension safflower and sunflower safflower and sunflower both produce oil that can be used for biodiesel although these oils tend to be more highly prized as premium cooking oils warm climate feedstocks tropical oilseed trees such as oil palm and coconut are used as biodiesel feedstocks in some parts of the world other warm climate feedstocks such as jatropha croton candlenut and tallow tree are also being researched as biodiesel feedstocks in most cases these plants grow wild and are well adapted to their environments however they have yet to be domesticated so little information is available about diseases and insect pests that could cause problems when plants are grown in high density jatropha a 114page report published in 2010 by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations emphasizes that the versatility of jatropha may make it useful in poor remote areas of the world this article summarizes the fao report castor bean a major constraint for using castor oil as a feedstock for biodiesel is the high price castor oil commands as an industrial and pharmaceutical feedstock castor oil boasts high lubricity characteristics so biodiesel derived from castor oil could achieve the required lubricity for biodiesel standards at concentrations much lower than that of rapeseed  brassica napus l or soybean  glycine max l  however castor oils high viscosity may limit its use to lower percentages in biodiesel blends or to warm climates potential oilseed crops pennycress image courtesy of usdanrcs plants database  britton n l and

several plants are currently being researched as biodiesel feedstocks lesquerella and pennycress both relatives of mustard show promise as oilseed crops hazelnuts could prove to be a costeffective productive new biodiesel feedstock if current disease problems can be overcome the tree is adapted to less productive soil and produces a high quantity of oil â€” about 90 gallons per acre in addition to oil seed crops biodiesel can be produced from used and waste oil waste oil and grease can be collected from restaurants to produce biodiesel while the processing costs of this urban source are higher per gallon than the processing costs of virgin vegetable oil the cost of the feedstock is generally low and sometimes free animal fats animal fats are lowcost biodiesel feedstocks however there are some drawbacks and challenges to animal fat feedstocks algae microalgae have long been recognized as potentially good sources for biofuel production because of their relatively high oil content and rapid biomass production there are production challenges which need to be overcome for successful commercialization feedstock yields and prices for biodiesel how do common biodiesel feedstocks
