amusing answers to the sultana raisin debate i am as confused as ever but it certainly brightened up 20 mins of my sad sedentary life thanks folks jenni winkleigh great britain ive found that its fairly rare to hear anyone call them raisins here brisbane people mostly use sultana as a blanket term it seems to be the reverse in the usa where many people call them all raisins but in my experience when i buy sultanas they are usually paler from white grapes and raisins are always dark red grapes however earlier today i baught a bag of each and both were dark but the raisins were larger and slightly darker both were seedless it seems like the names vary a lot in their usage sometimes used to describe the type of grape other times the size even the producers or at least the people responsible for packaging seem to be pretty inconsistant because of all this its hard to know exactly what youre buying when the lable is often wrong but it seems that the correct distinction is as others have already stated the variety of grape i always thought currants were the dried berries of currant treesbushes and that there were a whole bunch of species from different genera of fruiting plants all commonly called currants but people here are also saying the word is used for certain types of dried grape on top of being the common name for a large range of different berries

portland oregon usai need to know desperately why ive been told raisins soaked in gin are good for arthritis and i only have sultanas will let you know the result if i can crawl across the floor to my i pad by the way this is real honest joyce newcastle england it sounds to me like you are all talking about golden raisins which is what we sensibly call them here in america i have never even seen the word sultana until today i am reading a cookbook which also features rashers and capsicum why cant you just say bacon and peppers lol penny sherwood ohio usawell love all of the answers but i am going to share my bit of info now i grew up in the san joaquin valley in ca every year we would be involved in drying thomsan seedless grapes to make raisens for sun maid we would cut the grapes lay them on brown paper and after a couple of weeks go and turn them this would go on until they were a dark colour i hadnt heard of sultanas until i moved over here to england to live with my british hubby i am inclined to believe it is the drying technique which gives the difference between sultanas and raisens it makes the most sense i know dried apricots are different over here as well due to the drying techniques in california we halve the apricots and dry them after dipping them in a solution of lemonwater and then smoking some sulphur dioxide around them to keep them from turning black and keep the bugs off it is so interesting to discover the different techniques and tastes that come from these as you travel to different areas hope this is useful to some of you looking into the difference i am all for saving the raisins as i dont like the plumpness of the sultanas haha mj exeter usavery interesting read having grown up in a region of australia that grows huge amounts of grapes i feel the need to voice my opinion the sultana is actually a variety of grape a raisin is the result of drying any grape the confusion comes as the sultana is the best variety for the drying procedure as it is small sweet and seedless so most raisins are referred to as sultanas and for the international confusion the sultana grape variety is also known as thompson seedless in america lady de coverly in england and the ovalfruited kishmish in turkey getting on to the currents currents are a different fruit to grapes its a bit like wine fermented grape juice is referred to as a wine
