lifespan of birds how long does a bird liveby dr mike hounsome a dunnock in a garden in britain contrary to popular belief most adult small garden birds in britain live only for around 1¼ to 1½ years how long does a bird live is one of the questions ornithologists are always being asked and there is not a simple answer there is a great difference between the various types of bird and there is a great difference between the average length of life and the greatest length of life many years ago david lack was addressing an audience of learned ornithologists on the subject of his studies on robins he said that the average life expectancy of a robin was a little over one year he was laughed off the stage everybody knew that they have had a robin in their garden for years and they were sure that it was the same one but he was right and it takes only a moment’s thought for anyone to work it out no need for complicated modern maths  anybody can do it there are about as many robins this year as there were last year populations usually fluctuate about an average so if there was a pair in your garden last year then there is a pair this year but in the mean time that original pair has had say two broods of five young  that is ten new robins but by the start of the next breeding season there are only two so2102so how many have died obviously ten so out of twelve 210 birds ten have died  that’s more than 83 ringing studies have shown that about 60 of the adult robins die each year so of the original two adults only 08 of a bird will be alive this year yes 08 of a bird is nonsense but we are talking about averages here so for us to have two birds again this year 12 2 minus 08 birds must have entered the population in other words those ten young have resulted in only 12 adults  that’s an 88 mortality much of that ‘infant mortality’ happens in the nest or shortly after fledging ringing studies have shown that the first year mortality of young once they have fledged is about 72 robins are a familiar bird in many british gardens so are we any nearer answering the question how long do birds live well i’m afraid that we have to do a little bit of maths now the opposite of mortality is survival both can be written as a percentage or as a fraction of one for example a mortality of 83 can also be written as 083 and usually in these kind of studies we use this fractionofone method so if the mortality is 083 the survival is 017 17 because if 83 died then 17 10083 must have lived we can now answer the question for robins at least there are two expressions that are used for calculating life expectancy the first one is more straightforward so if the mortality is 06 as it is for adult robins then the life expectancy is 12 years the other expression uses natural logarithms so you have to use a calculator the natural log button is labelled ‘ ln ’ in the case of our robins if the mortality is 06 then the survival is 04 ie 106 and the life expectancy is 11 years which one is correct ornithologists usually use the second one because it fits into several other equations that are used in studying bird populations but as you can see the simple equation gives almost the same answer most of our common small birds have similar survival rates and life expectancies adult survival rates are usually between 04 and 06 with firstyear survival rates often being between 01 and 02  so roughly a half of all the adult birds and nearly all the baby birds you see will be dead in a years time it’s a sad thought but this has to happen if the population is to remain roughly constant generally large birds and seabirds live longer than small birds albatrosses live so long that it is hard to calculate their survival rates  they can live longer than the metal rings that identify them and probably longer than most humans even little seabirds like storm petrels live a remarkably long time  about seven years on average for adults  and they take about four or five years to reach adulthood but there is a very big difference between the average life expectancy and the maximum one and the maximum known age for a storm petrel is over 31 years and the oldest known robin was 8½ years old even very small birds can live a remarkably long time for instance the oldest marsh tit was more than 10 years old and there has been a 21 year old blue tit these are species for whom the average life expectancy is only just more than one year so you can see how very much better than average these particular individuals are their contribution to the subsequent generations is ten or twenty times as much as the average individual’s so it’s easy to see how natural selection could work although most adult blue tits live for only a little over a year at least one has been known to live for 21 yearsso the answer to our question is that most adult small birds in temperate regions such as ours live for between 1¼ and 1½ years but that only about 1020 of young reach adulthood big birds seabirds and tropical birds can live much longer but some individuals of any species can live as much as ten times as long as the average  that’s like an exceptional human living for about 800 yearsall of this information refers to wild birds birds in captivity can live to much greater ages  even exceeding the longest lived wild birds text copyright 2003 dr m v hounsome
