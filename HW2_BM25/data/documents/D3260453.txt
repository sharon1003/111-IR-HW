of pain you should stop”corina martinez a physical therapist at duke sports medicine center and member of the american medical society for sports medicine says that there is no onesizefitsall exercise

you want to pursue” she advises martinez says that anyone experiencing even mild sciatic nerve pain for more than a month should see a doctor or physical therapist they may find relief with an inhome
