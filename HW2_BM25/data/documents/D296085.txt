aqua and white kitchen reveal january 23 2012share pin tweet i love my new aqua and white kitchen i had white cabinets at my last house and loved them for some reason i thought since this house was a little more rustic that a white kitchen wouldn’t work but i am so happy with the way this remodel turned out note — lots of pictures to come the keep calm sign is from barn owl primitiveshere’s what the kitchen looked like when we bought the house 10 years ago — corian counters and lots of brass a few years later we added some granite counters and a rustic backsplash but it wasn’t quite what i wanted i needed something a little lighter and brighter so this summer we started working on making a pretty big change we painted the walls from brown to a light grey —sharkey grey from martha stewart paint via home depot and painted over the backsplash tile we used a special primer for tile first and it looks so great we ended up painting the entire first floor except for the living room that color it’s such a pretty shade of grey and so neutral and it makes the house seem so much lighter and brighter than the brown color did we also painted the little nook in our family room white and added some beadboard to the back it’s a great place to display family picturesthere are also a few other projects that i did along the way that added to this project like my aqua door stenciled pillows stenciled faux roman shades family organization station beadboard open shelves wrapping paperlined cabinet diy pendant lights pennant pantry and i love the color we decided to paint the island it’s martha stewart’s rainwater here are a few more pictures just to let you know — we did pay someone to paint the cabinets after painting my diy entertainment unit i knew i was way too anal to paint all of these cabinets myself so we hired a wonderful cabinet painter he used a very hightech spray gun with dyed polyurethane which is very durable and leaves no brush marks i couldn’t be happier and now i have a bright  happy kitchenfamily room area it’s a great space to spend time as a family xoxo have a wonderful day ps — coming up tomorrow a valentine’s day tutorial related posts make diy pendant lights kitchen remodel projectnavy and yellow spring kitchen nook updatekitchen remodel project — diy kitchen cabinet update with wrapping paperhow to install a rustic planked ceilingfree kitchen printables planning a kitchen remodel for a small space … and 1905 cottage kitchen sneak peekload more posts share pin tweet
