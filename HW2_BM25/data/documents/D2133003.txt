the we tv reality show match made in heaven he operates another company konkrete investments l l c which served as the general contractor for construction of the building records show bullard who owns several other properties that city inspectors say were built with proper inspections said the montgomery avenue building is safe he disputed city records listing the property as not having been inspected i dont know what to tell you it was inspected bullard said he referred further questions to his lawyer laurence mester who declined to comment without construction inspections city inspectors say its impossible to know whether the building is safe while the building has tenants and a rental license it does not have the required certificate of occupancy which attests that a property is in compliance with building codes and is safe for habitation city records show last week after the inquirer asked about the building officials with the department of licenses and inspections gave bullard 35 days to obtain such a certificate from the agency if he does not comply li officials said they will shut the building down and order the tenants to leave li commissioner carlton williams declined to be interviewed in response to written questions he said his department would conduct a hearing to determine whether to suspend bullards contractor license in the aftermath of the center city building collapse in june 2013 williams pledged greater scrutiny of contractors in bullards case williams said li issued several violations against the contractor for not summoning the agency to perform the required safety inspections in january the agency took him to court citing the failed inspections and unlawful occupancy the case is pending the narrow modernlooking montgomery avenue building has a graffitied side wall facing a vacant lot a student who lived there verified that there are eight tenants but declined further comment six current and former li inspectors who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal said they were appalled that the agency had allowed the construction to proceed without required inspections  and then allowed bullard to take in tenants theyre only threatening to vacate the building now because the newspaper asked about it one of the inspectors said the li employees also faulted bullard for not summoning inspectors to review the work as it progressed and for not obtaining a certificate of occupancy williams wrote that li became aware of the project in late 2013 when an accident occurred on the job a worker was injured when a scaffold he was standing on came in contact with electrical wires according to records of the occupational safety and health administration city records show that on dec 3 2013 an inspector wrote in the li database that there were no inspections performed of any sort at this site he added the contractor failed to notify me for any inspections li records show that the inspector issued a stopwork order but it was not carried out the next month with the building nearly completed the inspector wrote 4 story property built with no legal permit issued fire suppression system roughed in with no legal permit no inspections performed and all work done illegally and without permission from li north district to start work all work concealed from this office in a visit to the site a few months later another inspector ryan wheeler wrote no inspections were performed by any inspector   i ryan wheeler have stated in my notes that i will not assume any responsibility for work performed williams in his statement to the inquirer said the city has had problems with contractors building without the required inspections he said the agency is responding with stricter enforcement and a policy of revoking the licenses of such contractors li also has been hiring additional inspectors to step up enforcement he said as for bullards building williams wrote li inspectors found no structural conditions that pose a threat to occupants in interviews li inspectors said they were puzzled by that assertion how can we know the structural integrity of the building when no one inspected while it was being built one asked now the walls are up and we cant see in them to compensate for the lack of construction inspections bullard will be permitted to hire an engineer to study the building and assure the city that it is safe williams said to do that experts say an engineer would have to inspect the buildings framing foundation insulation and other aspects of construction a task that requires taking apart walls and peering in because construction was completed without li review city inspectors say they were unable to examine key indicators of the buildings safety such as checking the lumber to be sure floors and walls were not in danger of collapse ensuring that the construction complied with firesuppression regulations seeing that appliances are properly vented to prevent carbonmonoxide poisoning and fire hazards and dozens of other issues there are 100 ways to get hurt in an uninspected building one inspector said and that includes the firefighters who might be called there one day alubranophillynewscom2158544969alfred lubrano published april 23 2015 — 644 pm edt  updated april 24 2015 — 108 am edtthe philadelphia inquirer
