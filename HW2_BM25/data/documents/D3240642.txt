water properties and mineral salts21 reasons why life depends on water body water1 what is the approximate percentage in mass of water in the human body do you think this percentage is larger in adults or in the elderly approximately 65 of human mass is made up of water the brain for example is around 90 water muscles 85 and bones are between 25 and 40 water the young have a greater proportion of water than the elderly biological functions of water more bitesized qas below2 what are the main biological functions of water water is the fundamental solvent for the chemical reactions of living organisms it is the main means of substance transportation within and between cells and tissues and it is responsible for the maintenance of the correct temperature for the functioning of an organism water is also the reagent or the product of many biochemical reactions such as photosynthesis cellular respiration the forming of peptide bonds for protein synthesis etc3 water plays a key role in organic reactions what are examples of two types of organic reactions in which water is either an input or an output photosynthesis is a biochemical process in which water is incorporated into organic molecules in this reaction the hydrogen atoms from water are incorporated into the produced glucose and the oxygen atoms from water make up the molecular oxygen liberated carbon dioxide  water

answers the polarity of water4 is water a polar or a nonpolar molecule what does that mean for water’s function as a solvent water is made of two atoms of hydrogen attached to one central atom of oxygen by covalent bond making an angular spatial structure the hydrogen atoms “lend” electrons to the oxygen and consequently the oxygen atom becomes more negative while the hydrogen ones become more positive the spatial geometry of the water molecule makes it a polar molecule with negative and positive poles water is an excellent solvent for polar substances because the electrical activity attraction and repulsion of its poles helps in the separation and the mixing of these substances giving them more movement and thus increasing the number of molecular collisions and the speed of chemical reactions on the other hand water is not a good solvent for nonpolar substances water properties and mineral salts  image diversity water polarity5 which kind of polarity do watersoluble and fatsoluble substances demonstrate watersoluble substances are polar molecules meaning that they have electrically charged areas these molecules are called “watersoluble” because they are soluble in water which is also a polar molecule fatsoluble substances are nonpolar molecules meaning that they are electrically neutral they are called “fatsoluble” because they dissolve other nonpolar substances the dependency of enzymes on water6 what is the importance of water for enzyme activity enzymes are biological catalysts that depend on water to reach their substrates and to bind to them there is no enzyme activity without water in addition enzymes depend on adequate p h intervals to do their job and this p h is a result of the release of hydrogen cations h⁺ and hydroxyl anions oh⁻ by the acids and bases in water solutions the importance of water for life7 does water have a small or large heat capacity what is the biological significance of this characteristic thermology tell us that the quantity of exchanged heat q is equal to the mass m multiplied by the specific heat of a substance c multiplied by the variation in temperature t q  mcδt furthermore it says that heat capacity is qt and therefore mc heat capacity however relates to a specific object since it considers mass whereas specific heat relates to the substance in general therefore it is more correct to refer to specific heat in this case water has a specific heat of 1 calg°c which means that there is a 1 °c per gram change in its temperature per every addition or subtraction of 1 cal of energy this is a very high value for example the specific heat of ethanol is 058 calg°c and mercury a metal has a specific heat of 0033 calg°c which makes water an excellent thermal protector against temperature variations even if sudden external temperature changes occur the internal biological conditions are kept stable in organisms containing enough water high specific heat is one of the most properties of water8 what are the main properties of water that make it so special for life the properties of water that make it biologically important are its molecular polarity thermal stability elevated specific heat fusion and boiling points that allow it to remain liquid in most environments acidbase neutrality small molecular size and low chemical reactivity this is compared to other substances such as ethanol or hydrogen sulfide the main biological ions9 what are ions what are the two types of molecules into which ions are classified ions are atoms or substances that are electrically charged due to losing or gaining electrons the two types of ions are cations and anions cations are ions with a positive total electric charge and anions are ions with a negative total electric charge10 what are the main positive ions found in living organisms the main cations found in living organisms are the sodium cation na⁺ the potassium cation k⁺ the calcium cation ca⁺⁺ iron cations fe⁺⁺ fe⁺⁺⁺ the magnesium cation mg⁺⁺ the zinc cation zn⁺⁺ and the manganese cation mn⁺⁺11 what are the main negative ions found in living organisms the main anions found in living organisms are the chloride anion cl⁻ the phosphate anion po₄⁻⁻ the bicarbonate anion hco₃⁻ the nitrate anion no₃⁻ and the sulfate anion so₄⁻ biological functions of mineral salts12 what is the role of mineral salts in osmotic regulation osmotic pressure depends on the number of particles dissolved in a solution and not on the nature of such particles mineral salts glucose proteins and urea are the main regulating particles for the osmolarity of an organism these molecules along with other particles inside and outside the cell generate a larger or smaller osmotic gradient between the intracellular and extracellular space13 what is the role of mineral salts in the creation of electric tension voltage at the cellular level the electric activity of a cell in neurons for example depends on the different concentrations of positive and negative ions between the inner and the outer surfaces of the cell membrane mineral salts are responsible for that voltage the cell membrane of a nonexcited cell normally has a negative inside and a positive outside this electrical situation is maintained by ion transport across the membrane14 why is p h regulation important for living beings what is the role of mineral salts in this regulation the potential of hydrogen p h is a measure of the amount of hydrogen ions h⁻ in a solution the regulation of p h depending on the necessities of each organ or tissue is extremely important for an organism since enzymes only act within certain p h ranges and many proteins are only active within certain p h ranges therefore biochemical reactions depend on the presence of correct p h levels neutral p h is one of the properties of water15 what is the role of mineral salts in enzyme activity many mineral salts are cofactors of enzymes which means that they are substances without which enzymes do not work calcium iron magnesium phosphate iodine and chlorine16 what are the main biological processes in which calcium is involved calcium is present in almost all cells and has several functions calcium plays an important role in muscular contraction in the blood coagulation process in the structure of bone tissue in teeth in the motility of the sperm cell flagellum and in the transmission of nerve impulses17 what is hemoglobin what inorganic element is fundamental in the composition of hemoglobin hemoglobin is the protein present in blood responsible for the transport of oxygen from the lungs to tissues and cells the hemoglobin molecule is composed of four protein chains each with a heme group containing an iron atom the iron is responsible for the binding of oxygen in the lungs and also for the red color of hemoglobin and therefore blood18 what is the importance of magnesium for plants what are the other main biological functions of magnesium magnesium is fundamentally important for plants because it is part of the chlorophyll molecule and chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis magnesium also acts as the cofactor of several enzymes plays and important role in muscle relaxation and in the transmission of nerve impulses19 what is phosphorylation what are some biological processes in which phosphorylation plays a critical role phosphorylation is the name given to processes of the addition of phosphates to some molecules thus making these molecules more energized phosphorylation has an important role for example in photosynthesis the photophosphorylation of the light phase and in aerobic respiration oxidative phosphorylation of the respiratory chain in general the phosphate used in phosphorylation comes from atp molecules20 why is iodine important for human beings iodine is a chemical element necessary for the proper functioning of the thyroid because it is contained by the hormones produced by this gland iodine deficiency creates a type of hypothyroidism known as endemic goiter21 what are the main biological functions in which chloride ions are involved like sodium cations chloride anions actively participate in the regulation of the osmolarity of tissue and cells by crossing the cellular membrane and stopping water from entering into a cell or stopping the excessive loss of water from a cell chloride anions play an important role in the acidbase balance of an organism since they are involved along with bicarbonate anions in the p h buffer system of the body another function of chloride ions is in digestive physiology inside the gastric lumen hydrochloric acid secreted by stomach cells ionizes into hydrogen and chloride ions lowering the p h of gastric juiced and allowing enzymatic
