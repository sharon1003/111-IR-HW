bars are fairly easy to make the part that takes the longest chopping the nuts i’d try using a food processor just don’t overdo it you can use whatever nuts you’d like after they are baked they are chewy thick and really good a big tip is to pack them tightly in the pan press them down before you bake them after you bake them and before you cut them this helps make them stay together especially if you’re carrying them around the chocolate drizzle on top is optional it definitely makes them sweeter but makes them look prettier too8 coconut nut butter  honey “granola” bars – foraged dish shredded coconut – nut butter – coconut oil – honey – egg – cassava flour – chocolate chips since these are paleo you won’t find any oats here coconut is the substitute for oats in these paleo granola bars the goal in developing these was to make a granola bar that could be taken hiking camping or climbing or anywhere else that’s warm for that matter they needed to be made with whole ingredients that wouldn’t melt all of those goals were achieved except for the chocolate might melt it can easily be left out with the chocolate on them they could easily pass for dessert9 cashew protein bars – jay’s baking me crazy raw cashews – coconut flour – almond flour – fresh rosemary – garlic powder – onion powder – real salt – eggs – coconut oil jessica’s husband has blood sugar issues and needs to eat on a regular basis just like me and my mother she found that nuts are the easiest thing to carry around since the only nut her husband can eat is cashews without his stomach hurting she wanted to make something with cashews the problem was that cashews are expensive so she wanted something she could make with cashew pieces which are quite a bit cheaper so she decided to make some paleo granola bars without all the sugar in storebought ones they worked out great each bar has about 10 grams of protein and they cost a lot less than those you buy pin 45kshare 165tweet 32shares 45k8 comments
