to determine the viability of cells in flow cytometry assays view a selection guide for all nonfixable viability dyes for flow cytometry you get these advantages with sytox™ dead cell stains • bright signal —easily distinguishes dead cells from live cells • rapid staining —single step no wash assay to assess viability of unfixed cells • validation —in jurkat re h cho kg1a 3t3 he la hek primary cells and lysed whole blood • optimization —dye concentration has been optimized for use in flow cytometry • versatility —tested in a variety of experimental applications try sytox ™ dead cell stains in a flexible trial size the sytox™ dead cell stain sampler kit contains a small trial size of 5 different stains 50 tests per stain tests to help identify the best stain to work in multicolor experiments the sytox™ dead cell stain sampler kit includes the following stains • sytox™ blue dead cell stain s34857 for the 405 nm violet laser • sytox™ green dead cell stain s34860 for the 488 nm blue laser with green emission • sytox™ aadvanced™ dead cell stain s10274 s10309 for the 488 nm blue laser with red emission • sytox™ red dead cell stain s34854 for the 6335 nm red laser • sytox™ orange dead cell stain s34861 for the 532 nm green laser bright stains in an easy to use nowash assay sytox™ dead cell stains are cell impermeant nucleic acid stains by flow cytometry dead cells can be easily distinguished from live cells by the increased fluorescent signal due to ds dna binding of sytox™ dyes fig 1 because they are nonfluorescent in aqueous media sytox™ dead cell stains can be applied to cells and visualized with minimal background staining and without an additional wash step validated in flow cytometry the sytox™ dead cell stains in the sampler kit have been optimized for use in cell concentrations ranging from 1x10 4 to 1x10 6 cells per ml sytox™ cell stains have been validated in several cell types including • jurkat • re h • cho • kg1a • 3t3 • he la • hek primary cells • lysed whole blood sytox™ dead cell stains have been tested in several applications including• apoptosis fig 2 • cell cycle • cell proliferation • immunophenotyping assays the sytox™ family of cell viability stains sytox™ dead cell stains come in an assortment of excitationemission characteristics and have been incorporated into a number of assays for apoptosis cell viability and metabolism
