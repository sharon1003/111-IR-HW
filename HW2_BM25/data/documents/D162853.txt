airgas leak testing techniques water immersion  soap solution pressurize part under water and look for air bubbles or spray outside of part with soapwater solution and look for bubbles caused by air leakage out of the part advantages can be fast for larger leaks on small parts when testing multiple at one time can be fast for testing extremely large parts with larger leaks few areas for possible leak best method for detecting exact leak location detection low equipment cost disadvantages risky an extremely operator dependent technique with a high possibility of passing actual failures slow detecting small bubbles on typical parts can take much longer than other methods added cost parts must typically be dry and free of fluid before shipping less sensitive than other techniques on most parts no leak rate or test result information high frequency sound pressurize part and use hand held listening device around potential leak areas and watch for high pitched noise caused by leakage of air out of the part advantages good for detecting leak location low equipment cost disadvantages background noise can reduce sensitivity of the device can be very slow for finding small leaks no leak rate or test result information cannot test internal cavities trace gas detection mass spectrometerpressurize part with trace gas such as helium or argon inside a highvacuum chamber and detect the quantity of trace gas caused by leakage out of the part using an electronic mass spectrometer sensor can be hand held sniffer as well advantages outstanding sensitivity best solution for leak rates below 1 ccmin disadvantages very expensive equipment investment typically starts at or above 100k fixturing usually elaborate expensive to operate trace gas consumed is often high slow typically the part is placed into a chamber and closed off a hard vacuum must be pulled on that volume before the actual test can take place mass flow pressurize part and measure air flow caused by leakage out of the part using electronic mass flow sensors advantages very fast for large leak rates over 100 ccmin works best for checking size of fluidair path or detecting restrictions in part channels nonoperator dependant and test data can be obtained disadvantages sensitivity too low for leak rates below 100 ccmin accuracy of readings very dependant upon air temperature and actual system pressure more costly than pressure decay testing as it requires both a mass flow and a typical pressure decay transducer for each test channel pressurevacuum decay pressurize or apply vacuum to the part and measure pressurevacuum change within the part caused by leakage using electronic pressuredecay sensors advantages fastest most consistent test technique for 90 of welded plastic components nonoperator dependant and test data can be obtained accurate on leak rates as low as 1 ccmin no cleaningdrying operations required after testing system accuracy immune to most environmental conditions can be configured for 100 testing downstream of most bonding operations disadvantages not usable for leak location more costly than immersion testing slow with large part volumes and small leak rates
