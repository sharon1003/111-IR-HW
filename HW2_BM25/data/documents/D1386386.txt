2007 1149 ambest idea is to use zar using us is not common maybe other than hotels and tourist ventures and you will surely get a bad rate changing money in south africa is a bit painstaking since you will need to bring your passport to the bank otherwise they will not change your us on the plus side credit cards are very often accepted except gas stations and there are many atms in south africa why dont you just check with your bank whether you should tell them that you are going to south africa and if it is possible to withdraw cash at atms also ask how much they charge you for every withdrawel i used my visa a number of times in sa no problem to my mind in times of insured credit cards travellers checks are really outdated and they are a pain to change in south africa especially if they are not quoted in zar use your credit card to pay most of the time and withdraw from atms if possible to be on the safe side change a small amount of us in zar at home 10  20 to start with and bring some us with you just in case something is not working with your credit card take it easy enjoy your holidaymentioned in this post south africa africa report inappropriate contentbwanadave tempe

purchases at shops your hotel bill etc atm for getting south african rand yes they expect you to do business with them in their money changing money is actually simple if you use a forex in a shopping mall the fees time it takes for the transaction are all quite fair the major banks have branches in the malls too and their rate will be about the same as at the forex though youll have to wait in line just as you do at banks back home you can  if you have the time when you arrive  change dollars at the bank at the cape town airport most likely you wont have time for this however if you are being picked up to be transferred to a hotel if you get safrica rand here in the us you will get a poor exchange rate and if you change dollars at a hotel in safrica you will get a very poor rate yes inform your credit card companies and your bank that you will be in south africa and they should honor the transactions that come in from there this is absolutely important mentioned in this post cape

town aug 22 2007 334 pmyou have received some excellent advice i can only add that it is a good idea as suggested to inform your credit card companies your dates of travel  we should all do this it means they wont suspect fraud and stop your transaction whilst they try to rwach you and find they cant because youare awayalso please check your pin number  ours are 4 digits except am ex which is 5

advice above the last time i checked  travellers cheques werent charged when converting that said  load your credit cards etc they are accepted everywhere your debit card might work in rsa but i would double check this with your bank first i know my rsa bank card works in the uk for example also do inform your bank that you will be in rsa as we know from experience that they do stop cards if they

places during daytime travellers cheques just seem outdated to me i think its mostly people from the us and the more traditional brits who use them now they take ages to change in most parts of the world and they are not welcomed much theres been a huge leap forward in technology for financial transactions in the last 20 years and travellers cheques havent caught up yet you might keep 100 for emergencies i suppose  slightly safer than carrying cash report inappropriate contentmelyndamerseyside level contributor881 posts15 reviews save reply6 re currency question what to use in cape town

nor did we carry any travelers checks we got our south african cash on arrival at banking machines which we found everywhere we did not go into banks to change money call your credit card company to let them know youre traveling in south africa theres so much identity theft these days that when your credit card company is suddenly hit with a raft of charges from south africa it may refuse them causing embarrassment to you this has actually happened to me and it can make for awkward moments especially if your supply of cash is also depleted as with most any foreign country they have their own currency the rand prices are denominated in rand and cashiers expect to receive rand merchants will not particularly welcome dollars because someone has to calculate the exchange down at the bank the merchant is going to get dinged for fees and service charges when he deposits the dollars the rand is a freelyconvertible hard currency people have no need to try to get dollars like they do in communist countries with worthless soft money i did not find any use for dollars in south africa happy travels and let me know if i can help furtherdavidcapetien10gmailcom mentioned in this post south
