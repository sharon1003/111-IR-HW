clean vehicles electric vehicles cleaner cars from cradle to grave 2015over their lifetime battery electric vehicles produce far less global warming pollution than their gasoline counterparts—and they’re getting cleaner download full report executive summary faqsince we first published our state of charge report in 2012 the environmental benefits of electric vehicles evs have continued to grow twothirds of all americans now live in areas where driving an ev produces fewer climate emissions than almost all comparable gasoline and gasoline hybrid cars—a fact attributable to more efficient evs and an increasingly clean electricity grid but what are the global warming emissions of electric cars on a life cycle basis—from the manufacturing of the vehicle’s body and battery to its ultimate disposal and reuse to answer this the union of concerned scientists undertook a comprehensive twoyear review of the climate emissions from vehicle production operation and disposal we found that battery electric cars generate half the emissions of the average comparable gasoline car even when pollution from battery manufacturing is accounted for electric cars  global warming emissions your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  219a life cycle analysis of evs all vehicles experience three distinct life stages manufacturing operation and endoflife each stage is linked with carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions—but those emissions differ between gaspowered cars and electric cars use our ev emissions tool to see emissions in your area—or explore specific ev models both types of vehicle begin in much the same way raw materials are extracted refined transported and manufactured into various components that are assembled into the car itself because electric cars store power in large lithiumion batteries which are particularly material and energyintensive to produce their global warming emissions at this early stage usually exceed those of conventional vehicles manufacturing a midsized ev with an 84mile range results in about 15 percent more emissions than manufacturing an equivalent gasoline vehicle for larger longerrange evs that travel more than 250 miles per charge the manufacturing emissions can be as much as 68 percent higher these differences change as soon as the cars are driven evs are powered by electricity which is generally a cleaner energy source than gasoline battery electric cars make up for their higher manufacturing emissions within eighteen months of driving—shorter range models can offset the extra emissions within 6 months—and continue to outperform gasoline cars until the end of their lives how many miles per gallon would a gas car have to achieve to produce global warming emissions equivalent to an ev the answer depends on where you live numbers based on the epas e grid 2015 database click to enlarge the specific emissions of any given ev model will depend on the vehicle’s efficiency and the electricity that powers it check out our interactive tool to explore ev emissions in your area for all americans charging the average new ev produces far fewer global warming pollutants than driving the average new gasoline car in some of the country’s cleanest regions including parts of california new york and the pacific northwest driving an electric car is equivalent to getting 85 miles per gallon by the end of their lives gaspowered cars spew out almost twice as much global warming pollution than the equivalent electric car disposing of both types of vehicles excluding reusing or recycling their batteries produces less than a ton each what’s next questions check out our faq or executive summary electric vehicles already result in far less climate pollution than their gaspowered counterparts and they’re getting cleaner optimizing ev production and the disposal or reuse of batteries could further increase their environmental benefits and as electricity becomes cleaner  which it is  the difference between electric cars and gasoline cars will only grow—cementing the role of electric vehicles in halving u s oil use and cutting global warming emissions read more by downloading the full report use our interactive tool to explore ev emissions in your area or read most recent updates in our blog we need your support to make change happen we can protect consumers the climate and our environment from the growing costs and risks of our oil use —but not without you your generous support helps develop sciencebased solutions for a healthy safe and sustainable future25 50 100 250 1000 other donate
