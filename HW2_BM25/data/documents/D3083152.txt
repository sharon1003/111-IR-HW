advertisement the amount of sleep you get while you’re pregnant not only affects you and your baby but could impact your labor and delivery as well lack of sleep during pregnancy has been tied to a number of complications including preeclampsia a serious condition that affects your blood pressure and kidneys and could result in preterm birth now is the time to take sleep seriously when you become pregnant one of the first symptoms you may notice is being overwhelmingly tired even exhausted sleep will be irresistible to you you can most likely blame your changing hormones for this especially the extra progesterone that comes with being pregnant in the beginning pregnancy also lowers your blood pressure and blood sugar which can make you feel tired shortly after the first trimester your energy should return then sometime during the third trimester you’ll begin to feel tired again some of this feeling can be blamed on the sheer physical exhaustion that comes from growing a baby and the stress that it puts on your body mostly though your weariness during this time is in direct relation to your inability to get a good night’s sleep even if you’ve never had trouble sleeping before you may find it much more difficult while you’re pregnant path to improved health sleep should never be seen as a luxury it’s a necessity — especially when you’re pregnant in fact women who are pregnant need a few more hours of sleep each night or should supplement nighttime sleep with naps during the day according to the national institutes of health for many pregnant women though getting 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night becomes more and more difficult the farther along they are in their pregnancy there are many physical and emotional obstacles to sleep in this stage anxiety about being a mom or about adding to your family can keep you awake fear of the unknown or about the delivery can cause insomnia plus there is the getting up every few hours to go to the bathroom it also can be difficult to find a comfortable position in bed especially if you are a former stomach sleeper if any of the following is keeping you awake at night try these strategies for getting a good night’s sleep heartburn at some point in their pregnancy most pregnant women suffer from heartburn which is a form of indigestion that feels like burning in your chest and throat heartburn can wake you up in the middle of the night and ruin a good sleep minimize the chance for this by avoiding spicy foods also cut down on rich foods for dinner restless leg syndrome few things are more distracting than restless legs syndrome rls especially when you are trying to go to sleep while you can’t take traditional rls medicines when you are pregnant you can try to reduce the feelings of rls with a good prenatal vitamin that includes folate and iron morning sickness — at bedtime despite the name morning sickness can occur any time and is often worse later in the day try eating a few crackers at bedtime and keep a stash in your nightstand in case a wave of nausea hits as you are trying to go to sleep insomnia there are many ways insomnia can creep in and compromise your sleep time often it’s just about being able to shut down your brain most medicines for insomnia should not be taken while you are pregnant instead try journaling some of the things you are anxious about write down what is stressing you and try to let it go as you go to sleep also stop drinking caffeine by early afternoon try not to take long naps during the day doing any — or all — of these things can help ease you back into sleep at a reasonable bedtime leg cramps not many things can wake you as quickly and painfully as a leg cramp sometimes called a charley horse these cramps are usually a contraction of your calf muscle less frequently they can occur in your thigh or your foot these can plague you in pregnancy because of a lack of minerals especially calcium and magnesium they also are more common if you are dehydrated to guard against leg cramps make sure that you continue to take your prenatal vitamin and drink plenty of water and other fluids during the day finding a comfortable position as your body grows sleep becomes a little harder to come by especially in the third trimester it’s difficult to get comfortable it’s harder to move around and shift positions in bed if you’ve been a stomach or back sleeper it can be hard to adjust to sleeping on your side the best position to sleep in when you’re pregnant is on your left side this improves blood flow and therefore nutrient flow to your baby try lying on your left side knees bent with a pillow between your knees it also helps to tuck a pillow under your stomach as well for extra support frequent bathroom breaks with baby pushing down on your bladder you likely can’t make it all night without waking at least once to go to the bathroom you can help minimize nighttime bathroom trips by cutting down on how much you drink in the evenings just be sure to get adequate hydration during the day bright lights can make it harder for you to fall back asleep so use nightlights so that you will not need to turn on the lights when you get up to go to the bathroom in addition to minimizing the common obstacles to getting a good night’s sleep there are also ways to encourage good sleep habits also called good sleep hygiene be consistent with your sleep schedule go to bed and wake up at the same time every day prioritize sleep it’s one of the healthiest things you can do for your body exercise but do not exercise at bedtime keep daytime naps short stick to a bedtime routine that relaxes you and don’t vary from it make your bedroom inviting do not keep a tv computer or other distracting tech gadgets in your bedroom do not eat at bedtime finish eating two to three hours before going to bed things to consider sleep is essential to health lack of sleep is associated with many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes obesity depression and even heart disease if you’re pregnant not getting an adequate amount of sleep can put you at risk for some serious conditions lack of sleep

trimester are nearly 10 times more likely to develop preeclampsia late in pregnancy preeclampsia is a condition associated with pregnancyrelated high blood pressure swelling of hands and feet and protein in urine it can lead to serious and sometimes even fatal complications during pregnancy for mother and for child too much sleep during the first trimester more than 10 hours a night can also
