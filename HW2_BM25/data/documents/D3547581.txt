a christmas carol the best and worst adaptations we delve back into more than a century of a christmas carol movies to find the best and worst adaptations of dickens festive tale odd list robert keeling dec 20 2012j127 comments charles dickens’ a christmas carol the classic story of a time travelling pensioner who sees dead people is a festive fairytale which has itself become part of christmas folklore in terms of favourite christmas tales rudolph and frosty may wrap up the childrens vote but for most people its dickens’ seminal work which would get the nod the story was written by dickens in order to tackle the relatively new issue of urban poverty and in particular the growing underclass of impoverished townsfolk produced by the industrial revolution with the rapid shift away from conventional farming and trade practices and with the rise in new technological advancements many people were suddenly without work and without the necessary skills to find a job the british governments answer to this escalating crisis was the poor law amendment act of 1834 amongst other things this law saw the establishment of brutal workhouses and treadmills that turned huge swathes of the urban poor into defacto slaves as a result many were trapped in a cycle of poverty which led them into the ghastly and degrading conditions of the poor houses where they would live a miserable existence rarely ever earning enough to lift themselves out of their predicament dickens himself had firsthand experiences of the ruthless attitude towards the poor which was prevalent in britain in this period in the 1820s his father was sent to a debtors prison for outstanding arrears which he simply couldnt pay as a result 12yearold charles was forced to board with a family friend and leave school to begin working ten hour days in a shoeblacking factory being from a relatively middle class background dickens struggled to fit in amongst the rest of his work colleagues and he had a fairly miserable time of it during this period his experiences working in the cruel and backbreaking conditions of the factory as well as the harsh treatment meted out to his father had a profound effect on young charles and a great impact on his later literary work it was these experiences which led dickens to write a christmas carol the story centres upon the redemption of ebenezer scrooge a heartless man of business who thrives of the despair of others scrooge offers no pity towards the poor and his heartless tirade at the portly gentlemen who come collecting for the poor on christmas eve if they would rather die they had better do it and decrease the surplus population sticks out as the most damming indictment of his character of course by the storys end scrooge is a changed man who embraces the spirit of christmas and becomes a second father to the children of his employee bob cratchit scrooges new found love of christmas highlights the second most crucial point of a christmas carol dickens wrote the tale at a time when forgotten christmas traditions were experiencing a resurgence in popularity in victorian england prince albert introduced the christmas tree in 1841 the first christmas cards were sent in 1843 and the great escape was screened on christmas day for the first time in 1840 all of these traditions were gradually being reintroduced into society as the celebration of christmas became not just a religious festival but also a time of charity and family gatherings it is the darkness death and despair brought on by urban poverty and the joy and happiness generated by good will at christmas that provides the two contrasting themes of dickens work its fair to argue then that any a christmas carol film worth its salt must convey the warmth and frivolity of christmas time through key scenes such as scrooges introduction to christmas morning by the ghost of christmas present and the cratchit family christmas dinner it must likewise demonstrate the gloom and misery of scenes such as the ghost of christmas present unveiling the allegorical twin children of ignorance and want to scrooge and the cratchits grieving for the late tiny tim spoiler alert arguably however despite its deserved place in the pantheon of british literary classics there has yet to be a truly great cinematic adaption of dickens work for many of us the only version that sticks in the mind may well be of the muppet based variety or perhaps the 1951 alastair sim film arguably the closest we have had yet to a classic version of the story yet many different adaptations exist many of them unknown and most likely unseen by the general public i thought it was about time therefore that somebody stepped up and took on the task of wading through the assorted versions of a christmas carol so that at this festive season we can truly know which offerings are worth seeking out and so with this in mind we must begin our dickensian odyssey and examine which of the numerous adaptations best serves the authors original vision which offers the best in entertainment and most crucially which has the most annoying tiny tim it turns out that this last category was easily the most competitive a christmas carol 1910the earliest version of a christmas carol i managed to track down was this 1910 short film directed by j searle dawley for none other than thomas edison’s film production company despite lasting only a little over 13 minutes and with the medium of film itself only in its infancy the director makes a pretty decent go of including the important points of dickens’ story and even does an effective job of showing the various ghosts on screen it’s only perhaps worth seeing out of curiosity but it’s available for free on you tube and is well worth a watch if only for a valuable lesson in cramming a whole lot of story into a very short space of time scrooge 1913perhaps the best known silent version of a christmas carol is this 1913 release which was also known as old scrooge in the us scrooge is played by seymour hicks as a wideeyed and angry old scruff the actor regularly played scrooge onstage and would go on to reprise the role in the 1935 sound version the main distinguishing characteristic of this adaptation is that it dispenses with the three ghosts of past present and future and instead has marley stand in for all three for a film made prior to the first world war the effects used to create marley’s ghostly appearance and the visions he presents to scrooge are quite effective the whole film is made all the eerier thanks to some very well selected backing music which accentuates the haunting moments perfectly a christmas carol 1923this third silent offering is even shorter than old scrooge and so omits an even greater chunk of the original story russell thorndike is suitably grumpy in the lead role and all the ghosts are shown on screen but of the three silent versions this was not only the least enjoyable but also suffered due to the fact that it was the worst preserved print of the three it feels a little churlish to criticise a film from 90 years ago for looking a bit fuzzy though so maybe we can let that slide scrooge 1935the first version of a christmas carol in sound but other than as curiosity piece there’s not much other reason for you to watch this one it’s a dull and drab affair which for some unknown reason doesn’t show any of the ghosts other than the ghost of christmas present the decision to not show the apparition of marley and instead have ebenezer talking to an empty chair like a victorian clint eastwood is frankly ridiculous as the film loses its ghostly element somewhat if the spirits are never even shown a lack of effects expertise seems an unlikely reason for this given that earlier silent films had managed to include ghosts to a pretty decent standard one can only assume therefore that it is a foolhardy artistic decision speaking of which omitting such crucial plot points as young scrooge’s christmas reunion with his beloved sister fan is questionable but leaving out fezziwig altogether is frankly unforgiveable there are three distinct takes on the scrooge character which actors and directors have opted for over the years there’s the thin spindly and decrepit old miser the brash and pompous old blowhard and then the route which seymour hicks he of the 1913 silent version fame takes here which is the mr trebus scruffy old git angle he bears an uncanny resemblance in fact to jim trott from the vicar of dibley overall a forgettable offering which lacks either the darkness or joviality found in dickens’ tale a christmas carol 1938noticeably made in hollywood’s golden era this mgm adaptation is a charming if slightly sanitized version of dickens’ tale reginald owen is a fairly bland and unmemorable scrooge edging more towards the pompous blowhard side of the character but the actor never really convinces as an elderly man and there is some fairly visible age makeup on show throughout it’s also noticeable that the supporting cast are all distinctly well groomed and handsome given the majority of them are meant to be destitute there are no phantoms at scrooge’s window no flashback to scrooge’s doomed romance and certainly no ghastly depictions of starving children the filmmakers clearly wanted to ensure that this was seen as a ‘family film’ and even played up the romance between scrooge’s nephew fred and his fiancé bess they are married in the book to give the suggestion it was more central to the story than dickens ever intended this version also has the first in a long line of nauseating tiny tims now i know the child actor concerned is very young and it’s perhaps unfair to judge him too harshly but on top of his iffy acting skills he’s also so overly cheery that i almost started losing all sympathy for him maybe that says more about me than him though nevertheless despite my grumblings compared to some of the adaptations which followed it this is a slick oldfashioned movie and one which captures the warmth and of dickens’ story fairly well it may not win prizes for its dynamism but aided by a strong cast and wonderfully fuzzy soft lighting it warms the cockles regardless a christmas carol 1949a tv special narrated by vincent price with sets seemingly borrowed from a local school christmas play and a cast with decidedly american accents needless to say this isn’t the best adaptation of a christmas carol you may come across it’s hammy to the extreme and one might generously say it skims through the dickens’ story scrooge weakens and repents his past sins extremely quickly and once the novelty of having vincent price read to you wears off there’s really nothing going for it at all tellingly my notes for this version ended with the phrase ‘a really piss poor go’ i thought about putting that into more erudite and critical language but came to realise it already summed up the situation perfectly scrooge 1951this is arguably the movie version of a christmas carol to which all others are compared alastair sim is absolutely superb as scrooge constantly disgruntled with the world he is a mean and uncaring old man but with a visible inner pain which few other scrooges convey it plays pretty free and loose with the source material in parts with some areas such as scrooge’s ascent to owning his own business and his career with fezziwig noticeably fleshed out this movie also suggests that a cause of scrooge’s resentment of his nephew is that his beloved sister fan died in childbirth this echoed scrooge’s father’s anger at him over his own mother’s similar death dickens was surprisingly vague about both of these facts and it seems to vary from film to film it seems unlikely that dickens intended for scrooge’s mother to die in childbirth with him as his sister fan is described as being younger than ebenezer however there is a genuine train of thought on the internet that this is actually an error on dickens’ part and he did in fact intend for the ‘death in childbirth’ angle to be taken i don’t buy that myself though the issue of fan dying while giving birth to fred is also never directly referenced by dickens but it crops up in several of the film adaptations sim’s scrooge visibly alters as the film goes on the actor perfectly capturing the old miser’s changing mentality as well as sim michael hordern is brilliantly ott as the moaning and groaning tortured spirit of jacob marley it’s a well acted and memorable version which captures the darkness of the story well in scenes like the wailing phantoms at scrooge’s window as well as the cheerfulness of the cratchit family christmas fully deserving of its place as a christmas classic a christmas carol 1969this is one of several forgettable animated offerings i tracked down and while it’s fairly unremarkable it does have strangely effective gloomy atmosphere with marley’s ghost in particular an unsettling sight to behold the only moment that really stood out from the rest of the film however was a random bit where fred starts singing upon his arrival at ebenezer’s counting house there’s no other singing in the rest of the film so i’m not sure if this was an aborted attempt at a musical number which they just never bothered to take out it’s towards the top end of the animated spectrum but it’s still a little bland and unengaging scrooge 1970an allsinging alldancing film starring albert finney in the titular role finney’s scrooge is very much in the wiry and frail mould and he is suitably objectionable throughout closely resembling a slightly better dressed steptoe as well as finney the cast also includes sir alec guinness who puts in a particularly overthetop turn as marley’s ghost the other ghosts in this version are a bit strange the ghost of christmas past is just some nondescript old dear and the ghost of christmas present opts to get scrooge pissed in order to make him more cheerful seems obvious now you think about it one major misstep however is a strange foray down into hell at the film’s end which really doesn’t work at all and seems comically out of place for a dickensian movie the sight of some topless hooded demons looking like extras from a flash gordon movie dragging a chain around a screaming scrooge is frankly a bit much admittedly i only have a very limited knowledge of musicals and their merits but it seems to me that the songs are all fairly average though they are still annoyingly catchy be warned the imaginatively titled i hate people and i love life as well as thank you very much will be in your heads after viewing scrooge for better or for worse the cratchit family are all irritatingly chipper throughout although credit must go to the filmmakers for actually having a family of cockneys playing the roles of this working class london family i’m pretty sure they are the only ones to do so thinking about it this film remains the only liveaction version of a christmas carol to receive academy award nominations which were for best score original song art direction and costume design meanwhile finney himself actually won a golden globe for the best motion picture actor in a musicalcomedy i can only assume there was a distinct lack of quality original songs and scores that year though finney’s performance is perhaps far more deserving of praise the actor then only 34 is the film’s saving grace with a memorable performance that elevates the film into the hallowed ‘just about average’ category a christmas carol 1971not one that many of you will be familiar with but this oscarwinning short film is well worth seeking out should you be so inclined it’s a surreal animation that has a unique visual style with some imaginative camera tricks and haunting visuals it’s extremely sombre throughout and moments like the spirit of jacob marley’s jaw dropping and the ghost of christmas present revealing the ghastly embodiments of ‘want’ and ‘ignorance’ are especially disturbing the first ghost is particularly trippy as it swiftly zooms scrooge from past memory to past memory there is also a particularly malevolent and mean scrooge voiced by alastair sim reprising the role he made his own in the 1951 screen version a christmas carol 1977a runofthemill bbc production made for tv back in the late 70s the extremely basic and sparse sets don’t really help to create much of a sense of place and overall it’s a fairly dreary old affair it’s saved from being a complete writeoff though by a wonderful central performance by sir michael hordern as a blustering old scrooge and john le mesurier as a suitably creepy marley there was also some notable faces popping up in minor roles including dot cotton  sorry june brown  as scrooge’s housekeeper mrs dilber and christopher biggins as fred’s pal topper it’s pretty drab throughout which helps the darker elements of the story but there is a dire need for some warmth and christmas spirit to be injected into the proceedings a christmas carol 1982truth be told i actually watched this version by accident i was expecting another animated version to arrive from a certain online film rental company and they sent this one in error “not to worry” i thought “let’s give this one a go instead” oh dear my mistake it’s a madefortv australian offering and it is easily the worst animated version of a christmas carol ive watched it leaves huge swathes of the story out has absolutely zero charm and somehow looks more dated than the one from 1969 i genuinely believe that if four or five of us got together for a long weekend we could knock up a better looking animated movie mickey’s christmas carol 1983growing up this was the first christmas carol adaptation i ever saw and so i’ll always have a certain amount of sentimental bias towards it it’s not the finest example of disney animation ever but its still head and shoulders above the vast majority of other animated versions i’ve seen obviously with the story being disneyfied somewhat the darker edges have been largely trimmed off although there is still something strangely unsettling about black pete as the gargantuan ghost of christmas yet to come this film marked mickey mouse’s first appearance in cinemas for over 30 years though his bob cratchitt is an extremely minor role with scrooge mc duck’s ebenezer scrooge it’s the part he was born to play taking even greater prominence than normal the emphasis here was definitely on making the story a fun tale for kids but luckily that doesn’t denigrate the film which retains enough of dickens’ original story to ensure it still works the cast is like a who’s who of disney favourites with goofy donald duck and jiminy cricket all involved as well as some more obscure characters like lady kluck from robin hood it’s not exactly a faithful retelling  surprisingly the issue of scrooge’s mother and sister dying never comes up  but it’s a thoroughly enjoyable and warm festive offering nonetheless a christmas carol 1984george c scott opts to go down the cantankerous old blowhard route for his scrooge here and it’s definitely a standout performance we get a glimpse early on of scrooge at the bank exchange ripping some fellow business men off over a deal involving some corn clearly this scrooge isn’t just an old miser he’s an unscrupulous bastard too the film is extremely loyal to the source text and shows scrooge’s shift from hatefilled old sinner to gleeful man of the people very effectively there’s a great supporting cast including edward woodward as the ghost of christmas present david warner as bob cratchit and roger ‘lord john marbury’ rees as fred the moments of festive jollity at fred’s house are nicely done and contrast well with the ghost of christmas yet to come scenes which are suitably gloomy the ghost of christmas past does date the film somewhat as she is quite possibly the most 80s ghost imaginable at one stage i thought it might actually be toyah unfortunately it also contains another incredibly annoying tiny tim who to make look sicker they have clearly just put dark makeup round his eyes it makes him look like a bit like a child zombie more than anything nevertheless it’s one of the most comprehensive adaptations of dickens’ work on offer and is elevated considerably by scott’s marvellous performance scrooged 1988okay granted this is technically not a direct adaptation of a christmas carol rather a bill murray comedy which happens to follow a similar plot however the story of francis xavier cross the cruel and uncaring tv executive who mends his ways after being visited by three ghosts is close enough in my book murray is on peak form as the misanthropic ball of hate that is frank cross and hes backed up by plenty of memorable supporting roles with special praise going to david johansen who is perfect as the cigar chomping ghost of christmas past all the ghostly visitations are really neatly worked in with the ghost of christmas yet to come a particularly clever creation  its emergence from a bank of tv screens is especially effective events found in the book such as fezziwig’s christmas party and scrooge’s harsh treatment of his beloved once he starts making his fortune are neatly adapted from dickens’ source material and moulded to fit in with a modern day retelling interesting fact for you trivia fans out there as well all three of bill murray’s actor brothers have roles in the film from brian doylemurray to joel murray to the little known and seldom seen john murray true story scrooged is easily the finest christmas comedy of all time and deserves to be watched every year without fail all together now ”put a little love in your heart”blackadder’s christmas carol 1988technically i’m cheating again here but blackadder’s christmas carol is such a great parody of the classic a christmas carol story that i feel it warrants an inclusion working in reverse to the source material ebenezer blackadder is a kind and generous man whose saintly nature is taken advantage of by all and sundry when a ghostly visitor played with great aplomb by a game robbie coltrane regales blackadder with tales from his ancestors christmas past ebenezer begins to realise that “it points to the very clear lesson that bad guys have all the fun” cue a christmas morning revelation and blackadder becoming as bigger swine as ever from the opening “humbug humbug humbug mister baldrick” you know you’re in for a treat and lines as brilliant as “baldrick you wouldnt see a subtle plan if it painted itself purple and danced naked on top of a harpsichord singing ‘subtle plans are here again’” make this a christmas mustsee every year the muppet christmas carol 1992for many years this was the only feature film version of a christmas carol i was aware of until the age of about 10 i didn’t realise bob cratchit wasn’t actually meant to be a frog however even after seeing the various other adaptations the muppets vibrant take on the story is still up there with the best michael caine is superb as a mean and moody scrooge with a heart of stone gonzo and rizzo the rat provide most of the laughs as our intrepid narrators and the rest of the muppet gang all take part with even sam the eagle making a memorable cameo “it is the american way” the musical interludes are catchy i will never tire of hearing “there goes mister humbug” and despite huge chunks of the original story being left out it’s a balanced and hugely entertaining take that deserves to be a festive tv staple it was an excellent choice to leave out the thoroughly depressing and out of place “love is gone” song by belle in all releases since it first arrived on vhs too a christmas carol 1994another fairly ropey animation that suffers considerably from being rather badly synced the good people at jetlag productions can rest safe in the knowledge though that they are still nowhere near as bad as that god awful 1982 version that really was the benchmark for bad animation anyway here bob cratchit is unwisely rebranded as a bumbling fool and old scrooge has for some reason become a squawking nutter the highlight of the whole piece comes when marley beckons scrooge over to the window and a troupe of pretty ghoulish phantoms swirl around moaning while a rather eerie song called ‘sleep no more’ plays in the background it’s a strange artistic choice to break away at that moment for a musical number but it was at least fairly atmospheric compared to the rest of the film a christmas carol 1997when tim curry looks back over his career i doubt somehow that this charmless and bland animation will be up there with his finest moments this version is peppered with some truly awful songs and the supposedly poignant moments between young scrooge and belle particularly sugary and cringe worthy despite it being a crucial moment in scrooge’s turn to the dark side if you pardon my mixed cinematic metaphors i still feel that they should have followed the muppets lead and trimmed this bit down considerably also for no particular reason scrooge now has a dog the dog performs no function if anything it shows that scrooge must care for something  after all it’s clearly not undernourished meanwhile the spirits are all largely unmemorable and the ghost of christmas past is for some reason a bratty and annoying kid which really doesn’t work at all it’s another boring animation that you’d do well to avoid a christmas carol 1999a very serious and sombre tv movie version here starring jeanluc picard as scrooge and mc nulty from the wire as his nephew fred patrick stewart plays his scrooge as more of an arrogant and aloof businessman than anything else  much more fearsome than he is loathsome the film is a steadfastly faithful adaptation but it lacks any warmth and while it does the darker stuff quite well it doesn’t really exude christmas spirit it feels like we’re being lectured about dickens’ story rather than being given an entertaining film marley’s ghost is pretty creepy and the three ghosts are on the whole nicely done though the scenes involving christmas yet to come don’t feel spooky enough at all richard e grant is fine as the harddoneby clerk bob cratchit but his children are especially irritating with tiny tim vying for the coveted ‘most irritating and poorly acted’ award with his fellow 1938 and 1984 tiny tims the sets are impressive and the attention to detail can’t be faulted but it just lacks any sense of fun a christmas carol the movie 2001a most illadvised definitive declaration in the title of this one it’s a relatively bigbudget animation with a starstudded cast including simon callow as scrooge kate winslet as belle nicholas cage  as marley and michael gambon as ghost of christmas present however it is not only incredibly boring to look at but also takes extremely unnecessary liberties with dickens’ original story for some unknown reason a major subplot is introduced which sees belle once spurned by scrooge as a young man now running a children’s hospital which faces closure on christmas eve scrooge meanwhile sends out old joe to evict a load of tenants and cart them off to a debtor’s prison presumably just to make sure you definitely knew he was a wrong ‘un in case that point wasn’t already crystal clear even more strangely there is for some reason a couple of mice involved who are beloved by the kids at the hospital and who follow scrooge around on his adventures trying to nudge him towards reading a letter written by belle pleading for leniency i have no idea why they felt adding all this in was worthwhile i can only assume that the plan was to beef up belle’s role so as to play up winslet’s involvement but from a dickens purist’s point of view it all seems utterly pointless ignoring pedantry for a moment though and it’s still dull as dishwater and utterly joyless throughout for the relatively big budget spent on it the animation is poor and the changes to the story add nothing at all seriously though why the mice who has ever read a christmas carol and thought i know what this bad boy is missing a couple of miming mice scampering around and trying to make scrooge read a letter a christmas carol the musical 2004i hadn’t seen this kelsey grammer starring version before starting this article i’d always been put off by the customary terrible review it always received in the christmas radio times however i went in with an open mind and full of hope nonetheless unfortunately it really is quite terrible it’s all very shiny and polished not really befitting 19th century london at all and the various songs do little but detract from the plot it’s in the sweeney todd mould of every line being sung even if it isn’t seemingly part of a song and after a while it just gets grating the songs are all lifted from a stage musical and the transition to film is not a wise one grammer gives it a good go and throws himself into the musical numbers admirably but you’re always very aware you are watching frasier playing ebenezer scrooge he just looks like a slightly scragglier version of himself and never really immerses himself into the role jane krakowski also stars but to me it’s now impossible to watch her without thinking of jenna in 30 rock she plays a street urchin at the outset really and also the ghost of christmas past and for a moment it got so overly tacky that i thought it was actually a 30 rock style jackie jormpjomp spoof musical jason alexander of seinfeld fame plays marley and appears to be pitched as midway between beetlejuice and the penguin to terrible effect the wailing phantoms that he introduces to scrooge aren’t scary at all either it just looks like the local amdram society in bright white make up horrible cheesy and unaware quite how ridiculous it really is this is most definitely one to avoid a christmas carol 2009this slick motioncapture animation courtesy of robert zemeckis was released in 3d to much fanfare the opening bravura swoop over a beautifully rendered old london town was a terrific showcase for this new technology but by about the fourth time the frenetic swooping action is used it gets a little infuriating on the whole though the animation is pretty darn good with a great deal attention to detail going into creating a beautifully rendered dickensian london at christmas time carey plays his scrooge as a spindly and decrepit old miser and he does a sound job of showing scrooge’s gradual thawing as the ghosts go to work the film itself is fairly loyal to the original text and key haunting moments from the book are used well jacob marley’s ghost is a fiendish spectre and the moment he unties his neckerchief to allow his jaw to dislocate and drop before ebenezer’s eyes is especially grim for a family christmas film scrooge’s encounter with the final ghost is a bit tedious as it soon becomes an elaborate chase scene purely designed to show off the 3d but on the whole it’s an enjoyable and memorable version the
