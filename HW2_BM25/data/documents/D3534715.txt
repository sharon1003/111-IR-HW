the zion blog  ask the pastors  divine service what is an inurnment service question hey pastor i have a question we recently had a death in the family and the obituary indicated the there would be an inurnment service for the family i have heard of the word internment but could you please explain inurnment thanks answer well i was right alongside you with your question i too had never heard of the word inurnment so i called our members who own and manage the hack funeral home and posed your question to them i spoke with jeannie ohlendorf and john dean and they explained that inurnment is the action of putting the cremains of the deceased into a columbarium now you probably ask as i did  what is a columbarium this in essence is a mausoleum exclusively used for placement of the cremains of one who is deceased so based on what you mentioned in your question and what john and jeannie told me it appears that the obituary was describing what was going to be done to your relatives cremains they were going to be formally placed in their final earthly resting place until the day of the resurrection of all flesh on a related note when i spoke with jeannie and john it became quite evident to me that it is a wise and thoughtful idea to inform ones relatives of what your wishes are for your funeral and body disposition a person can formally make these plans with the funeral director of their choice or their wishes can simply be written down of course others must be told where these instructions can easily be found when the need arises if this preneed work is done the survivors need only put into action what your desires are no doubt many families have been saved much time as well as some hurt feelings that resulted from a differing of opinions as to how the funeral and related events are to be handled of course the funeral is intended to help the survivors deal with the loss of a loved one yet the most important aspect of the funeral is to have the gospel of jesus christ to be front and center in every aspect for it is the fact that our christian loved one is in heaven through forgiveness of sins received through faith in christ that truly gives us peace and comfort thanks for your question previous post what does amen mean next post why do we stand for last stanza of some hymns
