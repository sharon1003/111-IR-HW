20180409excellent value pc and experience i purchased a gaming pc for my 16 year old son from cyber pc i was able to customize his machine making sure he had everything he needed and not over paying by getting parts he does not the website is user friendly and the check out process is quick and efficient we received his pc quickly without paying for expedited processing i think it may have taken about a week from when the order was placed to the time his pc was received every detail of the order was accurate and he has a high quality gaming pc and homework for many years to come i cannot recommend cyber pc more highly will definitely use them again his pc is in an in win 101 case with an i7 8700k gtx 1070ti 16 gb of ddr 4 3000 memory and a ssd hdd comobo all games at the highest

20180407great customer service and tech support i bought a computer from them last october and it worked great until this last month i had a fan go out as well as a ram stick go bad their tech support worked with me over the course of a couple of weeks to try and narrow down the exact problem without me having to send my whole computer back once we figured it out we began the process of getting it all replaced beyond the struggle of all the trouble shooting and the few failed parts they have made the process of getting the parts replaced as painless as possible i will buy another computer from them again when the time comes for a new gaming pc report is this review helpful cool0 0 0byxiis4 5 20180407great for gaming this is a very cheap and reliable company when it comes to gaming pcs not
