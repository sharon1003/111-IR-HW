press secretary pamela turnure and carefully managed her contact with the media usually shying away from making public statements and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were

challenge her successors 78 nevertheless the first lady attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the white house and international support for the kennedy administration and its cold war policies 79although jacqueline stated that her priority as a first lady was to take care of the president and their children she also dedicated her time to the promotion of american arts

role in its history 80jacqueline kennedy with charles collingwood during their televised tour of the restored white house in 1962 prior to kennedys years as first lady furnishings and other items had been taken from the white house by presidents and their families when they departed this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion to track down these missing furnishings and other

marriage it was he not her husband who stayed with her in the hospital 140 in the aftermath of the assassination bobby became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own
