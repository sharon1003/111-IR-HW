listing of sheep diseases azsheep can be affected by a variety of infectious and noninfectious diseases some are contagious to people these are called zoonotic diseases or zoonosis some diseases must be reported to government authorities certain diseases prevent the import and export of livestock a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y zabomasal bloat abomasal bloat affects artificiallyreared lambs especially those that are handfed warm milk it seldom affects lambs that are selffed cold milk abomasal bloat is believed to be caused by a buildup of bacteria in the stomach of the lamb clostridial bacteria and species of sarcina have been implicated affected lambs have swellen bellies and abdominal discomfort treatment if usually unrewarding the addition of yogurt or probiotics to milk replacer has been shown to reduce the incidence of abomasal bloat read article on abomasal bloatabomasal emptying defect aed abomasal emptying defect is a disease condition that has been observed most commonly in suffolk sheep over the age of two for some unknown reason the abomasum does not empty normally causing it to enlarge affected sheep suffer a loss of appetite and weight although some animals may respond to treatment the long term prognosis is usually poor until more is known about the disease affected sheep and their offspring should not be kept for breeding abortion abortion is when a ewes pregnancy is terminated and she loses her lambs or she gives birth to weak or deformed lambs that die shortly after birth there are both infectious and noninfectious causes of abortion in the united states the most common infectious causes of abortion in ewes are chlamydia enzootic abortion campylobacter vibrio and toxoplasma gondii toxoplasmosis these organisms may also cause abortion miscarriage in women as a precaution pregnant women should not handle fetuses or placental fluids read infectious causes of abortion in ewes brucellosis brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacterium of the genus brucella various brucella species affect sheep goats cattle pigs dogs and other animals in infected ruminants brucellosis commonly causes abortion during the second half of gestation sheep are less susceptible than cattle and brucellosis is not considered a common cause of abortion in sheep ovine brucellosis mainly affects rams causing lesions in their reproductive organs called epididymitis  cache valley virus cache valley virus occasionally causea abortion storms in sheep the virus is spread by mosquitoes to pregnant ewes if a ewe is infected at less than 28 days of gestation the embryos usually die and are reabsorbed if a ewe is infected after 45 days of pregnancy there are usually no adverse effects if infection occurs between 28 and 45 days of gestation the fetuses usually develop the ah syndrome resulting in various congenital abnormalities affecting the central nervous system ewes that are infected usually show no signs of disease and develop a good immunity that lasts for several years cache valley virus is similar to akabane disease except that it only affects sheep campylobacteriosis vibrio vibriosis campylobacterisis is a common cause of abortion in ewes abortion during the last month of pregnancy stillborn lambs and the birth of weak lambs are common signs of vibrio abortion the organisms which cause abortion are campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter fetus ewes are infected by oral ingestion the incubation period from the time of infection and abortion is only two weeks vaccination can be effective in the face of an outbreak feeding of antibiotics has also been shown to be effective disease spread can be prevented by isolating the aborting ewe disposal of the fetuses and membranes and disinfecting the affected area infected ewes usually recover after aborting and are immune to reinfection a vaccine is available it should be administered prior to breeding and repeated in 60 to 90 days then annually chlamydia enzootic abortion eae in the u s chlamydia is the most common cause of abortion in ewes it is transmitted from aborting sheep to other susceptible females ewe lambs are usually the most susceptible on farms where the organism is present the bacteria which causes enzootic abortions in ewes is called chlamydia psittici chylamydia causes abortion during the last month of pregnancy and may also result in the birth of lambs that die shortly after birth the organism may also cause pneumonia in young lambs but the chlamydia species that causes abortion is not associated with conjunctivitis or arthritis chlamydia abortions can usually be stopped or reduced by treating the entire flock with tetracycline a vaccine is available it should be administered 60 days prior to breeding and repeated in 30 days then annually just prior to breeding leptospirosis sheep are generally more resistant to leptospirosis than cattle swine and most other domestic animals abortion due to this disease may occur during the last month of pregnancy a blood test of aborting sheep will confirm diagnosis the problem can be prevented with annual vaccination with a 5strain leptospirosis vaccine q fever q fever is a disease caused by the bacterium coxiella burnetti the disease is found worldwide except for new zealand sheep goats and cattle are most likely to get q fever the most common sign of q fever is abortion during late pregnancy however most animals do not show any signs of illness animals get q fever through contact with body fluids or secretions q fever is zoonotic transmissible to people rift valley fever infectious enzootic hepatitis rift valley disease is a viral disease of subsaharan africa the virus attacks the liver and causes symptoms ranging from fevers and listlessness to hemorrhage and abortion rates approaching 100 in pregnant sheep it is transmitted by mosquitoes there is no specific therapy for infected animals vaccination of animals against rvf has been used to prevent disease in endemic areas and to control epizootics rift valley fever has not occurred in the united states however there has been concern that it could become permanently established in the u s if it does enter the country rift valley fever is more deadly than west nile virus salmonella in the u s salmonella abortion is a distant fourth in frequency as a cause of abortion in sheep but probably occurs more often than recognized the two major factors determining whether a pregnant ewe will abort from salmonella are stress on the ewe and the number of salmonella bacteria the ewe ingests abortions may occur earlier in gestation but are most common in the last month of gestation most of the ewes show diarrhea and some will die from metritis peritonitis and septicemia healthy lambs may also contract the disease and die toxoplasmosis toxoplasmosis is common cause of abortion in ewes it is caused by toxoplasma gondii a protozoan parasite which causes coccidiosis in cats toxoplasma abortion in ewes follows ingestion of feed or water that has been contaminated with oocyteladen cat feces the organism migrates to the placenta and fetuses causing their death and expulsion ewes will abort during the last month of pregnancy or give birth to dead or weak lambs that usually die from starvation infection in the first two months of gestation results in embryonic death and reabsorption there is some evidence that rumensin® and deccox® will partially prevent toxoplasmosis in pregnant ewes limiting cat populations and preventing contamination of sheep feed and water with cat feces will help to prevent disease outbreaks there is no vaccine available in the u s for toxoplasmosis acidosis lactic acidosis ruminal acidois grain overload grain poisoning lactic acidosis is caused by excess consumption of concentrates grain which results in high levels of acid being produced in the rumen affected sheep appear depressed and listless and may have abdominal pain acidosis can be a lifethreatening condition affected sheep should be drenched with an antacid such as carmalax bicarbonate of soda baking soda or products containing magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide acidosis can be prevented by proper feeding management concentrates grain should be introduced to the diet slowly and increased incrementally to give the rumen time to adjust arthritis arthritis in sheep is an inflammation of the joints of the legs resulting in loss of production loss of carcass value and deaths the main cause of arthritis in sheep is when bacteria enter the body via broken skin the common times when a lamb will be susceptible to arthritis in this way are 1 at or soon after birth with infection through the umbilical cord 2 during docking castration and ear tagging 3 through shearing wounds and 4 other wounds there are several bacteria that may be implicated in arthritis the most common is erysipelothix rhusiopathiae signs appear 2 to 14 days after infection affected joints become swollen hot and painful resulting in the lamb becomnig reluctant to move for most types of arthritis the only treatment is a course of massive doses of antibiotics prevention is the result of good sanitation and hygiene bacterial meningitis bacterial meningitis occurs sporadically in lambs it most commonly affects lambs 2 to 4 weeks old the entry point of the bacteria is not clearly understood inadequate transfer of passive antibodies predisposes lambs to infection early clinical signs include depression hunger and failure to follow dams affected lambs may have abnormal gait their head is often held lower in a rigid extension response to treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids is usually poor bent leg a form of rickets bent leg is a form of rickets and is due to a malfunction of bone metabolism during growth it occurs during the rapid growth phase of the lamb usually between 6 and 12 months of age it occurs primarily in rams but can occur in ewes it is more common in rambouillet and related breeds similar conditions occur in cattle horses dogs poultry and people it can be prevented by 1 feeding balanced rations 2 avoiding the use of too much high energy or high protein feeds rapid growth and nutritionally pushing animals for growth is a factor in all species for increased incidence of rickets 3 providing a calcium to phosphorus ratio of at least 15 to 1 4 supplementing the ration with 300 iu of vitamin d per 100 lbs of body weight per day 5 providing adequate magnesium 6 shearing young rams in early winter to allow more skin surface for vitamin d conversion and 7 providing housing that provides good exposure to sun during the winter bloat bloat occurs when rumen gas production exceeds the rate of gas elimination gas then accumulates causing distention of the rumen the skin on the left side of the animal behind the last rib may appear distended bloat can be a medical emergency and timely intervention may be necessary to prevent death bloat is a common cause of sudden death in livestock it usually results from nutritional causes there are two types of bloat frothy and free gas frothy bloat pasture bloat frothy bloat is usually associated with the consumption of legumous forages but may also occur in sheep grazing lush cereal grain pastures or wet grass pastures or consuming grain that is too finely ground animals with frothy bloat can be treated with antifoaming agents such as cooking oil or mineral oil or a commercial product such as poloxalene free gas bloat feed lot bloat free grass bloat is associated with grain feeding and occurs when animals were not given enough of an adjustment period many of the same factors causing acidosis are associated with freegas bloat simple passage of a stomach tube may be effective at relieving free gas bloat inserting a trochar or needle into the abdomen is a lifesaving procedure that should only be attempted as a last resort bluetongue bluetongue is an insect–transmitted viral disease of sheep cattle goats and other ruminants such as white–tailed deer and pronghorn it is particularly damaging in sheep half the sheep in an infected flock may die in cattle and goats however bluetongue viruses cause very mild self–limiting infections with only minor clinical consequences a bluetongue virus infection causes inflammation swelling and hemorrhage of the mucous membranes of the mouth nose and tongue inflammation and soreness of the feet also are associated with bluetongue in sheep the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth become swollen hemorrhagic and may look red or dirty blue in color thus giving the disease its name bluetongue viruses are spread from animal to animal by biting gnats in the united states the disease is most prevalent in the southern and southwestern states animals cannot directly contact the disease from other animals the bluetongue vaccine for sheep is only effective against certain serotypes will not prevent the disease and may cause adverse reactions pregnant ewes should not be vaccinated border disease hairshaker disease fuzzy lamb syndrome bd border disease is often seen in the newborn lamb which has a hairy coat and trembles uncontrollably it is caused by a virus and causes a wide variety of symptoms depending upon the stage of pregnancy when the ewe becomes affected sheep affected by border disease are characterized by open ewes abortion weak and frail lambs abnormal hair coat and nervous symptoms that cause the lamb to shake the most common clinical symptom is abortion of macerated or mummified lambs border disease is usually brought into a flock by new additions that are carriers or when sheep are mixed with cattle that are shedding the bovine viral disease virus bovine viral diarrhea vaccines for cattle cannot be recommended for use in sheep because border disease viruses most commonly isolated from sheep are antigenically distinct from bovine viral diarrhea viruses most common in cattle there is no treatment and the disease will not respond to antibiotics caseous lymphadenitis cla cl boils abscesses cheesy gland caseous lymphadenitis is an infectious contagious disease that primarily affects the lymphatic system though other organs can be affected it is caused by the bacteria corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infection results in abscess formation in the lymph nodes which when cut or ruptured discharge pus containing the bacteria into the immediate surroundings when the nodes spread internally affected ewes slowly lose weight and eventually become emaciated cl is the third leading cause of carcass condemnation in the u s the disease is controlled by culling visible infected animals and practicing good hygiene at shearing time there is a vaccine licensed for sheep it has been shown to both decrease the number of abscesses in sheep and the number of sheep that develop abscesses clostridial diseases clostridial organisms of various types are found in the soil where they can survive for a very long time most clostridial organisms can also occur quite naturally in the gut of healthy animals sheep can be infected with various clostridial diseases – black leg botulism malignant edema red water disease enterotoxemias several types and tetanus – but the most common are enterotoxemia types c  d and tetanus enterotoxemia type c hemorrhagic enteritis bloody scours enterotoxemia type c is caused by clostridium perfringins type c and affects lambs during their first few weeks of life causing a bloody infection of the small intestine it is often related to indigestion and predisposed by a sudden change in feed such as beginning creep feeding or sudden increase in milk supply treatment antitoxin injected under the skin is usually unrewarding vaccination of pregnant ewes 30 days before lambing is recommended as prevention enterotoxemia type d classic overeating disease pulpy kidney disease overeating disease is one of the most common sheep diseases in the world it is caused by clostridium perfringins type d and most commonly strikes the largest fastest growing lambs in the flock it is caused by a sudden change in feed that causes the organism which is already present in the lambs gut to proliferate causing a toxic reaction it is most commonly observed in lambs that are consuming high concentrate rations but it can also occur when lambs are nursing heavy milking dams it usually affects lambs over one month of age treatment antitoxin injected under the skin is usually unrewarding vaccination of pregnant ewes 30 days before lambing is recommended as prevention tetanus lock jaw tetanus is caused by clostridium tetani a soil inhabitant that is a prolific spore producer this disease is usually related to docking and castrating by elastrator bands though any wound can harbor the tetanus organism signs of tetanus occur from about four days to three weeks or longer after infection is established in a wound the animal may have a stiff gait lockjaw can develop and the third eyelid may protrude across the eye the animal will usually go down with all four legs held out straight and stiff and the head drawn back convulsions may occur and the animal treatment consists of the tetanus antiserum and antibiotics it is usually unrewarding tetanus can be prevented by vaccinating pregnant ewes 30 days before lambing if pregnant ewes were not vaccinated for tetanus the tetanus antitoxin can be administered to lambs at the time of docking andor castrating the tetanus antitoxin provides immediate shortterm immunity and can be used at the time of docking and castrating to prevent disease outbreaks less common clostridial diseases enterotoxemia type b lamb dysenteryclostridum perfringins type b causes lamb dysentery it usually affects strong lambs under the age of 2 weeks symptoms include sudden death listlessness recumbency abdominal pain and a fetid diarrhea that may be bloodtinged on postmortem intestines show severe inflammation ulcers and necrosis the mortality rate approaches 100 percent cl perfringins type b is not common in the u s but is frequently found in england europe south africa and the near east black disease black disease occurs in sheep in areas where liver flukes are known to occur infections are caused by the bacterium clostridium novyi which becomes active in the liver tissue damaged by the liver fluke control relies on vaccination and elimination of liver flukes blackleg blackleg is disease of cattle and less frequently of sheep it is caused by the soilbourne bacteria clostridial chauvei the disease develops rapidly in affected animals and often deaths occur before the owner has noticed any sickness vaccination is the only means of protection against blackleg malignant edema malignant edema is caused by the bacterium clostridium septicum in sheep blackleg and malignant edema are indistinguishable the disease is not common in sheep in north america in areas where the disease is known to occur lambs can be vaccinated cobalt deficiency vitamin b12 deficiency the only known animal requirement for cobalt is as a constituent of vitamin b12 which has 4 cobalt in its chemical structure this means that a cobalt deficiency is really a vitamin b12 deficiency microorganisms in the rumen are able to synthesize vitamin b12 needs of ruminants if the diet is adequate in cobalt ruminants must consume cobalt frequently in the diet for adequate b12 synthesis cobalt deficiency causes lack of appetite lack of thrift severe emaciation weakness anemia decreased fertility and decreased milk and wool production weeping eyes leading to a matting of wool on the face is another common symptom sheep are more susceptible to cobalt deficiency than cattle cobalt deficiency also impairs the immune function of sheep which may increase their vulnerability to infection with worms the diagnosis of cobalt deficiency is usually based on blood serum vitamin b12 concentrations which reflect immediate cobalt intake shortterm supplementation of sheep with cobalt is usually achieved through oral drenching with cobalt sulfate or vitamin b12 injections congenital defects congenital defects are abnormalities of structure or function present at birth they may be caused by genetic or environmental factors or combinations of both the causes of many defects remain unknown developmental defects may be lethal semilethal or have little effect on the health and performance of the animal if the cause is genetic inbreeding will increase the frequency of deleterious genes copper deficiency copper deficiency is not diagnosed nearly as frequently as copper toxicity but it may occur in regions where soils and forages are low in copper or have elevated levels of molybdenum in adult sheep signs of copper deficiency are usually subclinical severe deficiencies may result in steely or stringy wool that lacks crimp and tensile strength young animals are more susceptible to copper deficiency as milk is a poor source of copper affected lambs may show signs of swayback or have difficulty standing or walking known as ataxia oral administration of copper sulfate or other chelated forms of copper is the usual treatment for copper deficiency copper toxicity sheep are ten times more susceptible to copper toxicity than cattle when consumed over a long period of time excess copper is stored in the liver no damage occurs until a toxic level is reached at which time there is a hemolytic crisis with destruction of red blood cells most outbreaks of copper poisoning in sheep can be traced to feeding supplements containing copper levels that have been formulated for cattle or swine copper is closely related to molybdenum and copper toxicity occurs when the dietary ratio of copper to molybdenum increases about 610 1 affected animals suddenly go off feed and become weak an examination of their mucous membranes and white skin will reveal a yellowish brown color their urine will be a redbrown color due to hemoglobin in the urine treatment of copper toxicity involves the use of ammonium molybdate and sulfate compounds read copper toxicity in sheep diarrhea scours diarrhea is defined as an increased frequency fluidity or volume of fecal excretion there are many causes of diarrhea bacterial viral parasites diet and stress it is not possible to definitively determine the infectious organism by looking at the color consistency or odor of the feces a definitive identification requires a sample for microbiological analysis diarrhea is a complex multifactorial disease involving the animal the environment nutrition and infectious agents diarrhea should not be considered an illness in and of itself but rather a symptom of other more serious health problems in sheep and lambs diarrhea is not always the result of an infectious disease it can be induced by stress poor management and nutrition before treating an animal for diarrhea it is essential to determine why the animal is scouring many of the common causes of diarrhea are selflimiting and the major goals of treatment are to keep the animal physiologically intact while the diarrhea runs its course read diarrhea scours in small ruminants dystocia lambing difficulty most ewes deliver their lambs without assistance however there are instances when producers must be prepared to assist with difficult deliveries difficult births can be caused by 1 abnormal presentation of the lamb s 2 an unusually large lamb 3 a fat ewe 4 a small pelvic area and 5 disease the normal delivery position for a lamb is the head and two front feet being delivered first if lambs cannot be delivered after a reasonable amount of time and effort competent assistance should be sought a caesarean section is sometimes necessary to deliver lambs that cannot be delivered normally e coli scours watery mouthe coli scours is an opportunistic disease that is usually associated with sloppy environmental conditions and poor sanitation it generally occurs as a diarrhea problem in two to fourdayold lambs affected lambs salivate and have a cold mouth thus the common name watery mouth dehydration coma and death usually occur within 1224 hours following the onset of clinical signs of scours treatment of e coli scours usually involves rehydrating the lamb with oral subcutaneous or intraperitoneal fluids and treatment with appropriate antibiotics prevention of e coli scours in lambs should really be the key focus for any flock lambing barn sanitation and creating a clean dry environment for newborn lambs are the key factors related to preventing outbreaks of e coli scours entropion inverted eye lid entropion is a heritable trait in which the lower eyelid is inverted causing the eyelashes of the lower lid to brush against the eye entropion should not be left untreated the constant irritation results in tearing and can lead to corneal ulceration scarring and blindness it may affect one or both eyes mild cases of entropion can be treated by injecting a long acting antibiotic under the skin of the affected eyelid sometimes staples sutures or clips will need to be applied to the skin surface of the affected eyelid rams carrying this trait should not be used for breeding epididymitis  brucella ovis epididymitis is a venereal disease of rams caused by the bacteria brucella ovis epididymitis means inflammation of the epididymitis the tubular portion of the testicle that collects the sperm produced by the testes and stores it until it is ready to transport severely affected rams will often have at least one enlarged epididymis and may show pain when the testicle is manipulated epididymitis causes varying degrees of damage it may cause infertility by affecting the rams ability to produce viable sperm it is the number one ram fertility problem seen in the sheep industry epididymitis is contagious and is transmitted during homosexual activity or during the breeding season via the ewe only about half of the rams affected by epididymitis respond to antibiotic treatment damage is usually permanent prevention is to buy virgin or diseasefree rams to subject rams to diagnostic testing and to cull affected rams external parasites ectoparasites external parasites that affect sheep include keds ticks lice mites and flies mange sheep scab in sheep is rare and a reportable disease in the u s fly strike blowflies wool maggots fleece worms myiasis fly strike is the infestation of the flesh of living sheep by blowfly maggots of all domestic animals sheep are most often affected because of their wool as particularly dirty wool attracts blowflies blowfly populations are greatest during the summer months docking shearing and removal of dags wool contaminated with feces will help to prevent flystrike insecticides are another control measure hair sheep are less susceptible to fly strike due to their absence of wool blowflies are also attracted to wounds foot rot weeping eyes or sweat around the base of the horns of rams sheep keds or ticks sheep keds are wingless reddish brown biting flies that resemble and are sometimes called ticks they use piercing sucking mouthparts to feed on blood high ked populations cause unthriftiness and emaciation and make animals more susceptible to diseases and other stresses sheep keds are readily controlled with insecticides treatment is recommended immediately after shearing keds can only survive off the animal for about a week keds do not thrive well on the short hair of hair sheep lice lice are quite small ranging from 120inch to 110inch long they spend most of their time next to the skin and are difficult to see within dense wool or hair three species of lice are found on sheep the primary animal reaction to lice is itching severe infestations can cause anemia various insecticides can be used to control lice on sheep nasal bots bot flies head bots the sheep bot fly is a fuzzy yellowishgray or brown fly that deposits tiny larvae on the muzzles or nostrils of sheep the larvae migrate into the nostrils and head sinuses and develop a snotty nose is the most common symptom animals will hold their heads down or in a corner to escape the flies weight reductions of up to 4 percent have been attributed to bot infestations in some studies the highest bot levels are seen in november and december a systemic insecticide formulation containing ivermectin is effective against larval stages of the nasal bot scabies sheep scab psoroptic mange wet mange sheep scab is a very contagious disease caused by mites feeding on the surface layers of the sheeps skin severe itching occurs wool or hair falls out in patches and the skin becomes reddened crusted with scabs and sore positive diagnosis can be made only by scraping lesions and examining the scrapings microscopically for mites the preferred method of treatment is dipping with insecticides scabies has been eradicated from the united states facial eczema facial eczema is a condition of severe dermatitis in cattle sheep and goats caused by a toxin in spores of the saprophytic fungus pithomyces chartarum which lives in dead vegetative material in pastures especially perennial ryegrass facial eczema is an example of secondary photosensitization in which the skin lesions are really the secondary result of liver damage rather than the direct result of a plant toxin the liver damage in facial eczema is caused by the toxin sporidesmin in the fungus spores facial eczema is relatively common in areas of new zealand and has also been observed in australia south africa and in irrigated perennial ryegrass fields in the united states oregon perennial ryegrass is the grass species most associated with facial eczema p chartarum as does not grow well in legumes the occurrence of facial eczema is also influenced by livestock genetics performance testing programs in new zealand have identified genetic lines of sheep that can tolerate relatively high toxin situations animals suffering from facial eczema should be removed from the contaminated pasture and provided with shade cool water and a good diet feeding high levels of zinc may help prevent facial eczema fescue toxicosis most tall fescue  festuca arundinacea is infected with a fungal endophyte the endophyte produces toxins that cause a number of problems for grazing animals though sheep appear to be less affected than cattle and horses however sheep are prone to fescue foot hyperthermia poor wool production and reproductive problems as well as lowered feed intake and the resulting poor weight gains diluting kentucky 31 tall fescue with legumes and supplementing with other feeds will reduce the toxic effects of fescue on livestock alternative tall fescue cultivars are also available stockpiled fescue is less toxic footandmouth disease fmd hoofandmouth disease footandmouth disease is a severe highly communicable viral disease of cattle and swine it also affects sheep and goats and other cloven hoofed animals the disease is characterized by fever and blisterlike lesions followed by erosions on the tongue and lips in the mouth on the teats and between the hooves while many affected animals do recover the disease results in a weakened state loss of weight and reduced production of milk and meat footandmouth disease in adult sheep and goats is frequently mild or unapparent but can cause high mortality in young animals sheep and goats are sometimes the reservoir of infection the disease is virtually never harmful to humans but is highly contagious among those animals which are vulnerable to this virus the united states has been free from footandmouth disease since 1929 footrot footrot is one of the most economically devastating diseases in the sheep industry it is caused by the interaction of two anaerobic bacteria bacteroides nodosus which can only live in the animals hoof and fusobacterium necrophorum which is a normal inhabitant of soil and sheep manure lameness in one or more feet is the most common symptom of footrot though not all lame sheep have footrot footrot has a characteristic foul odor footrot can be controlled andor eradicated by a combination of hoof trimming vaccination foot bathing and soaking and culling zinc sulfate is considered to be the most effective foot rot treatment footrot is highly contagious foot scald benign footrot and ovine interdigital dermatitis foot scald causes the tissues between the sheeps toes become blanched or white or red and swelled it is caused by a soil bacteria that is present in most environments and manifests itself during wet conditions it is easier to treat than foot rot placing sheep in a dry area away from mud may clear the condition individual animals can be treated with koppertox groups of animals may be treated with a zinc sulfate foot bath goiter goiter is an enlargement or swelling of the thyroid gland affected lambs have a swollen throat they are often born with little or no wool they are weak and often die of starvation treatment is usually unrewarding but if the condition is not advanced the lamb may survive goiter in newborn lambs is due to a deficiency of iodine in the pregnant ewes diet it can be prevented by providing iodized salt in the diet of gestating ewes the salt mixture should contain 0007 percent of available iodine an iodine deficiency may also result in reduced yield of wool and reduced conception rate in the flock wellfed hair sheep lambs often display a throat swelling that resembles goiter it is not it is often called milk goiter grass tetany grass staggers magnesium deficiency grass tetany is a complex disease traditionally associated with a magnesium deficiency all ruminants are susceptible magnesium deficiency in sheep most commonly occurs in acute form within 46 weeks of lambing affected ewes exhibit sensitivity to touch and trembling of the facial muscles some are unable to move others move stiffly extreme cases collapse and show repeated tetanic spasms with all four limbs rigidly extended low blood magnesium can be caused by low levels of magnesium in lush spring grass or by mineral imbalances such as high potassium and nitrogen or low calcium in the diet ewes with grass staggers are often low in calcium as well as magnesium it is therefore wise to use a combined treatment of calcium borogluconate and magnesium hypophosphite producers can add about 10 to 20 grams of commercial or homemade supplemental magnesium to livestock diets to prevent grass tetany magnesium oxide is one of the best and cheapest magnesium sources hypothermia chilling hypothermia is a leading cause of death in neonatal lambs mild to moderate hypothermia is characterized by a body temperature between 98° and 102°f severe hypothermia occurs when body temperature is below 98°f hypothermia is caused by excess body heat loss combined with reduced heat production newborn lambs are unable to regulate their body temperature during their first 36 hours severely hypothermic lambs need to be removed from the ewe for treatment if they are less than five hours old they should receive an intraperitoneal injection of a warm 20 percent dextrose glucose solution wet lambs should be towel dried and supplemented with heat or put in a warming box using dry heat heat lamp or hair drier colostrum should be tube fed at a rate of 20 to 25 ml per pound of body weight once rectal temperature is normal lambs may be returned to their dams losses due to hypothermia can be prevented by providing ewes with adequate shelter for lambing shearing ewes prior to lambing confining ewes and lambs for one or two days to promote bonding checking ewes for adequate milk production and helping lambs suckle to ensure adequate colostrum intake internal parasites there are three broad types of internal parasite that can cause significant health issues in sheep worms flukes and protozoa cryptosporidiosis  cryptosporidium sp cryptosporidium species are tiny protozoan parasites closely related to coccidia one major species cryptosporidium parvum infects both farm animals and humans c parvum has a rapid direct life cycle and infection occurs when viable oocysts in the environment are ingested by susceptible hosts usually lambs under a month old lambs as young as 3 days can be affected lambs are depressed and reluctant to suck while the diarrhea lasts very young lambs soon become dehydrated and die in poor weather conditions lambs may die of hypothermia the illness may last for up to 10 days and relapses after apparent recovery are common coccidiosis  eimeria sp coccidia are singlecell protozoa that are naturally in the sheeps digestive system young lambs are particularly susceptible to coccidia especially during periods of stress eg weaning coccidia damage the lining of the small intestine affecting absorption of nutrients the most common symptom of coccidiosis is diarrhea the diarrhea may be bloody or smeared with mucous the diagnosis of coccidiosis cannot be confirmed by identification of oocysts in fecal samples coccidosis is mostly a managementrelated disease caused by overstocking and poor hygiene coccidiosis can be prevented by including lasolocid bovatec® monensin rumensin® or decoquinate deccox® in the feed or mineral coccidiosis should be treated with amprolium or sulfa medications stomach worms  haemonchus trichostrongylus and ostertagia sp the internal parasites of greatest concern in sheep are usually the stomach worms with the barber pole worm  haemonchus contortus being of primary concern and the small brown stomach worm being of secondary concern the barber pole worm is a bloodsucking parasite that pierces the mucosa of the abomasum causing blood and protein loss the primary symptom of barber pole infection is anemia blood loss anemia can be observed in the sheep by examining its lower eyelid which will become paler whiter with increasing infestation an accumulation of fluid under the jaw called bottle jaw is also a telltale of barber pole infection the small brown stomach worm also burrows into the lining of the abomasum but it causes typical digestive symptoms especially diarrhea microscopically it is difficult to differentiate between the barber pole worm and the brown stomach worm the eggs only differ in size not appearance nematodirus spp the life cycle and transmission of nematodirus differs from that of other sheep worms infective n battus larvae generally dont survive for long on pasture when weather conditions are warm and dry but can survive for several months during cool and damp weather the symptoms of nematodirus are scours weight loss and sudden death tapeworms  moniezia sp there is disagreement as to whether tapeworms cause serious problems in sheep they are generally considered to be nonpathogenic though they can cause weight loss diarrhea and illthrift a heavy infestation may cause an intestinal blockage and result in death heavy infestations may also predispose lambs to enterotoxemia tapeworms infect mostly suckling lambs the only anthelmintics that are effective against tapeworms are the benzimadazoles fenbendazole and albendazole and praziquantel available extralabel in quest® plus or zimectrin® gold most research shows no benefit to treating lambs for tapeworms tapeworms are the only parasite that is visible in the feces and for this reason they tend to cause concern among producers read tapeworms problem or not lungworms lungworm larvae are passed in the feces but travel to the respiratory system once they enter the sheep system the symptoms of lung worm infection are not obvious unless the problem is severe lungworm infestations are most commonly diagnosed at necropsy or slaughter the same anthelmintics that are effective against stomach worms are also effective against lung worms liver flukes  fasciola hepatica liver flukes can be problematic in wet areas they are spread by snails and slugs as the name would suggest liver flukes damage the liver of the host animal they cause blood loss diarrhea weight loss and death the only drugs that are effective against liver flukes the adult form are clorsulon contained in ivomec® plus and albendazole valbazan® meningeal worm  paralaphostrongylus tenius deer worm brain worm the meningeal worm is a parasite of the white tail deer sheep goats llamas alpacas horses and other animals are abnormal hosts for the parasite after the host ingests the larvae the larvae travel to the spinal cord causing gait abnormalities and other neurological symptoms and eventually paralysis and death when the parasite reaches the sheeps brain it will kill them meningeal worm infection cannot be detected in the live animal when meningeal worm is suspected high doses of anthelmintics and antiinflammatory drugs are recommended infections can be prevented by limiting exposure to deer or by controlling snail populations since the parasite requires snails to complete its life cycle read meningeal worm johnes disease paratuberculosis johnes disease pronounced yo nees is a disease that affects the intestines of mostly ruminants it is most commonly observed in dairy cows but may also affect beef cattle sheep and goats it is caused by a hardy bacteria called mycobacterium paratuberculosis the strain that affects sheep is different than the one that affects cows though there is an intermediate strain that sheep are susceptible to while cattle experience diarrhea in sheep johnes tends to be more of a wasting disease control of the disease in infected flocks is difficult due to the lack of a reliable live animal test vaccination will reduce the number of clinical cases in a flock but will not prevent all animals from becoming infected colostrum from other sources cows goats could be a source of infection in sheep flocks the is no treatment for johnes disease download johnes disease q  a for sheep owners joint or navel ill joint ill occurs in lambs up to one month of age affected lambs are often lame in several joints usually limb joints including fetlocks knees hocks and stifles affected joints are hot and painful the lambs are dull feverish and clearly unthrifty some may have swollen infected navels while others may have symptoms of pneumonia or meningitis the infection is usually caused by strains of streptococci though coliforms and occasionally actinomyces pyogenes may be isolated affected lambs should be treated with a longacting penicillin joint ill is prevented by good hygiene and using a navel dip such as betadine or gentle iodine lameness it has been estimated that 80 percent of the flocks in great britain have lame sheep lameness can be a sign of several foot conditions – some of which are very serious – as well as some other problems these include foot rot and scald strawberry foot foot abscess footandmouth disease bluetongue ovine interdigital dermatitis looks like scald sore mouth arthritis nutritional deficiencies mineral excesses and physical injuries the more common foot problems can be avoided or minimized if good husbandry practices are followed regular hoof inspection and foot paring will prevent many problems download lameness in sheep laminitis founder lameness related to laminitis is caused by an inadequate flow of blood in the foot signs are heat in the feet laminitis is normally associated with digestive problems resulting from excessive intake of grain grain overloadacidosis which usually masks the effects on the feet such animals usually die before the feet become involved recovered animals may exhibit foot growth andor permanent lameness feeding management is key to the prevention of laminitisfounder listeriosis circling diseaselisteria monocytogenes the bacteria that causes listeriosis is widely distributed in nature and is found in soil feedstuffs and feces from healthy animals it is most commonly associated with the feeding of moldy silage or spoiled hay but because the organism lives naturally in the environment listeriosis may occur sporadically listeriosis usually presents itself as encephalitis inflammation of the brain but may also cause abortion in ewes sheep with the neurological form of the disease become depressed and disoriented they may walk in circles with a head tilt and facial paralysis mortality is high and treatment high doses of antibiotics is generally not effective mastitis hard bag blue bag mastitis is an inflammation or infection  of the mammary gland udder which is usually caused by a bacterial infection the bacteria that most commonly cause mastitis in ewes are staphylococcus aureus and pasteurella hemolytica there are two types of mastitis acute and chronic the glands of ewes with acute mastitis may be discolored and dark swollen and very warm the affected ewe may be reluctant to walk may hold up one rear foot and may not permit her lambs to nurse ewes with chronic mastitis often go undetected mastitis is usually treated with intramammary infusions of antibiotics systemic antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs there is no vaccine for mastitis it is best prevented by good management and sanitation heavy milkers are more prone to mastitis there is also a genetic component read mastitis in ewes and does measles sheep measles cysticerosis sheep measles  cysticercus ovis is the intermediate or larval stage of the cestode tapeworm taenia ovis the adult stage of which is found in the small intestine of dogs sheep host the larvae stage sheep measle lesions are found in the heart diaphragm and other muscles of sheep and goats although not considered to be a human health hazard carcasses can be condemned on account of sheep measles there are no clinical signs of cysticerosis in sheep currently diagnosis is only made by finding the cysts at slaughter to prevent sheep measles dogs and other canines should not be allowed to feed on sheep or goat carcasses dogs should be dewormed for tapeworms any dog given access to the farm should be required to be dewormed milk fever hypocalcemia parturient paresis milk fever is a metabolic disease affecting mostly pregnant ewes near term when calcium requirements are the highest it is most commonly caused by an inadequate intake of calcium but can also be caused by a ewes inability to mobilize calcium reserves prior to or after lambing milk fever presents similar symptoms as pregnancy toxemia but can be differentiated by the affected ewes response to calcium therapy ewes in the early stages of milk fever can be administered calcium gluconate subcutaneously more seriously affected ewes will require intravenous calcium and other supportive therapies milk fever can be prevented by providing proper levels of calcium in ewe diets especially during late gestation read milk fever strikes ovine progressive pneumonia opp lunger disease maedivisna ovine progressive pneumonia is a slow developing viral disease that is characterized by progressive weight loss difficulty in breathing and development of lameness paralysis and mastitis it is very closely related to caprine arthritisencephalitis virus cae and is caused by a retrovirus the opp virus closely resembles maedivisna which is a similar slow or retrovirus found in other parts of the world opp is transmitted laterally to other susceptible animals or to offspring through ingestion of infected milk and colostrum veterinary diagnostic laboratory assistance is required for diagnosis there is no treatment but opp can be eliminated from the herd using annual blood testing and removal of positive animals and removal of the lambs from the ewes prior to suckling it is estimated that over 50 of the flocks in the u s are infected with opp with the number of sheep infected within a positive flock anywhere between 1 to 70 however the vast majority of infected sheep will never show respiratory disease or a wasting syndrome pink eye infectious keratoconjunctivitis pinkeye is a highly contagious disease affecting the eyes of sheep pinkeye may result from many different infective agents chlamydia certain viruses and mycoplasma the disease will usually complete its course in three weeks in individual sheep the use of eye medications containing antibiotics may be helpful in individual cases there are no effective vaccines available as the agent that causes pinkeye in sheep and goats is different from the one that causes it in cattle read infectious keratoconjunctivitis pinkeye pizzle rot sheath rot pizzle rot is an infection in the sheath area of the ram it is caused by the bacteria corynebacterium renale or one from that group the other factor is high protein diets 16 percent ammonia produced by the excess urea in the rams urine can cause severe irritation and ulceration of the skin around the preputial opening the debris from the ulcer form a crust which may block the opening to the prepuce pizzle rot can affect a rams desire and ability to mate plant poisoning it is important to consider plant toxicities when diagnosing death losses many plants are toxic or potentially toxic to sheep some plants accumulate toxins during specific times of their growing cycle or after periods of environmental stress the incidence of plant poisoning in livestock tends to increase when normal forages are scarce causing animals to eat plants that they would not normally eat the signs of plant poisoning are as varied as the plants themselves and may mimic other diseases many poisonous plants cause sudden death some plants cause photosensitization a severe skin reaction other poisonous plants affect the nervous system some plant poisonings can be treated if signs are recognized early for many plant toxins there are no treatments pneumonia respiratory disease complex pasteurellosis shipping fever pneumonia is second in importance to diseases of the digestive tract pneumonia is a respiratory complex with no single agent being solely responsible for the disease the most common bacteria isolated from respiratory infections is pasteurella haemolytica or pasteurella multocida or both affected animals become depressed and go off feed they may cough and show some respiratory distress temperatures are usually over 104°f the disease may be acute with sudden deaths or take a course of several days pneumonia is treated with antibiotics polioencephalomalacia pem ccn polio cerebrocortical necrosis polioencephalomalacia is a disease of the central nervous system caused by a vitamin b1 thiamine deficiency since the rumen manufactures b vitamins polio is not caused by insufficient thiamine but rather the inability to utilize it the most common symptom of polio is blindness and stargazing polio most commonly occurs in lambs that are consuming high concentrate diets polio can also occur in sheep that consume plants that contain a thiamase inhibitor polio symptoms mimic other neurological disease conditions but a differential diagnosis can be made based on the animals response to injections of vitamin b1 polyarthritis polyarthritis is an infectious disease of nursing lambs recently weaned lambs and feedlot lambs symptoms are stiffness reluctance to move depression loss of body weight and conjunctivitis clinically the disease is primarily characterized by stiffness and by conjunctivitis body temperatures over 104°f are common lambs can be treated with several different broadspectrum antibiotics or tetracycline drugs pregnancy toxemia ketosis twin lamb disease lambing paralysis hypoglycemia pregnancy toxemia is a metabolic disease that affects ewes during late gestation it most commonly afflicts thin ewes overfat ewes older ewes andor ewes carrying multiple fetuses it is caused by an inadequate intake of energy during late pregnancy when the majority of fetal growth is occurring treatment is to increase the blood sugar supply to the body by administering glucose intravenously or propylene glycol or molasses orally in extreme cases removal of the fetuses is the only recourse to save the ewe and lambs pregnancy toxemia can be prevented by providing adequate energy to ewes during late gestation usually ½ to 1 lb of grain per head per day more for high producing ewes adequate feeder space is also necessary to ensure all ewes are able to consume enough feed read pregnancy toxemia in ewes and does rabies rabies is a viral disease of the central nervous system of mammals spread by contact with saliva from an infected animal usually through bites or scratches abrasions or open wounds in the skin domestic animals may become exposed during normal grazing or roaming sheep have symptoms similar to cattle and sometimes vigorously pull their wool livestock and horse owners may decide to vaccinate their animals if they are often exposed to potentially rabid wild or domestic animals generally production animals such as dairy cow herds and sheep flocks are not vaccinated because the potential risks are usually lower than the annual costs of vaccination and because human contact with individual animals is low small groups of valuable purebred animals may be an exception in recent years a few states have required vaccination for rabies before an animal including some livestock can be exhibited publicly rectal prolapse a rectal prolpase is protrusion of the rectal tissue through the exterior of the body it usually begins as a small round area that sticks out when the lamb lays down or coughs in extreme cases the intestines can pass through the opening and the disease can be fatal there are many predisposing factors to rectal prolapses including genetics short tail docks coughing weather stress and high concentrate diets rectal prolapses tend to occur more in ewe lambs than wether lambs and more in blackfaced sheep than whitefaced sheep the link between extreme tail docking and the incidence of rectal prolapses in grainfed lambs has been scientifically established usually lambs with prolapsed rectums are prematurely slaughtered or sent to market it is possible to repair a rectal prolapse by amputating the prolapsed part of the rectum these lambs should not be kept for breeding read rectal prolapses a complex problem with many contributing factors ringwomb ringwomb is when the cervix fails to dilate sufficiently to allow delivery of the lamb s while sometimes the cervix of affected ewes can be opened with gentle pressure or the injection of hormones usually such efforts prove futile and a caesarian section to remove the lambs is the only option that will produce a successful outcome unfortunately little is known about the cause of ringworm and how to prevent it there is some evidence to suggest that ringwomb has a genetic link ringworm club lamb fungus wool rot and lumpy wool club lamb fungus is a highly contagious fungal infection of the skin of sheep it is primarily a problem with show lambs that are frequently slick sheared club lamb fungus is caused by fungus of the genus trichophyton infection occurs when the fungus invades the skin and hair wool follicles fungal spores are transmitted by contaminated clippers blankets combs bedding bunks and pens lesions can appear anywhere however most are found on the head neck and back the infection is susceptible to antifungal agents club lamb fungus causes a nasty ringworm infection in people ryegrass staggers ryegrass staggers is a disease of grazing animals that causes muscle spasms loss of muscle control and paralysis it is caused by a group of toxins that accumulates in the leaf sheaths of perennial ryegrass the toxins are produced by a native fungus called ryegrass endophyte neotyphodium lolii that grows within the leaves stems and seeds of perennial ryegrass sheep and cattle are most commonly affected but horses aplaca and deer are also susceptible ryegrass staggers has not been recorded in goats affected animals have a stiff gait or are unable to walk they may injure or kill themselves in transit the toxins can induce high body temperatures thus animals will try to cool themselves younger animals tend to be worst affected the symptoms of ryegrass staggers usually develop 714 days after livestock stock start grazing the toxic parts of the plant prolonged exposure to toxic pasture can lead to permanent neurological damage scrapie scrapie is a fatal disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats it is spread from the dam to her offspring and other lambs and kids that come into contact with her birthing fluids placenta and bedding soiled with birthing fluids there is not treatment for scrapie affected animals always die while the occurrence of scrapie in the u s sheep flock is low it is a disease of regulatory concern this is because scrapie is a member of a family of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tges which also includes chronic wasting disease in mule deer and elk mad cow disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy and classic and new variant creutzfeldtjacobs disease in humans producers of breeding stock are encouraged to enrolled in the voluntary scrapie flock certification program which after five years of scrapiefree monitoring enables a flock to be certified scrapiefree furthermore while scrapie is not a genetic disease a sheeps genetic makeup influences its susceptibility to scrapie if exposed to the infective agent therefore sheep can be tested for scrapie resistance read an update on scrapie scrotal hernia a scrotal hernia is when the rams intestines slip through the inguinal rings into the scrotum the condition causes an enlargement of the scrotum scrotal hernias may be congenital or acquired they are thought to be caused by trauma it is not known if genetics plays a role while it may be possible to surgically repair a scrotal hernia a more practical option would be harvest them for meat obviously rams with scrotal hernias should not be used for breeding septic pedal arthritis septic pedal arthritis is a bacterial infection that usually gains entry to the distal interphalyngeal pedal joint from an interdigital legion which then tracks across the joint to discharge above the coronary band the foot is swollen with obvious widening of the interdigital space and a discharging sinus es above the coronary band in chronic cases there is considerable widening of the interdigital space and loss of hair around the coronary band chronic cases usually do not respond to antibiotic therapy digit amputation by a veterinarian is usually necessary soremouth contagious ecthyma scabby mouth pustular dermatitis orf soremouth is the most common skin disease affecting sheep and goats it is a highly contagious viral infection that can also produce painful human infections the virus causes scab formation on the skin usually around the mouth nostrils eyes mammary gland and vulva it first appears as tiny red nodules usually at the junction of the lips treatment is usually unrewarding the disease will usually run its course in 1 to 4 weeks effective vaccines are available the vaccine is applied to a woolless area in the inside of the ear or under a leg where it cannot spread to the mouths of other animals once the vaccine is used on the premises it should be continued yearly flocks that have not experienced soremouth should probably not vaccinate for soremouth since the vaccine introduces the virus to the farm read soremouth orf in sheep and goats spider syndrome spider lamb disease ovine hereditary chondrodysplasia spider syndrome is a genetic condition that results in lambs with severe malformations of the skeletal system these animals have very fine bone crooked legs and a crooked spinal column and a distinct lack of muscular development they usually do not survive to full maturity  the cause of the condition appears to be genetic alteration due to selection for extreme length and height in show sheep the disease is found predominantly in blackfaced lambs 75 suffolk and 25 hampshire in order to have this disease lambs must inherit a recessive gene from each parent several labs offer genetic testing for spider lamb disease urinary calculi water belly urolithiasis calculosis urinary calculi is a metabolic disease of wethers and rams characterized by the formation of calculi stones within the urinary tract blockage of the urethra by calculi causes retention of urine abdominal pain distention and rupture of the urethra or bladder the most common cause of urinary calculi is feeding rations with high phosphorus levels grain products tend to be very high in phosphorus relative to calcium whereas forages especially legumes have a much more desirable ratio the ratio of calcium to phosphorus in the ration should be at least 21 providing the proper balance of minerals in the ration is preferred to offering minerals free choice since there is no guarantee animals will consume adequate amounts of free choice mineral the addition of ammonium chloride to the ration will aid in preventing urinary calculi it is also important that animals have an ample supply of clean potable water the addition of salt to the ration will increase water intake and decrease stone formation read urinary calculi in sheep and goats uterine prolapse a uterine prolapse is when the womb uterus is turned inside out and pushed through the birth canal by abdominal strainings of the ewe it may occur immediately after lambing or several days later a uterine prolapse is a lifethreatening condition before the prolapsed uterus is be manually forced back into the ewe the ewes hindquarters should be raised the uterus should be cleaned with a warm soapy disinfectant solution prior to replacement and should be replaced before the tissues become dry or chilled pouring water into the uterus will help to ensure that the tips of the horns are unfolded affected ewes should be given antibiotics and oxytocin unlike ewes that prolapse their vaginas it is okay to keep a ewe that has prolapsed her uterus vaginal prolapse vaginal prolapses protrusion of the vagina are most commonly observed during the last month of pregnancy or shortly after lambing many factors have been implicated in the cause of vaginal prolapse such as hormonalmetabolic imbalances overfatoverthin body condition bulky feeds lack of exercise dystocia in previous pregnancies increased abdominal pressure and fetal burden prolapses often recur in subsequent pregnancies the exposed vagina of affected ewes should be washed with soapy disinfectant solution and forced back into the ewe a bearing retainer or spoon can be inserted and secured in the ewe to prevent further prolapsing in a ewe that has lambed sutures are used to secure the prolapse affected ewes and their offspring should probably not be kept in the flock for breeding animals due to the possibly hereditary nature of the problem white muscle disease wmd nutritional muscular dystrophy nutritional myopathy stiff lamb disease white muscle disease is a degeneration of the skeletal and cardiac muscles of lambs it is caused by a deficiency of selenium vitamin e or both and can be a problem wherever selenium levels in the soil are low or the diet is deficient in selenium symptoms are stiffness of the hind legs with an arched back and tucked in flanks treatment is the administration of selenium and vitamin e by injection feed rations should be evaluated to determine if they are providing adequate levels of selenium and vitamin e if dietary levels of selenium are inadequate lambs can be given an injection of selenium and vitamin e shortly at birth dietary supplementation of selenium is usually preferred to selenium injections read white muscle disease in
