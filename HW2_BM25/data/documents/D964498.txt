disease exotropia is a type of eye misalignment where one eye deviates outward the deviation may be constant or intermittent and the deviating eye may always be one eye or may alternate between the two eyes types physiologic a high percentage of normal people display a small exophoria on clinical examination but is within normal limits and of no concern newborn infants often have transient exodeviations that resolve by 24 months of age congenital exotropia this is an exodeviation often constant with an onset in the first six months of life which is nonresolving there is an increased incidence with cerebral palsy and other neurologic disorders craniofacial disorders and ocular albinism sensory exotropia a blind or poorly seeing eye may drift outward infants or young children with a blind or poorly seeing eye usually develop esotropia crosseyes but in children older than 24 years of age and adults the eye will typically become exotropic intermittent exotropia this is the most common type onset is in childhood there are 3 subtypes which will be discussed later in this article convergence insufficiency this type is often first noted in older children and teenagers f consecutive exotropia a person who was formerly esotropic becomes exotropic in some cases this occurs from a surgical overcorrection of the esotropia etiology the etiology of exotropia is unknown but on a rudimentary level there is impaired ability to maintain fusion and alignment in the case of sensory exotropia the poor acuity of one eye is the cause of the inability to maintain alignment risk factors neurologic disorders prematurity and a family history of strabismus all increase the risk of having exotropia general pathology intermittent exotropia the most common type of exotropia has a usual onset between infancy and 7 years of age there is no specific refractive error associated with exotropia although there is no specific racial predilection asians with strabismus are more often exotropic when compared to other racial groups symptoms symptoms may be mild or severe if suppression of the deviating eye occurs the patient can have diminished binocular vision and stereopsis those with later onset and milder frequency deviations can experience diplopia asthenopia can also occur with reading diagnosis physiologic a newborn with a clinical exodeviation resolving by 24 months of age many normal adults will display a small exophoria on alternatecover testing but have no symptoms congenital exotropia is an exotropia with an onset during the first 6 months of life which is usually constant and does not resolve spontaneously sensory exotropia usually is an exotropia which develops in an older child or adult with one poorly seeing eye intermittent exotropia is an intermittent deviation which is more likely to be manifest when fatigued ill or in a lowered mental state ex etoh use it is more commonly manifest with distance fixation and also in bright sunlight types of intermittent exotropia basic distance and near deviations are within 10 prism diopters units of measurement of each other these patients have normal convergence pseudodivergence excess a larger exotropia is present for distance but this difference is extinguished after 3060 minutes of monocular occlusion these patients have increased tonic fusional convergence true divergence excess a larger exotropia is present for distance even after 3060 minutes of monocular occlusion more than ½ of these patients have a high aca ratio and are prone to postoperative overcorrections if operated on for their full distance deviation convergence insufficiency deviation is worse at near and the patient has an abnormal near point of convergence f consecutive exotropia the patient has a history of esotropia treated with glasses or surgery and subsequently converts to displaying an exodeviation physical examination pertinent ophthalmological examination features for a person with exotropia visual acuity binocular function and stereopsis motility evaluation strabismus measurements near distance extreme distance and cardinal positions measures of fusional amplitudes cycloplegic refraction in some cases strabismus measurements after prolonged monocular occlusion and with 300 near add test evaluation of anterior and posterior ocular structures differential diagnosis exotropia is not a disease entity by itself it is a motility disturbance other conditions can display exotropia duane’s syndrome 3rd nerve palsy slipped or lost medial rectus muscle internuclear ophthalmoplegia orbital fibrosis management nonsurgical effectiveness of these therapies varies and in some cases they are only temporizing nonsurgical treatments include patching overminused spectacles and convergence exercises for convergence insufficiency prism glasses can be used to relieve diplopic complaints or asthenopia also some cases of exotropia may be improved by treating an underlying visual disturbance ex cataract refractive error amblyopiasurgical performed to preserve or restore binocular function also may be performed for relief of diplopia andor cosmesis in general longterm surgical success is better if the exotropia is intermittent instead of constant and the patient has better binocular function at the time of surgery there is controversy as to the optimal time for surgical intervention surgery consists of operating on the extraocular muscles additional resources aapos website  frequently asked questions topicexotropia references1 wright kw spiegel ph pediatric ophthalmology and
