when does lent start  end 20150 shares 8 comments by lauren weigle feb 6 2015 at 731am the first day of lent is ash wednesday and for 2015 the date is february 18th ash wednesday marks the beginning of lent which is the when christians prepare for the celebration of easter which is on april 5 2015 lent is believed to be a time for sacrificing as it’s the season of penance and prayer which is why many fast give up meat or rid themselves of delicious treats it’s almost looked at as a sort of “springcleaning” for your life project britain explains the christian church no longer imposes a strict fast lent is a time when some christians try to overcome their own faults because they believe that it was man’s sin which led jesus to be crucified some christians try to follow the example of jesus in the desert by giving up luxuries and practicing selfdiscipline and they try to put aside more time to prayer and religious acts so that they can really let god into their lives so how are the days of lent calculated about religioncom reports lent the period of prayer and fasting in preparation for easter is 40 days long but there are 46 days between ash wednesday the first day of lent in the roman catholic liturgical calendar and easter … since all sundays—and not simply easter sunday—were days to celebrate christ’s resurrection christians were forbidden to fast and do other forms of penance on those days therefore when the church expanded the period of fasting and prayer in preparation for easter from a few days to 40 days to mirror christ’s fasting in the desert before he began his public ministry sundays could not be included in the count lent ends on holy saturday which is the day before easter so this year it ends on april 4 2015 because easter occurs on a different date each year so does lent read more from heavy passover 2015 recipes unleavened bread  matzo for seder dinner read more from heavy what is lent read more religion8 comments8 comments janet february 16th 2015i give up £1 each day for the duration of lent on easter sunday i give what i’ve saved to my granddaughter mi february 6th 2015good to knowsee more comments discuss on facebook
