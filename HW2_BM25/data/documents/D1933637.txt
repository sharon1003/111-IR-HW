2 measurement process characterization21 characterization211 what are the issues for characterization2113 bias and accuracy definition of accuracy and bias accuracy is a qualitative term referring to whether there is agreement between a measurement made on an object and its true target or reference value bias is a quantitative term describing the difference between the average of measurements made on the same object and its true value in particular for a measurement laboratory bias is the difference generally unknown between a laboratorys average value over time for a test item and the average that would be achieved by the reference laboratory if it undertook the same measurements on the same test item depiction of bias and unbiased measurements unbiased measurements relative to the target biased measurements relative to the target identification of bias bias in a measurement process can be identified by calibration of standards andor instruments by a reference laboratory where a value is assigned to the clients standard based on comparisons with the reference laboratorys standards check standards where violations of the control limits on a control chart for the check standard suggest that recalibration of standards or instruments is needed measurement assurance programs where artifacts from a reference laboratory or other qualified agency are sent to a client and measured in the clients environment as a blind sample interlaboratory comparisons where reference standards or materials are circulated among several laboratories reduction of bias bias can be eliminated or reduced by calibration of standards andor instruments because of costs and time constraints the majority of calibrations are performed by secondary or tertiary laboratories and are related to the reference base via a chain of intercomparisons that start at the reference laboratory bias can also be reduced by corrections to inhouse measurements based on comparisons with artifacts or instruments circulated for that purpose reference materials caution errors that contribute to bias can be present even where all equipment and standards are properly calibrated and under control temperature probably has the most potential for introducing this type of bias into the measurements for example a constant heat source will introduce serious errors in dimensional measurements of metal objects temperature affects chemical and electrical measurements as well generally speaking errors of this type can be identified only by those who are thoroughly familiar with the measurement technology the reader is advised to consult the technical literature and experts in the field for guidance
