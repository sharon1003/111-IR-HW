leastsquares regression method leastsquares linear regression is a statistical technique that may be used to estimate the total cost at the given level of activity units labormachine hours etc based on past cost data it mathematically fits a straight cost line over a scatterchart of a number of activity and totalcost pairs in such a way that the sum of squares of the vertical distances between the scattered points and the cost line is minimized the term leastsquares regression implies that the ideal fitting of the regression line is achieved by minimizing the sum of squares of the distances between the straight line and all the points on the graph assuming that the cost varies along yaxis and activity levels along xaxis the required cost line may be represented in the form of following equationy  a  bx in the above equation a is the yintercept of the line and it equals the approximate fixed cost at any level of activity whereas b is the slope of the line and it equals the average variable cost per unit of activity formulas by using mathematical techniques beyond the scope of this article the following formulas to calculate a and b may be derived where n is number of pairs of units—totalcost used in the calculation σy is the sum of total costs of all data pairs σx is the sum of units of all data pairs σxy is the sum of the products of cost and units of all data pairs and σx 2 is the sum of squares of units of all data pairs the following example based on the same data as in highlow method tries to illustrate the usage of least squares linear regression method to split a mixed cost into its fixed and variable components example based on the following data of number of units produced and the corresponding total cost estimate the total cost of producing 4000 units use the leastsquares linear regression method month units cost1 1520 363752 1250 380003 1750 417504 1600 423605 2350 550806 2100 481007 3000 590008 2750 56800solutionx y x 2 xy1520 36375 2310400 552900001250 38000 1562500 475000001750 41750 3062500 730625001600 42360 2560000 677760002350 55080 5522500 1294380002100 48100 4410000 1010100003000 59000 9000000 1770000002750 56800 7562500 15620000016320 377465 35990400 807276500we have n  8 σx  16320 σy  377465 σx 2  35990400 and σxy  807276500calculating the average variable cost per unit calculating the approximate total fixed cost the costvolume formula now becomesy  19015  138x at 4000 activity level the estimated total cost is 74215  19015  138 × 4000 written by irfanullah jan
