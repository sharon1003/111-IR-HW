saturn moon has tropical great salt lake methane marshes titan has equatorial oasis as large as utah landmark nasa craft hints an artists impression of a hydrocarbon lake on saturns moon titan illustration by detlev van ravenswaay picture pressgetty images published june 14 2012saturn s hazy moon titan has a huge tropical lake and marshes of liquid methane near its equator suggest surprising new images from a nasa spacecraft related content once written off for dead the aral sea is now full of life why does florida keep getting sinkholes why this lake keeps catching on fire titan is the only moon in the solar system to host a significant atmosphere—a roiling haze of organic molecules which some scientists think might include the ingredients for life as we know it its also the only object in the solar system other than earth to have bodies of liquid on its surface—previous data from nasas cassini orbiter revealed hundreds of lakes near the frigid moons poles with surface temperatures hovering around 297 degrees fahrenheit 183 degrees celsius titan is far too cold to have liquid water instead the lakes are filled with liquid hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane see methane rain formed new lake on saturn moon now for the first time cassini images show dark regions that appear to be pools of hydrocarbons around the moons equator we detect evidence for the presence of a tropical lake with an area of 2400 square kilometers 927 square miles—as large as the great salt lake in utah—with a depth of at least a meter three feet said study leader caitlin griffith a planetary scientist at the university of arizona in tucson our work also suggests the existence of a handful of smaller and shallower ponds similar to marshes on earth with knee to anklelevel depths oases of liquid methane based on the polar lakes and other evidence scientists think methane—the main component of natural gas—might play a similar role as water on earth cycling between the atmosphere and the surface but until now titans lower latitudes were thought to be dry filled mostly with rippling sand dunes scientists had previously seen only hints of moistness in titans tropical areas for instance in 2004 the european huygens lander set down near the moons equator and captured views of what appeared to be rain runoff in addition later cassini images turned up evidence of storms in this supposedly parched region see spring rains darken saturns moon titan still griffith and colleagues think the newfound lakes cant be explained by rainfall since a number of circulation models say that significant bodies of liquid shouldnt be stable at the moons tropics based on precipitation alone any liquid deposited in the tropical surface evaporates quickly and eventually is transported by titans circulation to the poles where the large polar lakes appear griffith said lakes at the poles are easy to explain but lakes in the tropics are not one possibility griffith said is that our detection of tropical lakes suggests that a subterranean source of methane may flood the surface and dampen the ground in essence creating oases on titan related saturn moon has surprisingly slushy insides tropical lakes feed methane cycle while its unclear how long the tropical lakes might stay on titans surface planetary scientist oded aharonson agrees that their most likely source would be subterranean the possibility of persistent liquid bodies in the low latitudes  would point to an active subsurface hydrology on titan said aharonson of the california institute of technology who was not part of the study team in fact aharonson thinks the tropical lakes could be the longsought global source of liquid hydrocarbons on titan—the region where the compounds first bubble up to the surface to feed the moons methane cycle see is saturn moons haze old enough for life if the equatorial regions have subsurface methane emerging to the surface he said that would be a viable source the tropical lakes on titan are described in this weeks issue of the journal nature
