steak diane valentines day is less than a week away and it was about time that i got to trying some recipes out to make sure that it is perfect on a special day like valentines day it is nice to splurge and to be a bit decadent and i had had the idea of doing a steak with a nice cut of beef for a while in addition to getting some nice ingredients for your special meal you can be adventurous with the cooking techniques like in this recipe for steak diane where the brandy in the pan sauce is ignited i decided to go with filet mignon for the cut of beef for this special occasion but you can easily go with your favourite cut for steaks the trick to cooking a perfectly mediumrare steak in a pan of to cook it at a higher temperature and only give it one to two minutes per side the beef is going to stick to the pan when you add it but it will release once it has gotten that nice crispy seared bottom and that is when you know that it is ready to flip once you have removed the steaks form the pan you start making the tasty pan sauce with shallots garlic thyme and mushrooms which are quickly cooked before adding a healthy dose of brandy the brandy is then ignited and when the flames die out you build up the sauce with stock and cream all the while making sure to deglaze the pan scraping up all of those flavour packed brown bits that have collected on the bottom of the pan the steak and mushroom combo is one of my favourites and with this super tasty creamy mustard and brandy sauce this dish is definitely a winner that can confidently be served for any special occasion i served the steak diane simply on a bed of peas that soaked up any of the sauce that spilled over along with a side of fennel gratin get all 10 closet cooking e cookbooks in a bundle for 70 off enjoy some of the tastiest recipes from closet cooking along with exclusive cookbook recipesget the cookbook bundle nowsteak diane prep time 10 minutes cook time 10 minutes total time 20 minutes servings 2perfectly cooked mediumrare filet mignon in a mustard and brandy pan sauce with mushroomsingredients2 4 ounce filet mignon medallionssalt and pepper to taste1 tablespoon butter2 shallots finely diced1 clove garlic chopped12 teaspoon thyme chopped1 cup cremini mushrooms sliced14 cup brandy or cognac2 teaspoons dijon mustard14 cup heavy cream14 cup veal or beef stock2 teaspoons worcestershire sauce1 tablespoon parsley choppeddirections season the beef with salt and pepper melt the butter in a pan over mediumhigh heat add the beef and sear for 12 minutes on each side and set aside add the shallots garlic and thyme and saute for 20 seconds add the mushrooms and saute until tender about 2 minutes add the brandy and carefully ignite add the mustard and cream and mix while cooking for a minute add the veal broth deglaze the pan and simmer for another minute add the worcestershire sauce parsley and any juices that collected under the beef to the pan and remove from heat divide the beef and sauce between two plates and enjoy similar recipes double smoked bacon wrapped filet mignon with caramelized mushrooms topped with blue cheese steak tenderloin in a mushroom and blue cheese sauce steak tenderloin in pink peppercorn sauce steak tenderloin in a green peppercorn sauce grilled apple bbq pork medallions mushroom and peppercorn crusted steak in a creamy brie mushroom sauce steak stroganoff pot roast beef stroganoff salisbury steak with mushroom gravy pan seared steaks with sauteed mushrooms and roasted garlic gorgonzola butter does this recipe look tasty never miss a new recipe subscribe to the newsletter and get a free copy of the e book the best of closet cookingemail posted by kevin lynch thursday february 9 2012 at 648 pm 30 comments labels 20 minute meals  30 minute meals  beef  food  glutenfree  main course  mushroom  recipe
