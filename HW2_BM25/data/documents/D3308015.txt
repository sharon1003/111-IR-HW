· june 2007 with 10173 reads doi 101016jcep200608004cite this publication george awuah2094 mars petcarehosahalli s ramaswamy4601 mc gill university a economides abstract the food processing industry has matured over the years with an impressive record on safety and a vibrant marketplace for new product development consumer demands for highquality products has inspired researchers and the food industry to explore alternative methods as replacement for traditional processing methods the food industry is poised to adopt cost effective technologies that offer better quality and safe products given the impressive safety record associated with traditional systems one may be tempted to conclude that there is little room for advancement and innovation to meet current consumer demands process optimization will continue to evolve to enhance quality and overall energy utilization either in traditional or novel systems the need for efficient operations will certainly drive system automation control and monitoring systems that can handle complex mathematical routines in realtime such systems would certainly require vigorous validation and verification for industry to embrace them it truly sounds illogical for industry to reevaluate existing process schedules based on studies that demonstrate nonlinearity of survival curves however the need to optimize quality and operating costs could potentially prompt reevaluating existing systems to capture additional benefits new processing concepts such as the application of variable retort temperature have received attention from processing experts and promises to improve both the economy and quality of thermally processed foods do you want to read the rest of this article request fulltext citations  157 citations  157references  144

innocua in milk using radio frequency rf heatin december 2005 · innovative food science  emerging technologies using a 2 k w 2712 mhz rf heater studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of rf heating in inactivating surrogates of both listeria and escherichia coli cells in milk under continuous flow conditions depending on product residence time and rf power level rf heating was found to be capable of inactivating both listeria and e coli in milk with e coli being the more heat show full abstractread more article nonlinear constrained optimization of thermal processing ii variable
