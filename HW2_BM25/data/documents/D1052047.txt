serve it becomes whitegreen in the middle part of the inner fruit owing to its taste size shelflife high growing yield and in some areas yearround harvesting the hass cultivar is the most commercially

seedlings propagated from a single tree which was grown from a seed bought by rudolph hass in 1926 from a r rideout of whittier california at the time rideout was getting seeds from any source he could find even restaurant food scraps the cultivar this seed came from is not known and may already have been crosspollinated when hass bought it 1 2in 1926 at his 15 acre grove at 430 west road la habra heights california hass planted three seeds he had bought from rideout which yielded one strong seedling 1 after trying and failing at least twice to graft the seedling with branches from fuerte avocado trees the leading commercial cultivar at the time hass thought of cutting it down but a professional grafter named caulkins told him the young tree was sound and strong so he let it be when the tree began bearing odd bumpy fruit his children liked the taste as the trees yields grew bigger hass easily sold what his family didnt eat to coworkers at the post office 1 2 the hass avocado had one of its first commercial successes at the model grocery store on colorado street in pasadena california where chefs working for some of the towns wealthy residents bought the new cultivars big nuttytasting fruit for 1 each a very high price at the time equivalent to 14 in 2017 hass patented the tree in 1935 the first us patent on a tree 1 and made a contract with whittier nurseryman harold brokaw to grow and sell grafted seedlings propagated from its cuttings 1 2 with brokaw getting 75 of the proceeds brokaw then specialized in the hass and often sold out of grafted seedlings since unlike the fuerte hass yields are yearround and also more plentiful with bigger fruit a longer shelf life and richer flavor owing to higher oil content 1 2 however hass made a profit of less than us 5000 through the patent because cuttings from single trees sold by brokaw were then propagated to graft whole orchards 1rudolph hass carried on as a postman throughout his life and died of a heart attack at fallbrook hospital in fallbrook california in 1952 the same year his patent expired and not long after he had established a new 80acre 320000 m 2 orchard 1 2by the early 21st century the us avocado industry took in over 1 billion a year from the heavybearing high quality hass cultivar which accounted for around 80 of all avocados grown worldwide 2fate of mother tree  editowing to later suburban sprawl in southern california the mother tree stood for many years in front of a residence in la habra heights the tree died when it was 76 years old and was cut down on 11 september 2002 after a tenyear fight with phytophthora root rot which often kills avocado trees 6 two plaques by the private residence at 426 west road mark the spot where it grew the wood was stored in a tree nursery and from this stock a nephew of rudolph hass dick stewart 7 made keepsakes jewelry and other gifts 1 2 from 2010 to 2013 in midmay the city of la habra heights celebrated the hass avocado at its annual la habra heights avocado festival 8 9bearing pattern  edithass avocado trees like some other cultivars may only bear well every other year after a year with low yield often because of cold for which the tree does not have much tolerance yields may be very high the next year however the heavy crop can deplete stored carbohydrates lowering the following seasons yield and this can set the tree into a lifelong alternate bearing pattern southern california hass avocado groves have good soil and drainage plentiful sunlight and cool gentle winds from the oceans which help the fruit grow these conditions hold throughout the year so there are always fresh harvests of hass avocados in southern california 10nutritional value  editlike all avocados hass avocados are high in healthy fats
