these programs tend to focus on nursing courses where students learn better leadership skills what certification will i need after completing your degree program you’ll need to take the national council licensure examination nclex in order to sit for the exam you’ll need to apply for a nursing license from your state board of nursing since each state has different eligibility criteria check with your state board to ensure you’ve met the requirements in order to take the exam the nclex exam covers four “categories of needs” according to the national council of state boards of nursing safe

about a year but some can be as short as seven months with others lasting 24 months are online programs available community colleges and vocational schools offer lpnlvn programs many of which are online if you enroll in an online program you will most likely do your clinical work at a local hospital coordinated by the school how much will my education cost tuition for lpnlvn programs usually start at the 2000 range financial aid and grants are often offered by many of the schools making it easier to pay for your education if you decide in the future to go back to school to become an rn or to earn your bachelor’s degree many schools will give you credit for lpn coursework saving you time and if you’ve racked up some lpnlvn work experience some schools will allow you to test out of certain classes saving you money are there prerequisites lpnlvn programs at community colleges and vocational schools require candidates to have a high school diploma or equivalent some schools and programs will also require candidates to pass an entrance exam so it’s a good idea to confirm this when applying to programs what accreditation is there for my program accreditation is a definitive way to know if a program meets nationallyrecognized nursing education standards independent accrediting organizations register schools once they’ve undergone a rigorous application process because these organizations stay up to date on state governments and health departments they know whether a school or program provides the necessary training to an lpnlvn student in their respective state for students accreditation can help with financial aid eligibility earning a degree at one accredited school also allows a student to pursue further education at other accredited schools plus if you move to another state training from an accredited school can make getting a new license easier a quick tip accreditation isn’t earned and maintained in perpetuity accreditations are usually given for a certain amount of time usually between 5 and 10 years and are different for each school it’s a good idea to check with your potential program about the length of time it’s accredited for main accrediting bodies the accreditation commission for education in nursing acen formerly nlnac accredits the entire spectrum of nursing programs associate’s diploma bachelor’s and master’sthe commission on collegiate nursing education ccne this body accredits bachelor’s and master’s nursing programs it’s important to point out that the ccne doesn’t accredit lpnlvn programs so you’ll want to look for programs with a seal of approval from nlnac and one more thing state boards of nursing approve schools so they can prepare students for the national council licensure examination nclex however state board approval does not automatically equal school accreditation from one of the national organizations while most accredited schools are state boardapproved it’s always a good idea to check nonaccredited schools if you’re thinking of attending a nonaccredited but state boardapproved school there can be drawbacks while you can still take the nclex your nursing profession may stall out if you’re seeking additional education generally education from a nonaccredited school doesn’t qualify students to attend an accredited school
