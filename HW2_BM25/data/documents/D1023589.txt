a defining performance targets and tasks although objective assessments are very common in k12 classrooms and on standardized tests there are many critics who feel objective assessments do not adequately assess student learning whereas it is quite easy to measure students knowledge about a subject using a multiplechoice quiz objective assessments do not indicate whether or not the student can apply that knowledge for example a student may perform well on a mathematics quiz but be unable to make correct change performance assessments have the advantage of being able to provide clear evidence of students achievements in addition they are useful for a wide range of classroom activities including essays science projects public speaking and multimedia projects performance assessment is an excellent method for addressing skills at the higher levels of blooms taxonomy watch the video assessment for understanding from the edutopia website edutopiaorg to review some of the advantages and applications of performance assessment urban academy lo bandwidth hi bandwidth the first step in creating a performance assessment is defining the target  determining what is it you are going to assess this can generally be accomplished by reviewing the standards and objectives for example the following benchmarks clearly require assessments other than objective quizzes language arts 35 responds to speakers by asking questions making contributions and paraphrasing what is said science 35 determines that the properties of materials eg density and volume can be compared and measured eg using rulers balances and thermometers visual arts 68 creates twodimensional and threedimensional works of art that reflect competency and craftsmanship gained from the visual arts that can enhance and deepen understanding of life mathematics 68 constructs interprets and uses scale drawings such as those based on number lines and maps to solve realworld problems language arts 912 writes text notes outlines comments and observations that demonstrate comprehension and synthesis of content processes and experiences from a variety of media after the target is defined the next step is to create a task that will allow the students to demonstrate their knowledge reasoning skills andor attitudes these tasks should be authentic realworld feasible in time space and cost fair not biased based on gender race etc  flexible allow multiple outcomes and observable for example the performance task may be that students conduct a science experiment create a clay sculpture or write a position paper that advocates a change in the school dress code after the task is defined a rubric can be developed to assess the task
