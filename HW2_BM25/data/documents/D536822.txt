study h armstrong robertsclassic stock getty imagesby andrew zimmerman jones updated november 03 2017physics is a diverse area of study in order to make sense of it scientists have been forced to focus their attention on one or two smaller areas of the discipline this allows them to become experts in that narrow field without getting bogged down in the sheer volume of knowledge that exists regarding the natural world the fields of physics explore this list of different types of physics ac oustics the study of sound and sound waves in this field you study mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids it includes applications for seismic waves shock and vibration noise music communication hearing underwater sound and atmospheric sound in this way it encompasses earth sciences life sciences engineering and the arts astronomy the study of space this includes planets stars galaxies deep space and the universe it is one of the oldest sciences it uses mathematics physics and chemistry to understand everything outside of the earths atmosphere astrophysics the study of the physical properties of objects in space today this term is often used interchangeably with astronomy and many astronomers have physics degrees atomic physics the study of atoms specifically the electron properties of the atom as distinct from nuclear physics which considers the nucleus alone in practice research groups usually study atomic molecular and optical physics biophysics the study of physics in living systems at all levels from individual cells and microbes to animals plants and entire ecosystems there is overlap with biochemistry nanotechnology and bioengineering an example is deriving the structure of dna from xray crystallography topics can include bioelectronics nanomedicine quantum biology structural biology enzyme kinetics electrical conduction in neurons radiology and microscopy chaos the study of systems with strong sensitivity to initial conditions so a slight change at the beginning quickly become major changes in the system it is an element of quantum physics and useful in celestial mechanics chemical physics the study of physics in chemical systems it focuses on using physics to understand complex phenomena at a variety of scales from the molecule to a biological system you may study nanostructures or chemical reaction dynamics computational physics the application of numerical methods to solve physical problems for which a quantitative theory already exists cosmology the study of the universe as a whole including its origins and evolution this is getting back to the big bang and how the universe will continue to change cryophysics  cryogenics  low temperature physics the study of physical properties in lowtemperature situations far below the freezing point of water crystallography the study of crystals and crystalline structures electromagnetism the study of electrical and magnetic fields which are two aspects of the same phenomenon electronics the study of the flow of electrons generally in a circuit fluid dynamics  fluid mechanics the study of the physical properties of fluids specifically defined in this case to be liquids and gases geophysics the study of the physical properties of the earth high energy physics the study of physics in extremely high energy systems generally within particle physics high pressure physics the study of physics in extremely highpressure systems generally related to fluid dynamics laser physics the study of the physical properties of lasers mathematical physics applying mathematically rigorous methods to solving problems within physics mechanics the study of the motion of bodies in a frame of reference meteorology  weather physics the physics of the weather molecular physics the study of physical properties of molecules nanotechnology the science of building circuits and machines from single molecules and atoms nuclear physics the study of the physical properties of the atomic nucleus optics  light physics the study of the physical properties of light particle physics the study of fundamental particles and the forces of their interaction plasma physics the study of matter in the plasma phase quantum electrodynamics the study of how electrons and photons interact at the quantum mechanical level quantum mechanics  quantum physics the study of science where the smallest discrete values or quanta of matter and energy become relevant quantum optics the application of quantum physics to light quantum field theory the application of quantum physics to fields including the fundamental forces of the universe quantum gravity the application of quantum physics to gravity and unification of gravity with the other fundamental particle interactions relativity the study of systems displaying the properties of einsteins theory of relativity which generally involves moving at speeds very close to the speed of light statistical mechanics the study of large systems by statistically expanding the knowledge of smaller systems string theory  superstring theory the study of the theory that all fundamental particles are vibrations of onedimensional strings of energy in a higherdimensional universe thermodynamics the physics of heat it should become obvious that there is some overlap for example the difference between astronomy astrophysics and cosmology can be virtually meaningless at times to everyone that is except the astronomers astrophysicists and cosmologists who can take the distinctions very seriously edited by anne marie helmenstine ph dcite
