tanking slurry the ka tanking slurry waterproofing system provides a solution to water leakage ingress or seepage in concrete structures or any cementitious substrate the formation and development of insoluble crystals into water bearing capillaries and fissures effectively blocks the further passage of water and ensures permanent water tightness for the life of the structure the ka system is designed to function against water penetration in various conditions ka tanking slurry is supplied as a powder and when mixed with water is applied directly to concrete blockwork masonry or cement renders in areas where general waterproofing is required ka tanking slurry is used in conjunction with ka super plug for instant leak plugging ka tanking slurry can be applied to new or old structurally sound surfaces it can be applied either to the negative or the positive side and will negate dampness in ground water permeation even under hydrostatic pressure ka tanking slurry can be used for the following applications• retaining walls and columns in reservoirs • swimming pools prior to tiling or painting • concrete drinking water tanks • water treatment and sewerage plants • foundation slabs • underground cellars basement car parks garages etc • prestressed and precast concrete units • tunnels silos irrigation channels • bathrooms kitchens etc • lift shafts • vehicle maintenance pits wras approval number 1603503 labc registered detail technical data material safety data sheets declaration of performance ukas accredited testing displaying performance under a pressure of 7 bar
