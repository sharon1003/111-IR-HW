global assembly cache from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search the global assembly cache  gac is a machinewide cli assembly cache for the common language infrastructure cli in microsofts  net framework the approach of having a specially controlled central repository addresses the flaws  citation needed in the shared library concept and helps to avoid pitfalls of other solutions that led to drawbacks like dll hell contents  hide 1 requirements2 usage21 global assembly cache tool22 assembly cache viewer3 example of use4 implementation5 pitfalls6 see also7 references8 external links requirements  editassemblies residing in the gac must adhere to a specific versioning scheme which allows for sidebyside execution of different code versions specifically such assemblies must be strongly named usage  editthere are two ways to interact with the gac the global assembly cache tool gacutilexe and the assembly cache viewer shfusiondll global assembly cache tool  editgacutilexe is an older commandline utility that shipped with  net 11 and is still available with the  net sdk 1one can check the availability of a shared assembly in gac by using the commandgacutilexe l assembly nameone can register a shared assembly in the gac by using the commandgacutilexe i assembly nameor by copying an assembly file into the following locationwindirassemblynote that for  net 40 the gac location is nowwindirmicrosoft netassemblyother options for this utility will be briefly described if you use the  flag ie gacutilexe  assembly cache viewer  editthe newer interface the assembly cache viewer is integrated into windows explorer 2 browsing windirassembly for example cwindowsassembly or windirmicrosoft netassembly displays the assemblies contained in the cache along with their versions culture public key token and processor architecture assemblies are installed by dragging and dropping and uninstalled by selecting and pressing the delete key or using the context menu with the launch of the  net framework 4 the assembly cache viewer shell extension is obsolete 3example of use  edita computer has two cli assemblies both named assembly a but one is version 10 and the other is version 20 since it is required that both be compiled to a file named assembly a they cannot exist in the same directory within the fat32 file system instead the virtual file system of the gac can be used by programs that need to use each version of the assembly specifically implementation  editthe gac as a construct does not actually exist within the windows os it is implemented and managed by the cli the folders within systemroot named assembly and microsoft netassembly for  net 40 contain all globally available assemblies with managed filenames so that the version and public key tokens can be included each version can therefore exist within the same location and be called without requiring subsequent versions to preserve code entry point locations as usual windows explorer allows the draganddrop installation of assemblies into this folder only if they would otherwise be permitted to be installed from the command line a calling application may specify a version of an assembly when referencing it so the runtime can simply refer to the filename to use the correct one pitfalls  editthe global assembly cache mechanism helps to avoid older dll hell but it still has some drawbacks such as 4by default applications will only run with the version of the  net framework used to compile it which can cause the application to fail on machines with newer versions of the  net framework installed â€” even when the application would normally run properly with the newer version it is sometimes necessary to use conditional compilation if some of the core  net calls used in the application are only supported for some versions of the framework net applications that rely on native code risk incompatibilities even with the gac mechanism every assembly that is added to the gac must be strongly named the process of making an assembly strongly named can be quite painful in some situations for example if an assembly depends on another assembly that is not strongly named it cannot be registered in the gac in cases where the code of the thirdparty assembly is not in the programmers possession transforming the assembly to be strongly named can in fact be impossible browsing for files using standard windows apis doesnt allow selection of dlls located under the assembly folder when explorer is showing the userfriendly view of the gac see also
