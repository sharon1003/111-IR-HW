updated june 2013overview the cell search circulating tumor cell ctc test is a simple blood test that helps oncologists in assessing the prognosis of patients with metastatic breast colorectal or prostate cancer the cell search test is the only fdaapproved test for ctc assessment each result of the cell search test performed at mayo clinic is verified by both a cytotechnologist and a pathologist to ensure quality in addition mayo clinic pathologists and scientists are always available for consultation useful for tests circulating tumor cells ctc for breast cancer by cell search blood 35323 an aid in monitoring patients with metastatic breast cancer circulating tumor cells ctc for colorectal cancer by cell search blood 26176 an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic colon cancer circulating tumor cells ctc for prostate cancer by cell search blood 35325 an aid in the monitoring of patients with metastatic prostate cancer studies have demonstrated ctcs can play an important role as an adjunct to imaging 13 these studies demonstrate that metastatic breast cancer patients with ≥5 ctcs and imaging findings that show a stablepartial response have a shorter overall survival than those patients with 5 ctcs and imaging findings that show a stablepartial response this is an indication that rising ctc levels occur before imaging can detect a possible change in patient status studies suggest that the cell search test is able to detect tumor recurrence in metastatic breast cancer patients before tumor recurrence is detected by imaging 4 this may help oncologists switch to more effective therapies test results and consultations each result provides a strong independent predictor of survival each result performed at mayo clinic is verified by both a certified cytotechnologist and pathologist to ensure quality each report prepared at mayo clinic includes patient results for all previous ctc tests to aid oncologists with monitoring mayo clinic pathologists and scientists are always available for consultation on matters of test selection collection and processing procedures results interpretation new test development and methodologies clinical references cristofanilli m budd gt ellis mj et al circulating tumor cells disease progression and survival in metastatic breast cance r n engl j med 2004351781791cohen sj punt cj iannotti n et al relationship of circulating tumor cells to tumor response progressionfree survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer j clin oncol 2008 jul26 1932123221de bono js scher hi montgomery rb et al circulating tumor cells predict survival benefit from treatment in the metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer  clin cancer res 2008 october 114 1963026309budd tg cristofanilli m ellis mj et al circulating tumor cells versus imaging—predicting overall survival in metastatic breast cancer clin cancer res 2006 1264036409
