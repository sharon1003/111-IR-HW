saoirse ronan tells refinery29 what she thinks happens after that final lady bird scene anne cohen november 8 2017 105 pmphoto courtesy of a24 if you put together all the reels of film devoted to telling stories about mens relationships with their fathers i suspect youd have enough to circle the planet lady bird greta gerwigs masterful directorial debut proves that its time to turn the lens on the motherdaughter relationship originally titled mothers and daughters the film follows 17yearold christine lady bird mc pherson as she tries to navigate the perilous waters of teenage selfdiscovery a lot of that involves clashes with her mother marion who when she isnt worrying about making ends meet is fretting about lady bird her past her present and definitely her future advertisement things come to a head when it comes out that lady bird has secretly applied and been accepted to nyu in direct contradiction to marions wishes the two have a huge fight and lady bird leaves for college with marion still giving her the silent treatment never knowing that she actually rushes back to the airport to try to mend fences only to find that her daughters plane has already left likewise lady birds final phone call to marion is the act of love that caps the film after a night of freshman drinking lands her in the hospital she ends up in front of a church placing a call to sacramento on her emergency phone not finding her mother at home she leaves an emotional message and we know that all will be right refinery29 spoke to ronan over the phone about what she thinks happens after that last scene in the film why this film has resonated with so many viewers and what she said to her own mother refinery29 i want to start with the ending — where do you think lady bird goes after that exhale saoirse ronan “oh gosh she probably goes to take a shower because she’s a mess i would say she gets right back into the old new york groove she’s about to start college and she just needed to make that phone call in order for her to get on with this new life and i think she’s a very open person so i don’t see her having any trouble making friends advertisement there are so many male comingofage movies why do you think it’s taken so long for women to penetrate the genre because they weren’t really given the support to do it they weren’t necessarily given the resources i do feel like it actually started over in tv and it’s made it over to film — women like lena dunham and jenni konner and tina fey and amy poehler have helped each other and supported each other because if they weren’t going to write sketches or tv shows for themselves then nobody else was going to and they’re really good at it that’s been so successful — what it comes down to unfortunately for so many people is ‘is it commercial or not will it make us money or not’ and people are started to see that films can be made with women i mean even bridesmaids — it doesn’t necessarily have to be about the romance it doesn’t have to be about the girl finding the guy in order for it to be an entertaining film likewise even if a young guy and a girl were the leads in the film it would be really interesting to not have it be sexual or romantic and to show the other facets of a relationship there’s a light that’s been shone on the fascinating life of a woman now and you can’t really turn away i was just talking to beanie feldstein and your friendship with julie could be its own movie advertisement“absolutely maybe we’ll do a sequel”what was it like working with laurie metcalfe — how did you two develop that motherdaughter dynamic we didn’t have that many rehearsals together i think we had four or five hours of table read in a day and we sort of mapped out all the trigger points in each argument scene between the two of them and made sure that they each had a different flavor and then we just got in there and did it it was great that so many of our scenes are in the family home so that kind of gives you a chance to settle in and inhabit that place a little bit together”i’ve been reading so many reactions online from mothers and daughters who really relate to this movie what makes this motherdaughter relationship so universal“i think it shows the complexity of the relationship and how you can have a relationship with your mother or with your child that’s fueled by love but it gets a little murky sometimes and complicated especially as the kid starts to get older and wants that independence it was a very honest telling of what it’s like for a parent and a kid around this really difficult time in both their lives it’s a very changeable time a teenager one day is going to be one thing and is going to dress a certain way and do something different the next day because they’re finding themselves and i think that’s tricky for a parent to get used to”advertisement did you talk about the film with your own motheryes i was talking to her every day i don’t know where i’d be without my mom she’s the one who gives me the confidence to keep going she actually came out while i was filming because i had just come off a pretty intense play and done all the press for brooklyn before that and it had been a bit relentless for about six months i really wanted to do the best job for greta and knew that the only way to be in the right place to do that would be if my mom was there”a lot of the conversations around the film have been about lady bird as personal to greta how did you make the character your own did you add any experiences from your own life“i think you just naturally do when you’re acting in a scene that was actually an adjustment for me over the last few years because i started when i was young and didn’t have any life experience at all and now i’m 23 i was 22 at the time when i made lady bird and i’ve had my own experiences separate from work so they just start to naturally just play a part in how you bring a role to life or how you can be true emotionally it was definitely a collaboration between greta and i from day to day we found it and we found what we needed for each moment”advertisement how did working with a female director affect your experience as an actress in a way i don’t think of greta as being a female director i just think of her as being a great director she’s just a fantastic storyteller and i think even with this movie — there’s a female at the forefront of it and it really does celebrate and honor female relationships but she also pays as much attention to lady bird’s father and brother and boyfriends she’s very clever and sensitive to everyone in her film and any woman i’ve worked with i’ve never specifically thought of them as being a female director they are the boss they are the ones who are leading the way in the same way that it would be if it was a man read these stories next saoirse ronan got a new look for the oscars —  its giving us lady bird vibes behold the full list of 2018 oscar
