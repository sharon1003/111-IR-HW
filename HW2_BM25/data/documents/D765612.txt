george kelly1905  1967dr c george boeree george kelly was teaching physiological psychology at fort hays kansas state college in 1931 it was the time of the dust bowl and the depression recognizing the pains and sorrows of the farming families of this part of westcentral kansas he decided to do something a little more humanitarian with his life he decided to develop a rural clinical service mind you this was hardly a moneymaking operation many of his clients had no money some couldnt come to him and so he and his students would travel sometimes for hours to them at first kelly used the standard freudian training that every psychology ph d received in those days he had these folks lie down on a couch free associate and tell him their dreams when he saw resistances or symbols of sexual and aggressive needs he would patiently convey his impressions to them it was surprising he thought how readily these relatively unsophisticated people took to these explanations of their problems surely given their culture the standard freudian interpretations should seem terribly bizarre apparently they placed their faith in him the professional kelly himself however wasnt so sure about these standard freudian explanations he found them a bit farfetched at times not quite appropriate to the lives of kansan farm families so as time went by he noticed that his interpretations of dreams and such were becoming increasingly unorthodox in fact he began making up explanations his clients listened as carefully as before believed in him as much as ever and improved at the same slow but steady pace it began to occur to him that what truly mattered to these people was that they had an explanation of their difficulties that they had a way of understanding them what mattered was that the chaos of their lives developed some order and he discovered that while just about any order and understanding that came from an authority was accepted gladly order and understanding that came out of their own lives their own culture was even better out of these insights kelly developed his theory and philosophy the theory well get to in a while the philosophy he called constructive alternativism constructive alternativism is the idea that while there is only one true reality reality is always experienced from one or another perspective or alternative construction i have a construction you have one a person on the other side of the planet has one someone living long ago had one a primitive person has one a modern scientist has one every child has one even someone who is seriously mentally ill has one some constructions are better than others mine i hope is better than that of someone who is seriously mentally ill my physicians construction of my ills is better i trust than the construction of the local faith healer yet noones construction is ever complete  the world is just too complicated too big for anyone to have the perfect perspective and noones perspective is ever to be completely ignored each perspective is in fact a perspective on the ultimate reality and has some value to that person in that time and place in fact kelly says there are an infinite number of alternative constructions one may take towards the world and if ours is not doing a very good job we can take anotherbiography george kelly was born on april 28 1905 on a farm near perth kansas he was the only child of theodore and elfleda kelly his father was originally a presbyterian minister who had taken up farming on his doctors advice his mother was a former school teacher georges schooling was erratic at best his family moved by covered wagon to colorado when george was young but they were forced to return to kansas when water became scarce from then on george attended mostly one room schools fortunately both his parents took part in his education when he was thirteen he was finally sent off to boarding school in wichita after high school kelly was a good example of someone who was both interested in everything and basically directionless he received a bachelors degree in 1926 in physics and math from park college followed with a masters in sociology from the university of kansas moving to minnesota he taught public speaking to labor organizers and bankers and citizenship classes to immigrants he moved to sheldon iowa where he taught and coached drama at a junior college and met his wifetobe gladys thompson after a few shortterm jobs he received a fellowship to go to the university of edinburgh where he received a bachelor of education degree in psychology in 1931 he received his ph d in psychology from the state university of iowa then during the depression he worked at fort hays kansas state college where he developed his theory and clinical techniques during world war ii kelly served as an aviation psychologist with the navy followed by a stint at the university of maryland in 1946 he left for ohio state university the year after carl rogers left and became the director of its clinical program it was here that his theory matured where he wrote his twovolume work the psychology of personal constructs and where he influenced a number of graduate students in 1965 he began a research position at brandeis university where maslow was working sadly he died soon afterward on march 6 1967 theory kellys theory begins with what he called his  fruitful metaphor  he had noticed long before that scientists and therapists often displayed a peculiar attitude towards people while they thought quite well of themselves they tended to look down on their subjects or clients while they saw themselves as engaged in the fine arts of reason and empiricism they tended to see ordinary people as the victims of their sexual energies or conditioning histories but kelly with his experience with kansan students and farm people noted that these ordinary people too were engaged in science they too were trying to understand what was going on so people  ordinary people  are scientists too the have constructions of their reality like scientists have theories they have anticipations or expectations like scientists have hypotheses they engage in behaviors that test those expectations like scientists do experiments they improve their understandings of reality on the bases of their experiences like scientists adjust their theories to fit the facts from this metaphor comes kellys entire theory the fundamental postulate kelly organized his theory into a fundamental postulate and 11 corollaries his fundamental postulate says this a persons processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which he anticipates events this and all subsequent quotations are from kellys 1955 the psychology of personal constructs  this is the central movement in the scientific process from hypothesis to experiment or observation ie from anticipation to experience and behavior by processes kelly means your experiences thoughts feelings behaviors and whatever might be left over all these things are determined not just by the reality out there but by your efforts to anticipate the world other people and yourself from moment to moment as well as daytoday and yeartoyear so when i look out of my window to find the source of some highpitched noises i dont just see exactly and completely what is out there i see that which is in keeping with my expectations i am ready for birds perhaps or children laughing and playing i am not prepared for a bulldozer that operates with a squeal rather than the usual rumbling or for a flying saucer landing in my yard if a ufo were in fact the source of the highpitched noises i would not truly perceive it at first id perceive something id be confused and frightened id try to figure out what im looking at id engage in all sorts of behaviors to help me figure it out or to get me away from the source of my anxiety only after a bit would i be able to find the right anticipation the right hypothesis oh my god its a ufo if of course ufos were a common place occurrence in my world upon hearing highpitched noises i would anticipate birds kids or a ufo an anticipation that could then be quickly refined with a glance out of the window the construction corollarya person anticipates events by construing their replications that is we construct our anticipations using our past experience we are fundamentally conservative creatures we expect things to happen as theyve happened before we look for the patterns the consistencies in our experiences if i set my alarm clock i expect it to ring at the right time as it has done since time immemorial if i behave nicely to someone i expect them to behave nicely back this is the step from theory to hypothesis ie from construction system knowledge understanding to anticipation the experience corollarya persons construction system varies as he successively construes the replication of events when things dont happen the way they have in the past we have to adapt to reconstruct this new experience alters our future anticipations we learn this is the step from experiment and observation to validation or reconstruction based on the results of our experiment  the behaviors we engage in  or our observation  the experiences we have  we either continue our faith in our theory of reality or we change the theory the dichotomy corollarya persons construction system is composed of a finite number of dichotomous constructs we store our experience in the form of constructs which he also referred to as useful concepts convenient fictions and transparent templates you place these templates on the world and they guide your perceptions and behaviors he often calls them personal constructs emphasizing the fact that they are yours and yours alone unique to you and noone else a construct is not some label or pigeonhole or dimension i as a psychologist lay on you the ordinary person it is a small bit of how you see the world he also calls them bipolar constructs to emphasize their dichotomous nature they have two ends or poles where there is thin there must be fat where there is tall there must be short where there is up there must be down and so on if everyone were fat then fat would become meaningless or identical in meaning to everyone some people must be skinny in order for fat to have any meaning and vice versathis is actually a very old insight in ancient china for example philosophers made much of yin and yang the opposites that together make the whole more recently carl jung talks about it a great deal linguists and anthropologists accept it as a given part of language and culture a number of psychologists most notably gestalt psychologists have pointed out that we dont so much associate separate things as differentiate things out of a moreorless whole background first you see a lot of undifferentiated stuff going on a buzzing blooming confusion as william james called it then you learn to pick out of that stuff the things that are important that make a difference that have meaning for you the young child doesnt care if you are fat or thin black or white rich or poor jew or gentile only when the people around him or her convey their prejudices does the child begin to notice these things many constructs have names or are easily nameable goodbad happysad introvertextravert flourescentincandescent but they need not they can be unnamed babies even animals have constructs foodilike vs foodispitout danger vs safety mommy vs stranger probably most of our constructs are nonverbal think of all the habits that you have that you dont name such as the detailed movements involved in driving a car think about the things you recognize but dont name such as the formation just beneath your nose its called a philtrum or think about all the subtleties of a feeling like falling in love this is as close as kelly comes to distinguishing a conscious and an unconscious mind constructs with names are more easily thought about they are certainly more easily talked about its as if a name is a handle by which you can grab onto a construct move it around show it to others and so on and yet a construct that has no name is still there and can have every bit as great an effect on your lifesometimes although a construct has names we pretend to ourselves that one pole doesnt really refer to anything or anybody for example a person might say that there arent any truly bad people in the world kelly would say that he or she has submerged this pole  something similar to repression it might be you see that for this person to acknowledge the meaningfulness of bad would require them to acknowledge a lot more perhaps mom would have to be labeled bad or dad or me rather than admit something like this he or she would rather stop using the construct sadly the construct is still there and shows up in the persons behaviors and feelings one more differentiation kelly makes in regards to constructs is between peripheral and core constructs peripheral constructs are most constructs about the world others and even ones self core constructs on the other hand are the constructs that are most significant to you that to one extent or another actually define who you are write down the first 10 or 20 adjectives that occur to you about yourself  these may very well represent core constructs core constructs is the closest kelly comes to talking about a self the organization corollaryeach person characteristically evolves for his convenience in anticipating events a construction system embracing ordinal relationships between constructs constructs are not just floating around unconnected if they were you wouldnt be able to use one piece of information to get to another  you wouldnt be able to anticipate when you are talked into a blind date and your friend spends a great deal of energy trying to convince you that the person you will be going out with has a great personality you know you just know that they will turn out to look like quasimodo how do you get from great personality to quasimodo organizationsome constructs are subordinate to or under other constructs there are two versions of this first theres a taxonomic kind of subordination like the trees of animal or plant life you learned in high school biology there are living things vs nonliving things for example subordinate to living things are say plants vs animals under plants there might be trees vs flowers under trees there might be conifers vs deciduous trees and so on mind you these are personal constructs not scientific constructs and so this is a personal taxonomy as well it may be the same as the scientific one in your biology textbook or it might not be i still tend to have a species of conifer called christmas treesanimals  plantsflowers  treesdeciduous  coniferschristmas trees  others there is also a definitional kind of subordination called constellation  this involves stacks of constructs with all their poles aligned for example beneath the construct conifers vs deciduous trees we may find softwood vs hardwood needlebearing vs leafbearing conebearing vs flowerbearing and so onconifers  deciduous softwood  hardwood needlebearing  leafbearing conebearing  flowerbearing this is also the basis for stereotyping we are good clean smart moral etc while they are bad dirty dumb immoral etc many constructs of course are independent of each other plantsanimals is independent of flourescentincandescent to give an obvious example sometimes the relationship between two constructs is very tight  if one construct is consistently used to predict another you have tight construction prejudice would be an example as soon as you have a label for someone you automatically assume other things about that person as well you jump to conclusions when we do science we need to use tight construction we call this rigorous thinking and it is a good thing who after all would want an engineer to build bridges using scientific rules that only maybe work people who think of themselves as realistic often prefer tight construction but it is a small step from rigorous and realistic to rigid and this rigidity can become pathological so that an obsessivecompulsive person has to do things just so or break out in anxiety on the other hand sometimes the relationship between constructs is left loose there is a connection but it is not absolute not quite necessary loose construction is a more flexible way of using constructs when we go to another country for example with some preconceptions about the people these preconceptions would be prejudicial stereotypes if we construed them tightly but if we use them loosely they merely help us to behave more appropriately in their culture we use loose construction when we fantasize and dream when anticipations are broken freely and odd combinations are permitted however if we use loose construction too often and inappropriately we appear flaky rather than flexible taken far enough loose construction will land you in an institution the creativity cycle makes use of these ideas when we are being creative we first loosen our constructions  fantasizing and brainstorming alternative constructions when we find a novel construction that looks like it has some potential we focus on it and tighten it up we use the creativity cycle obviously in the arts first we loosen up and get creative in the simplest sense then tighten things up and give our creations substance we conceive the idea then give it form we use the creativity cycle in therapy too we let go of our unsuccessful models of reality let our constructs drift find a novel configuration pull it into more rigorous shape and try it out well get back to this later the range corollarya construct is convenient for the anticipation of a finite range of events only no construct is useful for everything the gender construct malefemale is for most of us something of importance only with people and a few higher animals such as our pets and cattle few of us care what sex flies are or lizards or even armadillos and noone i think applies gender to geological formations or political parties these things are beyond the range of convenience of the gender construct some constructs are very comprehensive or broad in application goodbad is perhaps the most comprehensive construct of all being applicable to nearly anything other constructs are very incidental or narrow flourescentincandescent is fairly narrow applicable only to light bulbs but notice that what is relatively narrow for you might be relatively broad for me a biologist will be interested in the gender of flies lizards armadillos apple trees philodendra and so on or a philosopher may restrict his or her use of goodbad to specifically moral behaviors rather than to all kinds of things people or beliefs the modulation corollarythe variation in a persons construction system is limited by the permeability of the constructs within whose range of convenience the variants lie some constructs are springy they modulate they are permeable  which means that they are open to increased range other constructs are relatively impermeable for example goodbad is generally quite permeable for most of us we are always adding new elements we may never have seen a computer before or a cd player or a fax machine but as soon as we have we want to know the best brand to buy likewise a person who will look around for a rock if a hammer is not available uses the construct concerning things to hammer with in a permeable fashion on the other hand flourescentincandescent is relatively impermeable  it can be used for lighting but little else is likely to ever be admitted and people who wont let you sit on tables are keeping their situpon constructs quite impermeable in case this seems like another way of talking about incidental vs comprehensive constructs note that you can have comprehensive but impermeable constructs such as the one expressed by the person who says whatever happened to the good old days there just dont seem to be any honest people around anymore in other words honesty though broad is now closed and there are incidental constructs used permeably such as when you say my but youre looking incandescent today permeability is the very soul of poetrywhen there is no more stretch no more give in the range of the constructs you are using you may have to resort to more drastic measures dilation is when you broaden the range of your constructs lets say you dont believe in esp you walk into a party and suddenly you hear a voice in your head and notice someone smiling knowingly at you from across the room you would have to rather quickly stretch the range of the constructs involving esp which had been filled up to now with nothing but a few hoaxes on the other hand sometimes events force you to narrow the range of your constructs equally dramatically this is called constriction  an example might be when after a lifetime of believing that people were moral creatures you experience the realities of war the construct including moral may shrink out of existence notice that dilation and constriction are rather emotional things you can easily understand depression and manic states this way the manic person has dilated a set of constructs about his or her happiness enormously and shouts ive never imagined that life could be like this before someone who is depressed on the other hand has taken the constructs that relate to life and good things to do with it and constricted them down to sitting alone in the dark the choice corollarya person chooses for himself that alternative in a dichotomized construct through which he anticipates the greater possibility for extension and definition of his system with all these constructs and all these poles how do we chose our behaviors kelly says that we will choose to do what we anticipate will most likely elaborate our construction system that is improve our understanding our ability to anticipate reality places limits on what we can experience or do but we choose how to construe or interpret that reality and we choose to interpret that reality in whatever way we believe will help us the most commonly our choices are between an adventurous alternative and a safe one we could try to extend our understanding of say human heterosexual interaction partying by making the adventurous choice of going to more parties getting to know more people developing more relationships and so on on the other hand we might prefer to define our understanding by making the security choice staying home pondering what might have gone wrong with that last unsuccessful relationship or getting to know one person better which one you choose will depend on which one you think you need with all this choosing going on you might expect that kelly has had something to say about free will vs determinism he has and what he has to say is very interesting he sees freedom as being a relative concept we are not free or unfree some of us are freeer than others we are freeer in some situations than in others we are freeer from some forces than from others and we are freeer under some constructions than under others the individuality corollarypersons differ from each other in their construction of events since everyone has different experiences everyones construction of reality is different remember he calls his theory the theory of personal constructs kelly does not approve of classification systems personality types or personality tests his own famous rep test as you will see is not a test in the traditional sense at all the commonality corollaryto the extent that one person employs a construction of experience which is similar to that employed by another his psychological processes are similar to the other person just because we are all different doesnt mean we cant be similar if our construction system  our understanding of reality  is similar so will be our experiences our behaviors and our feelings for example if we share the same culture well see things in a similar way and the closer we are the more similar well be in fact kelly says that we spend a great deal of our time seeking validation from other people a man sitting himself down at the local bar and sighing women does so with the expectation that his neighbor at the bar will respond with the support of his world view he is at that moment desperately in need of yeah women you cant live with em and you cant live without em the same scenario applies with appropriate alterations to women and similar scenarios apply as well to kindergarten children adolescent gangs the klan political parties scientific conferences and so on we look for support from those who are similar to ourselves only they can know how we truly feelthe fragmentation corollarya person may successively employ a variety of construction subsystems which are inferentially incompatible with each other the fragmentation corollary says that we can be inconsistent within ourselves it is in fact a rare person who has it all together and functions at all times in all places as a unified personality nearly all of us for example have different roles that we play in life i am a man a husband a father a son a professor i am someone with certain ethnic religious political and philosophical identifications sometimes im a patient or a guest or a host or a customer and i am not quite the same in these various roles often the roles are separated by circumstances a man might be a cop at night and act tough authoritarian efficient but in the daytime he might be a father and act gentle tender affectionate since the circumstances are kept apart the roles dont come into conflict but heaven forbid the man finds himself in the situation of having to arrest his own child or a parent may be seen treating a child like an adult one minute scolding her the next and hugging her like a baby the following minute an observer might frown at the inconsistency yet for most people these inconsistencies are integrated at higher levels the parent may be in each case expressing his or her love and concern for the childs wellbeing some of kellys followers have reintroduced an old idea to the study of personality that each of us is a community of selves  rather than just one simple self this may be true however other theorists would suggest that a more unified personality might be healthier and a community of selves is a little too close to multiple personalities for comfortthe sociality corollaryto the extent that one person construes the construction processes of another he may play a role in a social process involving the other person even if you are not really similar to another person you can still relate to them you can in fact construe how another construes psych him out get inside her head see where hes coming from and know what she means in other words i can set aside a portion of myself made possible through the fragmentation corollary to be someone else this is an important part of role playing because whenever you play a role you play it to or with someone someone you need to understand in order to relate to kelly thought this was so important he almost called his theory role theory except that the name had already been taken these ideas in fact came from the school of thought in sociology founded by george herbert mead feelings the theory so far presented may sound very cognitive with all its emphasis on constructs and constructions and many people have said so as their primary criticism of kellys theory in fact kelly disliked being called a cognitive theorist he felt that his professional constructs included the more traditional ideas of perception behavior and emotion as well as cognition so to say he doesnt talk about emotions for example is to miss the point altogether what you and i would call emotions or affect or feelings kelly called constructs of transition because they refer to the experiences we have when we move from one way of looking at the world or ourselves to another when you are suddenly aware that your constructs arent functioning well you feel anxiety you are as kelly said caught with your constructs down it can be anything from your checkbook not balancing to forgetting someones name during introductions to an unexpected hallucinogenic trip to forgetting your own name when anticipations fail you feel anxiety if youve taken a social psychology course you might recognize the concept as being very similar to cognitive dissonance when the anxiety involves anticipations of great changes coming to your core constructs  the ones of greatest importance to you  it becomes a threat  for example you are not feeling well you think it might be something serious you go to the doctor he looks he shakes his head he looks again he gets solemn he calls in a colleague this is threat we also feel it when we graduate get married become parents for the first time when roller coasters leave the track and during therapy when you do things that are not in keeping with your core constructs  with your idea of who you are and how you should behave  you feel guilt  this is a novel and useful definition of guilt because it includes situations that people know to be guiltridden and yet dont meet the usual criterion of being in some way immoral if your child falls into a manhole it may not be your fault but you will feel guilty because it violates your belief that it is your duty as a parent to prevent accidents like this similarly children often feel guilty when a parent gets sick or when parents divorce and when a criminal does something out of character something the rest of the world might consider good he feels guilty about itwe have talked a lot about adapting to the world when our constructs dont match up with reality but there is another way you can try to make reality match up with your constructs kelly calls this aggression  it includes aggression proper if someone insults my tie i can punch his lights out in which case i can wear my tie in peace but it also includes things we might today prefer to call assertiveness sometimes things are not as they should be and we should change them to fit our ideals without assertiveness there would be no social progressagain when our core constructs are on the line aggression may become hostility  hostility is a matter of insisting that your constructs are valid despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary examples might include an elderly boxer still claiming to be the greatest a nerd who truly believes hes a don juan or a person in therapy who desperately resists acknowledging that there even is a problem psychopathology and therapy this brings us nicely to kellys definition of a psychological disorder  any personal construction which is used repeatedly in spite of consistent invalidation the behaviors and thoughts of neurosis depression paranoia schizophrenia etc are all examples so are patterns of violence bigotry criminality greed addiction and so on the person can no longer anticipate well yet cant seem to learn new ways of relating to the world he or she is loaded with anxiety and hostility is unhappy and is making everyone else unhappy too if a persons problem is poor construction then the solution should be reconstruction a term kelly was tempted to use for his style of therapy psychotherapy involves getting the client to reconstrue to see things in a different way from a new perspective one that allows the choices that lead to elaboration kellian therapists essentially ask their clients to join them in a series of experiments concerning the clients life styles they may ask their clients to loosen their constructs to slip them around to test them to tighten them up again to try them on for size the intent is to encourage movement essential for any progress kelly with his background in drama liked to use roleplaying or enactment to encourage movement he might take the part of your mother and have you express your feelings after a while he might ask you to reverse roles with him  you be your mother and hell be you in this way you become aware of your own construction of your relationship and your mothers construction perhaps you will begin to understand her or see ways in which you might adapt you may come to a compromise or discover an entirely new perspective that rises above both kellys therapy often involves homework things he would ask you to do outside the therapy situation his best known technique is called fixedrole therapy first he asks you for a description of yourself a couple of pages in the third person which he calls the character sketch  then he constructs perhaps with the help of a colleague another description called the fixedrole sketch of a pretend person he writes this sketch by examining your original sketch carefully and using constructs that are at right angles to the constructs you used this means that the new constructs are independent of the original ones but they are used in a similar way that is they refer to the same range of elements if for example i use geniusidiot as a construct in dealing with people i dont give them a lot of room to be somewhere in between and i dont allow much for change and since we use the same constructs on ourselves as we use for others i dont give myself much slack either on a really good day i might call myself a genius on most days id have no choice if i used such a dramatic construct but to call myself an idiot and idiots stay idiots they dont turn into geniuses so id be setting myself up for depression not to mention for a life with very few friends kelly might write a fixedrole sketch with a construct like skilledunskilled this is a much more humane construct than geniusidiot it is much less judgmental a person can after all be skilled in one area yet unskilled in another and it allows for change if i find that i am unskilled in some area of importance i can with a little effort become skilled anyway kelly would then ask his client to be the person described in the fixedrole sketch for a week or two mind you this is a full time commitment he wants you to be this person 24 hours a day at work at home even when youre alone kelly found that most people are quite good at this and even enjoy it after all this person is usually much healthier than they areshould the client come back and say thank you doc i believe im cured all i need to do now is be dave instead of george for the rest of my life kelly would have a surprise in store he might ask that person to play another fixedrole for a couple of weeks one that might not be so positive thats because the intent of this playacting is not that the therapist give you a new personality that would quickly come to nothing the idea is to show you that you do in fact have the power to change to choose yourself kellian therapy has as its goal opening people up to alternatives helping them to discover their freedom allowing them to live up to their potentials for this reason and many others kelly fits most appropriately among the humanistic psychologists assessment perhaps the thing most associated with george kelly is his role construct repertory test which most people now call the rep grid  not a test in the traditional sense at all it is a diagnostic selfdiscovery and research tool that has actually become more famous than the rest of his theory first the client names a set of ten to twenty people called elements  likely to be of some importance to the persons life in therapy these people are named in response to certain suggestive categories such as past lover and someone you pity and would naturally include yourself your mother and father and so on the therapist or researcher then picks out three of these at a time and asks you to tell him or her which of the three are similar and which one is different and he asks you to give him something to call the similarity and the difference the similarity label is called the similarity pole  and the difference one is called the contrast pole and together they make up one of the constructs you use in social relations if for example you say that you and your present lover are both nervous people but your former lover was very calm then nervous is the similarity pole and calm the contrast pole of the construct nervouscalm you continue in this fashion with different combinations of three until you get about twenty contrasts listed by eyeballing the list or by performing certain statistical operations on a completed chart the list might be narrowed down to ten or so contrasts by eliminating overlaps often our constructs  even though they have different words attached to them are used in the same way nervouscalm for example may be used exactly like you use neurotichealthy or jitterypassive in diagnosis and selfdiscovery uses you are of course encouraged to use constructs that refer to peoples behaviors and personalities but in research uses you may be asked to give any kind of constructs at all and you may be asked to give them in response to all sorts of elements in industrial psychology for example people have been asked to compare and contrast various products for marketing analyses good and bad examples of a product for quality control analyses or different leadership styles you can find your musical style constructs this way or your constructs about political figures or the constructs you use to understand personality theories in therapy the rep grid gives the therapist and the client a picture of the clients view of reality that can be discussed and worked with in marriage therapy two people can work on the grid with the same set of elements and their constructs compared and discussed it isnt sacred the rep grid is rare among tests in that the client is invited to change his or her mind about it at any time neither is it assumed to be a complete picture of a persons mental state it is what it is a diagnostic tool in research we can take advantage of a number of computer programs that allow for a measurement of the distances between constructs or between elements we get a picture created by the people themselves of their worldviews we can compare the views of several people as long as they use the same elements we can compare a persons worldview before and after training or therapy it is an exciting tool an unusual combination of the subjective and objective side of personality research for more information on the rep grid see the qualitative methods workbook part fivediscussion kelly published the psychology of personal constructs in 1955 after a brief flurry of interest and considerable criticism he and his theory were pretty much forgotten except by a few loyal students most of whom were involved more in their clinical practices than in the advancement of the psychology of personality curiously his theory continued to have a modest notoriety in england particularly among industrial psychologists the reasons for this lack of attention are not hard to fathom the science branch of psychology was at that time still rather mired in a behaviorist approach to psychology that had little patience with the subjective side of things and the clinical side of psychology found people like carl rogers much easier to follow kelly was a good 20 years ahead of his time only recently with the socalled cognitive revolution are people really ready to understand him it is ironic that george kelly always true to his philosophy of constructive alternativism felt that if his theory were still around in ten or twenty years in a form significantly like the original there would be cause for concern theories like our individual views of reality should change not remain static there are legitimate criticisms first although kelly is a very good writer he chose to reinvent psychology from the ground up introducing a new set of terms and a new set of metaphors and images and he went out of his way to avoid being associated with other approaches to the field this inevitably alienated him from the mainstream in a more positive vein some of the words he invented are now firmly fixed in mainstream psychology although many still think of them as trendy  anticipation has been made popular by the famous cognitive psychologist ulric neisser construct construction construal and all its variations can be found in books and articles right alongside of words like perception and behavior sadly kelly just like other innovators seldom gets any credit for for his innovations mostly because psychologists are rarely trained to pay much attention to where ideas come from the rep grid has also become quite popular especially since computers have made it much easier to use as i mentioned before it is a nice blend of the qualitative and the introspective that even critics of kellys overall theory have a hard time finding fault with connections much of personal construct theory is phenomenological kelly acknowledged his sympathies with the phenomenological theories of carl rogers donald snygg and arthur combs and the selftheorists prescott lecky and victor raimy but he was skeptical of phenomenology per se like so many people he assumed that phenomenology was some kind of introspective idealism as we shall see in later chapters that is a mistaken assumption but a phenomenologist would find much of kellys theory quite congenial for example kelly believes that to understand behavior you need to understand how the person construes reality  ie how he or she understands it perceives it  more than what that reality truly is in fact he points out that everyones view  even the hardcore scientists  is just that a view and yet he also notes emphatically that there is no danger here of solipsism the idea that the world is only my idea because the view has to be of something this is exactly the meaning of the phenomenologists basic principle known as intentionality on the other hand there are aspects of kellys theory that are not so congenial to phenomenology first he was a true theorybuilder and the technical detail of his theory shows it phenomenologists on the other hand tend to avoid theory second he had high hopes for
