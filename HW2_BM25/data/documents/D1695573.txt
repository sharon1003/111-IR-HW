who shot liberty valance is essential when the legend becomes fact print the legend this famous line from the man who shot liberty valance might also be the motto for john fords career although he directed in a wide range of genres ford is best known for his westerns and along with writers like zane grey visual artist frederick remington and perhaps a few others no one did more to forge the legends and myths of the old west with its heroes and villains the codes and philosophies the look and sound and feel of it fords was a romantic sentimental vision of our historical past and it frequently centered on the conflict between the wilderness and civilization tinged with nostalgia and loss as a younger man with my darling clementine 1946 he viewed the encroachment of society into the untamed west with some sense of hope and possibility nearly 20 years later the man who shot liberty valance still depicts the inevitable demise of the outlaw hero the man who acts on behalf of a civilization that must always exclude his type to progress forward but the world that replaces his is now shot through with regret fraud and a willful forgetting arent you proud ranse stoddards wife asks as she looks over the garden that he has made from the desert the look on his face and the final coda to the film speaks not of pride but of the realization that his entire life and career have been built on a lie and thats a shattering truth for a man in his twilight years back in 1962 many dismissed the man who shot liberty valance as a minor disappointing work from a master filmmaker who had seen better days in the years following the pendulum made a wide arc into unqualified reverence and a determination to see major significance in every tiny corner of the frame and every utterance ransom stoddard get it ransom and he defeats liberty a more balanced contemporary approach recognizes the films flaws but gives it credit as the last fully realized work of one of the most important directors in american cinema history if nothing else as theorist robert b ray has detailed it can be taken as a perfect critical study of one of the most enduring of hollywood tropes the outlaw hero tom in liberty valance clementine s doc holliday rick in casablanca 1942 reluctantly drawn into cooperating with the official hero stoddard wyatt earp victor laszlo to defeat a common enemy valance and the cattle interests the clantons nazis usually for the mutual love of a good woman hallie clementine ilsa except the outcome in valance is dark and painful as some have noted about this story the hero doesnt win the winner isnt heroic destiny here is more a matter of accident and misunderstanding and history depends entirely on whos telling it and why much of the criticism leveled against the man who shot liberty valance focused on its look what seemed to be fords lack of regard for any kind of pictorial beauty the elegant vistas of his beloved monument valley the majestic sweep of the cavalry trilogy my darling clementine and the searchers 1956 are nowhere to be seen the film is dark and confined shot almost entirely on a sound stage opposing reasons for this have been put forward the studio reluctant to finance a ford western even with stars like wayne and stewart imposed the production limits the blackandwhite photography was necessary to cover the makeup that allowed 54yearold stewart to play both a young man just out of law school and a distinguished elderly politician ford wanted to forego his usual methods in favor of concentrating on the characters and their oftensuppressed emotions motives and truths it has even been put forth that the casting was not as offhanded as it appears or merely arising from fords desire to work with actors he knew and trusted regardless of their age inappropriateness but rather a decision dictated by the notions of truth legend and history inherent in the story we dont see the characters realistically as they were years earlier but as projections of their memories which have been distorted by legend and fateful acts from which there is no escape whatever the reason the murky darkness and confined spaces of the man who shot liberty valance perfectly reflect the gloom and pessimism of the story peter bogdanovich once pointed out that the man who shot liberty valance was made when john ford was 67and he was old in terms of his health hastened by many years of hard work and hard living his films of the five or six years prior to this had generally not been commercial successes or critically praised and the studio system under which he made his greatest works was changing drastically he was now in the position of begging for financing and the only reason he got it for this picture was because he had john wayne the actor he had made into a star a film legend almost singlehandedly forged by ford himself i think the world he knew was collapsing bogdanovich said perhaps in this story ford found a telling parallel to his latelife realizations and one last comment on the west he had virtually created on screen by rob nixonback to top the man who shot liberty valance 1962shortly before hes shot liberty valance draws the dead mans hand aces and eights the legend of the fatal poker deal grew from the hand wild bill hickok supposedly held as he was shot dead in a saloon in deadwood south dakota ford used the dead mans hand once before held by luke plummer just before he is shot by the ringo kid john wayne in stagecoach 1939 making a nice symmetry between the first of his great sound westerns and what many consider his last although cheyenne autumn 1964 and one segment of how the west was won 1962 came later most film critics and analysts consider the man who shot liberty valance fords last fully realized work it wasnt until this point in his career that john wayne called another character on film pilgrim but wayne imitators ever since have used it as one of his most standard catchwords parodies of waynes use of the term pilgrim to refer to stewart have turned up in various movies including full metal jacket 1987 and an american tale fievel goes west 1991 on a 1972 episode of the british tv comedy monty pythons flying circus there is a cheese western spoof that mentions the cheese who shot liberty valance although it was never used in the score for the man who shot liberty valance a popular pop ballad was inspired by the movie it was written by burt bacharach and hal david but not recorded until after the picture came out it became a top 10 hit for gene pitney the tune was later recorded by jimmie rodgers james taylor and the royal guardsmen at one point harddrinking newspaper editor dutton peabody refers to the bad guys as liberty valance and his myrmidons the myrmidons were figures of ancient greek mythology skilled warriors in homers iliad commanded by achilles because they were known for their fierce loyalty to their leader the term came to be used in preindustrial europe almost as robots would be today according to the oxford english dictionary the term has since come to mean hired ruffian or a loyal follower especially one who executes orders without question protest or pityunquestioning followers print the legend a phrase taken from the movies famous quote is the title of a crime novel by craig mc donald about the death of ernest hemingway a study of photography in the american west and of course a book about john ford by scott eyman the phrase is often invoked in any writing or discussion about a person or event whose fame has surpassed the base realties sergio leone the director of once upon a time in the west 1968 the good the bad and the ugly 1966 and many other westerns was one of the directors heavily influenced by ford he said the man who shot liberty valance was his favorite john ford film because it was the only film where he ford learned about something called pessimism by rob nixonback to top the man who shot liberty valance 1962tom doniphon refers to valance as the toughest man south of the picketwirenext to me the picketwire is not a fence or dividing wire as it sounds but slang for the purgatoire river which flows into the arkansas river in colorado this is the only indication in the man who shot liberty valance of the specific location of the town of shinbone the location however could be new mexico or possibly oklahoma south of the river since the territory in the film has yet to achieve statehood and the flag in the classroom scene has 38 stars placing it after colorados entry into the union john wayne made a total of 21 films with john ford it was waynes appearance in stagecoach 1939 that brought him from the ranks of b pictures to true stardom and he first received credit for his acting in such ford films as she wore a yellow ribbon 1949 and the searchers 1956 its fair to say the actor owed much of his career to his most frequent director and one of the reasons wayne remained respectful of him even though ford was often abusive to the actor after the man who shot liberty valance they worked on two more films together the civil war sequence of how the west was won 1962 and the comedyaction picture donovans reef 1963 the man who shot liberty valance was james stewarts second film with john ford after two rode together 1961 ford also directed stewart and wayne in an hourlong alcoa premiere teleplay the same year this picture came out a baseball drama called flashing spikes stewart and wayne appeared together again in waynes final film the shootist 1976 directed by don siegel they were also both in the cast of how the west was won 1962 but in different segments woody strode 19141994 was a star athlete at ucla before he was discovered by ford and put in his first role a bit part in stagecoach strode played a few small parts in the following years and after the war he became one of the first black athletes to integrate profootball as a member of the los angeles rams besides liberty valance he made two other films for ford two rode together and the title role in sergeant rutledge 1960 he always gave ford credit for making him an actor and called him the greatest director i ever worked for the man who shot liberty valance was the second ford movie each for vera miles  the searchers and jeanette nolan  two rode together  miles was the sister of the murdered janet leigh in alfred hitchcocks psycho 1960 for which nolan supplied the voice uncredited of mrs bates this was andy devines third picture with ford after stagecoach and two rode together ford stock company sightings in addition to stars like john wayne and henry fonda the director often used many of the same character actors and supporting players in his films the man who shot liberty valance included the following frequent ford players  john carradine john qualen willis bouchey carleton young anna lee woody strode o z whitehead denver pyle shug fisher qualen played vera miless father in the searchers ford also liked to give work to former silent stars such as mae marsh who had worked with him in his earliest days but were barely remembered by the public gertrude astor was the first actress signed to a contract with universal that was 1915 she made dozens of movies before the end of the 1920s gaining a reputation as one of the most elegant and best dressed women in the business but by the mid30s she was mostly doing uncredited bits she made two silent films with ford a 1917 western and the lead in a 1925 drama he cast her in a bit in three godfathers 1948 and again in the man who shot liberty valance in the cast as an uncredited townsman was danny borzage brother of director frank borzage and something of a ford mascot borzage had been playing bits in fords films since the iron horse 1924 and was always on set to play mood music on his accordion for the cast and crew between scenes and sometimes during them scenarist james warner bellah was a novelist and short story writer before going into screenwriting at the age of 55 with the john wayne film the sea chase 1955 fords cavalry trilogy fort apache 1948 she wore a yellow ribbon rio grande 1950all

with uncredited work on fords fort apache he also shot fords donovans reef and a few other john wayne pictures he received academy award nominations for waynes the alamo 1960 and fords cheyenne autumn

nominations and eight awards make head the most honored costume designer and woman in academy history lee marvins widow pamela said the man who shot liberty valance was her alltime favorite of all the movies her husband made jim stewart and duke wayne gave for me topnotch performances in a picture ideally suited to them  cast member edmond obrien the man who shot liberty valance went into general release in april 1962 and received mostly unfavorable reviews in many cases it was relegated to the bottom half of a double bill it took a few decades before critical reassessment turned in its favor and it is now regarded as one of john fords most significant achievements there has been a bit of a backlash in recent years however some critics and theorists have gone to great pains to make a case in favor of the film seeing great significance in every shot and even in the names of the characters leading some writers to say now that liberty valance is solid and worthy but overrated memorable

shot liberty valance 1962born in iowa in 1905 dorothy m johnson grew up in montana after graduating from the state university she moved to new york for work as a writer and editor in 1950 she returned to montana edited the local paper and joined the university faculty over the course of her life she published 17 books and 52 short stories becoming one of the most noted female writers of fiction about the american west her story a man called horse was first adapted into an episode of the wagon train television series and later into a 1970 film her novel the hanging tree was brought to the screen by director delmer daves and star gary cooper in 1959 the man who shot liberty valance began as a short story in johnsons 1953 collection indian country although he had been one of hollywoods most respected and powerful directors for decades john ford was operating in a very different industry by the late 1950s the old studio system was in its final days most of the big companies were increasingly functioning as distributors and often only partial financers of projects initiated outside the studio ford had been putting together his own productions for years but now it was becoming harder to find backing tastes were changing as well fords work was looked on more and more as sentimental old fashioned and unsophisticated and his most characteristic genre the western although still popular particularly on the rival medium of television would not be a viable genre much longer in this atmosphere it was more difficult for ford to get work and took him longer to find projects he could connect with personally his last two productions sergeant rutledge 1960 and two rode together 1961 a picture that was a disappointment to him had not been big successes he busied himself directing his most frequent star john wayne in an episode of tvs wagon train and doing some uncredited work on the dukes film the alamo 1960 so he was happy when he found johnsons story which had themes close to his heart and provided a good role for wayne unfortunately it would not be smooth sailing into production to adapt the screenplay ford renewed his collaboration with the writers of sergeant rutledge willis goldbeck and james warner bellah goldbeck also signed on as coproducer for the part of the young lawyer from the east who inadvertently becomes a town hero and successful politician ford chose james stewart whom he had worked with for the first time on two rode together stewart genuinely liked ford and was eager to work with him again especially since he was less than happy about the development of his unlikable character in the earlier film but would be playing an upstanding citizen and idealist in liberty valance wayne convinced ford to cast lee marvin his costar in the comancheros 1961 as villain liberty valance john wayne was one of hollywoods biggest stars and had just signed a tenpicture deal with paramount at 600000 per film so ford took liberty valance there but even with the directors reputation plus his agreement to come up with half the 32 million budget and two major stars on board the studio was not sold on the project and took nearly half a year to greenlight it the studio had several concerns about the project it was downbeat in nature waynes character was dead at the outset and stewart who was approaching his mid50s would have to play a character fresh out of law school for the extensive flashback structure and a man in his 60s or older for the framing story the company was also still smarting from the loss they incurred on marlon brandos oneeyed jacks 1961 and was not eager to make another risky western ultimately it was waynes clout and his solid deal with paramount that got the goahead on the project it also probably rankled ford to have the actor whose career he virtually created be the one he was now dependent on to get his production going wayne was still on location for the comancheros in early summer 1961 when he began getting memos about their upcoming project from ford who was eager to have his star back by summers end to begin shooting liberty valance for a change no locations ford wrote on july 7 all to be shot on the lot  seriously we have a great script in my humble opinion the script followed johnsons story and viewpoint fairly closely with one notable exception on the page tom doniphon waynes character was more of a mentor to ranse stoddard stewart easing him along the road from frontier lawyer to state senator in the film except for two notable acts that change stoddards life forever doniphon isnt quite so proactive with an eye to stoddards future in 1967 ford was quoted as saying the man who shot liberty valance was based on historic facts although he never said and evidence never revealed what that facts might have been by rob nixonback to top the man who shot liberty valance 1962although most sources say the man who shot liberty valance was shot almost entirely at paramount studios with exteriors on the janss conejo ranch in thousand oaks california a documentary about the making of it revealed that the town and train shots were done on lot 3 at mgm there are varying opinions about why the man who shot liberty valance was shot in black and white in the studio instead of location filming in color some accounts have it that ford was forced to curtail his usual production methods because paramount would not give him the financing he needed to shoot in one of his favorite locales such as monument valley others particularly critics and film analysts looking back to reclaim the film as one of fords major achievements say the decision was entirely fords a choice that zeroed in on a more intimate and intense character study most observers agree that black and white also helped ease the suspension of disbelief necessary to accept stewart and wayne as young men and stewart in his makeup for the character late in life ford himself once said he preferred black and white and that it is actually more difficult than shooting in color in black and white youve got to be very careful youve got to know your job lay your shadows in properly get your perspective right but in color there it is he said you might say im old fashioned but black and white is real photography according to actor frank baker who played in several ford movies but not liberty valance  the director substantially improvised on the scenario from day to day ford only shot just what he needed with very little extra coverage on the man who shot liberty valance he also preferred to do a minimum of takes saying that after the first few the actors get tired and jaded and their performances lack spontaneity thats why he liked to work with the same people over and over again the famed ford stock company because he could count on them to know what he wanted and give it to him on the first take according to his grandson dan ford many people involved in the shooting remarked on fords lack of energy and complete disregard for details such as background effects lindsay anderson in his booklength study of the director says no doubt this was yet another instance of fords growing impatience with the business of shooting it was no longer fun he resented the demands of narrative of crowdpleasing spectacle the trappings of art and in places the work suffered if ford was sick of filmmaking it wasnt apparent to cast member edmond obrien who said i have never seen ford happier than he was in making this he came on the set positively beaming every morning and that was not the usual thing with him obrien also said everyone involved seemed to enjoy making the man who shot liberty valance when he saw the set for the town of shinbone assistant director wingate smith remarked that it didnt looked lived in enough ford replied if they dont like it well give them their nickel back during shooting of the man who shot liberty valance john wayne was already suffering from the cancer that would take his life in 1979 wayne said liberty valance was a tough assignment for him while everyone else seemed to have wellrounded characters he saw his role as merely functional for the plot i just had to wander around in that son of a bitch tom doniphon and try to make a part for myself when someone suggested to wayne that his role was a complicated one full of ambiguity he reportedly shot back screw ambiguity perversion and corruption masquerade as ambiguity i dont like ambiguity i dont trust ambiguity known for his tendency to be disagreeable at times ford was always rough on wayne who usually took the rough treatment with equanimity but on this production the abusiveness was raised a few notches some have ascribed it to fords age and increasing impatience with filmmaking others say he resented wayne because so few of the scenes ford worked on without credit for waynes film the alamo 1960 actually made it to the screen in any case the days when ford wayne and others would carouse or play cards all night or spend time on fords yacht were behind them and the relationship was more strained than usual ford deliberately goaded wayne repeatedly hitting a particularly sore spot by pointing out publicly that many on the set  james stewart lee marvin woody strode  had served during world war ii while wayne did not jealousy might also have been a factor in fords treatment of wayne who was perhaps the biggest movie star in the world at this time while the man who helped him reach that status now had to scramble for work and depend on his star to get backing from studios one day when wayne casually suggested a minor scene change ford lost his temper and screamed jesus christ here i take you out of eightday westerns i put you in big movies and you give me a stupid suggestion like that ford seemed to be determined to make bad blood between wayne and strode ford needled wayne who had attended the university of southern california on a football scholarship by insisting that strode a decathlete and football star at ucla was the real football player tensions came to a head during a scene in which wayne was supposed to be driving a wagon back to his ranch with strode in the back strode noticed that wayne was having trouble controlling the horses and getting them to stop so he reached forward to grab the reins to help wayne swung his arm and knocked him back roughly when the wagon was finally brought to a halt strode jumped down ready to fight wayne woody dont hit him we need him ford said likely antagonizing wayne further shooting was halted a couple of hours until both men cooled off strode frequently performed his own stunts partly because he was such a good athlete and partly because it was hard to find a black double to match his build and looks this had also been the case on spartacus 1960 in the scene where waynes character sets fire to his house strode had to race in and drag him out of the building wayne was using a double but the 47yearold strode wasnt ford told his star duke woody is an old man and hes got to carry you and he doesnt need a double wayne decided to do the scene without one strode was amazed that a man of waynes professional and physical stature was so subservient to ford sometimes ford would holler duke and whatever john wayne was doing i dont care if his pants were down around his ankles hed stop and come running strode wrote in his autobiography i told the other actors you see duke running hes a millionaire he doesnt have to do that but that old man made him a millionaire thats respect although he had his problems with wayne strode said stewart was one of the nicest men youll ever meet anywhere in the world wayne and stewart got along very well during production stewart also liked ford immensely and was glad to be working with him again after two rode together 1961 he appreciated fords subtle direction such as in the stage holdup scene where stewarts character first encounters liberty valance stewart couldnt get a handle on it and kept flubbing his lines until ford walked over and repeated quietly in his ear you are not a coward you are not a coward that gave stewart just the cue he needed to nail the take stewarts ease with the director might have had something to do with the fact that ford was easy on him unlike the treatment of his costar wayne used to ask stewart with envy why it was that he never incurred the directors wrath one day however stewart made the mistake of giving his honest opinion when ford asked what he thought of strodes costume stewart said he found it a little uncle remuslike ford then embarrassed him in front of everyone saying one of the players seems to have some objection one of the players here doesnt seem to like uncle remus as a matter of fact im not sure he even likes negroes wayne was visibly delighted cast member ken murray called ford an ogre and said he was scared of him the one cast member who could get away with just about anything on the set was lee marvin ford appreciated him not only for his acting and his world war ii service as a marine but for marvins genuineness as a person one day ford came on the set and marvin whistled loudly through his teeth the crew froze certain there would be trouble instead ford just smiled because he recognized that what marvin was doing was giving the admirals whistle and piping the director on board on marvins first day on the set ford called him over and said you just did a movie with john wayne  the comancheros 1961 wayne did some directing on that right well thats not happening here dukes not doing anything on this picture but what i tell him marvins first scene the stage holdup in the man who shot liberty valance presented problems for the actor he couldnt seem to get a handle on his character after several takes ford instructed the stage driver not to throw down the cash box when marvin demanded it this had the effect of greatly notching up marvins anger causing him to shout now the take was printed cyril mockridge was hired to score the picture but ford used a bit of music from his 1939 young mr lincoln score under some of vera miless scenes as hallie ford later told peter bogdanovich that he used alfred newmans ann rutledge theme for the same reason in both films to evoke the feeling of lost love he also told bogdanovich that he made it apparent through this music and other means that miless character hallie had never gotten over tom doniphon wayne because he wanted wayne to be the lead rather than

the motto for john fords career although he directed in a wide range of genres ford is best known for his westerns and along with writer zane grey artist frederick remington and perhaps a few others no one did more to forge the myths of the old west its heroes and villains its codes and philosophies the look and sound and feel of it fords perspective is often a romantic even sentimental vision of our historical past but its a viewpoint that confirms the indomitable nature of americas western pioneers the man who shot liberty valance predates by just a few years revisionist westerns like sam peckinpahs the wild bunch 1969 and even fords own cheyenne autumn 1964 in which the brutality and ambiguous morality of americas relentless drive across the continent were thrown into a harsher light this film is not exactly a reversal of fords vision of the frontier but it is shot through with the darkness regret and a touch of cynicism of an older and wiser man once again as in two of his greatest works my darling clementine 1946 and the searchers 1956 we get the struggle between individual and society between wilderness and civilization between wild nature and tamed garden represented here by the desert rose cactus bloom tom brings to hallie and by sen stoddards massive irrigation project whats missing are the elegant vistas of monument valley a place ford immortalized on screen and the strong sense of destiny and history the film is dark and confined shot on a sound stage instead of the outdoors destiny here is more a matter of accident and misunderstanding and history depends entirely on whos telling it and why fords decision to shoot the entire film in black and white at the studio was taken by some reviewers of the time as a sign that the venerable filmmaker was becoming lazy and careless in his twilight years new yorker film critic pauline kael who had criticized fords western films of the forties for overemphasizing the pictorial beauty of the frontier disliked this film for never venturing outdoors but many have reevaluated the look of the man who shot liberty valance seeing in its murky darkness and confined spaces a reflection of the storys thematic gloom and pessimism foregoing the historical sweep of his cavalry films and other classics ford concentrates here on the characters and their oftensuppressed emotions motives and truths even in this however the film came under fire for employing actors notably stewart who were far too old to play themselves in flashbacks to their earlier days a look back however reveals not a cavalier casting decision but the effect of playing with the notions of truth legend and history inherent in the story we dont see the characters realistically as they were years earlier but as projections of their memories which have been distorted by legend and the fateful acts from which there is no escape director john ford producer john ford willis goldbeck screenplay james warner bellah willis
