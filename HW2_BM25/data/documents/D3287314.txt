risky assets and then borrow or lend to achieve the combination of risk and return they prefer capm  applications 2 strategic applications optimal portfolios tactical applications take advantage of mispricing asset pricing area of finance that we don not know much about current asset pricing models financial professionals do not know much about asset pricing the current models are imperfect and dont address all factors cml combination of risk free and risky assets the slope of the cml is the sharpe ratio rmrf sdmarket this is a one factor model portfolio m in cml this is the single optimal risky portfolio for everyone in the market regardless of risk aversion what occurs to the cml as borrowing costs increase the curve becomes flatter less steep this is what the curve should like given the fact that we cannot borrow at the risk free rate market portfolio criticisms the market portfolio doesnt include commodities treasuries labor markets real estate etc this is the limitation of the market portfolio why the market portfolio all investors will identify the same optimal risky portfolio m to combine with riskless asset m is the market portfolio if the supply of assets equals the demand what is the cml the unique single best cal we move investors along the cml depending on risk aversions however what we know about the cml doesnt tell us anything about what prices should be proxy for future expected returns historical prices are used as proxies for future expected returns strategic asset allocation try to overweight and underweight some allocation to take advantage of mispricing isnt this the tactical allocation who can short mutual funds are now allowed to short this deviates from the actual model assumptions only hedge funds short significantly we must assume that they short sufficiently to fulfill the model assumptions present value  risk pv  p  e cf 1r  e cf 1e r the discount rate written in terms of an expected return if you change the discount rate raise it you will get a lower price which implies a higher expected return the price investors set today is based on investors expected cash flows and required returns so a pricing model should tell us something about expected return asset pricing models asset pricing models will tell us how much return investors should get for bearing risk in the case of capm it tells us about bearing systematic riskcapm capm is an indirect pricing model if we know expected return e r then we know what the implicit pricing should be we know pricing for risky assets should be lower asset pricing models ii all these models will tell us is what expected return e r should be and we can infer the price relationship from that what factors move prices in the market 1 expected cash flows even without a change to expected cash flows there is a risk 2 discount rates these often change due to changes in the risk profile risk increase prices must fall so investors can obtain the e r in the long termrelationship between prices and risk risk increase price falls risk falls price increases capm the capm is an equilibrium model based on the laws of supply and demand of the relationship between the expected rate of return on an asset and the return covariance of that asset with all risky assets covariance is due diversification benefits capm is a 1 factor model betaunderlying assumptions of capm competition horizon perfect markets rationality homogenous expectations underlying assumptions of capm competition investors are price takers no monopoly trading powerunderlying assumptions of capm horizon one period investment horizon static model refers to a one period one time investment rf is constantunderlying assumptions of capm perfect markets no taxes no transactions costs no restrictions on short sales frictionless market there is no differential between borrowing and lending rates underlying assumptions of capm rationality investors trade off mean against standard deviation if we observe skewness in the model and preference for skewness in the model then that means the model isnt working well because capm assumes the returns will be normally distributed underlying assumptions of capm homogenous expectations all investors analyze securities in the same way with the same probabilistic forecasts total risk total risk  systematic risk  unsystematic risk unsystematic risk will be completely diversified away total risk  diversification if investors are well diversified then they only care about the systematic risk of a security the variance of a stock is irrelevant since it it has a large unsystematic component which can be diversified away beta beta is a new measure of market risk beta  covariance security market variance of market since variance of a stock is irrelevant unsystematic componeent diversified away we look at beta beta a measure of responsiveness of the price of a particular security to the market portfolio variance  beta x sdmarket2  unsystematic risk e

capm conclusions iii the expected risk premiums on the individual assets should be proportional to the risk premium on the overall market and it is a function of the individual securitys contribution to the risk of the market portfolio capm conclusions iv its derived using principles of diversification with simplified assumptions the proportionality factor is beta beta proportionality factor risk premium on asset  market risk beta x market risk premium e ri  rf  b e rm  rf this last portion is the market risk premium security market line stocks should be closely aligned with the sml if the model works examines individual asset risk premiums against a measure for systematic risk beta reward to risk ratio the slope of the sml is e ri  rfbi which is the reward to risk ratio the reward to risk ratio must be the same for each asset all assets in the market must plot on the same line beta  0 the capm then says that e ri  rf a security that is uncorrelated with the market portfolio has no relevant risk it adds nothing to the risk of our well diversified portfolio thus in a portfolio context it is riskless and should return the riskless rate a beta of 0 could still have volatility from firm specific risk  note if the security is held in isolation then that security could have a high variance beta  1 the capm says that e ri  e rm the market also has a beta of 1 so a stock with a beta of 1 should earn the same return as the overall market beta  2 this stock should earn a risk premium twice that of the market as a whole the intuition behind capm i investors hold well diversified portfolios this is a weakness of the model we know that the average investor holds a portfolio of 35 stocks this is not enough diversification if investors dont diversify they will care about unsystematic risk and thus price assets based on unsystematic risk problem with the modelthe intuition behind capm ii some of the total risk of the asset will be eliminated by diversification therefore there is no reason for the investor to demand a compensation for this risk without diversification investors will care about idiosyncratic risk but diversification makes it so investors care only about systematic riskthe intuition behind capm iii the only risk that matters is the additional risk that the security contributes to an investors portfolio the intuition behind capm iv since every investor holds the market portfolio the relevant risk is the contribution of an asset to the risk of the market portfolio systematic riskbeta  capm beta combines like e r thus if we have two

the market index rsecurity  rf alpha  beta risk premiumreading statistics summary output r square how much of the variation in y is explained by the x variable this is the amount of systematic risk 1r square is unsystematic risk it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean 100 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean in general the higher the rsquared the better the model fits your data it is also a measure of systematic risk that is the amount of r squared is the the amount of the volatility that is systematically generated we only care about the systematic portion intercept alpha the intercept is known as alpha a nonzero alpha means that there is an additional return not explained by the model alpha is the difference between what occurred and what the model expected alpha  actual  capmnegative alpha this indicates that the model overestimated the expected return it also means that the security with the negative alpha was overpriced and underperformed positive alpha this indicates that the model underestimated the expected return a portfolio manager wants a positive alpha t stats in order for data to be considered statistically significant we require t stat values in excess of 2 this corresponds with a 5 probability that were wrong to be exact we ware looking for 196 t stat p value 1  p value is equal to the confidence internal excess security coefficient this is the beta of the security the higher the beta of the security the higher the return we should get if alpha isnt 0 then beta the securitys systematic risk failed to fully explain the excess return assuming capmequation analysis ri  rf  ai  bi rmrf  ei ri  rf  the y variable it is the excess return of the security ai should be 0 if capm holds perfectly use this as a sign of whether the model works or fails bi rmrf capm systematic risk ei noise error term related to what cant be explained by the market that is firm specific risk on average the error term should have a value of 0 it captures the volatility of returns uses of capm use capm to evaluate investment managers based on alphas use capm for cost of capital purposes regulation of certain industries ex utilitiesbeta  1 return less than the market excess returnbeta  0 return is less than the rf excess returnalpha is positive then capm underestimated the return of the security and the security actually performed better over that time period the price of the security should therefor go up because its exposure to systematic risk is low this would reduce the return to be aligned with the risk that youre actually taking two camps for why capm fails to explain returns i markets work efficiently but the model is failing ii investors are irrational and investor preferences are not always based solely on riskreturn capm failure markets work but the model is the problem capm is very simple model so it is not sufficient to explain the returns capm is missing factors and the factors that are missed are being lumped into alpha the missing factors are such ones that investors care about and add risk that justifies the increased return capm failure investors are irrational investors are irrational and investor preferences are not always based on riskreturn capm works fine but investors dont get the market they act irrationally so they misprice it erturks comment a bit of both camps is at play the capm is simple but there is also a lot of less sophisticated investors out there short interest short interest can be expressed as a percentage by dividing the number of shares sold short by the total number of outstanding shares for example 3 short interest means that 3 of the outstanding shares are held short the top 10 of stocks with short interest underperform how is capm tested capm is usually tested by estimating the following regression rit  rf  a b bi  eit this test is beta against the excess return testing beta if capm is true then i the intercept a should be 0 ii the coefficient b should rm  rf what does this mean iii the assets beta should be the only factor that explains expected return if other terms such as residual variance dividend yield firm size priceearnings ratios or beta squared are added to the regression they should have no explanatory power testing capm black jensen scholes theory doesnt measure up to practice the sml has a flatter slope than capm predicts thus the differentiation in beta doesnt really explain return black proposes that practical restrictions on borrowing may explain the flatness of smlborrowing and sml when borrowing cannot be done at the lending rate the only way to increase exposure is to overload on high beta stocks this pushes prices up and expected return falls and consequently causes the sml line to flatten it also causes investors to deviate from the market portfolio testing capm result ii estimated betas are unstable the problem that arises because historical data is used what if beta changes over time blume 1971 capm does better for large portfolios beta estimation when you calculate a beta for a security or a portfolio you need a market portfolio include other assets classes more than equities the sp isnt an efficient portfolio so if you calculate a beta off that they wont be right this may explain why capm isnt working betas are wrong thus we need to find the market portfolio it must be efficient  we know this is so if it has the highest sharpe ratio r square  of total risk that can be explained by systematic risk measuring beta to measure beta accurately we need to be as inclusive as possible to the market portfolio include more asset classes because we cant find a market portfolio multifactor models were developed to attempt to explain more market portfolio the theoritical market portfolio is hard to get at labor income you take on the risk of your employers industry real estate peoples exposure to this risk is different depending on the person and market tx vs ca so there is no way to hold the market portfolio capm doesnt work i the average number of stocks in individual portfolios is 35 so investors are exposed to firm specific risk so if they are exposed they may actually require return for that risk contrary to capm assumption about diversification ii we cannot borrow at the rf so our efficient portfolios are not at maximum utility investors who are less risk averse will deviate from their market portfolio and load up on high beta stocks to obtain risk since they cant short the rf and leverage themselves that way so instead of borrowing they load up on high betas driving the expected returns down and flattening the smlbeta test two step test 1 measure beta 2 determine if high beta stocks earn higher returns in actuality there is a weak relationshipbeta tests from 1931 to 1965 the relationship between return y axis and beta x axis sits along the sml however over the past 40 years 1966  1991 higher betas have not commanded higher returns the actual sml has flattened as compared to the theoretical sml why beta has changed over the past 40 years indexing may break the relationship between return and risk may be overloading on higher beta stocks pushing prices up and returns down how does indexing affect the market mimic an index buy the stocks that are indexed this throws off the risk  return relationship the stock ought to have increased demand for a stock once its in an index so price rises and return falls betas  bad times high beta and low beta stocks perform correctly during bad time high beta stocks do worse and low beta stocks do better the high beta high return relationship is weak i the models are flawed ii models work well but investors are irrational explanations of irrationality i when looks at average investor they only hold 35 stocks exposing them to more firm specific risk ii borrowing rate does not equal the lending rate consequently the only way to increase return is to deviate from market and load up on high beta stocks pushes up those prices and depresses return estimated betas based of an index but what kind of market portfolio should we use we need to add all asset classes real estate fixed income commodities to the market portfolio 1 figure out the market portfolio 2 calculate beta against the market portfolio indexing indexing breaks the relationship between risk and return which can lead to inaccurate betas capm belief  beta capm assumes that everyone invests in the market but there is no way for the investor to hold the actual market portfolio thus people will require risk premiums that are unrelated to beta because not everyone holds the markethow to accurately measure beta be as inclusive as possible include different asset classes use multifactor models to explain more
