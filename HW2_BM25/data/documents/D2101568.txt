back table of contents for this issue pastoral confidentiality an ethical and legal responsibility the pastor’s obligation to maintain confidentiality is not only a moral obligation but also often a legal one by david o middlebrook confidentiality places a duty on clergy not to disclose information shared with them in private confidentiality is also the ethical and often legal responsibility to safeguard congregation members from unauthorized disclosures of information given in the context of a confidential pastorparishioner relationship historically pastors have had only a moral obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information given to them by congregation members in recent years however people have brought an increased number of lawsuits against pastors for invasion of privacy and other tort claims arising out of the disclosure of confidential information by a pastor or other church official the result of these suits has brought recognition that the obligation to maintain confidentiality is not only a moral obligation but also often a legal one this article will focus on pastoral confidentiality as it applies in a variety of church settings church board confidentiality in most legal relationships or transactions we deal with one another with what the law generally calls an “armslength” status this means we have no special duty or requirement to protect the other person or warn him if he is about to engage in conduct that is unwise or not in his best interests in certain situations however the law does require a higher standard of conduct we refer to such situations as having a fiduciary duty officers and directors of a corporation including a nonprofit corporation such as a church or ministry also owe a fiduciary duty to that corporation so what is fiduciary duty it is the duty to act in the best interests of the church even if doing so may not be in the best personal interests of that officer or director fiduciary duties include the duty of loyalty within this duty of loyalty is the responsibility to maintain confidentiality this means the director needs to hold all information he learns by virtue of his position on the board of directors in confidence a director should not disclose information regarding church affairs unless the church has already made a public disclosure or the public already commonly knows this information this is especially important in the case of financial information and future plans of the church one specific example of why it is important for board members to always maintain their fiduciary duties particularly the duty of loyalty is because from time to time board members may receive information that is protectable under the attorneyclient privilege the courts will waive the protections available to preserve these confidential communications if a board member discloses them outside a proper venue breaches of the duty of loyalty can result in personal liability for directors although some states have legislatively limited the liability of volunteer directors in some circumstances some organizations have directors and officers liability insurance that may protect directors from personal financial liability in certain situations most courts view whether or not a pastor or board member violated fiduciary duty based on the individual facts and circumstances of each case they will judge a church officer’s conduct on what an ordinary and prudent officer would have done or not done under similar circumstances hipaa and confidentiality the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  creates nationwide standards related to the collection retention and uses of employees’ health information the basic idea behind hipaa is that employers may not use or disclose an employee’s private health information without the employee’s written consent except for certain narrowly defined purposes generally related to treatment payment and health operations does your church have to comply with hipaa  the answer a favorite of lawyers everywhere is “it depends” the area where this issue tends to come up is with administration of the church’s health plan churches that selfadminister health plans and have over 50 participants are subject to the privacyprotection rules of hipaa  churches that are subject to hipaa will need to create document and implement a privacy plan to ensure they keep employees’ private medical information confidential this written plan needs to include designation of a certain employee as the plan’s “privacy official” to administer the plan creation of a privacytraining program and creation of internal guidelines and procedures to ensure that they protect private health information by making sure no unauthorized persons see it the plan should also include documenting authorized uses for the information creating an inspection and copying process creating a recordkeeping procedure creating notices regarding information practices and having a complaint process the law has specific requirements in each area some churches may decide the costs and risks associated with administering their own plan are not in the organization’s best interests and obtain a fully insured plan administered by third parties as a general proposition the church should be careful that the designated privacy official is not involved in hiring firing promoting or demoting fellow employees imagine a situation where the privacy official acting also as the church’s human resources director decides not to promote an employee from assistant business manager to the controller position or is the person who advises the employee of this decision imagine further that this employee knows this same privacy official just finished processing the employee’s claim for health benefits related to a heart condition if the employee were to conclude that the church denied the promotion for fear the increased demands of the new position might cause the employee to suffer a heart attack that employee might make a claim to the government for violation of hipaa  hipaa does not provide for a private lawsuit remedy but it does allow for someone to lodge a complaint that would initiate a government investigation anyone not just the employee who alleges his employer violated his privacy can initiate a complaint in addition the government on its own initiative may initiate an investigation without a complaint picking the church to be investigated at random if it desires upon launching an investigation the government will want to inspect the church’s written hipaa plan the church must maintain hipaa records for 6 years either in written or electronic form also while a hipaa violation may not allow for the filing of a private lawsuit a person could use hipaa regulations as the basis for a private lawsuit alleging other claims such as invasion of privacy or another civil violation so what about churches that do not selfadminister their own health plans employers as a general rule are not considered to be covered under the hipaa requirements the real key though is what uses the church makes of employee health information at the least the church should conduct an internal review of its access to or use of health information and create a memorandum detailing that review and any conclusions reached such as that the church does not make use of employee’s private health information and therefore does not have need to create a hipaa plan if the church is in any way involved in collecting or giving out health information — such as a church that has a fully insured health plan but that fulfills some administrative functions or monitors benefit utilization — then it needs to think about hipaa regulations many churches wonder whether hipaa prohibits them from discussing a congregant’s health issues with other members for instance if a member is in the hospital is the church permitted to list the member in the prayer request section of the church bulletin hipaa does not prohibit this type of disclosure the church however needs to consider the purpose behind hipaa before it or its ministers divulge information regarding a member’s healthrelated issues simply put the purpose of hipaa is to give an individual protected right over his health information and set rules on who can look at and receive his health information so before you discuss a congregant’s health issues with other members consider whether you have the congregant’s permission or whether the information is something that needs to remain confidential rule of thumb keep the information confidential unless the individual or immediate family gives you permission to share clergypenitent privilege the clergypenitent privilege is the legal mechanism that prevents clergy or counselors from being required to disclose confidential communications in a court proceeding this privilege belongs to the person who disclosed the information and is designed for his protection rather than for the protection of the clergy one important exception to the privilege rule deals with the issue of suits affecting the parentchild relationship in mental health counseling it may be possible to uncover information that concerns a child and that is the subject of a pending lawsuit this exception makes it critical for a church that provides counseling services to distinguish what type of services it is providing and to understand the difference it makes to the congregation if the counseling is pastoral or spiritual counseling only in many states the only exception for divulging information is for reporting child abuse if the counseling is mental health counseling lawyers can argue that the exceptions of the mental health privilege would apply and the court could compel the counselor to divulge the information in a suit involving a parentchild relationship failure to differentiate between these could give rise to liability on the part of the church and the counselor for example based on the lack of informed consent if pastorcounselor inaccurately led the person he was counseling to believe that nothing he tells the pastorcounselor can ever be revealed another situation in which the privilege would not apply is when the individual or someone authorized to act on his behalf signs a written waiver of the right to the privilege or confidentiality this eliminates the privilege and the information is subject to disclosure if a parishioner waives this privilege the pastor has no legal grounds for withholding the information and must disclose it upon proper request a recent washington state case regarding confessions made by a church member to a pastor dealt with the issue of waivers the congregant made certain confessions to his pastor regarding a murder in which he had been involved the pastor discussed it with two colleagues at the church member’s trial the court attempted to compel the pastor to testify regarding the confessions when the pastor refused stating they were confidential the judge held him in contempt of court the prosecutor argued the communications were no longer privileged because the pastor had waived the privilege by talking to others about the conversations the court ruled that while the pastor broke the rules regarding the confidentiality of the statements the congregant’s rights regarding the privileged nature of the communications were still intact essentially the court stated that only the communicant may waive his privilege the acts of another unauthorized person may not act to waive the confidential nature of these special conversations note that any waiver of the privilege that a pastor or counselor uses must be clear and specific so the person understands that anything told to the pastorcounselor will not be kept confidential if requested by a third party this does not change the confidential nature of the communication or records but does prevent the counselor and the counselee from claiming these communications are “privileged”in summary while each state’s privilege rules differ every state has some form of privilege for communications made to a member of the clergy in the context of a confessional or penitential communication child abuse reporting all 50 states have enacted childabuse laws that define responsibilities in protecting vulnerable children from abuse and neglect most state statutes define child abuse to include physical and emotional abuse neglect and sexual molestation some states now include parental substance abuse and abandonment within their definitions of child abuse states ordinarily define a child as any person under age 18 typically individuals who may be reported for abuse or neglect include individuals who have some legal responsibility for the child such as a parent legal guardian foster parent or relative every state has a statute that identifies persons who are under a legal duty to report abuse under specific circumstances whether members of the clergy are required to report suspected child abuse varies from state to state some states’ statutes include a list of mandatory reporters and define a mandatory reporter by occupation — doctor nursery school workers or nurses or the statute simply defines a mandatory reporter as “any person having a reasonable belief that child abuse has occurred” if a pastor falls within the category of a mandatory reporter the pastor must report actual or suspected instances of child abuse to the proper authorities in contrast other states’ statutes may provide that a pastor falls within the category of a permissive reporter which means that the pastor may report cases of abuse but he is not legally required to do so pastors who are mandatory reporters of child abuse under state law face an ethical dilemma when they learn information about child abuse during a confidential counseling session how should the pastor proceed should the pastor maintain the confidentiality of the privileged communication or should the pastor adhere to his legal responsibility to report the abuse to the proper designated authorities the short answer is that the response will depend on the laws of the state where the pastor lives some states have attempted to resolve the conflict of mandatory reporting versus the clergypenitent privilege by exempting clergy from the duty to report child abuse if the abuse was disclosed during counseling sessions other states have determined that any information protected by the clergypenitent privilege is not admissible in a court proceeding even though the reporting laws frequently recognize the clergypenitent privilege courts typically interpret this narrowly in the child abuse or neglect context as a general rule clergy should not assume they have no duty to report even if the clergypenitent privilege is in effect in your particular state it does not automatically excuse a failure to report for instance if the clergy learns of suspected abuse outside of the context of counseling or he does not obtain the information in confidence then the clergypenitent privilege could be held not to apply and the pastor could be liable for failure to report the suspected or actual abuse while persons who are legally required to report child abuse are subject to criminal prosecution for failure to do so instances of actual criminal prosecution are rare some clergy however have been prosecuted for failing to file a report when they were in a mandatory reporting classification and they had reasonable cause to believe abuse had occurred criminal penalties for failing to file a report vary but they typically involve short prison sentences and small fines members of the clergy must know and understand their responsibility regarding the reporting requirements for child abuse to find the specific reporting requirements

they divulge confidential information about a congregant to the question of whether people can sue clergy formalpractice we give the answerofa qualified yes as a basic concept clergy malpractice is related to a lack of professional skill and failure to exercise reasonable professional care directed against the claimant seeking such services it is based on what the clergyman did or did not do as compared to what a reasonable and prudent clergyman would have done or not done under the same set of circumstances while there may be a number of circumstances where the issue may arise one of the recurring areas is within clergy privilege most pastors understand that communications made to them by a person seeking spiritual help or guidance are confidential and privileged all jurisdictions recognize this privilege and hold that a clergyman may not be compelled to disclose what a person divulged to him malpractice claims have been asserted for violating that privilege one of the more common situations where people assert malpractice claims is in the pastoral counseling setting for example a spouse admits to his pastor during a counseling session that he is being unfaithful to his wife the pastor then tells his staff and the information gets back to the other spouse although there are a number of reported cases involving claims for clergy malpractice throughout the country each year — with some resulting in money damages being assessed against the clergyman and against the church — as a general rule the courts are rejecting the idea that there is a cause of action for clergy malpractice by that name they find there is no law recognizing such a distinct claim and there is no fiduciary relationship between the pastor and the claimant meaning the law does not require the pastor to exercise any greater care to the claimant than it would as to a stranger some courts however are finding there is such a claim and there is a special or fiduciary relationship that requires the pastor to exercise reasonable care the more common approach appears to be that the court does not recognize a claim for malpractice but does allow other claims to proceed that are independent torts such as assault defamation misappropriation of funds fraud or any other crime or tort that might apply whether your jurisdiction recognizes clergy malpractice is important because such conduct may or may not be covered under church insurance many policies make exclusions for intentional misconduct in that case the claimant may assert clergy malpractice and plead it as a negligent and not intentional action does your jurisdiction recognize clergy malpractice and if so is it covered under the church’s insurance what policies and procedures does your church have in place to remove or restrict the potential for such a claim many claims can be prevented with proper planning even if your church is ultimately found not liable for such malpractice the loss in terms of money spent to defend the case distraction and loss of purpose and damage to reputation can be enormous and farreaching final thoughts confidentiality is an important and recurring theme in the church world whether in the context of corporate boards of directors hipaa requirements the clergypenitent privilege child abuse reporting malpractice or other areas clergy members and churches need to be aware of the impact that the u s constitution andor the laws of their respective state have on their respective legal obligations of confidentiality though there are certain circumstances under which a disclosure of confidential information is not only necessary but is required unauthorized disclosures of confidential information can give rise to liability therefore you must thoroughly explore and understand the specific parameters of your responsibility to disclose or not to disclose confidential information depending on a certain set of circumstances if you are confronted with a difficult situation and are in doubt about whether or not the release of confidential information is appropriate it is sensible and in fact advisable for you to consult with an attorney who may counsel you regarding these important subjects and who can provide you with advice that will help protect both you and your church david o middlebrook j d grapevine texas is a member of the church law group he is the author of
