colorado’s governor john hickenlooper warily learns to live with pot andrew romano west coast correspondent yahoo news • april 17 2017colorado governor john hickenlooper in the colorado state capitol photo carl bower for yahoo newsmore when the people of colorado voted in 2012 to legalize recreational marijuana they instantly transformed their governor john hickenlooper into america’s most reluctant pot pioneer citing various risks the rangy democrat warned coloradans not to “ break out the cheetos or goldfish too quickly ”“if it was up to me i wouldn’t have done it” hickenlooper admitted “i opposed it from the very beginning”but the governor didn’t have a choice — and now after nearly five years of overseeing what has become a 1 billion industry he considers himself “cautiously optimistic”“we were worried about everything” hickenlooper tells yahoo news “we were worried about kid usage going up people coming into work high the branding of the state we haven’t seen anything negative in regard to any of those things”in early april hickenlooper spoke to us about the factors and forces that have softened his stance how colorado families are benefiting from legalization and his own experiences with marijuana as both a son and a father excerpts yahoo news you opposed amendment 64 saying it wasn’t worth the risk what were you afraid would happen if colorado legalized recreational marijuana gov john hickenlooper i was afraid that we would see a spike in teenage use and a rapid increase in overall use and a big part of my reluctance was that as a governor you don’t want to be in conflict with federal law even amsterdam never fully legalized marijuana — they set up a regulatory system to tax it to do something that literally no one in the world had ever done before … it’s a steep hill you have a teenage son he was 8 at the time how did being a father influence your views on legalization obviously having a son who’s just coming into the age when a lot of the brain scientists believe that this highthc marijuana is most damaging … that was difficult they say there’s a high probability that you’ll lose a sliver of your longterm memory every time you use this highthc marijuana so i was worried that teenagers like my son would think that if the adults have legalized this it must be ok nearly five years have passed since colorado embarked on this experiment what were you right to worry about what were you wrong to worry about we were wrong to worry about a dramatic spike in overall usage and teenage usage basically the people who were smoking marijuana before it was legal still are the people who weren’t smoking marijuana before it was legal still aren’t we were worried about everything we were worried about kid usage going up people coming into work high the branding of the state we haven’t seen anything negative in regard to any of those things haven’t some studies shown that teenage use is up not in colorado people fight over which data sets to use but the largest database we have — it’s thousands of kids — shows that teenage use is essentially flat in fact it’s the same thing across all age groups — with the exception of senior citizens more senior citizens appear to be smoking not a huge amount but more a 5 or 6 percent increase that’s interesting why we’re not sure if it’s pain mitigation or if it’s just baby boomers remembering their high school days  laughs i don’t know what that is would you support amendment 64 today knowing what you now know you know it’s hard to say what i’ve said before is that if i had a magic wand when it first passed and i could have reversed the vote i would have now if i had a magic wand i’d probably put it back in the drawer for a couple of years i’d want to see more data i’m not sure i’d vote for it yet but certainly the old system was a train wreck so if i had a doover — and i tell other governors this — i’d wait a couple of years let’s get more data in to see whether this thing really works colorado governor john hickenlooper in the colorado state capitol photo carl bower for yahoo newsmore what data do you want to see what do you need to know before you declare legalization an unqualified success i’d like a couple more years on teenage use just to make sure i’d also like more data on overall usage and they’re finally beginning to do scientific experiments the fact that we don’t have good data on the effects of prolonged highthc marijuana use — what it does to your longterm memory — that is to me very frustrating if no state was willing to take the first step though we’d never get these answers that’s fair louis brandeis was the first to say the states are laboratories of democracy this is a classic example has being the governor in charge of recreational legalization made it harder to talk to your son about pot no if anything it’s been easier i bet i don’t go two weeks without having a discussion with him he’s in ninth grade now so he just went into one of the big public high schools here in denver within three weeks of being there somebody offered to sell him some pot he came back and told me and i said “well you didn’t buy it did you” and he laughed and went “dad you’re so square of course i didn’t buy it you’re the governor i can’t do that”he’s politically aware  laughs well it’s politically aware but really what he meant is that he’s heard about it so much that it wasn’t even something that he’d considered and he said that none of his friends had even considered it it’s not something any of them are looking forward to experimenting with why not we spent a bunch of time and a bunch of money trying to market some of the risks of this highthc marijuana to teenagers we took the tax money and prioritized it toward the unintended consequences of legalization this year we’ll spend 10 million on tv ads and radio ads and promotions when i was a kid there was an old movie called reefer madness it was hysterical and by hysterical i don’t mean hysterically funny they were so over the top in terms of what would happen if anyone ever dared to touch marijuana so i graduated from high school in 1970 in my senior class 95 percent of the kids had tried marijuana before they graduated — they did a poll wow now it was much much weaker they say it was onesixth to oneeighth the intensity of the marijuana out there today but it was pretty commonplace so it was kind of weird reefer madness and all the hysteria that surrounded marijuana in the 1950s and earlier made us so cynical about the whole thing — and that lesson tempers how we market the risks to teenagers so that they’ll hear it did your mother ever talk to you about marijuana she never talked to me about it in terms of “don’t use it it’s dangerous” she never said one thing or another we did end up having discussions though because i tried it and she found a little bit in my room then we had a serious discussion her point was “listen if you want to break the law don’t do it in my house you’re 18 years old i can’t control everything you do but i think you’re being stupid and whatever you do you can’t break the law in my house it’s not fair”did you listen to her she was exactly right and i never did again but pot is something you experimented with when you were younger — just like 95 percent of your high school classmates yeah exactly what were your feelings about it before you became a politician i was aware that it was out there i was always surprised … sometimes you’d be at someone’s house for dinner and someone would light up a joint after the meal i was like “wow i never thought they smoked pot”  laughswhen you speak to families — parents kids husbands wives — what do they tell you about legalization and how it’s affecting them it’s all over the map there are some parents who still no matter what the data says they think it’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to the state and that their kids are at risk — unreasonable risk and i tell them “talk to any teenager before it was legalized any kid who wanted it could get it cheap” and they go “not like it is now” and i say “that’s not what the data says” but people feel that way a lot of people are still worried about their employees but it’s just like drinking drinking is legal but you can’t come in drunk same with marijuana — you can’t smoke it at work you can’t come in high if it affects your work your boss has the right to fire you do families seem to be registering any of the positive impacts there are people who are engaged in the community — especially civicminded people — who welcome the change because the old war on drugs was such a failure we were sending so many lowincome kids to prison giving them a felony on their record that was the wrong way the son of a friend of mine interviewed me for a school project about two years ago he was 17 afterwards i asked him “do you think it’s more likely that your friends will try marijuana use marijuana now that it’s legal”and he looked at me and smiled and said “are you kidding drug dealers don’t care who they sell it to so we could always get marijuana if you guys tax it right and figure out how to get rid of the black market the drug dealers then you’ll actually make it harder for us kids to get access to it”was your friend’s son right we have some anecdotal evidence that there are fewer drug dealers on the street which makes sense they estimated that marijuana was 40 to 50 percent of the drug trade if you take 40 to 50 percent of any retail sales product out of circulation you’re not going to be able to support the same number of distributors i had never really thought about that donald trump recently said “they’ve got a lot of problems going on right now in colorado some big problems” it sounds like you think trump is wrong he is every state has problems the big problems are the ones you don’t know how to deal with how have you dealt with the problems that have arisen from legalization in most cases the things we should have worried about more we’ve been able to come back and legislate a friend his 12yearold kid was at a movie went into the restroom and some other kid offered him a gummy bear infused with marijuana for 5 that’s just not right that’s the kind of stuff we didn’t anticipate but since then we’ve really come down on it now you cannot infuse anything that looks like candy — anything that looks like it’s meant for kids no little gummy bears no animals no faces none of that like most states we have caregiver rules that allow people to grow marijuana if they’re providing it to people for medical reasons our original law allowed these caregivers to grow up to 99 plants ninetynine plants you’re a factory that’s not a caregiver so this year we cut it back to 12 plants colorado governor john hickenlooper in the colorado state capitol on april 4 2017 photo carl bower for yahoo newsmore what challenges remain there are two bills working their way through the colorado legislature right now one allowing home delivery and one allowing pot clubs where do you draw the line we knew there would be a large group of people with a selfinterest in continuing to normalize pot use i personally think it’s too early to be delivering marijuana especially because of attorney general jeff sessions’ clear opposition to recreational marijuana i’ve been saying “hey let’s just take a deep breath here”what about the pot clubs there’s a possibility some people will interpret them the wrong way as somehow making pot easier for kids to get i don’t see that great a risk there that horse is out of that barn a pot club you’re not going to be able to smoke it you can’t smoke anything we have a statewide indoor health law so at a pot club you can sit around and eat edibles big deal they can do that right now the attorney general just ordered the justice department to review its policy on pot what are you going to do if sessions tries to crack down on marijuana in your state well you know amendment 64 passed 55 percent to 45 percent here polls show it’s over 60 percent approval now i took a solemn oath to uphold the constitution of the state of colorado our voters put marijuana into our constitution i don’t really have too much choice the way i look at itread more from the yahoo weed  the american
