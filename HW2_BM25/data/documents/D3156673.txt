real world examples for rational numbers rational numbers represent just a different quantity different than integers a rational number is a ratio of two integers it is very useful to point that very early that a rational number or a rational quantity is just a quotient of two integers where divisor is different than 0 or two whole numbers because kids are already familiar with integers rational numbers are quantities that sit between integers although strictly speaking integers are a subset of rational numbers because every integer divided by 1 is by definition a rational number as well set of integers is a subset of rational numbers but for the introduction it should be acceptable to show that rational numbers are quantities that are between integers for instance 75 38 1719 123127 are all rational quantities note however that they are just constructed as division of two integers7 5 3 8 17 19 123 127 hence any quotient any ratio of mn where m n belong to the set of whole numbers or integers n is different than 0 is a rational number there is another way to nicely explain introduction of rational numbers you really only have to know integers to construct all rational numbers lets say number 37258 how you get this number using only integers lets use a length unit of measure say 1 meter take one meter and divide it carefully to 258 segments obviously you can divide it to any number of segments you wish take that one small segment which is one 258th part of meter and multiply it or put one after another 37 times the length you get by adding these small segments is exactly 37258 meters note that we used only integers to obtain this new number new length you can call these kinds of lengths as you wish but someone agreed to use word rational because it is written as a ratio of two integers but what this ratio really tells you is that you use known numbers integers and do operations first division and then multiplication to obtain the new length rational number 37258 by definition is answering the question which quantity when multiplied by 258 gives exactly number 37 motivation for mathematics increased focus of a student and plenty of examples for whole numbers rational and real numbers can be made by using pirates pirates ships invent a story of a pirates ship coming to an island wind speed is 10754 ms rum bottle is 34 full surface area of sail is

tonessurface areas of squares and rectangles dvd cd surface areas tv screen surface areas calculations liquid level in the bottle or any container time measurements by watches during explanation make every attempt to clearly separate non mathematical reasoning from actual mathematical calculations in each of these examples clearly show that real world situations can be a motivation to count and measure certain objects and hence to obtain certain numbers rational integers but emphasize that those numbers and operations on them can exist by themselves too pure math also show that you can go from math to real world you can say that you want to fill 12 of a bottle with water note that here you first came up with a number 12 you dont know yet what this quantity will represent it is only a number 12 only in the next separate step you decide it will be related to a bottle of water bottle of water not 12 of a watermelon or 12 of a cake or 12 of an apple but a 12 of bottle of water one of the best examples to illustrate rational numbers may be to start with pizza here is one whole pizza thats number one but look you can have half a pizza right how many halves will make one whole pizza 2 how about one quarter of a pizza how many quarters will make one whole pizza 4 so the main question we are asking here is what is that quantity then when multiply by 4 will give the whole one thats 14 what is the quantity that when multiply by 2 will give one whole pizza its 12 lets look at that pizza again how many friends can divide the pizza so each one can have an equal slice 2 3 more sure say 10 friends even more of course there can be 120 people wanting to get a slice of one pizza each one of them will get exactly 1120th part of pizza you can see that we can divide pizza to as many slices as we want what would be other numbers to divide pizza in equal parts we surely can give examples of 19 112 1125 11279 1100242  any integer can be a divisor now lets say you want to divide 2 pizzas to say 15 friends each one will get in that case 215 part of pizza maybe you are having a big party and you have 5 pizzas and 17 friends each one will get 517 of a pizzas this quantity 517 is the real quantity it exists as a real slice how you are going to cut pizza equally is a technical issue  so we can see now that dividend ie how many pizzas you can have can be any integer you can have 1 2 5 15 20 100 pizzas and you can divide them between 2 3 120 150 friends this tells us that rational number can be represented by two integers one is dividend another is divisor like this ab  c where a can be any integer b can be any integer number c is their quotient another interesting example to illustrate rational numbers is when you want to divide juices from 5 one liters juice boxes or more to 17 friends but each one is getting a unusual size glass of 107 ml you will start filling up glasses from the first box and you can show your student how sometimes when a box is empty and the glass partially filled then the glass must be filled up from another juice box or bottle thats the nice point to introduce rational numbers too you can download this post as an article in pdf file format by clicking on the picture below or from here let me demonstrate you in one example what is the difference between pure and applied math it will help to understand where the numbers come from and why they can be used in real life situations and how mathematics can be independent discipline no matter how many real life examples are there moreover we should not move from integers to rational numbers without having another perhaps deeper look what numbers are and their relation to objects counted once this is clear then it will be way more clear how we define any kind of a number to give you an advanced start all numbers are constructed from integers either as ratios of two integers or sums of ratios of two integers ie sums of fractions finite or infinite with repeating or non repeating decimals when you se e a person writing down 2  3  you dont know what objects she might be adding but you know the result will be 5 thats actually pure mathyou see a person is writing down 2  3 … now lets say it again you don’t know what that person has in mind which objects she was counting but you know that the result will be 5 that’s so called pure math you have just abstracted pure numbers from any objects whose counts these numbers can representwhile objects counted whatever they may be  can have color weight temperature texture taste if you count apples the numbers you have just dealt with have their own properties which are magnitudes and their relations with other numbers ie great than less than equal divisible by etc but these are numbers properties and not the properties of objects we have counted investigating these numbers properties is subject of pure math one more nice point about pure math you dont need to see 5 objects to come up with the number 5 you can start with pure number 1 and add four times number 1 and you got 5 you see how even you can abstract operation of addition from any real world object that may be counted you can deal with number 1 only and by adding or subtracting number 1 you can define all integers without even counting any real world object in the same way you can construct rational numbers by dividing integers you just obtained the examples in real world comes at the point when you associate to a number a thing or object you have counted so it is true that you can obtain a number count in two ways by counting real world objects or just by declaring the number you are interested in because you just constructed them in the field of pure mathonce you are aware that you can work only with numbers or counts you are in a position to investigate properties of these counts without considering at all where they come from note though when you investigate properties of numbers no real world objects or examples enter discussion you may now want to continue to develop math as a separate discipline make more examples think of more numbers operations on them 5  3  8 3 x 4  12 8  5  3 you can say now that if you have 7 and you add 8 you will get 15 just by dealing with numbers no matter what objects and rules about them were involved you realize that you can work with numbers only and with operations you have at your disposal addition subtraction division multiplication now be sure there are no other operations in math these fours are sufficient to define all kinds of numbers and all mathematics other so called more complex operations although they are not so in many cases are just different sequences of these basic four   x  and mathematicians give them exotic names thats all this is probably the most important step you have made in learning math so far rational numbers can be quickly introduced to kids the issue may be that kids are asked for too long to deal only with integers that they may think there are no other numbers or that the other numbers must be difficult to understand since their introduction is so much postponed the major concept to explain to kids is a quantity quantity is what we deal with in mathematics make no mistake as we have shown mathematics can exist without referencing any real world examples it is because math deals only with numbers counts however math can be used in real life once you start keeping track what is counted and why the confusing thing for kids is that they continuously try to link the ways how the counts are obtained and why with mathematics thinking that the description how and why counts are obtained is a part of mathematics but it is not so mathematics knows only about numbers it does not care where they come from think about it it is you who will keep track how what when and why you have counted certain objects you can invent the game for two kids one kid will define what to count and when while the other kid will just write down the numbers do the required operations on them and tell the result back to the first kid the second kid is pure mathematician the first kid is applied mathematician this is how the thinking about math and applied math should go second kid the calculator kid will realize that the same operations and results can be applied and reused for many different requests and objects defined by the first kid students should be shown that all the other numbers rational real imaginary transcendent irrational are constructed from integers students should not be under impression that somehow rational or irrational numbers are complicated or exotic it should be shown that rational numbers are fractions and fractions are made of two integers thats it its the operation on integers in this case their division that led to new so called type of numbers but these are not new type of numbers these are just new different quantities defined in a new way that should be clear it is operations division that has been applied to two integers to obtain a new quantity somewhere in between two integers later you can show that irrational numbers the numbers that can not be represented by ratios of two integers actually can be represented by a sum though infinite of smaller and smaller fractions an irrational number cannot be written as a simple fraction but can be written as an infinite sum of smaller and smaller non repeating fractions you see using rational numbers fractions and adding them you can get rational numbers again but also you can get irrational numbers like square root of 2 which is an infinite sum of smaller and smaller fractions note about infinite sums here you may think at first that when you infinitely add quantities the sum must be infinitely big but it is not so if the quantities you add up are smaller and smaller fractions just try to add more and more elements 1 2 2n like 12  14  18  116  132  even if you use a calculator you will see that the sum is closer and closer to one 1 as you add more and more smaller fractions thats the essence of a irrational numbers as you can see knowing integers can greatly help understanding the complete number system using integers you constructed rational numbers as fractions of two integers and then on one elegant idea you obtained irrational numbers by adding up many smaller and smaller rational numbers knowing this you are absolutely ready to proceed further in mathematics very fast square root of 2 is an example of an irrational number here is another famous example of an irrational number pi 314159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 4197 note that rational number can be represented as a ratio of two integers and as a number with finite decimal places or with infinite but repeating decimals like 033333333 which is 13 irrational number can not be represented as a ratio of two integers irrational number can be represented as a number with infinite smaller and smaller but nonrepeating decimals examples are square root of 2 and pi at this point i would like to show you how mathematics can be an independent discipline and also can be and is used in many applications and disciplines in real life i will make a comparison between lines some shapes and numbers when you look at the building and you want to draw it you will draw some lines squares rectangles trying to mimic the shape of the building as truthfully as possible look at the lines you draw you draw vertical horizontal and lines at any arbitrary angle it appears that which line and where you will draw it will depend on the shape of the building and thats true now look away from the building and get a new blank sheet of paper draw a line on it draw horizontal lines vertical and at arbitrary angles you are not required to draw a building just draw lines you see how you abstracted lines and moreover you can play with them without taking care whether they represent anything in real world moreover you can draw completely new building with your lines and call a company to actually build a new object from your drawings similar things is with numbers you can count real objects and get their numbers and deal with them you can add subtract multiply numbers following the real world examples like how many litres of gas i will use if i travel 125 km with the car that consumes 89lkm etc when you calculate this or any other example you deal only with numbers you are the one who will keep track of units what you have counted but then you can notice that 7 x 5  35 regardless what is counted similar thing happened with lines you could draw lines without worrying if they represent any object in real world now you can play with numbers any number and use any operations on them without worrying do they currently represent anything in real world thats the essence of math when you do applied math you still do pure calculations while keeping aside the units what you have counted but in pure math you start with some numbers its up to you with which ones without providing reasons why they are there and do calculations on them try both scenarios and you will see the point asking someone to find a real life example of a number integer rational etc is the same as asking to find a real world example for a straight line in the same way a straight line is abstracted from all real world straight distances a number is abstracted from all the objects that have the same count looking at the line only one can not say what it represents but it he can say what line may represent the same thing is a number looking at the number one can not say what does it represent but only what it may represent the fact is mathematics doesnt need real life examples to illustrate its concepts fiction is an equal member for mathematical examples illustrations take for example vampires twilight saga is very popular now so why dont use vampires to illustrate rational numbers if a vampire sucks 27852 m l of blood per 1 minute how much blood a vampire can suck out after 7 minutes you notice real life examples are not necessary to illustrate rational numbers and for that matter many of other concepts in mathematics we can count real world objects as well as completely fictional ones math doesnt care where the numbers are coming from math cant tell real world from fictional one another example if harry potter flies 10 ms how many meters he will advance after flying 5 seconds harry potter and his flying device are fictional yet mathematics is very real despite widespread math applications no real world concept ever enters a mathematical proof hence for mathematics anything outside it can be or is a fairy tale the same way dragons from fairy tales dont enter mathematical proof so apples oranges atoms meters do not enter the proof either thats how mathematics see real world real or fictional world none of their concepts ever enters a mathematical proof you can download this post as an article as well in
