also known as anal incontinence or in some forms encopresis is a lack of control over defecation leading to involuntary loss of bowel contents—including flatus gas liquid stool elements and mucus or solid feces fi is a sign or a symptom not a diagnosis incontinence can result from different causes and might occur with either constipation or diarrhea continence is maintained by several interrelated factors including the anal sampling mechanism and usually there is more than one deficiency of these mechanisms for incontinence to develop the most common causes are thought to be immediate or delayed damage from childbirth complications from prior anorectal surgery especially involving the anal sphincters or hemorrhoidal vascular cushions and altered bowel habits eg caused by irritable bowel syndrome crohns disease ulcerative colitis food intolerance or constipation with overflow incontinence 1 an estimated 22 of community dwelling adults are affected 2fecal incontinence has three main consequences local reactions of the perianal skin and urinary tract including maceration softening and whitening of skin due to continuous moisture urinary tract infections or decubitus ulcers pressure sores 1 a financial expense for individuals due to cost of medication and incontinence products and loss of productivity employers days off and medical insurers and society generally  health care costs unemployment  and an associated decrease in quality of life 3 there is often reduced selfesteem shame humiliation depression a need to organize life around easy access to a toilet and avoidance of enjoyable activities fi is an example of a stigmatized medical condition which creates barriers to successful management people may be too embarrassed to seek medical help and attempt to selfmanage the symptom in secrecy from others fi is one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual but it is generally treatable 2 management may be achieved through an individualized mix of dietary pharmacologic and surgical measures health care professionals are often poorly informed about treatment options 2 and may fail to

and professional life emotional effects may include stress fearfulness anxiety exhaustion fear of public humiliation feeling dirty poor bodyimage reduced desire for sex anger humiliation depression isolation secrecy frustration and embarrassment some people may need to be in control of life outside of fi as means of compensation the physical symptoms such as skin soreness pain and odor may also affect quality of life physical activity such as shopping or exercise is often affected travel may be affected requiring careful planning working is also affected for most relationships social activities and selfimage likewise often suffer 4 symptoms may worsen over time 1causes  editfi is a sign or a symptom not a diagnosis 4 and represents an extensive list of causes usually it is the result of a complex interplay of several coexisting factors many of which may be simple to correct 4 up to 80 of people may have more than one abnormality that is contributing 5 deficits of individual functional components of the continence mechanism can be partially compensated for a certain period of time until the compensating components themselves fail for example obstetric injury may precede onset by decades but postmenopausal changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms 1 6 the most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after effects of anorectal surgery especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions 1 the majority of incontinent persons over the age of 18 fall into one of several groups those with structural anorectal abnormalities sphincter trauma sphincter degeneration perianal fistula rectal prolapse neurological disorders  multiple sclerosis spinal cord injury spina bifida stroke etc  constipation fecal loading presence of a large amount of feces in the rectum with stool of any consistency cognitive andor behavioral dysfunction  dementia learning disabilities  diarrhea inflammatory bowel diseases eg ulcerative colitis crohns disease irritable bowel syndrome disability related people who are frail acutely unwell or have chronic  acute disabilities and those cases which are idiopathic of unknown cause 4 7 diabetes mellitus is also known to be a cause but the mechanism of this relationship is not well understood 8congenital  editanorectal anomalies and spinal cord defects may be a cause in children these are usually picked up and operated upon during early life but continence is often imperfect thereafter 2anal canal  editthe functioning of the anal canal can be damaged traumatically or atraumatically the resting tone of the anal canal is not the only factor which is important both the length of the high pressure zone and its radial translation of force are required for continence this means that even with normal anal canal pressure focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms external anal sphincter eas dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control whereas internal anal sphincter ias dysfunction is associated with impaired fine tuning of fecal control 1 lesions which mechanically interfere with or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge such lesions include piles inflamed hemorrhoids anal fissures anal cancer or fistulae obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters and some of these injuries may be occult undetected the risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged when forceps are used with higher birth weights or when an midline episiotomy is performed only when there is post operative investigation of fi such as endoanal ultrasound is the injury discovered 2 fi is a much underreported complication of surgery the ias is easily damaged with an anal retractor especially the parks anal retractor leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15 of the resting anal tone surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status 2 partial internal sphincterotomy fistulotomy anal stretch lords operation hemorrhoidectomy or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to fi post operatively with soiling being far more common than solid fi the keyhole deformity refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence this defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall and may occur after posterior midline fissurectomy or fistulotomy or with lateral ias defects rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures spine injuries or perineallacerations insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum and sexual abuse 2 nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma damage to the pudendal nerves and ias degeneration of unknown cause 3 radiation induced fi may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum when proctitis anal fistula formation and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur 2 irradiation may occur during radiotherapy eg for prostate cancer pelvic floor  editmany people with fi have a generalized weakness of the pelvic floor especially puborectalis 3 a weakened puborectalis leads to widening of the anorectal angle and impaired barrier to stool in the rectum entering the anal canal and this is associated with incontinence to solids abnormal descent of the pelvic floor can also be a sign of pelvic floor weakness abnormal descent manifests as descending perineum syndrome 4 cm perineal descent 3 this syndrome initially gives constipation and later fi the pelvic floor is innervated by the pudendal nerve and the s3 and s4 branches of the pelvic plexus with recurrent straining eg during difficult labour or long term constipation then stretch injury can damage the nerves supplying levator ani the pudendal nerve is especially vulnerable to irreversible damage stretch induced pudendal neuropathy which can occur with a 12 stretch 2 if the pelvic floor muscles lose their innervation they cease to contract and their muscle fibres are in time replaced by fibrous tissue which is associated with pelvic floor weakness and incontinence increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency may indicate pelvic floor weakness the various types of pelvic organ prolapse eg external rectal prolapse mucosal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception  solitary rectal ulcer syndrome may also cause coexisting obstructed defecation rectum  editthe rectum needs to be of a sufficient volume to store stool until defecation the rectal walls need to be compliant ie able to distend to an extent to accommodate stool rectal sensation is required to detect the presence nature and amount of rectal contents the rectum must also be able to evacuate its contents fully there must also be efficient coordination of rectal sensation and relaxation of the anal canal 9 rectal storage capacity ie rectal volume  rectal compliance may be affected in the following ways surgery involving the rectum eg lower anterior resection often performed for colorectal cancer radiotherapy directed at the rectum and inflammatory bowel disease can cause scarring which may result in the walls of the rectum becoming stiff and inelastic reducing compliance reduced rectal storage capacity may lead to urge incontinence where there is an urgent need to defecate as soon as stool enters the rectum where normally stool would be stored until there was enough to distend the rectal walls and initiate the defecation cycle tumors and strictures also may impair reservoir function conversely increased rectal volume  megarectum  may cause fecal loading and overflow fi reduced rectal sensation may be a contributory factor  citation needed if the sensory nerves are damaged detection of stool in the rectum is dulled or absent and the person will not feel the need to defecate until too late rectal hyposensitivity may manifest as constipation fi or both rectal hyposensitivty was reported to be present in 10 of people with fi 10 pudendal neuropathy is one cause of rectal hyposensitivity and may lead to fecal loadingimpaction megarectum and overflow fi 11 normal evacuation of rectal contents is 90100 2 if there is incomplete evacuation during defecation residual stool will be left in the rectum and threaten continence once defecation is finished this is a feature of people with soiling secondary to obstructed defecation 12 obstructed defecation is often due to anismus paradoxical contraction or relaxation failure of the puborectalis 2 38 whilst anismus is largely a functional disorder organic pathologic lesions may mechanically interfere with rectal evacuation other causes of incomplete evacuation include nonemptying defects like a rectocele straining to defecate pushes stool into the rectocele which acts like a diverticulum and causes stool sequestration once the voluntary attempt to defecate albeit dysfunctional is finished the voluntary muscles relax and residual rectal contents are then able to descend into the anal canal and cause leaking 2 37drugs that may exacerbate fi and diarrhea 13drugmechanism of action common examples drugs altering sphincter tone nitrates calcium channel antagonists betaadrenoceptor antagonists  betablockers  sildenafil selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors broad spectrum antibiotics

requires conscious and subconscious networking of information from and to the anorectum defectsbrain damage may affect the central nervous system focally eg stroke tumor eg spinal cord lesions trauma multiple sclerosis or diffusely eg dementia multiple sclerosis infection parkinsons disease or druginduced 1 14 fi and urinary incontinence may also occur during epileptic seizures 15 dural ectasia is an example of a spinal cord lesion that may affect continence 16diarrhea  editliquid stool is more difficult to control than formed solid stool hence fi can be exacerbated by diarrhea 4 some consider diarrhea to be the most common aggravating factor 2 where diarrhea is caused by temporary problems such as mild infections or food reactions incontinence tends to be short lived chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or crohns disease can cause severe diarrhea lasting for weeks or months diseases drugs and indigestible dietary fats that interfere with the intestineal absorption may cause steatorrhea oily rectal discharge  fatty diarrhea and degrees of fi respective examples include cystic fibrosis orlistat and olestra postcholecystectomy diarrhea is diarrhea that occurs following gall bladder removal due to excess bile acid  citation needed orlistat is an antiobesity weight loss drug that blocks the absorption of fats this may give side effects of fi diarrhea and steatorrhea 17overflow incontinence  editthis may occur when there is a large mass of feces in the rectum fecal loading which may become hardened  fecal impaction  liquid stool elements are able to pass around the obstruction leading to incontinence megarectum enlarged rectal volume and rectal hyposensitivity are associated with overflow incontinence hospitalized patients and care home residents may develop fi via this mechanism 4 possibly a result of lack of mobility reduced alertness constipating effect of medication andor dehydration pathophysiology  editstylized diagram showing action of

structure of anal canal see also defecation the mechanisms and factors contributing to normal continence are multiple and interrelated the puborectalis sling forming the anorectal angle see diagram is responsible for gross continence of solid stool 3 the ias is an involuntary muscle contributing about 55 of the resting anal pressure together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions the ias maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest the eas is a voluntary muscle doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction which is possible for a short time the rectoanal inhibitory reflex rair is an involuntary ias relaxation in response to rectal distension allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency the rectoanal excitatory reflex raer is an initial semivoluntary contraction of the eas and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the rair other factors include the specialized antiperistaltic function of the last part of the sigmoid colon which keeps the rectum empty most of the time sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present its consistency and quantity and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal problems affecting any of these mechanisms and factors may be involved in the cause 2diagnostic approach  editidentification of the exact causes usually begins with a thorough medical history including detailed questioning about symptoms bowel habits diet medication and other medical problems digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and voluntary contraction maximum squeeze of the sphincter complex and puborectalis anal sphincter defects rectal prolapse and abnormal perineal descent may be detected 3 anorectal physiology tests assess the functioning of the anorectal anatomy anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction the procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum anal electromyography tests for nerve damage which is often associated with obstetric injury pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves proctography also known as defecography shows how much stool the rectum can hold how well the rectum holds it and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool it will also highlight defects in the structure of the rectum such as internal rectal intussusception dynamic pelvic mri also called mri defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems 18 proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope a long thin flexible tube with a camera into the anal canal rectum and sigmoid colon the procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause such as inflammation tumors or scar tissue endoanal ultrasound which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions 19 evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen functional fi is common 20 the rome process published diagnostic criteria for functional fi which they defined as recurrent uncontrolled passage of fecal material in an individual with a developmental age of at least 4 years the diagnostic criteria are one or more of the following factors present for the last 3 months abnormal functioning of normally innervated and structurally intact muscles minor abnormalities of sphincter structureinnervation nerve supply normal or disordered bowel habits ie fecal retention or diarrhea and psychological causes furthermore exclusion criteria are given these are factors which all must be excluded for a diagnosis of functional fi and are abnormal innervation caused by lesion s within the brain eg dementia spinal cord at or below t12  or sacral nerve roots or mixed lesions eg multiple sclerosis or as part of a generalized peripheral or autonomic neuropathy eg due to diabetes anal sphincter abnormalities associated with a multisystem disease eg scleroderma and structural or neurogenic abnormalities that are the major cause 21definition  editthere is no globally accepted definition 1 but fecal incontinence is generally defined as the recurrent inability to voluntarily control the passage of bowel contents through the anal canal and expel it at a socially acceptable location and time occurring in individuals over the age of four 1 2 3 4 6 social continence has been given various precise definitions for the purposes of research however generally it refers to symptoms being controlled to an extent that is acceptable to the individual in question with no significant effect on their life there is no consensus about the best way to classify fi 4 and several methods are used symptoms can be directly or indirectly related to the loss of bowel control the direct primary symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment indirect secondary symptoms which are the result of leakage include pruritus ani an intense itching sensation from the anus perianal dermatitis irritation and inflammation of the skin around the anus and urinary tract infections 1 due to embarrassment people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms such as protrusion of mucosa in external rectal prolapse symptoms of fecal leakage fl are similar and may occur after defecation there may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear 2types  editfi can be divided into those people who experience a defecation urge before leakage urge incontinence and those who experience no sensation before leakage passive incontinence or soiling 4 urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden need to defecate with little time to reach a toilet urge and passive fi may be associated with weakness of the external anal sphincter eas and internal anal sphincter ias respectively urgency may also be associated with reduced rectal volume reduced ability of the rectal walls to distend and accommodate stool and increased rectal sensitivity 3there is a continuous spectrum of different clinical presentations from incontinence of flatus gas through incontinence of mucus or liquid stool to solids the term anal incontinence often is used to describe flatus incontinence 4 however it is also used as a synonym for fi generally it may occur together with incontinence of liquids or solids or it may present in isolation flatus incontinence may be the first sign of fi 2 once continence to flatus is lost it is rarely restored 4 anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types 22 fecal leakage fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of fi and describe incontinence of liquid stool mucus or very small amounts of solid stool they cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity staining soilage seepage and accidents 1 rarely minor fi in adults may be described as encopresis fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of incontinence discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of ias function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum solid stool incontinence may be called complete or major incontinence and anything less as partial or minor incontinence ie incontinence of flatus gas liquid stool andor mucus 2in children over the age of four who have been toilet trained a similar condition is generally termed encopresis or soiling which refers to the voluntary or involuntary loss of usually soft or semiliquid stool 23 the term pseudoincontinence is used when there is fi in children who have anatomical defects eg enlarged sigmoid colon or anal stenosis  2 encopresis is a term that is usually applied when there are no such anatomical defects present the icd10 classifies nonorganic encopresis under behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence and organic causes of encopresis along with fi 24 fi can also be classified according to gender since the cause in females may be different from males for example it may develop following radical prostatectomy in males 25 whereas females may develop fi as an immediate or delayed consequence of damage whilst giving birth pelvic anatomy is also different according to gender with a wider pelvic outlet in females clinical measurement  editseveral severity scales exist the cleveland clinic wexner fecal incontinence score takes into account five parameters that are scored on a scale from zero absent to four daily frequency of incontinence to gas liquid solid of need to wear pad and of lifestyle changes 1 the parks incontinence score uses four categories1  those continent for solid and liquid stool and also for flatus2  those continent for solid and liquid stool but incontinent for flatus with or without urgency3  those continent for solid stool but incontinent for liquid stool or flatus4  those incontinent to formed stool complete incontinence 26the fecal incontinence severity index is based on four types of leakage gas mucus liquid stool solid stool and five frequencies once to three times per month once per week twice per week once per day twice or more per day other severity scales include ams pescatori williams score kirwan miller score saint marks score and the vaizey scale 2differential diagnosis  editfi may present with signs similar to rectal discharge eg fistulae proctitis or rectal prolapse pseudoincontinence encopresis with no organic

surgery or both 2 the success of treatment depends upon the exact causes and how easily these are corrected 4 treatment choice depends on the cause and severity of disease and the motivation and general health of the person effected commonly conservative measures are used together and if appropriate surgery carried out treatments may be attempted until symptoms are satisfactorily controlled a treatment algorithm based upon the cause has been proposed including conservative nonoperative and surgical measures neosphincter refers to either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial bowel sphincter lavage refers to retrograde rectal irrigation 2 conservative measures include dietary modification drug treatment retrograde anal irrigation biofeedback retraining anal sphincter exercises incontinence products refer to devices such as anal plugs and perineal pads and garments such as diapersnappies perineal pads are efficient and acceptable for only minor incontinence 2 if all other measures are ineffective removing the entire colon may be an option  citation neededdiet  editdietary modification may be important for successful management 3 both diarrhea and constipation can contribute to different cases so dietary advice must be tailored to address the underlying cause or it may be ineffective or counter productive in persons with disease aggravated by diarrhea or those with rectal loading by soft stools the following suggestions may be beneficial increase dietary fiber reduce wholegrain cereals  bread reduce fruit and vegetables which contain natural laxative compounds  rhubarb figs prunes  plums  limit beans pulses cabbage and sprouts reduce spices especially chilli  reduce artificial sweeteners eg sugar free chewing gum  reduce alcohol especially stout beer and ale  reduce lactose if there is some degree of lactase deficiency and reduce caffeine caffeine lowers the resting tone of the anal canal and also causes diarrhea excessive doses of vitamin c magnesium phosphorus andor calcium supplements may increase fi reducing olestra fat substitute which can cause diarrhea may also help 27medication  editpharmacological management may include antidiarrhealconstipating agents and laxativesstool bulking agents stopping or substituting any previous medication that causes diarrhea may be helpful in some see table  there is not good evidence for the use of any medications however 28in people who have undergone gallbladder removal the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine may help minor degrees of fi 29 bulking agents also absorb water so may be helpful for those with diarrhea a common side effect is bloating and flatulence topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used such as topical antifungals when there is evidence of perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical antiinflammatory medication prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing moisturization and use of a skin protectant 30other measures  editevacuation aids  suppositories or enemas eg glycerine or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed people may have poor resting tone of the anal canal and consequently may not be able to retain an enema in which case transanal irrigation retrograde anal irrigation may be a better option as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation a volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus people can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes but it does require special equipment if the irrigation is efficient stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours 31 by regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation controlled bowel function is often reestablished to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence andor constipation this enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine 31 however persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents consequently the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare the effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably some individuals experience complete control of incontinence and other report little or no benefit 31 it has been suggested that if appropriate people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation 4biofeedback the use equipment to record or amplify and then feed back activities of the body is a commonly used and researched treatment but the benefits are uncertain 32 biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered but it is unknown if one type has benefits over another 32the role of pelvic floor exercises and anal sphincter exercises in fi is poorly determined while there may be some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators these exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles mainly levator ani the anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group but the eas is a voluntary striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner it has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them this kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness more rarely are they used in fi the effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength speed or endurance of voluntary contraction eas 32electrical stimulation can also be applied to the anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises similar to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tens the evidence supporting its use is limited and any benefit is tentative 33 in light of the above intraanal electrical stimulation using an anal probe as electrode appears to be more efficacious than intravaginal using a vaginal probe as electrode 33 rarely skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves 32 tens is also sometimes used to treat fi by transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation 34in a minority of people anal plugs may be useful for either standalone therapy or in concert with other treatments 35 anal plugs sometimes termed tampons aim to block involuntary loss of fecal material and they vary in design and composition 4 polyurethane plugs were reported to perform better than those made of polyvinylalcohol 35 plugs are less likely to help those with frequent bowel movements 2 and many find them difficult to tolerate 35in women a device that functions as an inflatable balloon in the vagina has been approved for use in the united states 36surgery  editmain article surgical management of fecal incontinence surgery may be carried out if conservative measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence there are many surgical options and their relative effectiveness is debated due to a lack of good quality evidence the optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and nonsurgical treatments 37 the surgical options can be considered in four categories restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function sphincteroplasty sacral nerve stimulation tibial nerve stimulation correction of anorectal deformity replacement  imitation of the sphincter or its function anal encirclement secca procedure nondynamic graciloplasty perianal injectable bulking agents dynamic sphincter replacement artificial bowel sphincter dynamic graciloplasty antegrade continence enema  malone procedure  and finally fecal diversion eg colostomy 1 a surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed isolated sphincter defects iaseas may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation functional deficits of the eas andor ias ie where there is no structural defect or only limited eas structural defect or with neurogenic incontinence may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation if this fails neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated substantial muscular andor neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially 6epidemiology  editfi is thought to be very common 1 but much underreported due to embarrassment one study reported a prevalence of 22 in the general population 2 it affects people of all ages but is more common in older adults but it should not be considered a normal part of aging 38 females are more likely to develop it than males 63 of those with fi over 30 may be female 1 in 2014 the national center for health statistics reported that one out of every six seniors in the u s who lived in their own home or apartment had fi men and women were equally affected 39 45–50 of people with fi have severe physical andor mental disabilities 1risk factors include age female gender urinary incontinence history of vaginal delivery non caesarean section childbirth obesity 22 prior anorectal surgery poor general health and physical limitations combined urinary and fecal incontinence is sometimes termed double incontinence and it is more likely to be present in those with urinary incontinence 40traditionally fi was thought to be an insignificant complication of surgery but it is now known that a variety of different procedures are associated with this possible complication and sometimes at high levels examples are midline internal sphincterotomy 8 risk lateral internal sphincterotomy fistulectomy fistulotomy 1852 hemorrhoidectomy 33 ileoanal reservoir reconstruction lower anterior resection total abdominal colectomy ureterosigmoidostomy 22 and anal dilation lords procedure 050 41 some authors consider obstetric trauma to be the most common cause 42history  editwhile the first mention of urinary incontinence occurs in 1500 bc in the ebers papyrus the first mention of fi in a medical context is unknown 43 for many centuries colonic irrigation was the only treatment available stoma creation was described in 1776 fi associated with rectal prolapse in 1873 and anterior sphincter repair in 1875 during the mid 20th century several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened 44 muscle transpositions using the gluteus maximus or the gracilis were devised but did not become used widely until later endtoend sphincteroplasty is shown to have a high failure rate in 1940 in 1971 parks and mc partlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure biofeedback is first introduced in 1974 45 in 1975 parks describes post anal repair a technique to reinforce the pelvic floor and eas to treat idiopathic cases endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991 which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries in 1994 the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic mri shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously during the last 20 years dynamic graciliplasty sacral nerve stimulation injectable perianal bulking agents and radiofrequency ablation have been devised mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures 44society and culture  editpersons with this symptom are frequently ridiculed and ostracized in public it has been described as one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual in older people it is one of the most common reasons for admission into a care home persons who develop fi earlier in life are less likely to marry and obtain employment often people will go to great lengths to keep their condition secret it has been termed the silent affliction since many do not discuss the problem with their close family employers or clinicians they may be subject to gossip hostility and other forms of social exclusion 46 47 48 the economic cost has not received much attention in the netherlands outpatients were reported to have total costs of €2169 annually and over half of this was productivity loss in work in the usa the average lifetime cost treatment and followup was 17166 per person in 1996 the average hospital charges for sphincteroplasty was 8555 per procedure overall in the usa the total charges associated with surgery increased from 34 million in 1998 to 575 million in 2003 sacral nerve stimulation dynamic graciloplasty and colostomy were all shown to be cost effective 49japan  editamong the most offensive insults in japan on the same level as fuck in english relate to incontinence such as kusotarekusottare and shikkotare which mean shit hangerleakeroozer
