in this issue introduction annual gifts donee’s tax treatment lifetime estate and gift credit gifts in trust joint accounts tax consequences of gifts introduction i often receive the following email “my parents made a gifted me either money or stock how much tax must i pay” the answer absent exceptional circumstances no tax is owed by the recipient of a gift u s law taxes the giver donor for the privilege of transferring property whether the transfer occurs during life gift tax or at death estate tax thus gift and estate taxes are imposed on gratuitous transfers of property both gift and estate taxes have significant exemptions available to the donor annual gifts every u s taxpayer donor may gift up to 11000 per calendar year per recipient donee without the imposition of a gift tax there is no limitation on the number of individuals that may receive an annual gift of 11000 or less married couples may together make gifts worth up to 22000 per year per donee therefore a husband and wife with three children may gift each of them or anybody else 22000 per person per year 66000 total the annual gifttax exclusion applies to gifts of a present interest an actual and complete transfer but not to gifts of a future interest such as a gift to a trust discussed below donee’s tax treatment the donee receives a carryover basis which is the same basis that the donor had in the property or the fair market value of the property whichever is lower for example if the donor’s basis in a share of gifted stock is 40 and the fair market value is 100 the donee’s basis is 40 and an immediate sale of the stock will produces a 60 gain if the stock’s fair market value drops to 25 when the gift is made donee’s basis is 25 and an immediate sale at 25 produces no gain or loss in these circumstances it is usually advantageous for the donor to sell the stock recognize a 15 loss and gift the donee cash proceeds of 25 lifetime estate and gift credit now the confusing part in addition to the annual gifttax exclusion every u s taxpayer has a lifetime credit that may be applied to gift and estate taxes although the application to gifts is limited to 1 million even though the credit is 1500000 for tax years 2004 and 2005 use of the lifetime credit becomes an issue when the donor makes a gift of a future interest or a present gift of more than 11000 in a calendar year to the same beneficiary for example assume father makes a 100000 cash gift to his daughter during calendar year 2004 the annual gifttax exclusion covers the first 11000 so the excess gift is 89000 the donor has the option of paying gift taxes on the 89000 or reducing his lifetime credit if he chooses to reduce the lifetime credit the overall credit is reduced from 15 million to 1411000 and the gifttax portion of the credit is reduced from 1 million to 911000 gifts in trust a gift in trust is considered a gift of a future interest which means the annual gifttax exclusion does not apply not to worry attorneys have devised a method to make gifts in trust qualify for the annual gifttax exclusion by providing the doneebeneficiary with the present right to withdraw funds transferred to the trust of course along with the power given to the beneficiary to withdraw the funds comes the notsosubtle threat that if the beneficiary actually does withdraw the funds no additional gifts will be made and disinheritance is a real possibility gifts made to a trust for the benefit of one’s children or grandchildren is a common estateplanning technique often life insurance is placed in an irrevocable trust using the annual gifttax exclusion to fund the insurance premiums for these trusts in general the beneficiary ies is given the present right to withdraw contributions joint accounts adding a joint tenant to a bank or investment account is not a gift unless and until the joint tenant actually withdraws money joint tenancy is a form of ownership in which the last surviving tenant receives the entire property because the donor may withdraw the entire amount at any time no gift occurs until the doneejoint tenant actually receives funds correction to may’s newsletter the time period for occupying a residence for purposes of the residence exclusion is 24 of the 60month period prior to sale the newsletter mistakenly stated the time period was 50 months
