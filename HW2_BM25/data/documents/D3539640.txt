while cobra commanders birth name and childhood are unknown he is believed to be a north american citizen born in the midtwentieth century his only known relative an older brother named dan enlisted in the military during the vietnam war and volunteered for repeated tours to spare his younger sibling from conscription during this time the man who would become cobra commander worked as a used car salesman when dan returned from vietnam he displayed deep psychological trauma and took to selfdestructive behavior resulting in his death in a car collision with another family devastated by the loss of his brother the future cobra commander blamed the familys survivor another war veteran against whom the young cobra commander formed an elaborate revenge scheme 23 24cobra commander tracked the former soldier to japan where he was training to become a member of the arashikage ninja clan the commander approached the mercenary firefly to assassinate the soldier but firefly referred cobra commander to zartan another assassin who infiltrated the clan but ultimately killed the wrong man the hard master  storm shadow was blamed for the murder and his search for his uncles killer would

wife found out what had happened in japan she threatened to go to the authorities cobra commander abandoned his wife taking billy with him living on the road and earning a living by increasingly illicit scams and con jobs the soontobe commander blamed all his problems on the american social system and traveled in search of people who shared his desire to topple big business and the government using money earned from pyramid schemes to attract followers it was during these early meetings that he first began wearing a blue hood to mask his civilian identity 26 27he then moved operations to springfield an average small american town which had suffered economic collapse through his criminal skills he revived springfields fortunes and used cash and charisma to win converts to his cause eventually he seized control of the entire town and used it as a base to grow his organization into the paramilitary group cobra this corrupting rise to power distanced cobra commander from his son enough that billy eventually joined the underground anticobra resistance from springfield cobras agents spread throughout the world overturning or subverting unstable governments to establish criminal networks and profitable arms trades the organization also explored dangerous and experimental technology including mindscanners and battle robots cobra became a significant international threat becoming so large that cobra commander could no longer control it on his own he created a high command of his most skilled lieutenants which included zartan baroness anastasia de cobray scottish arms dealer james mc cullen destro and australian mercenary major sebastian bludd 28this led to frequent powerstruggles within the organization and ultimately the baroness and major bludd enacted a plot to assassinate the commander and seize control of cobra in a twist of fate the conspirators recruited billy to carry out the assassination but he was intercepted by destro 29 cobra commander had no qualms about torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy yet billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit storm shadow later freed billy and they both escaped to new york where storm shadow trained him in ninjitsu billy was later caught in the crossfire between the soft master and cobra agent scrapiron resulting in an explosion which seemingly killed billy and several others

assumed civilian disguises to travel incognito cobra commander was depicted as an average physically fit caucasian with a pony tail large round greenspectacle sunglasses and a long slender mustache although only a convenient disguise at the time this civilian look would resurface on subsequent unmaskings a police officer soon recognized the commander from a picture carried by an accident victim the commanders son billy who had survived the explosion but lost a leg and an eye unnerved by the discovery the commander swore to take responsibility for billys condition and promised to be a better father 32still incognito the commander traveled to denver where he sought out the undercover crimson guard agent fred vii a mechanical genius billy eventually awoke from the coma with acute amnesia and a new motorized prosthetic leg built by fred after an encounter with the blind master and storm shadows cousin jinx billy recovered his memory and immediately rejected his father whereupon the commander renounced the organization he had founded declaring that his ambitions had cost him the only things that truly mattered fred vii in return shot cobra commander in the back apparently killing him 33 34fred vii then impersonated the commander himself traveling to cobra island to vie for control of cobra with serpentor eventually sparking the cobra civil war unknown to fred vii he had been under surveillance by another crimson guardsman when he buried the commanders body this agent discovered that cobra commander was not dead and brought him back to health thereafter the commander

new leader he discovered the empty grave upon which the original cobra commander revealed himself and seized open control of cobra 34 35hardened by his death and betrayal at the hands of those he once thought loyal the resurgent commander was even more ruthless than before his first act was to eliminate those who tried to murder him or came to know of the act subsequently fred vii raptor firefly mindbender zartan billy and numerous unnamed cobra personnel all of whom he had buried alive within a volcano later he established a brainwashing program to compel allegiance from those around him

face plate mask the lower portion of the mask has fangs engraved around the jaw line unlike other incarnations of the character this version of cobra commander  usually just called the commander  is extremely reclusive and his existence is only known to only select highprofile cobra subordinates such as the twins tomax and xamot and the baroness cobra commanders personality is also much more passiveaggressive and introspective having captured the g i joe spy chuckles cobra commander refuses to allow tomax and xamot to kill the spy opting instead to personally recruit chuckles by taking him into his confidence and promising him revenge against xamot in issue 12 of g i joe cobra xamot attempts to set up cobra commander to be killed and chuckles to be blamed only to learn the commander

several chinese triads 63the first action krake takes as commander is to openly invade the southeast asian nation of nanzhao and steal its gold reserves during the invasion he destroys heroin poppy fields so it initially looks to the world like cobra is overthrowing a brutal regime and fighting the drug trade it also drives up the price of heroin a drug cobra deals in 64 the cobra council are then slaughtered by krakes agents giving him full command of cobra 65 writers chuck dixon and mike costa have said that while the previous commander allowed his subordinates to pursue their own goals so long as they kick back to him and was content to profit invisibly krake wants to be known and wants to be powerful and wants to rule the world in the most supervillainy sense with his leadership cobra shifts from a sneaky shadowy cabal to an actual military presence 66g i joe origins involves a psychotic exstock broker who murders his family and several law enforcement officers when his crimes are discovered calling himself the chimera and gathering a militia around him he is one of the first villains that g i joe faces it is also noted that he started the subprime mortgage crisis of

security by the un with ironblood being labeled world enemy 1 68in 1985 hasbro began moves to market g i joe in the uk under the action force name this would affect the comic version of battle action force as the writers were to get rid of the red shadows and baron ironblood and replace them with cobra and cobra commander to preserve continuity within the comic the decision was made to transform baron ironblood in to the action force version of cobra commander 69the transition came as baron ironblood grew tired of his groups failures and decided to destroy the red shadows by secretly informing action force of the groups bases going into hiding ironblood relocated to southeast asia where he had plastic surgery on his face constructed a new mask and costumed identity that of cobra

weekly cobra commander is a featured character starting from issue 1 where he is depicted as bald 70 destro believes cobra commanders excesses are the greatest risk to cobras success cartoons  editsunbow  editin the first season of the original 1980s g i joe a real american hero cartoon cobra commander is the leader of cobra described in the shows opening theme as a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world his face is always covered either by a featureless chrome mask concealing his entire face or by a hood with eyehole cutouts he wears a blue military uniform occasionally sporting a cape and carrying a scepter depending on the occasion his distinctively shrill raspy voice was provided by chris latta 71 he had a knack for concocting creative schemes for world domination  including cloned dinosaurs giant amoebas miniaturized troops stowed away inside christmas presents and using a superlaser to gleefully carve a picture of his face on the moon  plans which his immediate subordinates particularly destro often blasted as ridiculous the writers later commented that they only found cobra commanders personality when they stopped writing him as an adolf hitler type and started writing him more in the vein of yosemite sam season 2 opened with the 5episode miniseries arise serpentor arise in which elements of cobra disillusioned by cobra commander decide to literally create a new leader to replace him acting as an operation to create a supersoldier cobra agents are sent around the world to collect dna samples retrieved from the tombs of historys most notorious despots to genetically craft cobra commanders successor serpentor who immediately assumes charge of cobra and deposes the erstwhile commander to the status of lackey fortunately for the commander g i joe managed to interfere with the gene collection to deny serpentor the critical inclusion of sun tzu s dna and it is instead replaced with sgt slaughters the absence of that influence and the addition of sgt slaughters dna makes serpentor prone to impulsive foolhardiness which shows during a fullscale attack on washington d c cobra commander is able to rescue the high command from certain disaster and slyly saves himself by convincing serpentor that he truly needs him as a scapegoat thereafter cobra commander seems to be employed as cobras primary field commander while serpentor leads mostly from the terrordrome serpentor even allowed cobra commander to be the organizations secondincommand a decision tolerated by the rest of the cobra high command cobra commander spent most of season 2 trying to reclaim his former glory from under serpentors domineering shadow assembling his own secret society called the coil to that end g i joe the movie explained cobra commanders origin in full in contradiction to background information previously seen in the animated series cobra commander is revealed to be a former scientist and nobleman from the ancient prehuman society of cobrala although humanoid in appearance he has pale blue skin no hair and eyes with catlike pupils the nobleman was disfigured by mutative spores in a laboratory accident causing him to grow an array of eight additional eyes over his face explaining why he wears a mask despite this deformity his ambition was recognized and he was selected by cobralas ruler golobulus to venture from their isolated himalayan kingdom into the outside world he was instructed to establish an army for the razing of human civilization and reemergence of cobrala into the rest of the world that army is cobra 34 72 this origin stands in contrast to the episode twenty questions where the commander told an interviewing journalist that he was responsible for spearheading a mutiny at his military academy in his youth in other episodes aforementioned reactions to offscreen unmaskings or glimpses of the commanders features are not in keeping with the inhumanly blueskinned figure portrayed in the movie in light of cobras constant failures golobulus decides to put the commander on trial and punishes him by forcing his further exposure to the spores whose effect begins to devolve him into a snake he escapes with joe member roadblock but cobra commanders humanity inevitably slips away as his body transforms literally loses his human form and ultimately becomes mentally unresponsive and fully changes him into an oversized snake during the joe assault on cobrala he is last seen coming to lt falcon s rescue during the final battle and foils serpentors attack allowing g i joe to defeat serpentor and golobulus and save the world 72di c series  editafter the movie as seen in g i joe a real american hero cobra commander is still in his snake form and kept as a pet by serpentor however baroness restores him partly to a semihuman form—through exposure to an ancient primordial energy called dragonfire which is the focal point of the first five episodes of the new series the basic shape of his body is humanoid his skin and features are reptilian and he retains a taste for flies that he catches with his prehensile tongue his intellect is fully restored and upon being outfitted with his battle armor cobra commander once again appears to be a humanoid male he regains control of cobra and even dispatches serpentor using the new found dragonfire energy to turn him into an oversize iguana cobra commanders inhuman origins are never mentioned again and he is never shown to have reptilian features again in season 2 he resumes wearing his original cloth mask and
