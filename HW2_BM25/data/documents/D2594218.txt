part 2 identifying a terminated contract1 determine if a contract has ended through abandonment abandonment occurs when neither party completes their obligations under the contract whether purposefully or inadvertently by the time the contract specifies 5 if both parties abandon a contract the contract is terminated and ceases to have any legal effect for instance imagine you contract with a friend to sell your car for 500 on july 1 2014 at 10 am on that day neither of you show up you don’t bring the car and your friend doesn’t bring the money this contract has been abandoned because neither party did what they were supposed to under the contract it is not termination by mutual agreement because you did not agree together to terminate the contract because abandonment occurs without any express agreement between the parties unlike a mutual termination agreement it may be difficult to tell whether the contract has been abandoned if one party abandons the contract but the other party does not the contract will remain in effect and the nonperforming party may be liable for breach of contract2 identify a material breach of contract if one party breaches a contract the other party may terminate the contract and refuse to abide by its terms 6 7 a material breach of contract occurs if one party receives some act good performance or service substantially different from what is specified in the contract in these cases the nonbreaching party is justified in terminating the contract because of a breach she is also entitled to damages or remedies for breach of contract 8for example if you hired a children’s birthday party clown and were sent a benjamin franklin impersonator instead this would be a material breach of contract as another example if you hire a contractor to paint your home and the contractor shows up one month after the contracted start date you would be justified in terminating the contract because of the contractor’s material breach3 be realistic about minor breaches of contract a minor breach occurs when one party fails to perform some element of the contract but the rest of the contract is fulfilled in the case of minor breach the nonbreaching party is not permitted to terminate the rest of the contract in most cases a minor breach does not cause a significant loss but if the nonbreaching party has some losses he or she may be eligible to recover damages or remedies 9for example if you hire a contractor who shows up 20 minutes late on the first day the breach is not serious enough to warrant termination if you believe a breach is serious enough to warrant termination be sure to keep all documents and materials related to the contract and the breach if the other party tries to fight the termination calling it a minor breach you’ll have documentation to support your claim of a major breach4 assess whether there has been nonfulfillment of a contingent condition the obligations of a contract may be contingent on a particular condition occurring conditions may be acts or events failure to meet a condition will terminate the parties’ obligations under the contract if a contingent condition does not occur the contract is immediately terminated unless the parties affirmatively agree that the condition is excused and that the contract will remain in effect there are two common types of conditions conditions precedent and conditions subsequent 10a condition precedent means that the contract does not become binding until a contingent act or event occurs for example many home sale contracts include a contingent condition that the sale will not be finalized until the house passes a building inspection if the house does not pass the building inspection the contract of sale is terminated 11a condition subsequent means that a previously binding contract will end upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the contingent act or event for example an employer hires an employee with the condition that the employee finish college and get her degree within six months of her hire date if the employee does not finish college and get her degree within six months the contract is terminated5 determine if a contract has been terminated through impossibility 12 a contract may be terminated if the terms of the contract become impossible to complete or if it would cause one party an extreme hardship to complete 13 common situations in which a party’s performance of a contract is impossible include destruction or unavailability of the subject matter of the contract for example if you hire someone to paint your house and your house burns down the subject matter of the contract the house is destroyed and the contract is impossible the contract is thus terminated death or incapacitating illness if one of the parties to the contract suffers death or an incapacitating illness physical or mental the contract may be terminated supervening illegality supervening illegality occurs if a contract is legal when entered into but a subsequent change in the law has made its performance illegal for example imagine that you are a farmer who has contracted to sell your carrots to your local supermarket if your city passes a law that makes the sale of local produce to supermarkets illegal your contract is terminated because you can no longer legally complete the terms 146 identify a contract that should be terminated due to impracticality a contract can be terminated if the performance of the obligation has become highly impractical or difficult by the occurrence of events that were not caused by an involved party 15for example if a book publisher goes out of business it is impossible for them to continue publishing books therefore the contracts they currently have with writers may be terminated7 identify illegality in a contract in some cases a “defense of illegality” may be used as a defense against breach of contract suits 16 a contract that requires one or more parties to do something illegal is void this is different from some other types of termination because the court considers the contract to never have existed neither party is entitled to damages or remedy if one party breaches the contract 17for example if you contract to hire a poker dealer to run a game in a state where gambling is not legal the contract is void because the service cannot legally be performed8 consider other means of terminating a contract in addition to the situations listed above there are other circumstances that could enable a party to terminate a contract some have to do with whether the contract was legally enforceable to begin with some situations which may lead to contract termination include fraudulent misrepresentation if the content or execution of the contract was misrepresented lied about in order to defraud trick or mislead the other party you can terminate the contract for example if you enter a contract to sell your car to another person but you know that the car does not run and you do not disclose that information in the contract you have committed fraudulent misrepresentation and the contract may be thrown out duress if one of the parties to the contract was forced to enter the contract against her will the contract is void and may be terminated for example if someone is blackmailed or threatened into signing a contract the contract will not hold up in court undue influence if one of the parties to the contract has considerable influence over the other party the contract may not have been entered into fairly for example a person who enters into a contract unrelated to the workplace with her boss may have experienced undue influence and felt as though she did not have an option about the contract
