excess calories it takes to gain a pound or deficit calories to lose a pound 3500 and you know about how many calories you need in  my personal profile  you are already on the road to a healthier you the next thing you need to learn is how to count calories so you can determine how many you eat each day at first this may seem like too much trouble but once you get familiar with portion size and the number of calories in your favorite foods youll be able to estimate how many calories you eat each day easily without weighing your food and without taking too much of your valuable time anthony is a 56yearold man who is 510 and weighs 185 pounds anthony is a high school teacher and track coach who spends most of his day standing at work anthony does some light yard work when he returns home from work each day using the bmi chart on page 12 anthony determined that he has a bmi of 27 according to the bmi chart he is overweight next using the definitions on page 15 anthony determined his physical activity level because he does some physical activity while coaching and doing light yard work each day for at least 30 minutes he is active then anthony using the calorie chart on page 16 determined his estimated calorie needs based on his age and current physical activity level this is approximately 2600 daily calories to maintain his current weight how many calories do you eat each day calories countâ€”and they come from both food and beverages when eating packaged foods for example frozen canned and some prepared foods from the grocery store counting your calories is easyâ€”its on the nutrition facts label when eating foods that do not have a nutrition facts label such as fresh fruits and vegetables or when eating at home or in restaurants determining calories is more difficult if you cant count calories because there is no nutrition facts label you should pay attention to portion size use the nutrition facts label most packaged foods have a nutrition facts label an example of one is on the next page you can use this tool to make smart food choices and to find out how many calories and nutrients you are actually eating to use the label effectively to count calories you need to check serving size servings per container and calories  look at the serving size and the number of servings per container how many servings are you consuming if you are eating 2 servings you are eating double the calories and the nutrients listed on the nutrition facts label portion size is the amount of food eaten at one time serving size is the amount stated on the nutrition facts label sometimes the portion size and serving size match sometimes they dont for example if the label says that 1 serving size is 6 cookies and you eat 3 youve eaten â½ of a serving of cookies more importantly you have just reduced by half the calories listed on the nutrition facts label remember that the serving size on the nutrition facts label is not a recommended amount to eat its a simple and easy way for letting you know the calories and nutrients in a certain amount of a food if the label helps you be more aware of how much you eat or drink—all the betterwhen eating foods without a nutrition facts label pay attention to how your portion size compares to a recommended amount of food from each food group in chapter 7 breaking it down well show you how to do this some foods prepared at the grocery store and other foods such as produce items may not have food packaging that provides nutritional information but this information can sometimes be obtained in the store by request many restaurants have nutrition information on the foods they serve available at the restaurant or on their web site as grocery stores increase the number of prepared products that have nutrition information it will become easier for you to make lowercalorie choices to help you control your calories every day dont be afraid to ask for nutrition information if you dont see it displayed at the grocery store or on the menu when eating out on the sample nutrition facts label above the serving size of this food is 1 cup and there are 2 servings in this container there are 260 calories per serving of this food if you eat the entire container of this product you will eat 2 servings that means you need to double the calories 260 calories x 2  520 calories to know how many calories you are eating if you eat 2 servings you will have eaten over 500 caloriesnow youve learned how to use food packaging to help you figure out how many calories you are eating in the following chapter you will learn how to build healthy eating patterns using food groups estimating how many calories you are getting from these foods can be challenging at first but since one of the best ways to manage your weight is to be aware of foods and beverages high in calories being able to keep track of where your calories are coming from is an important skill that will help you for the rest of your life setting your calorie goal in chapter 4 where to start you determined your body mass index or bmi to assess whether you were underweight at a healthy weight overweight or obese staying atâ€”or getting toâ€”a healthy weight can help us in several ways not only might it help us feel better and look better but science shows it plays an important role in reducing our risk of several types of chronic diseases that can definitely interfere with our hopes for a long healthy life excess body fat leads to a higher risk for premature death type 2 diabetes high blood pressure problems

calories for you this number depends on your age gender weight activity level and whether youre trying to gain maintain or lose weight in chapter 4 where to start you estimated how many calories you need to maintain your weight at your current physical activity level if you are at a healthy weight bmi between 19 and 24 then use the number of calories you estimated as your calorie needs based on your current physical activity level this is the number you wrote down in my personal profile in chapters 9 and 10 you will determine whether you are physically active enough to reduce your risk for developing a chronic disease or to maintain or achieve a healthy weight if you are obese overweight or have a high waist size and two or more risk factors  even modest weight loss for example 10 pounds has health benefits preventing further weight gain is very important eating fewer calories while increasing physical activity are the keys to controlling body weight simply put eat less move more if you need to lose weight aim for slow steady weight loss by decreasing calorie intake while maintaining an adequate intake of nutrients next are a couple of suggestions to get you on your way if you need to lose weight a reduction of 500 or more calories each day from added sugar fat and alcohol is a good strategy for example drink water flavored with lemon or lime seltzer water or a diet soda instead of a sugarsweetened beverage or use a noncaloric sweetener instead of a sweetener with calories together these small changes can quickly add up to 500 calories later on we will give you more details on how to do thistip for controlling calories on the nutrition facts label when 1 serving of a single food item contains 400 or more calories its high and 40 calories is low 1the packaging of a food can also contain other useful information for making your food selections for example sometimes foods are labeled calorie free low calorie reduced or lower in calories light or lite here is a quick guide to what those words mean calorie free  less than 5 calories per serving low calorie  40 calories or less per serving reduced calorie or lower in calories  at least 25 percent fewer calories than the regular version light or lite  half the fat or a third of the calories of the regular version 21 based on 2000 calories2for example if a regular cheesecake has 300 calories and 8 grams of fat per serving then the lite version could have 200 calories and 4 grams of fat per serving chapter 6
