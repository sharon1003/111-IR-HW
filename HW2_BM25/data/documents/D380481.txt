aliphatic hydrocarbons alkanes alkanes hydrocarbons in which all the bonds are single have molecular formulas that satisfy the general expression c n h 2 n  2 where n is an integer carbon is s p 3 hybridized three electron pairs are involved in bonding forming a tetrahedral complex and each c—c and c—h bond is a sigma σ bond  see chemical bonding  in order of increasing number of carbon atoms methane ch 4  ethane c 2 h 6  and propane c 3 h 8 are the first three members of the series methane ethane and propane are the only alkanes uniquely defined by their molecular formula for c 4 h 10 two different alkanes satisfy the rules of chemical bonding namely that carbon has four bonds and hydrogen has one in neutral molecules one compound called n  butane where the prefix n  represents normal has its four carbon atoms bonded in a continuous chain the other called isobutane has a branched chain different compounds that have the same molecular formula are called isomers isomers that differ in the order in which the atoms are connected are said to have different constitutions and are referred to as constitutional isomers an older name is structural isomers the compounds n butane and isobutane are constitutional isomers and are the only ones possible for the formula c 4 h 10 because isomers are different compounds they can have different physical and chemical properties for example n butane has a higher boiling point −05 °c 311 °f than isobutane −117 °c 109 °f there is no simple arithmetic relationship between the number of carbon atoms in a formula and the number of isomers graph theory has been used to calculate the number of constitutionally isomeric alkanes possible for values of n in c n h 2 n  2 from 1 through 400 the number of constitutional isomers increases sharply as the number of carbon atoms increases there is probably no upper limit to the number of carbon atoms possible in hydrocarbons the alkane ch 3 ch 2 388 ch 3 in which 390 carbon atoms are bonded in a continuous chain has been synthesized as an example of a socalled superlong alkane several thousand carbon atoms are joined together in molecules of hydrocarbon polymers such as

and iso the naming of organic compounds is facilitated through the use of formal systems of nomenclature nomenclature in organic chemistry is of two types common and systematic common names originate in many different ways but share the feature that there is no necessary connection between name and structure the name that corresponds to a specific structure must simply be memorized much like learning the name of a person systematic names on the other hand are keyed directly to molecular structure according to a generally agreed upon set of rules the most widely used standards for organic nomenclature evolved from suggestions made by a group of chemists assembled for that purpose in geneva in 1892 and have been revised on a regular basis by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the iupac rules govern all classes of organic compounds but are ultimately based on alkane names compounds in other families are viewed as derived from alkanes by appending functional groups to or otherwise modifying the carbon skeleton the iupac rules assign names to unbranched alkanes according to the number of their carbon atoms methane ethane and propane are retained for ch 4 ch 3 ch 3 and ch 3 ch 2 ch 3 respectively the n  prefix is not used for unbranched alkanes in systematic iupac nomenclature therefore ch 3 ch 2 ch 2 ch 3 is defined as butane not n butane beginning with fivecarbon chains the names of unbranched alkanes consist of a latin or greek stem corresponding to the number of carbons in the chain followed by the suffix ane a group of compounds such as the unbranched alkanes that differ from one another by successive introduction of ch 2 groups constitute a homologous series iupac names of unbranched alkanesalkane formula name alkane formula name ch

chain of carbon atoms in the molecule called the parent the alkane shown has seven carbons in its longest chain and is therefore named as a derivative of heptane the unbranched alkane that contains seven carbon atoms the position of the ch 3 methyl substituent on the sevencarbon chain is specified by a number 3 called a locant obtained by successively numbering the carbons in the parent chain starting at the end nearer the branch the compound is therefore called 3methylheptane when there are two or more identical substituents replicating prefixes di tri tetra etc are used along with a separate locant for each substituent different substituents such as ethyl −ch 2 ch 3 and methyl −ch 3 groups are cited in alphabetical order replicating prefixes are ignored when alphabetizing in alkanes numbering begins at the end nearest the substituent that appears first on the chain so that the carbon to which it is attached has as low a number as possible methyl and ethyl are examples of alkyl groups an alkyl group is derived from an alkane by deleting one of its hydrogens thereby leaving a potential point of attachment methyl is the only alkyl group derivable from methane and ethyl the only one from ethane there are two c 3 h 7 and four c 4 h 9 alkyl groups the iupac rules for naming alkanes and alkyl groups cover even very complex structures and are regularly updated they are unambiguous in the sense that although a single compound may have more than one correct iupac name there is no possibility that two different compounds will have the same name
