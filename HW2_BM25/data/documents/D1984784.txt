stories on physorg• can we imitate organisms abilities to decode water patterns for new technologies• king penguin breeding colonies are structured like fluids• study suggests the elusive neutrino could make up a significant part of dark matter nov 21 20102cjl we do emit radio its just much much fainter than the infrared we emit similarly the sun emits much more infrared per square meter than we do even though it peaks in the visible nov 21 20103logical acid at our temperature we mainly emit infrared radiation correct then why do we see each other in visible light heres my hypothesis left to ourselves meaning no light present at night we are not seen because we dont have enough energy in us to emit visible light we emit infrared at the most that is why even if there is no light we can still see if we have infrared goggles nov 21 20104logical acidcjl said ↑we do emit radio its just much much fainter than the infrared we emit similarly the sun emits much more infrared per square

cant we be used as antennas then lemme rephrase that why do antennas have the ability to send out radio waves if we emit radio waves as well nov 21 20106pallidin to suggest that biological systems emitting ir must also emit lower frequencies is false there is no natural requirement for a biological system emitting a specific wavelength to be required to emit all the other subwavelengths down to zero nov 21 20107logical acidpallidin said ↑to suggest that biological systems emitting ir must also emit lower frequencies is false there is no natural requirement for a biological system emitting a specific wavelength to be required to emit all the other subwavelengths down to zero took it right outta my mouth why is this nov 21 20108cjl re at our temperature we mainly emit infrared radiation correct thats reasonably accurate the reason we see each other in visible light is because we see the light reflected off of each other not because we see the light emitted the reason this is in the visible range is because thats where the suns emission peaks nov 21 20109andy resnick science advisor education advisor insights author logical acid said ↑if our temperature is already above the necessary temperature to emit radio waves at our temperature we emit mainly infrared right how do you know we dont humans can be clearly imaged using the 812 um lwir band which corresponds closely to the peak in thermal emission i know that humans are opaque to millimeter waves new airport full body scanners and o we emit in the millimeter wave as well but at some point we become transparent and so by kirchoffs law we wont emit in that waveband nov 21 201010logical acid re at our temperature we mainly emit infrared radiation correctcjl said ↑thats reasonably accurate the reason we see each

peaks great i have some questions i would like to ask you instead of starting a new thread would you mind nov 21 201011logical acid andy resnick said ↑how do you know we dont humans can be clearly

systems emitting ir must also emit lower frequencies is false there is no natural requirement for a biological system emitting a specific wavelength to be required to emit all the other subwavelengths down to zero we emit infrared because we arent at absolute zero not due to any unusual property of biological systems the radiation our bodies emit more or less follows a black body spectrum and we do indeed emit at lower frequencies all the way down to zero your statements suggest the ir emissions are special when it is really the gaps and other variations due to our deviations from black body emitters that are special your statement applies to bioluminescence but not to body heat logical acid said ↑lemme rephrase that why do antennas have the ability to send out radio waves if we emit radio waves as well the question doesnt make sense why would the fact that we emit radio waves make you think antennas cant but anyway note that theres two types of emission here you and an antenna both emit thermal radiation in a range of frequencies including the radio band but peaking in the infrared spectrum heat an unpowered antenna up to body temperature in the sun and its emission spectrum will be quite similar these emissions are very weak though an object at human body temperature wont be emitting particularly large amounts of power and most of that will be in the infrared range radio transmitters do not produce radio waves by thermal emission they do it far more directly by literally pushing the electrons in the antenna back and forth at the frequency desired accelerating charges radiate and by doing this you can emit very large amounts of power in a very narrow portion of the spectrum nov 22 201016buzzworks logical acid said ↑then we are basically antennas why cant we be used as antennas then because it could trigger painful sparks every now and then so no thank you nov 22 201017yaang we should be emitting radio waves too  or at least i think so its just we emit much more infrared and infrared has a lot more energy than radio waves infrared dominates nov 22 201018magnet dave re at our temperature we mainly emit infrared radiation correct to be totally fair most nightvision goggles are based around photomultipliers they also have some ir sensitivity but that is mainly so that they can use an ir light source to illuminate an area without being seen but thats an engineering point you are more or less correct about the underlying emission phenomenon nov 22 201019magnet dave you are conflating two concepts here an antenna is something that transmits and receives coherent radio transmissions this is done by applying electromotive force of the appropriate phase and frequency blah blah blah thermionic emission is what the human body does with respect to radio waves just the heat of the body causes some ultralongwave ir aka rf waves to come off they are not in any way coherent similarly the body is not a coherent absorber the energy we absorb from rf waves is just dissipated as heat not conducted down our length to a detector a lot of the art of antenna design is optimizing it for sensitivity to what we are
