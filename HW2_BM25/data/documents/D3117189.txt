 a a print poor okay good great awesome your rating none  7 voteshow to sharpen a handplane iron when most folks begin to get serious in woodworking they inevitably reach a point where the seductive handplane beckons for some the curiosity arises from an appreciation of the tools design for others its all about using a smoother to achieve a glasssmooth surface that requires no sanding whatever the reason the handplanes siren song can be difficult to ignore i seem to have fallenâ€”hard luckily however fine woodworking magazines art director michael pekovich was kind enough to share his own sharpening methodology with me and here it is prep your waterstones the process of sharpening a new handplane iron begins with flattening the back of the iron but you cant obtain a flat iron using a wavy waterstone so i begin the process by flattening my waterstones on a diamond plate the procedure is rather simple using three successively finer grit diamond plates moistened with water i lay the stones atop each plate and rub back and forth applying a decent amount of pressure the idea here is to grind away the stone material until youve achieved a perfectly flat surface and with diamond plates it shouldnt take very long at allthat said diamond plates can be pricey so as an alternative method consider using 80grit sandpaper stuck down to a perfectly flat surface your tablesaw or jointer s table will work great flatten the back a newlypurchased handplane iron doesnt necessarily in fact it probably doesnt have a perfectly flat back and a flat back is essential if you intend to produce a finely honed cutting edge lapping the back of your plane iron is a process youll most likely only have to do once so take your time and get it right waterstone lineup this technique uses four different stones from lr 800grit 1000grit 1200grit and a supersmooth 6000grit synthetic stone to flatten the back of your plane iron set up a line of successively finer waterstone grits in this case i began with an 800grit stone and worked my way up through 1000grit 1200grit and finally a 6000grit synthetic stone after wetting the stone with water lay the flat side of your iron atop the stone and apply even pressure now rub back and forth for about 30seconds to a minute on each grit and remember you dont have to flatten the entire back of the iron only about the first inch or so you should see an even shiny polish develop across the back grind a bevel next take your plane iron to the grinding wheel youll need to use some sort of jig there are many available on the market to hold the iron to the wheel at the appropriate angle in my case 25degrees remember this time youre working on the bevel edge not the flat side of the iron the smoothing plane iron i sharpened in the video below came with a factory bevel of 25degrees and i simply set beveltostone using my eyes fill the grinder s trough up with water turn her on and move the iron left to right backandforth grinding the bevel until you see a uniform polish from edge to edge final honing now its time to really get down to business the honing process is where you really sharpen that blade now there are about as many distinct sharpening methods out there as there are woodworkers ill show you one triedandtrue method as taught to me by michael pekovich but dont be surprised if you read about other variants this honing method involves the use of a microbevel at this point in the game your plane iron already has a bevel on it of about 25degrees a microbevel is simply a very thin about 132inch additional bevel added to the very end of the blade more than one way to hone a blade for this job i used a simple veritas honing guide that said there are many different styles of guides on the market i first rest the iron atop my stone with the bevel flat to the stone at 25 degrees in this case i then adjust the iron so that its back end is tilting up slightly 2730degrees this means that only about the front 132in of the bevel is being sharpened you want the iron to be tilted up slightly so that you can see a bit of light between the stone and the back end of the bevel only the very front of the cutting edge should be in contact with the stone once youve properly secured your plane iron in the honing guide go through your series of waterstone grits lapping the bevel with a backandforth motion for smoothing plane irons like the one i sharpen in this video youll want to impart a bit of camber to the cutting edge this is done by alternating the pressure your fingers impart upon the iron while holding it to the stone during honing now that youve gone through all your grits you will have developed a slight burr on the back of the plane iron use your smoothest stone in this case the 6000grit to polish off that burr and youll have a razor sharp iron thats ready to plane watch the video to see how its done note although you may not see it in the video the progression of waterstone grits is as follows 800grit 1000grit 1200grit and 6000grit posted by ed pirnik  producer september 15 2010 in video how to sharpening hand planes related articles handplaning 101 handplane primer whats the
