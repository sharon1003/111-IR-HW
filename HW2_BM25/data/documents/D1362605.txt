print overview varicose veins spider veins varicose veins are gnarled enlarged veins any vein may become varicose but the veins most commonly affected are those in your legs and feet thats because standing and walking upright increases the pressure in the veins of your lower body for many people varicose veins and spider veins — a common mild variation of varicose veins — are simply a cosmetic concern for other people varicose veins can cause aching pain and discomfort sometimes varicose veins lead to moreserious problems varicose veins may also signal a higher risk of other circulatory problems treatment may involve selfcare measures or procedures by your doctor to close or remove veins symptoms varicose veins may not cause any pain signs you may have with varicose veins include veins that are dark purple or blue in color veins that appear twisted and bulging often like cords on your legs when painful signs and symptoms occur they may include an achy or heavy feeling in your legs burning throbbing muscle cramping and swelling in your lower legs worsened pain after sitting or standing for a long time itching around one or more of your veins bleeding from varicose veins a painful cord in the vein with red discoloration of the skin color changes hardening of the vein inflammation of the skin or skin ulcers near your ankle which can mean you have a serious form of vascular disease that requires medical attention spider veins are similar to varicose veins but theyre smaller spider veins are found closer to the skins surface and are often red or blue they occur on the legs but can also be found on the face spider veins vary in size and often look like a spiders web when to see a doctor selfcare — such as exercise elevating your legs or wearing compression stockings — can help you ease the pain of varicose veins and may prevent them from getting worse but if youre concerned about how your veins look and feel and selfcare measures havent stopped your condition from getting worse see your doctor request an appointment at mayo clinic causes arteries carry blood from your heart to the rest of your tissues veins return blood from the rest of your body to your heart so the blood can be recirculated to return blood to your heart the veins in your legs must work against gravity muscle contractions in your lower legs act as pumps and elastic vein walls help blood return to your heart tiny valves in your veins open as blood flows toward your heart then close to stop blood from flowing backward causes of varicose veins can include age as you get older your veins can lose elasticity causing them to stretch the valves in your veins may become weak allowing blood that should be moving toward your heart to flow backward blood pools in your veins and your veins enlarge and become varicose the veins appear blue because they contain deoxygenated blood which is in the process of being recirculated through the lungs pregnancy some pregnant women develop varicose veins pregnancy increases the volume of blood in your body but decreases the flow of blood from your legs to your pelvis this circulatory change is designed to support the growing fetus but it can produce an unfortunate side effect — enlarged veins in your legs varicose veins may surface for the first time or may worsen during late pregnancy when your uterus exerts greater pressure on the veins in your legs changes in your hormones during pregnancy also may play a role varicose veins that develop during pregnancy generally improve without medical treatment three to 12 months after delivery risk factors these factors increase your risk of developing varicose veins age the risk of varicose veins increases with age aging causes wear and tear on the valves in your veins that help regulate blood flow eventually that wear causes the valves to allow some blood to flow back into your veins where it collects instead of flowing up to your heart sex women are more likely to develop the condition hormonal changes during pregnancy premenstruation or menopause may be a factor because female hormones tend to relax vein walls taking hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills may increase your risk of varicose veins family history if other family members had varicose veins theres a greater chance you will too obesity being overweight puts added pressure on your veins standing or sitting for long periods of time your blood doesnt flow as well if youre in the same position for long periods complications complications of varicose veins although rare can include ulcers extremely painful ulcers may form on the skin near varicose veins particularly near the ankles ulcers are caused by longterm fluid buildup in these tissues caused by increased pressure of blood within affected veins a discolored spot on the skin usually begins before an ulcer forms see your doctor immediately if you suspect youve developed an ulcer blood clots occasionally veins deep within the legs become enlarged in such cases the affected leg may swell considerably any sudden leg swelling warrants urgent medical attention because it may indicate a blood clot — a condition known medically as thrombophlebitis bleeding occasionally veins very close to the skin may burst this usually causes only minor bleeding but any bleeding warrants medical attention because theres a high risk it can happen again prevention theres no way to completely prevent varicose veins but improving your circulation and muscle tone can reduce your risk of developing varicose veins or getting additional ones the same measures you can take to treat the discomfort from varicose veins at home can help prevent varicose veins including exercising watching your weight eating a highfiber lowsalt
