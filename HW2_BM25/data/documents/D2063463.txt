the lincoln continental was an automobile produced by the lincoln division of ford motor company from 1939 to 2002 despite often sharing underpinnings with lessexpensive fords the continental was usually a distinctively styled highly equipped luxury car this car was used by gangsters and it was a choice of this or a town car when they chose a lincoln the flagship lincoln model during most of its run the continental name conveyed special cachet in the product line it was largely replaced by the lincoln ls contents  showfirst generation edit lincoln continental first generation production 19391948body style s 2door sedan layout fr layout engine v8the first lincoln continental was developed as edsel fords oneoff personal vehicle though it is believed he planned all along to put the model into production if successful in 1938 he commissioned a custom design from the chief stylist eugene t bob gregorie ready for edsels march 1939 vacation the design allegedly sketched out in an hour by gregorie working from the lincoln zephyr blueprints and making changes was an elegant convertible with a long hood covering the lincoln v12 and long front fenders and a short trunk with what became the continental series trademark the externally mounted covered spare tire the car could be considered a channeled and sectioned zephyr that did not even have the bulge that in the zephyr and in some other cars replaced the runningboard at the bottom of the doors this decrease in height meant that the height of the hood was much closer to that of the fenders there was hardly any trim on it at all making its lines superb this car is often rated as one of the most beautiful in the world the custom car for the boss was duly produced on time and edsel had it delivered to florida for his spring vacation interest from welloff friends was high and edsel sent a telegram back that he could sell a thousand of them lincoln craftsmen immediately began production on the continental convertible and even a rare few hardtop models they were extensively handbuilt the two dozen 1939 models and 400 1940built examples even had handhammered body panels since dies for machinepressing were not constructed until 1941 after the attack on pearl harbor continental production was suspended to be restarted in 19461948 like the other postwar lincolns however the continental had similar bits of trim added to make it look improved the 19391948 continental is recognized as a full classic by the classic car club of america one of the lastbuilt cars to be so recognized the 1939

continental name was revived in 1955 as a separate ford brand with its sole model being the continental mark ii this version was a unique design with the highest quality control ever seen in the automobile industry highclass luxury abound in the new continental — and with very limited availability it appeared even more exclusive than the original continental for 56 was one of the most expensive cars in the world—with a cost of 10000 at a time when a regular ford could be had for less than 2000 it rivaled rollsroyce but despite its astronomical price tag ford motor company actually lost money on each one sold on a side note cadillac suffered a similar financial loss with its own continental rival the fourdoor eldorado brougham vehicles such as these were image builders for the two companies as well as test beds for new ideas and concepts the continental mark ii was sold for just two model years with about 3000 total units built between the tales of dealers turning potential buyers away because they were not deemed to be the right kind of people to own continental and its sticker price found affordable by only the worlds wealthiest the continental became almost mythical

lincoln and continental would be paired on a car other than one in the mark series the design was originally intended to be the new 1961 ford thunderbird but the concept was enlarged and slightly altered before being switched to the lincoln line by robert mc namara one of the most striking features of the new continental was its size it was 2 ft 061 m shorter than its predecessor so much smaller was this car that advertising executives at ford photographed a woman parallel parking a sedan for a magazine spread the new continentals most recognized trademark front opening rear doors was a purely practical decision the new continental rode on a wheelbase of 123 in 31 m and the doors were hinged from the rear to ease ingress and egress when the lincoln engineers were examining the back seats that styling had made up the engineers kept hitting the rear doors with their feet hinging the doors from the rear solved the problem the suicide doors were to become the bestknown feature of 1960s lincolns to simplify production in the beginning anyway all cars were to be fourdoor models and only two body styles were offered sedan or convertible the 1961 model was the first car manufactured in the u s to be sold with a 24000 mi 39000 km or 2year bumpertobumper warranty it was also the first postwar fourdoor convertible from a major u s manufacturer the 1961 lincoln continental was really engels design masterpiece considered by many to be pinnacle of lincoln style even the dashboard was his design this may have been the last time a single individual was responsible for the complete design of a production car the 1961 lincolns striking understated elegance immediately won a major design award and was widely copied by other manufacturers — note the similarity of the 1963 cadillac and the 1963 buick electra it was a sales success with 25160 sold continentals of this generation are favored by collectors and have appeared in movies such as the matrix the last action hero kalifornia and inspector gadget movies the tv series pushing daisies and recently in the opening sequence of the tv series entourage ford produced several concept cars which recalled this design in 2007 lincolns 2007 suv line adopted massive chrome grilles in the style of these classic continentals this slabsided design ran from 19611969 with few changes from year to year lincoln dealers began to find that many people who bought 1961 and post1961 models were keeping their cars longer in 1962 a simpler front grille design with floating rectangles and a thin center bar was adopted sales climbed over 20 in 1962 to 31061 due to customer requests for 1963 the front seat was redesigned to provide a little more leg room to back seat passengers the rear deck lid was also raised to provide more trunk space the floating rectangles in the previous years grille became a simple matrix of squares the cars electrical system was updated this model year when ford replaced the generator with an alternator for 1963 another 31233 were sold the car was stretched 3 in 76 mm in 1964 to improve the ride and give more rearseat legroom while the roofline was squared off at the same time the dash was also redesigned doing away with the pod concept side glass was now flat to provide more interior room the gas tank access door which had been concealed at the rear of the car in the rear grille was now placed on the drivers side rear quarter panel the exterior continental script was changed and the rear grille replaced by a simple horizontally elongated continental star on the rear deck lid lincoln recorded 36297 sales for the year the convex 196164 grille was replaced by a flatter squaredoff one for 1965 the car was given front disc brakes to improve stopping

second pump and eliminating the hydraulic solenoids a glass rear window replaced the previous years plastic windows prices were reduced almost us600 without reducing equipment levels in the hope of luring cadillac buyers it succeeded helping boost sales to 54755 that year an increase of 36 all of it due to the new 2door both fourdoor models sales slipped slightly 11 product breakdown for the year consisted of 65 sedans 29 coupes and just under 6 for the fourdoor convertible the 1967 continental was almost identical to the 1966 the most obvious external difference is that the 1966 model has the lincoln logo on each front fender ahead of the front wheel this does not appear on the 1967 model it was also the end for the 4door convertible down to just 2276 units a drop of 28 over 1966

year in 1979 a collectors series option package was available which added virtually every lincoln feature with the exception of a moonroof engineblock heater and velour or leather upholstery the collectors series package raised the price of a town car or mark v to almost 2200000 us dollars an astronomical sum for a domestic automobile in 1979 there were only four colors available dark blue

wheelbase which was shared directly with ford ltd and mercury marquis mark vi coupes and sedans were available in standard signature and designer editions bill blass emilio pucci cartier and givenchy all had their unique say on color and fabric choices for their designer models the new continental carried over as many styling cues as possible from the previous cars modified somewhat to match the new size lincoln management knew that keeping the family resemblance going was critical sales depended on the car being instantly recognizable as a lincoln in 1981 what was formerly known as the continental sedan and coupe were replaced in name only by the town car and town coupé designation a former option package name for continental models with the 1981 town carcoupe now the entrylevel lincoln the upper rung models formerly referred to as continental town carcoupe in 1980 were replaced with the signature series designation while the town car available exclusively in 4door form after 1982 enjoyed rising sales the mark vi model started to slide part of the sales slump for the mark vi was the redundancy of the newfor1982 continental 4door competing for sales against the mark vi

signature and designer valentino and givenchy form while the mark vi was still available through 1983 in coupe and 4door styles the continental for 1984 was strictly a sedan this car introduced two industry firsts gascharged shock absorbers and selfsealing tires continentals exterior styling was modeled along the lines of rival cadillacs seville although the continental was more sedate in style it came along two years too late as seville had already established a sales force from its introduction in 1980 continentals focus groups discovered — too far along the preproduction process — that sevilles bustleback design was fast becoming past its prime an 11hour change was the addition of a horizontal brushedchrome strip that ran along each side of continental this added trim along with plentiful twotone color combinations somewhat disguised continentals sevillelike design and made the lincoln appear slightly more conventional looking the standard engine for 1984 was a carbureted version of fords proven 302 cid v8 with a fuelinjected version arriving the next year upgraded to sequential injection a few years later and remaining through 1987 also available for 1984 and 1985 was

schemes and upholstery patterns in what became lincoln fashion since the early 70s brandname designer labels appeared on the upperrung models cartier was the top town car model american designer bill blass and italian sportswear mogul versace both chose schemes for mark vii while french designer hubert de givenchy and italianborn valentino gave their personal touches to the continental the 84–87 continental was a spiritual successor to the lincoln versailles intermediate of the 1970s like the earlier versailles which shared most of its sheet metal drivetrain and chassis with the ford granada and mercury monarch this new continental — serving as the brands premium model — was based on a lowerrung ford model using fords fox platform this new platform was originally introduced for the 1978 ford fairmont and mercury zephyr fairmonts 1055 in 2680 mm wheelbase was stretched 3 in 76 mm for the continental in a parallel the 76 seville shared gms xplatform alongside the chevrolet nova a compact vehicle that competed directly with fairmont but the 84–87 continental differed greatly than versailles in that continental wasnt a lesser car dressed with luxury addons instead the 1984

interior compared to 5passenger last year with glints of chrome and woodtone accents appealed to fans of the prior years model while front wheel drive a contemporary euro exterior look and newfound v6 economy would win over potential customers interior room was up from 1987 and the new continental now boasted the largest interior of any frontwheel drive car although the redesigned 1989 cadillac deville grabbed that title next year the longer 109 in 2800 mm wheelbase was a slight increase over last years 1085 in 2760 mm the better use of space allowed true 6passenger capability — not seen since the 1981 model cargo capacity was up to 19 cubic feet 054 m3 compared to under 15 in least years trunk the power steering had been improved upon with the addition of variableassist which reacted differently depending on speed  more power assist at low speeds for ease in parking less assist at highway speeds for better road feel the 1988 continental was four inches longer yet 170 pounds lighter than the 1987 and was set to compete against the frontwheel drive cadillac deville and fleetwood which had been downsized in 1985 from 1988 the designer editions were gone — only base later

system and a 3position memory seat a 1993 attempt to compete with the imports was the available individual seats group available only on signature in 93 and only on executive in 94 which ditched the usual chrome column shifter and 5050 comfort lounge split bench seating and 6passenger capacity for a center console with floor shifter a continental first storage armrest and a single cup holder the 556 option proved unpopular with 93 continental buyers at this point in time the average owner was not the youthful buyer lincoln was so desperately seeking but rather someone who would have otherwise bought a town car but for regional purposes living in a snowbelt area for example chose the benefits of continentals frontwheel drive in 1994 one last try at moving continental was a mild revamp including a redesigned front bumper and grille bodycolor side skirts in place of the previous wide chrome strip underneath the doors and revised tail lamps decklidlock cover and trim and a rear bumper with aerodynamic spats a new font appeared for the lincoln nameplate on the front grille and rear tail lamps moved off the decklid from last year inside a new steering wheel design — borrowed from the
