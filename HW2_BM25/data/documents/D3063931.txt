editopening day excursion on the seattle lake shore and eastern railroad site of the future burkegilman trail c 1887 8 9the trail can trace its origins to the founding of the seattle lake shore and eastern railway on 15 april 1885 by ten men headed by judge thomas burke and daniel gilman in its heyday burke and gilmans road extended from downtown north to arlington and east to rattlesnake prairie above snoqualmie falls taken over by the northern pacific railway around 1890 4 the line became part of the burlington northern railroad in 1970 and was abandoned in 1971 in 1978 the first 121 miles 195 km of the rightofway from seattles gas works park to kenmore s tracy owen station was opened as a public trail and named after the founders of the railroad 10the burkegilman trail ends in

burkegilman trail at its western end connecting the short and long segments between the ballard locks and 11th avenue and a northern extension along shilshole bay from nw 60th street to golden gardens park and planning for connecting between the ballard locks and downtown ballard at 11th avenue nw and nw 45th street 7 a major point of contention regarding the remaining missing link project is the industrial nature of the salmon bay waterfront through which this portion of the trail would pass many business owners are concerned about the safety and liability issues inherent in the convergence of trains trucks cyclists and pedestrians while the city and citizens groups claim the dangers are being exaggerated 12 the trail overall can at times be busy and even crowded 10daniel hunt gilman
