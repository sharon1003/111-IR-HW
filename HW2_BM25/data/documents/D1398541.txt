some important facts water heater parts most residential tanks hold 40 to 60 gallons and have to be able to hold the pressure of a residential water system which typically runs at 50 to 100 pounds per square inch psi steel tanks are tested to handle 300 psi and normally have a bonded glass liner to keep rust out of the water as well as insulation surrounding the tank other water heater parts include a dip tube to let cold water into the tank a pipe to let hot water out of the tank a thermostat to control the temperature of the water inside the tank heating elements similar to those inside an electric oven a drain valve that allows you to drain the tank to replace the elements or to move the tank a temperature or pressure relief valve that keeps the tank from exploding a sacrificial anode rod to help keep the steel tank from corroding temperature or pressure relief valve a temperature or pressure relief valve helps prevent a tank from exploding if temperature or pressure exceeds safe limits unfortunately residential valves are somewhat prone to failure as part of your annual water heater care test this valve by pulling up on the handle to make sure water flows freely out and stops when you let go of the handle if it does nothing or runs or drips then the valve should be replaced flushing the hot water heater through the drain valve at least once a year to remove sediment buildup you should have a drain line usually to within about 6 inches of the floor or plumbed outside this is to prevent you from being scalded if the valve should open while you’re standing next to it temperature control on residential tanks the settings are normally warm hot very hot or something similar there is so much variation on what these settings mean but the right temperature is at least 120 degrees at the tap which you can test with a meat or candy thermometer it is important to keep the temperature close to 120 degrees to kill germs and prevent children from being scaled compared to adults babies and children have thinner skin that burns faster and at lower temperatures its a good idea to check the water temperature using your wrist or elbow every time you bathe a baby toddler or young child for more information about preventing burns and scalds to children visit make safe happencom when leaving for vacation set the hot water heater temperature at its lowest setting this will save money and reduce the risk of any problems while you are away also if your faucets are sputtering spitting and spewing it could be a sign that your water heater is overheating vents a poor draft can cause fumes and carbon monoxide to come back into the room instead of going outside to maintain good ventilation make sure that the vent is the same diameter as the tanks draft diverter the vent goes straight up and out without any dips where it passes through walls or roofs it is doublewalled singlewalled vent sections should be screwed with 3 screws per section especially in earthquake zones earthquake straps strapping your water heater is a good idea even if you live outside an earthquake zone if your water heater were to fall over for any reason it could sever the gas line and cause an explosion additional water heater safety tips keep safe by following these water heater recommendations remove paper accumulated dust or other combustibles from the heater enclosure extinguish the pilot light before using flammable liquids or setting off aerosol bug bombs if the device is in the garage raise it so the pilot light is 18 inches above the floor this helps prevent ignition of gasoline vapors that collect near the floor consider installing an automatic gasshutoff valve which stops the flow of gas if the ground moves or if gas flow increases dramatically the valve which costs around 300 prevents fires when a gas line breaks due to flood earthquake or other disaster you may also want to insulate the first 6 feet of the hot water pipe and the first 3 feet of the cold water pipe that extends from your hot water tank insulating the hot water pipe reduces heat loss and insulating the cold water pipe reduces “sweating” in the summer you can find pipe wrap insulation for this purpose in most hardware stores do not use pipe wrap or any other insulation within 6 inches of the draft hood or flue exhaust vent at the top of the natural gas water heater
