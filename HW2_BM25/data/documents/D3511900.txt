mancha the name of which i dont want to recall there lived not long ago one of those gentlemen with a lance on the rack an old shield a wornout horse and a racing greyhound these are the very first lines of don quixote full title the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha el ingenioso hidalgo don quijote de la mancha in the original spanish the novel was written by spanish writer and satirist miguel de cervantes cervantes wrote the story in two parts the first part published in 1605 and the second in 1615 the story is about an old hidalgo named alonso quijano who was so into chivalric novels that he lost a few screws and decided that he was a vagrant knight quijano renames himself as don quixote de la mancha and decides to win eternal fame through the besting of criminals and general upholding of the chivalric code unfortunately for a lot of innocent people his delusions make him pick fights with innocent bystanders some of whom do not fight back because don quixote is obviously crazy of course there are strangers who are not that sympathetic and after one of those delivers a brutal beating to don quixote a neighbor from his village meets the wounded don quixote and takes him home where his friends and family burn out the cursed books of chivalry and claim that a wizard did it literally to try to cure him but he soon returns to his delusion and journey this time he manages to convince a simple farmman sancho panza to become his squire and sidekick under the promise of a governorship in the future then they live a lot of adventures including the famous one where don quixote attacks some windmills thinking they are ferocious giants note at the end of the book don quixote’s friends trick him by making him believe he is enchanted and take him back to his village throughout the novel don quixote never even for a moment doubts that the fictional adventures that he has read were real and that he really is a knight errant not even the petitions of his loved ones the continuous ridicule of his peers or the brutal beatings he suffers made him break his resolution don quixote always continues trying to impose his quixotic literally hes the words origin beliefs on the world the first part of the novel was published in 1605 when the books of chivalry were pushing deader than disco and don quixotes dreams of reviving chivalric ways were really a strange misbegotten idea the novel became a big success among the public of the time although that success was nothing unheard of at the time with other titles and certainly that was not the case with the contemporary spanish critics and was reprinted several times in the next decade and even translated into french and english but most notable was the change in spanish popular culture a few months after printing virtually all of spain knew about don quixote’s exploits memetic mutations arose those ridiculous books of chivalry became popular again and even apocryphal continuations appeared cervantes created a character to mock the fan dumb and the books of chivalry that perverted true heroism only to find that don quixote thanks to his readers had achieved his goal to change reality cervantes had promised a sequel at the end of volume i and had begun writing it when he caught word of a spurious fake sequel of don quixote written as a cash grab this led him to denounce the book in his own pages and led him to make vol ii the hidalgos final adventure the second part has a more serious tone taking advantage of the change operated by the first part of the book in real life where don quixote has evolved from a lord errorprone to an honest but still insane man whose noble attitude and delusions makes him the buttmonkey of a lot of people don quixote has to confront his delusions but only in the very last chapter and the harshness of reality makes him realize that his naïve dreams were shallow which brings him back to sanity before his death it has been adapted to
