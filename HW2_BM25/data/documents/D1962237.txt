home  how to  more in ventilation how to install a range hood replacing a recirculating hood with a ducted model by anna holbrook of todays homeowner  photo by smithbaer photo by smithbaer its not surprising that most kitchens are equipped with a range hood what is remarkable however is that most of these hoods do a lousy job of eliminating steam smoke grease and odors thats because they simply recirculate the air by drawing it through a filter and blowing it back into the room for a range hood to perform well it must exhaust the dirty air to the outdoors in this project well show you how to replace an old recirculating unit with a new ducted range hood in our kitchen the range sat against an exterior wall so we ran the duct out the rear of the hood and through the house wall however we could have also run the duct straight up into the upper cabinet and then cut through the roof or turned it down through the eave for a range placed against an interior wall the duct can go up into the soffit above the cabinets or between ceiling joists and then out through the nearest exterior wall regardless of where you run the duct be sure it leads outdoors never end a ventilation duct inside an attic or other enclosed space most recirculating range hoods can be converted to an exhausted type with standard 7india round or 3 14 x 10in rectangular ducting we opted to replace our range hood with a newer one thats a lot more effective we installed the 30in allure iii 399 from broannu tone it features sleek styling and dual halogen lamps that light up the range top plus its fan operates at only 09 sones which is 50 percent quieter than some comparable units drawing a respectable 250 cfm cubic feet per minute of air the fan also features a boost setting that kicks the blower up to 400 cfm for extra power theres even a delayoff mode that automatically turns off the range hood 20 minutes after you set it the allure iii is designed for easy cleaning too its two large filters are dishwasher safe and the steel cover behind the filters is coated with nonstick silver stone which means you can easily wipe off grease stains the unit comes in 30 36 and 42in sizes in white biscuit almond black and stainless steel prices start at about 200 photo by smithbaer readying the new hood start by removing the two filters and unscrewing the bottom cover step 1 take out the damperduct connector and set it aside to prevent damage during shipping the connector is screwed to the inside of the hood next use a hammer and slotted screwdriver to remove the rectangular duct knockout from the rear of the hood step 2 work carefully so you dont deform the metal surface around the knockout hole then screw the connector over the hole step 3 photo by smithbaer cutting the hole before removing the old range hood shut off the electricity to that circuit at the main electrical panel flip the light switch on the old hood to confirm that the power is off remove the grilles from the stove top and cover the range with a blanket to remove the old hood reach up into it and disconnect the electrical cable locate the mounting screws that hold the hood in place and remove them gently pull the hood from the wall step 4 next mark the centerline of the upper cabinet on the back wall measure down 18 in from the bottom of the cabinet and draw a level line across the wall use these two references marks to draw a 3 34 inhigh x 10 12 inlong rectangle on the wall cut out the duct hole with a drywall saw step 5 if youre lucky you wont hit a wall stud or other obstacle if you do but its just at one edge of your hole you can shift damperduct connector on the rear of the unit 1 in to the left or right this shift is often enough leeway to miss a stud or obstacle however if the stud is still in the way youll have to remove it and install a header heres how empty out the wall cabinet that sits directly above the duct location then unscrew and remove the cabinet cut a hole in the wall thats about 14 in high x 28 in wide use a reciprocating saw to cut the stud 6 in above the location of the duct hole and 4 in below it pry out the severed piece of stud next make a header by nailing together two 2x4s sandwiched around a 12inthick plywood spacer the header must be long enough to span between the two fulllength studs on each side of the hole for studs placed 16 in on center cut the header 30 12 in long make a double sill plate to the same length by nailing together two 2x4s then reach into the wall hole and screw a 2ftlong 2x4 trimmer stud to each fulllength wall stud the trimmers must be level with the top of the justcut wall stud coming up from below if you cant fit the trimmer stud into place enlarge the hole slip the double sill into the wall and screw it down into the trimmers insert the header and screw up into the bottom of the cut stud hanging down from above cut two short 2x4s to fit vertically between the sill and header screw one to each of the fulllength wall studs inside the hole cover up the new framing by replacing the original drywall or cutting a new piece to fit conceal the wall patch with drywall tape and joint compound reinstall the wall cabinet and cut out the 3 34inhigh x 10 12inlong duct hole next transfer the duct hole location to the outside by boring a hole through the exterior wall from inside step 6 go outside and use the hole as a reference point to saw out a 3 12inhigh x 10 14inlong duct hole step 7 photo by smithbaer installation sequence at this juncture the hardest part of the project is done installing the range hood takes only about 30 minutes start by feeding the electrical cable through the round knockout hole in the rear of the hood step 8 be sure the hole is fitted with a cable clamp use wire connectors to join samecolor wires black to black and white to white tighten the green or bare wire under the grounding screw lift the hood into place and press it tightly against the underside of the upper cabinet secure it with four screws driven up from the inside step 9 now go outdoors to install the wall cap 23 run a continuous bead of caulk around the flange of the wall cap then press it into the hole step 10 check to make sure the wall duct on the cap slides onto the damperduct connector thats attached to the rear of the range hood if the wall cap is too long trim it with tin snips if its too short pick up a 3 14 x 10in section of aluminum duct at a home center or lumberyard a 24in piece costs 8 cut a piece of duct to fit between the wall cap and damper and attach it with professional not clothbacked duct tape finish the installation of the wall cap by screwing it to the house turn the electricity back on and test the ventilating fan and lights go outside to check that the wall cap damper flips open when the fan is on and closes tightly when its off of course to truly test your new range hood go fry up a batch of fishâ€” you can be confident that the kitchen wont smell like captain stinkys house of haddock photo by smithbaer step by step1 remove the onepiece cover from the bottom of the range hood also remove the aluminum damperduct connector thats attached to the inside of the hood2 pry off the rectangular knockout from the rear of the hood for ducting straight back through the house wall the unit can also be ducted through the top3 attach the damperduct connector over the knockout hole you can adjust it up to 1 in off center if needed to avoid a stud or other obstacle4 pull the old range hood from the wall after removing its mounting screws be sure the electricity is off to this circuit5 cut out the rectangular duct hole with a drywall saw hold a wetdry vacuum under the saw to capture any dust that falls6 bore through the exteriort wall with a 38in spade bit and an extension shaft by drilling exactly at each corner of the hole7 use a sabre saw to cut a duct hole measuring 3 12 x 10 14 in through the siding and the plywood wall sheathing beneath8 pass the electrical cable through the round knockout hole in the rear of the hood then tighten the cable clamp9 secure the new range hood with four largeheaded screws driven into the upper wall
