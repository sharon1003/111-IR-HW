only place in the body where without surgery we can look in and see veins arteries and a nerve the optic nerve the eyes transparency explains why common eye diseases such as glaucoma cataracts and macular degeneration can be detected early with regular eye exams unfortunately people get busy and delay not only eye exams but regular physicals thats why eye doctors sometimes discover other issues like diabetes or high blood pressure iwach says especially vulnerable he says people like caregivers who worry about others around them while neglecting care for themselves keep your eye out for these 14 problems1 red flag disappearing eyebrows what it means shaved eyebrows are a fad or fashion if you will in some circles but when the outer third of the brow the part closest to the ears starts to disappear on its own this is a common sign of thyroid disease  either hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid gland or hypothyroidism underactive thyroid gland the thyroid is a small but critical gland that helps regulate metabolism and thyroid hormones are among those critical to hair production more clues brows tend to thin with age naturally but with thyroid disease the browhair loss isnt evenly distributed its a selective dropout on the ends theres usually a loss of hair elsewhere on the body too but the brows are so prominent its often noticed here first early graying is a related sign of a thyroid problem women are more often affected than men and hyperthyroidism especially strikes women in their 20s and 30s what to do mention this symptom to a dermatologist or your regular doctor most other symptoms of both hyper and hypothyroidism are notoriously broad and general before you see a doctor make note of any other changes youve noticed possibly concerning weight energy levels bowel or

gland carcinoma more clues actual styes are pluggedup oil glands at the eyelash follicle fairly common they tend to clear up within a month a cancerous cyst that mimics a stye on the other hand doesnt go away or it may seem to go away but return in the same spot another eyelid cancer warning sign loss of some of the eyelashes around the stye what to do point out a persistent stye to an
