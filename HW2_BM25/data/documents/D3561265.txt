lawn tennis associations agreed one of the four harvard players dwight f davis designed a tournament format and ordered an appropriate sterling silver trophy from shreve crump  low purchasing it from his own funds for about  1000 3 they in turn commissioned a classically styled design from william b durgin s of concord new hampshire crafted by the englishman rowland rhodes 4 davis went on to become a prominent politician in the united states in the 1920s serving as us secretary of war from 1925 to 1929 and as governorgeneral of the philippines from 1929 to 1932 the first match between the united states and britain competing as the british isles was held at the longwood cricket club in boston massachusetts in 1900 the american team of which dwight davis was a part surprised the british by winning the first three matches the following year the two countries did not compete but the us won the match in 1902 and britain won the following four matches by 1905 the tournament expanded to include belgium austria france and australasia a combined team from australia and new zealand that competed together until 1914 the tournament was initially titled the international lawn tennis challenge although it soon became known as the davis cup after dwight davis trophy the davis cup competition was initially played as a challenge cup all teams competed against one another for the right to face the previous years champion in the final round beginning in 1923 the worlds teams were split into two zones the america zone and the europe zone the winners of the two zones met in the interzonal zone inz to decide which national team would challenge the defending champion for the cup in 1955 a third zone the eastern zone was added because there were three zones the winner of one of the three zones received a bye in the first round of the inz challenger rounds in 1966 the europe zone was split into two zones europe zone a and europe zone b so the winners of the four zones competed in the inz challenger rounds from 1950 to 1967 australia dominated the competition winning the cup 15 times in 18 years 5beginning in 1972 the format was changed to a knockout tournament so that the defending champion was required to compete in all rounds and the davis cup was awarded to the tournament champion up until 1973 the davis cup had only ever been won by the united states great britainbritish isles france and australiaaustralasia their domination was eventually broken in 1974 when south africa and india made the final however the final was scratched and south africa awarded the cup after india refused to travel to south africa in protest at south africas apartheid policies the following year saw the first actual final between two outsider nations when sweden beat czechoslovakia 3–2 and since then many other countries have gone on to capture the trophy in 1981 the tiered system of competition in use today was created in which the 16 best national teams compete in the world group and all other national teams compete in one of four groups in one of three regional zones in 1989 the tiebreak was introduced into davis cup competition and from 2016 it is used in all five sets 6davis cup games have been affected by political protests several times especially in sweden the match between sweden and rhodesia 1968 was supposed to be played in båstad but was moved to bandol france due to protests against the rhodesian white minority government of ian smith the swedish government tried to stop the match between chile and sweden in 1975 in båstad due to violations of human rights in chile the match was played even while 7000 people protested against it outside after the 2008–2009 israel–gaza conflict 6000 people protested against israel outside the malmö city davis cup match between sweden and israel in march 2009 7 the malmö municipality politicians were concerned about extremists and decided due to security reasons to only let a small audience

rubbers  editas in other cup competitions tie is used in the davis cup to mean an elimination round in the davis cup the word rubber means an individual match in the annual world group competition 16 nations compete in eight firstround ties the eight winners compete in four quarterfinal ties the four winners compete in two semifinal ties and the two winners compete in the final tie each tie consists of five rubbers which are played in three days usually on friday saturday and sunday the winner of the tie is the nation which wins three or more of the five rubbers in the tie on the first day the first two rubbers are singles which are generally played by each nations two best available singles players on the second day the doubles rubber is played on the third day the final two rubbers are typically reverse singles in which the firstday contestants usually play again but they swap opponents from the first days singles rubbers however in certain circumstances the team captain may replace one or two of the players who played the singles on friday by other players who were nominated for the tie for example if the tie has already been decided in favour of one of the teams it is common for younger or lowerranked team members to play the remaining dead rubbers in order for them to gain davis cup experience since 2011 if a nation has a winning 3–1 lead after the first reverse single match and that match has gone to four sets or more then the remaining reverse single match which is a dead rubber is not played all five rubbers are played if one nation has a winning 3–0 lead after the doubles match 9ties are played at a venue chosen by one of the competing countries the right of choice is given on an alternating basis therefore countries play in the country where the last tie between the teams was not held in case the two countries have not met since 1970 lots are drawn to determine the host country 10venues in the world group must comply with certain minimum standards including a minimum seating capacity as follows 11world group playoffs 4000world group first round 4000world group quarterfinals 6000world group semifinals 8000world group final 12000captain  editprior to each tie the captain nonplaying coach appointed by the national association nominates a squad of four players and decides who will compete in the tie on the day before play starts the order of play for the first day is drawn at random in the past teams could substitute final day singles players only in case of injury or illness verified by a doctor but current rules permit the captain to designate any player to play the last two singles rubbers provided that no first day matchup is repeated there is no restriction on which of the playing team members may play the doubles rubber the two singles players two other players usually doubles specialists or a combination each rubber is normally played as best of five sets since 2016 all sets use a tiebreak at 6–6 if necessary formerly the fifth set usually had no tiebreaker so play continued until one side won by two games eg 10–8 however if a team has clinched the tie before all five rubbers have been completed the remaining rubbers may be shortened to best of three sets with a tiebreak if necessary to decide all three sets in group iii and group iv competitions each tie consists only of three rubbers which include two singles and one doubles rubber which is played in a single day the rubbers are in the best of three sets format with a tie breaker if necessary to decide all three sets records and
