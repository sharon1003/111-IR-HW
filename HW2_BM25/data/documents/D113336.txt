taking a road trip across the united states offers an alternative to flying that can be more fun and often less expensive if your point of origin and destination are not located near major airports that offer an abundance of cheap flights then the price of an airline ticket can be steep although oil prices affect both flying and driving costs their correlation with the price of filling up your vehicle is much more pronounced with the price of oil low in 2016 it might be a good time to get behind the wheel and explore the united states the following analysis compares the cost of a road trip from new york city to los angeles in 2016 to the cost of making the same trip in 2015 expenses considered include gas food and lodging gas prices new york to los angeles covers 2800 miles even if youre driving a hybrid the trip requires many stops at gas stations to fill up to make things simple assume that you are driving a toyota camry which gets about 35 miles per gallon on the highway and 25 in the city since the trip is almost all on the highway also assume that youll get 35 miles per gallon in this case the trip requires 80 gallons of gas the price of gas varies in different parts of the country so national averages must suffice to estimate fuel costs for a crosscountry trip in july 2015 the average cost for a gallon of regulargrade gasoline was 279 as of july 2016 its average cost was 223 therefore the cost in gas to drive from new york to los angeles in a camry has dropped from 22320 to 17840 food prices the cost of food can vary greatly on a crosscountry trip stopping for meals at expensive steakhouses for instance imposes much steeper costs than packing coolers full of sandwiches and making an occasional splurge at mc donalds regardless if you are fine dining or filling your belly on a budget food costs in the united states have risen by only 03 from summer 2015 to summer 2016 assuming a sevenday drive — easily enough time to get from new york to los angeles and make some stops along the way — and three meals per day at a base price of 10 per meal your food costs for the trip rose from 210 in 2015 to 21630 in 2016 lodging prices the biggest determinant of lodging prices is how you pace the trip putting the pedal to the metal and rotating drivers so that you make progress around the clock and arrive in two days without stopping yields lower lodging costs than stopping at landmarks every day and turning in for a good nights sleep for an applestoapples comparison from 2015 to 2016 again consider a sevenday trip in which you spend six nights at hotels the average hotel room cost 121 per night in june 2015 and 126 per night in june 2016 your lodging costs then increased from 726 to 756 frugal crosscountry roadtrippers can mitigate lodging costs by staying at discount motel chains such as motel 6 or camping along the way you can control what you pay for lodging to a large degree by choosing your accommodations carefully total trip costs adding up the cost of gas food and lodging a typical road trip from new york to los angeles actually has decreased slightly in price from 115920 to 115070 between 2015 and 2016 a moderate decrease in gas prices more than cancels out slight increases in food and lodging costs again dozens of variables exist that determine the cost of a road trip across the united states the analysis above considers a hypothetical trip with a familiar starting and ending point and uses broad averages for common costs incurred along the way the most important takeaway is that the cost of a road trip has not changed materially from 2015 to 2016 with gas prices still lower than they have been for much of the 21st century 2016 is a good time to drive or ride around the united states related articles
