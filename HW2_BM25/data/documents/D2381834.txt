metamorphism and metamorphic rocks chapter 8i the same elements that originally went into igneous minerals were incorporated into sedimentary rocks by fragmentation and dissolution and have now been heated pressurized and possibly chemically altered to form metamorphic rocks a conditions have gone far beyond those found near the surface of the earth ie temperature 200300 o c  pressure greater than a few hundred bars due to burial plate collisions and intrusion of magma ii agents of metamorphism a heat may be most essential because thermal energy breaks bonds  increases reaction rates heat source is intruding magma or the normal geothermal gradient ie rate of increase of temperature with depth within the earth  2030 o ckm fig418b pressure produces denser minerals  recrystallization by compressing the preexisting minerals it’s called directed pressure when not applied uniformly and results in foliation eg rock cleavage slaty cleavage and schistosity  figures 8689c chemically active fluids introduce new elements iii common metamorphic rocks figure 812a the foliated rocks below are listed in order of increasing grade or intensity of metamorphism figures 89811 813815 slate  phyllite  schist – gneiss1 these rocks show increasing grain size increasingly higher grade index minerals  more distinct foliation from rough parallelism of platy minerals to distinct bands of differing minerals b marble and quartzite are nonfoliated rocks metamorphic equivalents of limestone and sandstone respectively figures 816818 iv types of metamorphism a contact metamorphism near contact between magma and rock during intrusion causes new minerals larger grains and possibly introduction of new elements by hydrothermal solutions temperature most important but chemically active fluids also required1 large intrusions cause aureoles of decreasing intensity of metamorphism to develop around them figs 819820 b metamorphism along fault zones caused by purely mechanical processes as blocks of crust grind past one another pulverizing the existing minerals figure 823 c regional metamorphism great bulk of metamorphic rocks subjected to both increasing temperature and pressure not a localized process but instead form from regional heating and deformation often directed pressure causing foliation see figures 824 and 8261 depending on the composition of the original rock different mineral groups will result from various combinations of temperature and pressure2 index minerals  good geothermometers  geobarometers fig825 and box 82a aluminosilicate polymorphs  al 2 si o 5   understand phase diagram shown in box 82 and explained in classv minerals found almost exclusively in metamorphic rocks1 al 2si o 5polymorphs garnet epidote staurolite vi other important minerals not exclusively metamorphic1 quartz mica plagioclase amphibole pyroxene vii understand the relationships shown in fig 825
