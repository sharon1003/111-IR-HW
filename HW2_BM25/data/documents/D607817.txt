spiking it with atrazine is crop safety an issue post emerge with lumax duanemartin posted 3102011 2004 1663057  in reply to 1662770 subject re halex gt vs lumax callisto can be used either preemergence or postemergence however the rates are different preemergence callisto can be applied at 536 ozac postemergence callisto is to be applied at 3 ozac lumax  and lexar  at the recommended rates have the 536 ozac rate of callisto in them lumax and lexar are identical on this part of their makeup  halex has the 3 ozac rate of callisto in it i would imagine that since it has the lower callisto rate in it that enables it to have a wider window of postapplication halex also has a lower rate of dual ii magnum in it edited by martin 3102011 2006h2o town farmer posted 3102011 2155

also was it one pass herbicide farmer dale posted 3102011 2317 1663666  in reply to 1662770 subject re halex gt vs lumax casey illinois used halex last year had excellent control with it planning on using it this year did not spike anything with it jon sposted 3112011 0506 1663873  in reply to 1662770 subject re halex gt vs lumax you need to keep the callisto at 3 ozs for postemerge 28 pts of lumax would contain 3 ozs of callisto and 1 pt of dual and 7 pts of atrazine 36 pts of halex gt would contain 3 ozs of callisto and 1 pt of dual and 15 pts of touchdown halex gt has a slight price advantage according to my price sheet even if i add glyphosate to lumax and add atrazine to halex to make them equivalent  a little atrazine added to callisto seems to help it work better husker agronomist posted 3112011 1124 1664398  in reply to 1663873 subject re halex gt vs lumax iowa halex has a big price advantage for a one pass program its safe for crop use from a pre all the way up to v8 corn i try to put it on around the 2 leaf stage to extend its use throughout the year i always spike it with atrazine no matter what but that might be a problem in others soils so watch that i put it on late on a field with a bad weed history last year and it it burnt down 2 ft tall pigweed and kept it the cleanest its every been that farmer now doesnt put anything else down on his corn im not a lumax fan but im a huge believer in halex and always sing its praises jon sposted 3112011 1433 1664669  in reply to 1664398 subject re halex gt vs lumax husker agronomist  3112011 1124 halex has a big price advantage for a one pass program im not a lumax fan but im a huge believer in halex and always sing its praises first of all halex does not have a big price advantage if we are comparing equivalent a i secondly why would you sing praises of halex gt yet not be a fan of lumax they are almost interchangeable from a dual and callisto perspective halex gt just has more filler the ratios are the same they both have 10 times more dual than callisto in the package  so its virtually impossible for one to be more or less safe than the other at the same equivalent rates per active ingredient you mentioned you spike halex gt with atrazinewell you just made lumax lol halex gt  205 dual  205 callisto lumax  294 dual  294 callisto fwiw i have witnessed issues with callisto post in situations of overlapbut not always i have seen corn turn very pale yellow almost white in the lapped areas like i said not alwaysso i assume that this is brought on by a specific weather environmental condition i have also seen white corn from applications of lumax but again not consistentlysparrell posted 3112011 1450 1664683  in reply to 1662770 subject guys one important caution and distinction im almost 100 sure halex gt and lumax use the two different forms of the grass herbicide dual magnumdual ii magnum lumax uses dual ii magnum because it is labeled for preemergence use and therefore needs the ii benoxacor safener part of the dual ii magnum herbicide halex gt is strictly labeled for postemergence use and therefore has just straight dual magnum in the mix without the safener because when you apply it post the corn is already emerged and has no real use for the safener benoxacor i believe that is a very important distinction that needs to be understood about the two products edited by sparrell 3122011 1357jon sposted 3112011 2022 1665028  in reply to 1664683 subject re guys one important caution and distinction you know that is an excellent point both products have the smetolachlor ai listed but it isnt mentioned whether benoxacor is included on either label if that is true i guess that the lesson here is to just forget about purchasing halex gt altogether and make your own version of halex gt out of 875 per gallon glyphosate and lumax of course the op was asking about using these products post so your point is moot edited for spelling
