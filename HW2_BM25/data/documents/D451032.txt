practice essentials hyperthyroidism is a set of disorders that involve excess synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland which leads to the hypermetabolic condition of thyrotoxicosis the most common forms of hyperthyroidism include diffuse toxic goiter graves disease toxic multinodular goiter plummer disease and toxic adenoma see the image below bilateral erythematous infiltrative plaques on lower extremities in 42yearold man with graves disease are consistent with pretibial myxedema myxedematous changes of skin usually occur in pretibial areas and resemble orange peel in color and texture view media gallery signs and symptoms common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include the following nervousness anxiety increased perspiration heat intolerance hyperactivity palpitations common signs of thyrotoxicosis include the following tachycardia or atrial arrhythmia systolic hypertension with wide pulse pressure warm moist smooth skin lid lag stare hand tremor muscle weakness weight loss despite increased appetite although a few patients may gain weight if excessive intake outstrips weight lossreduction in menstrual flow or oligomenorrhea presentation of thyrotoxicosis varies as follows  1 younger patients tend to exhibit symptoms of sympathetic activation eg anxiety hyperactivity tremorolder patients have more cardiovascular symptoms eg dyspnea atrial fibrillation and unexplained weight loss patients with graves disease often have more marked symptoms than patients with thyrotoxicosis from other causes ophthalmopathy eg periorbital edema diplopia or proptosis suggests graves disease see clinical presentation for more detail diagnosis thyroid function tests for hyperthyroidism are as follows thyroidstimulating hormone tshfree thyroxine ft 4 or free thyroxine index fti—total t 4 multiplied by the correction for thyroid hormone bindingtotal triiodothyronine t 3 thyroid function study results in hyperthyroidism are as follows thyrotoxicosis is marked by suppressed tsh levels and elevated t 3 and t 4 levels patients with milder thyrotoxicosis may have elevation of t 3 levels only subclinical hyperthyroidism features decreased tsh and normal t 3 and t 4 levels autoantibody tests for hyperthyroidism are as follows anti–thyroid peroxidase antitpo antibody  nonspecific elevation with autoimmune thyroid disease found in 8 of graves patients thyroid stimulating antibody tsab  also known as thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin tsi longacting thyroid stimulator lats or tshreceptor antibody trab found in 6381 of graves disease a positive test is diagnostic and specific for graves disease autoantibody titers in hyperthyroidism are as follows graves disease  significantly elevated antitpo elevated tsab toxic multinodular goiter  low or absent antitpo and tsab toxic adenoma  low or absent antitpo and tsab patients without active thyroid disease may have mildly positive antitpo and tsab if the etiology of thyrotoxicosis is not clear after physical examination and other laboratory tests it can be confirmed by scintigraphy the degree and pattern of isotope uptake indicates the type of thyroid disorder findings are as follows graves disease – diffuse enlargement of both thyroid lobes with uniform uptake of isotope and elevated radioactive iodine uptake toxic multinodular goiter  irregular areas of relatively diminished and occasionally increased uptake overall radioactive iodine uptake is mildly to moderately increased subacute thyroiditis –very low radioactive iodine uptake see workup for more detail management treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptom relief as well as therapy with antithyroid medications radioactive iodine131  131 i or thyroidectomy symptomatic treatment is as follows oral rehydration for dehydrated patients betablockers for relief of neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms for mild ophthalmopathy saline eye drops as needed and tightfitting sunglasses for outdoors for visionthreatening ophthalmopathy highdose glucocorticoids with consideration for orbital decompression surgery and ocular radiation therapy antithyroid drug treatment is as follows used for longterm control of hyperthyroidism in children adolescents and pregnant women in adult men and nonpregnant women used to control hyperthyroidism before definitive therapy with radioactive iodine methimazole is more potent and longeracting than propylthiouracil propylthiouracil is reserved for use in thyroid storm first trimester of pregnancy and methimazole allergy or intolerance antithyroid drug doses are titrated every 4 weeks until thyroid functions normalize patients with graves disease may experience remission after treatment for 1218 months but recurrences are common within the following year toxic multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma will not go into remission radioactive iodine treatment is as follows preferred therapy for hyperthyroidism administered orally as a single dose in capsule or liquid form causes fibrosis and destruction of the thyroid over weeks to many months hypothyroidism is expected pregnancy breast feeding and recent lactation are contraindications radioactive iodine should be avoided in children younger than 5 years  2radioactive iodine is usually not given to patients with severe ophthalmopathy thyroidectomy is reserved for special circumstances including the following severe hyperthyroidism in children pregnant women who are noncompliant with or intolerant of antithyroid medication patients with very large goiters or severe ophthalmopathy patients who refuse radioactive iodine therapy refractory amiodaroneinduced hyperthyroidism patients who require normalization of thyroid functions quickly such as pregnant women women who desire pregnancy in the next 6 months or patients with unstable cardiac conditions guidelines for the management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis were developed by the american thyroid association and the american association of clinical endocrinologists  2 these were updated in 2016  3see treatment and medication for more detail next background
