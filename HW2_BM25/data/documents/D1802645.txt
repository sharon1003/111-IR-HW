professional learning communities and their prospect for reform by kimberly la prade ph d grand canyon university print emailin the development of the professional learning community plc as a model of school reform dufour et al 2005 emphasize that each word of a plc has been strategically chosen professional learning community has builtin purpose to its meaning professionals in this case educational experts engage in a continuous cycle of inquiry or learning that promotes a collaborative neighborhood or community this model has been gaining momentum as an increasing number of organizations and schools have succeeded with this model schmoker 2004 success breeds excitement professional learning communities have become one of the most talked about ideas in education today thompson gregg  niska 2004 the effectiveness of the professional learning community model the following recommended principles guide shift the development of a professional learning community from a focus on teaching to a focus on learning from working in isolation to working collaboratively from focusing on activities to focusing on results from fixed time to flexible time from average learning to individual learning from punitive to positive from teacher tellsstudent listens to teacher coachingstudent practice from recognizing the elite to creating opportunity for many winners du four eaker  du four 2005 p 179however at the end of the day the effectiveness of a professional learning community depends on the quality my emphasis of the conversations within the community a key component to effective reform when using a plc model is that the collaboration be purposeful du four 2004 strahans study of three elementary schools 2003 and langers study of 25 secondary schools 2000 highlighted professional conversations as a foundation for successful reform here it is important to note there is not just one component or focus that can shoulder the responsibility for successful reform the people the ideas and the tools necessary to build professional learning communities are interdependent according to peter senge 2000 in his article on leadership and learning what fundamentally will distinguish learning organizations from traditional authoritarian controlling organizations will be the mastery of certain basic disciplines p 15 these disciplines are outlined in the following table table 2 adapted from senge 2000the disciplines work together to build the capacity of the learning organization the effectiveness of a professional learning community would depend on the organizations ability to function at high levels in all five disciplines michael fullen 2000 has a formula that he uses to help describe an organizations ability to be successful in their reform efforts e  mca2  where e refers to the rate of efficacy of the system m refers to the motivation for reform will purpose commitment c refers to the capacity for reform skills knowhow available resources and a2 refers to assistance times accountability p 6 fullens formula and senges disciplines can work hand in hand to describe school change either of these explanations can serve to describe the effectiveness of a professional learning community no two plcs are the same plcs are as fluid and dynamic as the community they represent the effectiveness of any plc is only as strong as its weakest link and it becomes the challenge of the learning organization to evolve in pluripotent ways another significant finding huffman  jacobson 2003 is the relationship between leadership style and the perception that the professional learning community model makes a positive impact leaders that exhibit collaborative or transformational styles have been shown to have greater opportunities for success in developing professional learning communities p248 their research reinforces the trend for promoting more facilitative leadership styles in order to build partnerships that afford students every opportunity for success school climate the professional learning community model has now reached a critical junctureinitial enthusiasm gives way to confusion about fundamental concepts driving the initiative followed by implementation problemsreinforcing the conventional wisdom that promises â€˜this too shall pass dufour et al 2005 p 31 this can be avoided if the principal as instructional leader stays the course so that the core principless of the model become deeply embedded in the culture of the school p 32 it is the responsibility of the schools leadership to maintain a school climate that promotes a professional learning community at the 2005 national education associations annual convention in scottsdale arizona richard du four spoke about his tightloose style of leadership for example he demands achievement for all students however how the teachers choose to get there is up to them teachers and students are given ownership and it is empowering it is the driving force of the schools climate michael fullen 2000 addresses the importance of school climate to successful reform when he refers to climate as the inside story the climate must move from a culture of teaching to a culture of learning du four 2004 in this realm fullen 2000 further suggests that educators should pay attention to the difference between restructuring and reculturing in short he says the inside story is that there is no substitute for internal school development p3 roland barth 2006 a former public school teacher and principal champions a relationshiporiented approach to fostering successful school climates a precondition for doing anything to strengthen our practice and improve a school is the existence of a collegial culture p7 teacher morale moreover collaboration is a key component to teacher morale in susan j rosenholtzs 1991 important book teachers workplace the social organization of schools she summarizes that the hopes of educators were not likely the domain of isolated workplaces p207 where on the other side in collaborative schools many minds tended to work better than a few p208 in these types of schools the modus operandi was one of assistance these schools lived in a culture that empowered each other common was the call for requests of help or unselfish offers of assistance teachers work in teams engaging in an ongoing cycle of questions that promote deep team learning du four 2004 schools must dedicate the time required for colleagues to work together in order to maximize the benefits of teaming for meaningful collaboration to occur a number of things must also stop happening schools must stop pretending that merely presenting teachers with state standards or district curriculum guides will guarantee that all students have access to a common curriculum du four et al 2004 growth and development are a process that must become part of the daily lives of professional p19 furthermore the plc helps address the problem of teachers working in isolation p 26 with a decrease in isolation teacher morale would increase and the increased collegiality would have a positive impact on teacher efficacy yet according to peter senge in chapter 2 of educational leadership 2000 surprisingly few adults work rigorously to develop their own personal mastery p17 if that is the case it makes sense why professional development programs sometimes feel like such a struggle to take flight it is important for educators to rely on best practice why should we reinvent the wheel the main assumption of best practice professional development programs is that educators can learn from successful programs a true learning community according to schmoker 2004 identifies honors and provides opportunities for any and every successful team or teacher to share his or her methods and successes with colleagues p 88 teachers are empowered by results that show improvement across indicators it is that fist in the air exclamation of triumph that can pump up a teachers morale increased academic performance first as schools move to a learning centered culture they must investigate what to do with a student that experiences difficulty in learning with collaboration teachers become aware of the incongruity between their commitment to ensure learning for all students designed and applied curriculum and their lack of a coordinated strategy to respond when students do not learn acquired curriculum du four 2004 in a plc model teachers approach this discrepancy collaboratively by designing strategies to ensure that struggling students receive additional time and support no matter who their teacher is du four 2004 the plcs response must systematic timely and directive conclusion professional learning communities can work effectively but it is work as a community there is a responsibility to and for one another the goals for learning teams should promote equity and excellence student achievement is the priority it is not as much about teaching as it is about learning point of view is critical to the success of a professional learning community as the schools move from teacher mode to learning mode  it is a matter of direction the main enemies of largescale reform are overload and extreme fragmentation fullan 2000 p 6 the professional learning community model minimizes those dangers with shared responsibility between communities of experts working toward common goals there is less of a chance for overload or extreme fragmentation the prospect that a reform movement specifically plcs can be a longstanding effective
