did you know that adolf hitler professed to be a godfearing christian it is truehence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord”—adolf hitler mein kampfadolf hitler either sincerely thought in his own mind that he was justified in massmurdering millions of innocent people or else he was a liar of liars and falsely made the preceding statement to deceive the german people in his infamous work mein kampf regardless hitler professed to be a christian scary huh anything can be justified if you deny god and his law because then man becomes the highest moral standard it was a sad day in america when judge roy moore was disbarred as a judge for refusing to remove the ten commandments from the front of his courtroom the higher judges made an issue where there was no issue abusing their power god will judge those judges out of the words of their own mouths who put themselves above gods law judge moore was accused of “ willfully and publicly ” flouting the courts order to remove the ten commandments yet it is those very same judges who “ willfully and publicly ” flout gods holy commandments i am not being unkind just truthful gods law is the highest law in the universe as we see in these two examples that i just gave you people dont always do what is right but they think it is right hitler claimed he was doing “the will of the almighty creator” hitler was a fan of charles darwins the origin of species i sincerely doubt if hitler even believed he was a christian regardless my point is that hitler convinced the german people and the world that he was a true christian and they believed him over 200000000 people have been murdered over the past two
