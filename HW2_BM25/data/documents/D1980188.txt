construction the 29 massive blocks of marble weighing a total of 1100 tons were lifted into place by cranes a process well documented in ancient architectural and engineering writings that make clear romes proficiency in raising large weights off the ground even so the raising of the 53ton capital to a height of 120feet remains an impressive achievement and would have required a special purposebuilt towered arrangement of ropes pulleys and capstans operated by teams of oxen and slaves the standard roman treadwheel crane would have been inadequate for the job moreover the task would have been complicated further by the simultaneous construction of the nearby basilica ulpia despite all the building difficulties as well as a number of earthquakes in the region trajans column remains almost exactly upright leaning at an angle of less than half a degree for comparable engineering feats from classical antiquity see egyptian pyramids historical basrelief frieze the trajan column frieze is based on 5th century designs for greek pottery  designs repeated in both the high classical greek sculpture of the parthenon and the hellenistic greek sculpture of the pergamon altar it spirals upward around the shaft from base to capital it was carved only after the column was finished undoubtedly by the best sculptors in the city it comprises an engraved band  625 feet in length and 4 feet in height  covered in basrelief sculpture rarely more than 1 inch deep which forms a continuous narrative of trajans military campaigns in dacia now romania the upper parts of the frieze were not designed to be viewed from groundlevel but from the galleries of the surrounding buildings nonetheless adjustments were made to minimize optical foreshortening the size of the figures at the base for instance measure about 35inches 90cm compared with 50inches at the top see also architecture glossary  the lower half of the column narrates the first campaign 101102 and the upper half illustrates the second 105106 in total there are 155 scenes populated by more than 2500 figures  all sculpted in lowrelief  including 60 images of the emperor himself events unfold against a flat relief background occasionally there is a suggestion of a town with houses walls and bridges interestingly fewer than 20 scenes show actual fighting between the opposing armies most depict the daytoday activities of the roman legionaires providing a wealth of visual data on the military equipment techniques and weaponry of the roman army however the frieze does illustrate certain specific events from the dacian campaigns including the first crossing of the danube by the roman legion trajans voyage up the danube the surrender of the dacians at the close of the first war the great sacrifice by the danube bridge during the second war the assault on the dacian capital and the death of the dacian king decabalus in addition dacian weapons and armour are illustrated on the pedestal frieze in meticulous detail on the cornice bunches of oak leaves tied with ribbons are held by eagles two of which are extant for more about the art of ancient rome see early roman art 51027 bce and christian roman art 313 ce onwards it is possible that the highly detailed marble sculpture pictorializes trajans own commentary on the dacian wars now lost which he wrote during the period 106110 bce a fullsize cast of trajans column is on display at the victoria and albert museum in london artistic influence trajans column its architecture and sculpture had a significant impact on late roman art and important buildings its helical stairway design in particular spread gradually throughout the empire the aweinspiring design of the column was later adopted by the emperors antoninus pius and marcus aurelius while sixteen centuries later a very similar column carved in basrelief was erected in the place vendome in paris to commemorate napoleons famous victory at austerlitz further resources for more information about ancient art from classical antiquity see the following resources sculpture of ancient greece background  archaic greek sculpture 600480 bce  early classical greek sculpture 480450 bce  late classical greek sculpture 400323 bce
