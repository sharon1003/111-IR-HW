may 12 2014 by andrew minalto  28 comments don’t mess up product pictures on e bayone from every two e bay listings i look at has some sort of issue with product pictures… in fact it’s probably even more common than thatit’s unbelievable that so many sellers simply don’t understand the basics of image editing resizing and saving correctly for web and e bay use the most common problems i see are wrong image file type wrong image size wrong image file size wrong image resolution wrong proportions you have to get all 5 of these right to have perfect product images on e bay by messing up only one of these things you’ll do a lot of harm to your listings which will also affect your conversion rates and sales in today’s blog post i want to cover this problem once and for all and give you a clear plan to follow so you can fix your existing product images and do everything correctly for all future listings while this may sound like a complicated and overly technical subject when you know the basics behind it it’s actually very simple and straightforward so let’s get startedimage file type there are various image file formatstypes available such as jpegpnggifand others for e bay product pictures you want to use one and only one image file type which is – jpegjpg both are the same file format just named differently depending on the operating system your pc uses simple – only jpeg files and nothing else this should be so obvious but i still see listings with png and gif images which are really only meant to be used for graphic files and illustrations not product picturesimage size now the most complicated part – image size for web use it’s measured in pixels and not centimetres like some people believe one pixel is basically one dot on your computer screen it’s a metric value so 20 pixels will be 2 times more than 10 pixels from digital cameras you get a very large image size by default but you can’t use such images for your e bay listings they’re way too big and will load very slowly due to their size so you want to edit them before uploading to e bay or your own hosting account as a general rule of thumb your gallery image should be 1600 x 1600 pixels or more 2000 x 2000 will also be ok but there’s no real need to go bigger than 1600 x 1600 pixels yes it’s a square image which means that you’ll have to do some cropping which we’ll cover later on for now you just have to understand that you want to createsave a seperate image for gallery use sized exactly 1600 x 1600 pixels for your templatelisting description part you need to use a different set of images ones much smaller than the 1600 x 1600 pixels used for the gallery image the exact size of the images you will use depends on the size of your template as the pictures obviously have to fit within the template’s width you can easily measure the width of your template using this simple approach open up your template and using screen capture software such as the sniping tool for windows capture an image of your template’s description area save this image on your desktop then simply rightclick over this newly created screenshot to get a list of options select properties  details and there in image dimensions you’ll see the exact width of the screen capture which of course corresponds to the width of your template if this sounds too complicated to you just stick with 600 pixels in width for all product images you use in your template’s description block 600 pixels should fit almost any e bay template out there so that’s a very safe bet what about the height of the image well if the width is 600 pixels the height will usually be around 400 pixels height isn’t really that important as it won’t break up your listing template just use whatever size seems right for you when cropping images if the product image is in portrait format the height will actually be more than the width so in cases like these the width will still be 600 pixels but the height could be 800 or even 900 pixels this is fine as long as it looks good and suits the product you’re selling image file size this won’t directly affect how your images look on e bay but it will affect your listing’s performance how if your image file size is too big your listing and images will take longer to loadshow up in a viewer’s browser this is crucial nowadays when so many people use mobile devices to shop on e bay the slower your listing loads the higher the chance that people will hit that back button and never even get to see your offer image file size is measured in kb kilo bytes and for webe bay use you really want to keep this number down while still maintaining good image quality by default a high quality jpeg image sized 600 x 400 pixels can be as large as 300kb or more this is too much especially if you have loads of images in your listing how to reduce the image file size use compression when saving your images before uploading them to e bay or your own hosting account later on we’ll cover exactly how to do this but just so you know – by using image compression the size of your image will go down significantly but the quality will remain almost exactly the same regular internet users won’t even notice the difference a properly compressed jpeg image sized 600 x 400 pixels should be no more than 100kb 150kb max for complicated images if you have lots of white space in your images the size can be as small as 50kb which is perfect for e bay use and will load up very quickly when people land on your listing image resolution this is measured in dpi dots per inch technically for web use we should use ppi pixels per inch but basically these terms are used in the same way when talking about simple image processing the rule is very simple here – use nothing but 72 dpi for any kind of product images graphics website design or any other files for web use your camera takes images  300 dpi which is a much higher resolution and meant to be used for printing purposes you don’t need 300 dpi for web use monitors can’t display more than 72 dpi so that’s the industry’s standard and the exact resolution you need to use for e bay product images to keep their size down proportions lastly one of the most common mistakes i see newbie photo editors make when resizing and cropping their images is to screw up the image by not following its original proportions this is usually caused by the wrong method of resizing and cropping product images you want to keep the correct aspect ratio for your images to avoid an outcome like this later on i’ll show you an easy way to fix this potential problem by resizing your images directly using the cropping tool pretty simple right then why are you not following this why are you making a mess out of your e bay product images chances are you don’t know how to edit and save your images correctly so let’s cover this process in a simple step by step guide picture editing  saving first of all you’ll need some kind of photo editing software to edit the images you get from your digital camera remember – you can’t use images directly from the camera as they’re way too big to be used on e bay you need to edit and properly save them first so they fit all 5 criteria already mentioned in this post i personally use photoshop elements for this task which is a very popular photo editing software made by adobe you can get a 30 day fully functional free trial here or simply purchase the software from adobe’s website e bay or amazon expect to pay around 6070 pounds for a physical version of this software if you can’t invest any money into this there are always free alternatives out there one of the most popular is gimp – an open source photo editing software that works pretty much like photoshop it’s more complicated and not as user friendly but hey – it’s free and for basic image editing you really need to learn just 2 or 3 functions if gimp looks too complicated to you there are free online tools that can be used for the same job such ashttppixlrcomhttpfotoflexercomhttpwwwfotorcomhttpwwwpicmonkeycomhttpipiccycomi personally don’t like working with these online tools as they’re slow and somewhat awkward to use especially if i need to edit large batches of images but for some people they may be just fine no matter what software you use the principles stay the same and the toolsfunctions i’ll cover in this guide will be available on all programs first things first so the first thing you want to do is copy all product images you have taken from your camera to your pc there are two ways to do thisa via usb cable – connect your camera to your pc and copy all images to your local hard driveb memory card – most computers nowadays have memory card readers so you can simply take the memory card out of your camera plug it into your pc and copy images this way option b is quicker and easier as there’s no messing around with cables plus transfer speed from card to pc is usually higher than via usb if you don’t have a card reader built in to your pc – then of course you have no choice but to use a usb cable to connect your camera to your computer you might be wondering why i’m even bothering to mention this step but i’ve seen many people make the mistake of not copying the image files to their computer and just opening them directly from the camera technically you can do this but i wouldn’t recommend it as there are several technical issues that can occur as a result so keep things simple for yourself and make sure you always copy the pictures directly to your computer before starting any editing work step 1 – open the image in editor simply open an image in your chosen photo editing program you can work with multiple images at once if using photoshop or gimp but if you’re completely new to this start with just one image at a time step 2 – croppingresizing in most cases you’ll want to start the editing process with the cropping tool sometimes you’ll have some background setup details shown in the image like in the example below that you’ll need to remove but more often you’ll want to crop your product image so that the item itself is better positioned also during this process we’ll resize the image so it’s perfect size for e bay useto do this click on the cropping tool from the lefthand side menu remember you can always undo a step if you’ve made a mistake by going to edit  undo you can go back several steps this way so don’t panic if something you do doesn’t work out as planned – simply undo the last few operations and you’ll be back at the same point you started at if you’re working on listing images the size will be different compared to gallery images as covered earlier in the post in most cases the width will be around 600 pixels and height – 400 pixels but this will depend on the template you use and how large an image you want to display for the product you’re selling lastly you need to set the resolution here remember you want to use 72 dpi and nothing else so just do that and write 72 dpi in that block once you have set the resolution to 72 dpi and customised the height and width all you have to do is select all of the image with the cropping tool enabled and hit enter or click on the green tick by doing this you’ll automatically resize the image to your preset values if you want to leave some parts of the image outside your final edit you can simply select part of the image with the cropping tool like this now our image is prepared for the last step in this process…step 3 – saving for web use after you’ve cropped  resized your image all you have to do is save it for web use in photoshop elements go to file  save for web and a new window will show up with some variable settings just select jpeg high from the preset list if it’s not already selected by default and click on the ok  save button this process compresses the image’s file size so it’s perfect for e bay and general web use you don’t want to save these images as full quality jpeg files they’ll be too big in size and will load slowly in your listings always use the save for web function in photoshop to fix this problem with the click of a button if you don’t have photoshop there should still be some kind of image compression method available in your software look for jpeg quality settings or image compression settings to adjust these values and that’s all there is to it just follow these 3 simple steps and you’ll get perfect e bay product pictures every single time there’s no place for interpretation – this is a set of rules you have to follow each and every time you create pictures for your e bay listings just to remind you of the 5 things you need to keep in mind when preparing product images for e bay use image file type – use only the jpeg file format and nothing else image size – 1600 x 1600 pixels for gallery image and a smaller size for description images the exact size depends on the template you use image file size – use the save for web function in photoshop or image compression function in other software to keep files sizes down to a minimum image resolution – 72 dpi and nothing else proportions – use the “keep aspect ratio” function if you want to maintain the exact image proportions as in the original picture or deselect this if you want to crop out selected parts of your image still confused please reread this guide as many times as needed to fully understand all the technical terms so you can once and for all get this right you only have to learn this stuff once after that you’ll be a pro picture editor and your e bay images will always be in perfect shapeany further questions feel free to ask below this post and i’ll answer you personally

information it has confirmed a lot stuff i have listed my first items onto ebay store i’m selling wedding invitations the invitation pictures i have in my listing have all been printed on ivory linen card however the pictures look very different from the way it looks on my computer all the pictures are 1600 x 1600 and file size is about 15mb i’ve even tried using 2100×2100 and other sizes but no joy only way you an see the actual design of the invitations is by zooming in and this shouldn’t be the issue any ideas any suggestions would be appreciated andrew minalto2 years ago reply if there are small details you need to show – use additional images zoomed inmacro shots so that people can see those small details without zooming in your images andrew james2 years ago reply thanks for this – have been looking for ideas on how to jazz up my e bay listings just wanted to make the point that nobody needs to worry at all about the resolution of images for web display you can ignore it entirely it doesn’t need to be changed to 72dpi or anything else image resolution is just an instruction to the printer about how closely to space the dots when viewed on screen the image is always displayed at the resolution of the monitor its being viewed on regardless of what dpi the picture is saved as the dpi makes absolutely no difference to file size because a pixel is still just a pixel

i never click pictures all i do is copy from other websites d as an example lets say i want to sell lcd assembly for a phone asus zenfone 5 and here is one picture i want to make this perfect for my listing could you answer below questions1 please explain me steps for this image using some online free photo editors since i dont know usage of photoshop or gimp i tired editing it using paint but whats with resize… if i keep ‘maintain aspect ratio’ checked i cannot make it 600400 and if i unselect ‘maintain aspect ratio’ and den do it 600400 pic gets very ugly as you have mentioned even in mistake points people make in your article so how to do it in your example above does photoshop do something differently does it maintain aspect ratio if yes how editing to 600400 doesnot alter proportions horribly2 secondly whats best to erase those watermarks and come up with your own watermark  d is there any simple editor for newbies to do that3 the pic i have mentioned in link clearly has very less width and very large height i dont think its possible to get 600400 pixels for such image by not distorting it please let me know above and then i would ask more if i am confused thanks a lotandrew minalto3 years ago reply hi manjo1 just check you tube – tons of videos there on how to do such simple edits in any program2 you can’t do that it’s stealing3 if it’s a portrait image you will want to change size accordingly to say 400 x 600 or so longest side – height thanks andrew sammy3 years ago reply what size images would you recommend for an ecommerce website andrew minalto3 years ago reply hi sammyit will depend on your shop’s layout – how large image fits the product page then for the zoom in version usually you would go max 1000 pixels in widthheight but if it’s a very
