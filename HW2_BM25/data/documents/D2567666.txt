let�s start with the simplest pneumatic circuit one thermostat and one controlled device the controlled device could be an actuator like a water valve actuator or a damper actuator or else it could be a control device like a pneumaticelectric switch the controlled device can itself be direct or reverse acting  in addition controlled devices can be also be normally open or normally closed the main line pressure is the constant pressure coming from the air compressor the main line pressure is always regulated the pressure is usually set in the range of 15 to 25 psi for the purposes of this article we will set the main line pressure at 20 psi direct acting da pneumatic thermostat increases branch line pressure as temperature increases reverse acting ra pneumatic thermostat decreases branch line pressure as temperature increases the amount of change in temperature that is required to boost the output pressure of the pneumatic thermostat branch line from 3 to 13 psi full closed to full open is called the proportional band or the throttling range normally a pneumatic thermostat throttling range is set from 2 to 6 degrees lets use an example of a 4 degree throttling range example a thermostat has a throttling range proportional band of 4 degrees the occupant sets the pneumatic thermostat to 71 degrees a direct acting da pneumatic thermostat should increase the branch line pressure from 3 psi at 69 degrees to 13 psi at 73 degrees 71 degrees should correspond to 8 psi which in pneumatics is top dead center a reverse acting ra pneumatic thermostat would decrease the branch line pressure from 3 psi at 73 degrees to 13 psi at 69 degrees but again 71 degrees should correspond to 8 psi top dead center now lets define the controlling device as a water valve with a pneumatic actuator an actuator is like a bellows or a piston as the air pressure increases the piston moves when air pressure is removed the piston returns to its minimum position how does it get back to minimum position a spring of course springs are a critical component of pneumatic controlled devices what is frequently misunderstood is that the springs are tuned to the actuation specifications springs are color coded according to their spring pressure and size sometimes the color is only a little stamp you may have to clean the entire spring with glass cleaner to locate the color code then call your controls vendor and ask them  for instance what pressure is a 3 inch diameter blue honeywell spring  the answer will be a spring range for example 4 to 8 psi lets assign this actuator as a directacting water valve actuator with a spring range of 9 to 13 psi and a normally closed valve so the thermostat has a throttling range proportional band of 4 degrees the occupant sets the pneumatic thermostat to 71 degrees a direct acting da pneumatic thermostat should increase the branch line pressure from 3 psi at 69 degrees to 13 psi at 73 degrees 71 degrees should correspond to 8 psi which in pneumatics is top dead center but remember the spring range is 9 to 13 psi what happens at the other end room temperature of 69 degrees and below thermostat sends a signal of 3 psi but the spring�s lowest capability is 9 psi the spring�s pressure outweighs the air pressure so the actuator does not move and the valve remains in its normally closed position as the temperature rises the branch line air pressure from the thermostat also rises when the air pressure rises above 9 psi the air pressure outweighs the spring�s minimum pressure the actuator moves to the balance point and the normally closed valve opens somewhat as the air pressure continues to rise the directacting actuator moves to proportionately higher balance points the normally closed valve opens by the same proportion pressures at or above 13 psi outweigh the spring�s maximum pressure the actuator is inflated to its fully extended position and the normally closed valve remains fully open so the flow of water starts as a trickle at a room temperature slightly more than 71 degrees and increases to full flow as the temperature rises to 73 degrees full flow would be maintained at any temperature above 73 degrees this sequence of operations is commonly used in chilled water air conditioning fancoil units when the room temperature exceeds the setpoint the chilled water is allowed to flow through the coil which serves to cool the room a properly tuned pneumatic circuit will respond to the temperature by opening the water valve to the exact position necessary to provide the correct amount of chilled water to the coil
