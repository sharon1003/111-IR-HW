week at the end of july we have a young family so although wed like to be central i am concerned about noise levels as pointed out by many reviewers around plaza de la merced area any advice on where to stay so that we are close to good restaurants etc but perhaps a little quieter thanks mar 21st 2012 0345 pm  2ympepe join date aug 2009posts 63stay in marbella if you can make the switch el fuerte is in a super location and has 2 hotels at different price points mar 22nd 2012 1258 am  3wom batt join date jul 2010posts 543you do not say what kind of accommodation you are wanting i have no recollection in many years of one or two night visits of external noise disturbance and cannot speak of staying near that plaza there are plenty of sc and hotel accommodation a short bus ride or 5 10 or 15 minutes walk from the city proper and like la malagueta plenty to eat in the vicinity  examples httpwwwownersdirectcoukspains19654htm and hotel ms maestranza i rarely stay anywhere else but the ibis the other side of downtown but as i said these last few years only for a couple of nights mar 22nd 2012 0311 am  4isabel join date jan 2003posts 6249this hotel is very central but i dont recall

would be the parador gibralfaro at the top of the hill  beautiful but nowhere to walk in the evening also the old fort itself is not safe to visit in the evening mar 22nd 2012 0534 am  6josele join date aug 2004posts 1309what are you looking for hotel or apartment city center shall be noisy at night but it greatly depends on the area i may suggest small hotels in the east pedregalejo with a good nightlife only at the waterfront and 15 min by bus from the city center but it greatly depends on what youre looking for or your budget please be more specific mar 23rd 2012 0833 am  7dmacjoriginal

are some names of hotels in pedregalejo  we lived in the area many years ago but of course things have changed want to eat conchas finas grilled sardines and chanquetes if still available is the restaurant antonio martin still extant  thanks mar 25th 2012 0949 am  12stevelyon join date feb 2003posts 1270pedregalejo is very atmospheric but its not central to malaga and not nearly as nice as torremolinos not far from malaga and probably the same distance as pedregalejo is torremolinos which gets a very unfair bad press but to me its a fantastic area to stay  with la carhuela with its many fish restaurants a short stroll away along a wonderful promenade bustling with people and lined with barbecues grilling sardines mar 25th 2012 1021 am  13bedar join date jan 2003posts 4021thanks stevelyon pedregalejo is rather a barrio of malaga torre is much farther i agree that torre gets a bum rap more people should stay there it has alot to offer i lived there in the 60s just looking for a different place to stay for sept who knows what with all the new roads and faster travel well probably drive straight thru from almeria to algeciras and wind up at the reina cristina mar 25th 2012

be a few larger ones for families mar 26th 2012 0210 pm  15josele join date aug 2004posts 1309bedar hotels in pedregalejo are mostly 3star extant houses turned into hotels but they are nice la chancla right on the waterfront more quiet streets las acacias h pedregalejo h elcano chanquetes you can have but are from fish factory or the like not exactly the real thing but i know where to get them of course antonio martin exists but it is now dani garcías la moraga pedregalejo is a malaga neighborhood in the east part of malaga it is in the very city i mean 5 min by car from city center

are divine mar 28th 2012 1136 am  17ekscrunchy join date may 2005posts 21290i hope you all will report back especially about the quest for conchas finas mar 28th 2012 0210 pm  18bedar join date jan 2003posts 4021josele  i did some research with the help of a friend who has a terrific memory the name of the seafood placebar in torre is vina p evidently it is one of the original bars there dates from 1951 conchas finas are difficult to clean and this place served them without any trace of sand our friend said that vina p was still there in 98 so who knows maybe its still there mar 28th 2012
