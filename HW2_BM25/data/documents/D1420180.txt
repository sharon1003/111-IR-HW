history see the list below sesamoiditis is manifested by pain beneath the first metatarsal head with weight bearing on the ball of the foot or with motion at the first metatarsophalangeal mtp joint common complaints include pain with jumping and with pushing off to run turf toe is an acute injury that involves forced hyperdorsiflexion of the first mtp joint as the classic mechanism of injury this results in a sprain of the first mtp joint symptoms include pain and decreased range of motion rom at the mtp joint and difficulty running or changing directions sever disease eg calcaneal apophysitis is a common cause of acute or chronic heel pain in children during early adolescence athletes typically complain of heel pain or soreness that improves with rest and worsens with prolonged running posterior tibial tendinitis occurs most commonly as an idiopathic condition in middleaged females athletes with this condition may present with planovalgus deformity and often play sports with sudden stopstart or pushoff activity such as soccer football and basketball patients typically complain of pain inferior to the medial malleolus and decreased rom patients with peroneal tendon subluxationdislocation typically present with acute pain and swelling that is centered behind the lateral malleolus with extension proximally over the tendons these symptoms are caused by a dorsiflexioninversion stress injury that pulls the peroneal retinaculum off the lateral malleolus athletes usually complain of snapping and sudden sharp pain when changing directions or pushing off with the foot patients with peroneal tendinitis present with pain and swelling on the lateral aspect of the ankle usually posterior to the lateral malleolus patients may also complain of either a giving way or sharp pinching sensation of the lateral ankle longdistance running and any activity that requires repetitive cutting and pushing off can aggravate this condition patients with fhl tenosynovitis usually present with pain in the posteromedial aspect of the ankle the pain improves with rest and increases in sports that require pushoff and extended running fifth metatarsal fractures are a common complication with ankle sprains so physicians must always address this condition when obtaining the patients history three types of fractures occur in the fifth metatarsal avulsion fractures off the base commonly occur with ankle sprains particularly the plantar flexioninversion variety proximal diaphyseal fractures result from repetitive cyclical stress to the foot and typically have a prodromal presentation transverse fractures occurring within 15 cm from the tuberosity at the metaphysealdiaphyseal junction are the definitive jones fracture contrary to popular belief true jones fractures primarily occur traumatically pain may be diffuse and difficult to localize depending on the type and location of the fracture morton neuroma causes pain over the ball of the foot followed by radiation of pain to the affected toes the patient may complain of numbness tingling burning or a sensation similar to an electrical shock pain usually eases upon removal of the offending shoes and rubbing the ball of the foot near the affected web space the information obtained in the history usually reveals the wearing of tightfitting highheeled or pointedtoed shoes which are commonly worn by females who are young to middleaged athletes who use a repetitive stepoff motion eg sprinters jumpers those who regularly use stair steppers or treadmill machines may complain of these symptoms most athletes with stress fractures complain of progressively increasing pain that correlates with a change in activity footwear training playing surface or equipment trauma is not part of the history pain is exacerbated by impact loading and is ameliorated with rest the tmt fracture dislocation or lisfranc fracture dislocation is named after a field surgeon in napoleons army who described amputations through the tmt joint injury to the tmt joint was common when a soldiers boot became caught in the stirrup during a fall from horseback more recently lisfranc injuries have been observed in snowboarders and windsurfers as well as in football and rugby players typically the lisfranc fracture dislocation occurs when one player falls onto the heel of another while the foot is plantar flexed and fixed resulting in axial loading the clinical presentation depends on the degree of displacement almost universally patients complain of pain in the midfoot with the inability to bear weight edema and ecchymosis are usually present gross deformity of the forefoot may be seen in severe cases vascular compromise may manifest as absence of the dorsalis pedis pulse next physical
