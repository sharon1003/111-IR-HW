outages protection ratio in mobile telephony the quality of service is often expressed in terms of the probability of outage experienced by subscribers near the boundary of the base station service area because of limited spectrum availability radio networks become increasingly limited by mutual interference between users therefore the outage probability is usually determined in terms of the probability that the signaltojointinterference ratio drops below a minimum required ratio z if noise is also significant an outage occurs when the signaltonoiseplusinterference ratio c i  n drops below the threshold z the receiver parameter appears in many studies throughout the technical literature the parameter is calledthe cochannel rejection ratiothe receiver thresholdthe threshold ratiothe capture ratiothe interference criterion orthe protection ratio the parameter protection ratio however is principally intended as a parameter in system design or network planning describing the minimum required average ciratio rather than merely a receiver parameter for instance as indicated by the ccir in report 3585 fade margins may be implicitly included in the required protection ratio to allow for the effects of multipath fading or terrain irregularities the terms threshold and  capture  were originally used in studies of the demodulation of fm broadcast transmissions the choice of the value of z in general depends on the required quality of service and may therefore be somewhat arbitrary the outage criterion can for instance be a certain figure of merit subjectively determined by a representative panel of listeners or in a digital system an instantaneous bit error rate or digitalword erasure rate typical receiver thresholds in general the receiver threshold considered depends both on the required output performance ie at base band and on the type of interference if the characteristics of the interference resemble awgn the relation between the required signaltonoise ratio at the detector output snr and expressions for z are well known for linear modulation such as am and ssb and any gaussian interference the relation between the snr at the detector output and the rf ciratio is linear however in nonlinear modulation such as phase modulation  pm or frequency modulation  fm  the postdetection signaltonoise ratio can be greatly enhanced as compared to baseband transmission or compared to linear modulation this enhancement occurs as long as the received predetection signaltonoise ratio is above a certain minimum value called the threshold typically for fm signals the threshold is in the range of 3 to 10 d b this threshold fundamentally limits the noise immunity of various types of nonlinear modulation techniques table typical receiver

modulation which is more commonly used in mobile radio nets the receiver threshold can be reduced but cannot be substantially lower than 5 to 10 d b the ccir indicates in report 319 that the threshold is around 80 about 19 d b for fm voice signals with an occupied bandwidth of 125 k hz and 7 to 8 8 to 9 d b for fm voice signals with bt 25 to 30 k hz a receiver threshold of 17 d b z  50 is used in the u s amps cellular radio network employing fm voice with a peak deviation of 12 k hz and a channel spacing virtually identical to the occupied bandwidth of 30 k hz for a ciratio higher than 17 d b most subscribers experience the quality of voice reception as good or excellent an outage probability of 10 is tolerated for a rayleighfading channel the receiver threshold below which the received voice becomes unintelligible is much lower and may be in the order of 6 to 10 d b if however this outage criterion is used tolerable outage probabilities will be significantly smaller typically 1 or 01 figure mean opinion score of speech quality as a function of ci ratio for indigo digital and analogue orange systems for digital modulation the receiver threshold may be defined as the instantaneous ciratio at which the shortterm average bit error probability or the block erasure probability exceeds a maximum tolerable value which is called the outage criterion if interference has a gaussian probability density and if the interference signal is independent from bit to bit the relation between outage probability and required ci threshold is in the form of an errorfunction if coherent detection is used on the other hand for a single interferer with a peaklimited signal such as a constantenvelope bpsk signal the bit error rate is nearly a step function of the ciratio if the ciratio is above a certain threshold value error rates are negligible whereas below this threshold bit errors rapidly tend towards 50 for the digital paneuropean gsm system using gmsk modulation a receiver threshold of 95 d b is considered to describe the performance of practical receivers appropriately jpls wireless communication reference website Â© 1993 1995
