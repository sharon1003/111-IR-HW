output power of audio amplifier the output power is a important characteristic for audio amplifiers introduction amplifiers have a specific power which is indicated in watts the power is the product of current and voltage in a loudspeaker the supplied electrical power is converted almost exclusively in heat only a fraction of the electrical power can be converted from loudspeakers into sound energy this relationship describes the efficiency which is indicated in per cent without proving it eg a sound power of 30 watts would cause an indescribable volume with hifi the amplifier power output is measured by alternating voltages measuring with dc voltage everything would be simpler measuring with dc voltages is not possible most audio amplifier does not transfer dc voltages the background for it is that a woofer coil can be easily destroyed by dc voltage therefore is in such a way designed the amplifiers that dc voltage is not amplified meaning of the output power for an audio amplifier how much output power needed in addition a few questions how loud do you want to hear how large is s the efficiency of your loudspeaker how large is your room and how far far away sits you from the loudspeakers how does the distortion factor of your amplifier with increasing volume change with your loudspeaker how well can your amplifier dissipate the developing heat to the ambience can you answer these questions clearly probably you do not know actually needed power output i also not it is perfectly indifferently how much power output an hifi amplifier has the amp must supply only the desired volume in the desired quality with your loudspeakers it is technically possible to build an amplifier with only 30 watts that is better than a 200 watt amplifier with same low volume level with high loads which demand more than rated output to which small one naturally throws up the sponge might be logical the question of which amplifiers the better one is that with 30 watts or with 200 watts it is not a question of the power but alone a question of the construction specification and the electrical special equipment eg protective circuits for amplifiers and loudspeakers what would you have rather a formula 1 engine with 800 hp or a modern marine diesel with 800 hp i rather take a modern marine diesel why the marine diesel has a torque plot of it dreams the formula 1 engine at night the marine diesel has a long service life and a full power firmness of it dreams the formula 1 engine during whole race in the comparison many amplifiers must be built after economical considerations the placement robot in the assembly hangar it must be constant in motion in mass production the number of elements per equipment is to be small expensive elements are not applicable in many cases from cost reasons the average customers request required for payable achievement understandably orients itself mass production to it a good amplifier with high power and low manufacturing costs to build is a tightrope act in addition the elements must be often loaded to to their absolute maximum ratings the manufacturer calculates by right into his development also that the user demands the maximum power only most rarely in other words many of the constructions are not appropriate for continuous stress under full load some cooling systems are not appropriate for the rated output the transistors and thus the heat sinks become very hot try it that heats the interior and other construction units eg electrolyte condensers which lose on life span how much per cent of the maximum power takes a music signal up at all is entitled other question whose answer extends the life of most amplifiers clearly end of the discussion the answer is that most amplifiers for a realistic medium volume music pleasure are sufficiently cooled in the long term however only few are appropriate for the indicated rated output the full powerfirm well cooled 30 watt amplifier achieves a similar size and still higher costs than the 200 watts paper tiger the smaller need according to power made it possible to built better circuits however only few customers would buy the small expensive exclusively developed amplifier therefore a majority of the industrie does not build this amplifier at all only for enthusiasts i want to never say thereby the industry build bad amplifiers the industry build very good amplifiers in a very good pricepower relationship somebody who is cocksure nothing more leaves itself to improve has only little knowledge mathematics and power
