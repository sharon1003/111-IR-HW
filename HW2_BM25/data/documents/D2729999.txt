convinced to help a person out in time of need however i will say with some relief that after talking to several clevelandarea banks this week i dont think its as easy to change a pin as some might fear i didnt find any banks  including a few i tested with my own accounts  where you could change your pin to a new pin that you choose without at least knowing the old pin as well as some other information the bigger banks seem to have the more secure policies at key bank for example customers can change their pins by phone but our authentication process goes beyond social security number or

pin to a specific new number at an atm using his old pin or inside a branch by providing identification if a pnc customer cant remember his pin then a randomlygenerated pin is mailed to the customers address of record once the customer gets that and uses it at the atm then the pin can be changed again at the atm to a number the customer selects at fifth third charter one and huntington it also requires multiple verification steps to change a pin we use authentication and advanced fraud monitoring to protect our card customers when they make changes to their accounts said laura passerallo of
