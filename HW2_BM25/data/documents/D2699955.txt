helping women successfully manage pelvic organ prolapse urinary incontinence and chronic hip pain without dangerous surgery so they can live full active lives welcome to all woman determined to help themselves while not lifethreatening pelvic conditions such as pelvic organ prolapse rectocele cystocele or uterine prolapse urinary incontinence and chronic hip pain can make your life a misery if the idea of surgery makes you uncomfortable you came to the right place since i published my book saving the whole woman in 2003 and the newer book save your hips thousands of women from around the world are avoiding dangerous and ineffective surgery for these most common of womens health issues of pelvic organ prolapse urinary incontinence and chronic hip pain as much as i love books producing them is too slow in the fastpaced world in which we live as a result in recent years i am producing more video where i can make more current data available to women who need it faster than with books if you prolapse is disrupting your life you are not alone few women even appreciate prolapse exists until they themselves become symptomatic fifty to eighty percent of women will experience prolapse in their lives once considered an “old ladies” problem prolapse is now epidemic in the postpartum population and even teenage girls call us at times what i discovered and what makes whole woman revolutionary is that pelvic organ prolapse is a postural problem pelvic organ support is a postural system you can manage your prolapse for a lifetime and take back your life using the postural methods i developed while doctors promote kegel exercises to help prolapse please read my free article why kegels dont work on this site to learn that kegels are likely to make your condition worse urinary incontinence reduces the quality of life for countless women young and old my specialized methods can stabilize and in most cases restore control without medical interventions that can leave disastrous side effects over twenty years of research in the scientific literature and the feedback from thousands of women worldwide tell thrilling stories of recovery if you are posthysterectomy your condition is more complex but many of our posthysterectomy sisters have gotten significant stabilization and improvement from my methods in most cases the benefits are enough to justify saying “no” to further surgeries that are likely to create other problems leading to still more surgery there is no surgical cure for prolapse chronic hip pain affects hundreds of thousands in the 18th and 19th centuries physicians understood and had effective treatments for chronic hip pain but the surgeons werent interested in these slower more methodical approaches they wanted to do surgery and after a centurylong battle inside the medical profession surgeons redefined orthopedics as a surgical specialty much of the wisdom accumulated by traditional orthopedists has been lost why does this matter hip surgeries are complex invasive and often produce catastrophic results imagine driving your car to the shop for a tuneup and being told you must replace the engine you only need a tune up but the mechanic only knows how to replace engines this is the state of orthopedics today as with prolapse and incontinence if you live with chronic hip pain you are not broken and do not need fixing your chronic condition needs management over time to bring yourself back to health replacing your hip joint may offer short term relief although it often doesnt but the longterm consequences are dire at whole woman we offer an effective program for reducing or eliminating hip pain and restoring hip function without dangerous surgery the next three things to do there are three pillars that support your pelvic health they are education support and persistence your first job is educating yourself at whole woman we offer a wide range of informational materials that will help you regain control of your pelvic heath and life understand that modern western medicine is often in conflict with your best interests gynecologists urogynecologists and orthopedists are surgeons that is how they train
