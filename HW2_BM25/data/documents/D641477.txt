hybrid electric vehicles how do i know if a hybrid makes sense for me even without gas at 4 a gallon the economics of hybrids make a certain amount of sense particularly if you find yourself driving a significant number of miles each year for example lets say you drive 30000 miles a year and by purchasing a hybrid you can increase your fuel economy from an average of 30 mpg to 40 mpg with gas at 2 a gallon youll save 500 in fuel costs each year whether a hybrid makes economic sense will depend upon the difference in the purchase price minus any tax credit you may receive for buying a hybrid vehicle you can get more details plus tax information right here if you can pay off the difference in the amount of time you usually keep a car it would make reasonably good economic sense to buy a hybrid its also worth noting that toyota is beginning a program for certified used hybrids so if youre thinking of going the used hybrid route but want the security of a dealer warranty that might be a good choice heres another consideration most of us now buy our vehicles using car loans and while a hybrid may have a total cost thats 3000 to 4000 higher than its conventional version youll only pay a few bucks more per month on your loan  additional costs that might well be offset by the fuel savings youll be getting right away there are other reasons to buy a hybrid of course youve got a bit of insurance against the chance that the price of gas will start going up again and if gas does skyrocket your savings will only increase finally whatever happens youll be doing your part to reduce pollution minimize greenhouse gasses and reduce americas oil consumption for which we wholeheartedly applaud you does engine size matter not if youre a hybrid heres why in our opinion todays conventional vehicles are vastly overpowered a standard sedan typically has a 200 horsepower engine every once in a while youll use that power to pass someone on the highway however for the vast majority of driving we do youre actually only using 30 to 40 horsepower no kidding heres a shocker because carmakers consistently used technology advances to make new vehicles more powerful over the years cars averaged 14 mpg in 1923 the university of michigan reports and a measly 174 mpg as recently as 2008 instead a hybrid uses a more appropriately sized gasoline engine and supplements it with a high torque electric motor the result is that the gasoline engine can run at a lower more efficient speed and let the electric motor help with the heavy lifting you get increased efficiency from the conventional gas engine  and better mpg toyota honda or something else which system is right for me broadly speaking vehicles that use toyotas hybrid system are likely to be better for urban drivers the one big exception to this rule is fords fusion hybrid which racks up some remarkable mpg ratings in the city  41 mpg compared to 33 mpg for the camry fords cmax hybrid does even better  47 mpg both in the city and on the highway generally speaking the system found in the honda and lexus models favor highway driving and offers increased performance plus a marginal improvement in mileage where should i get it serviced  dealer or independent your dealer will certainly be the most familiar with your hybrid because hell see more of them than anyone else hell also know about common problems and service actions that may save you time and money this is especially true during the warranty period so for anything thats unique to a hybrid  the hybrid batteries the electric motors or the hybrid electronics or even stuff like the electric power steering thats showing up on some hybrids  youd do well to stick with the dealer however a lot of a hybrid car is just like any other car so for routine service such as tires brakes shocks and oil changes you can take a hybrid anywhere you like in time independent shops will gain more experience on hybrids the question is do you want them to gain that experience on your car are you willing to put up with a few nasty engine conflagrations while crusty gets up to speed on the new fusion if not be sure to ask your regular mechanic how much experience hes had with hybrid drive systems find out if hes taken any courses in hybrid repair and safety heres just one example of why that matters its easy to accidentally leave a hybrid in the on mode now imagine that car on a lift drained of oil during an oil change suddenly the cars computer decides it needs to turn on the engine result one cooked engine if your mechanic is someone you have a relationship with and hes honest enough to send you to the dealer when an issue is outside of his area of expertise then you can always start with him if not consider starting with the dealer for anything weird and using your local guy for the basics is there a lot more service involved and will it be more expensive when it happens we dont think there will be more service involved  but the reliability of the hybrid power plant particularly as it ages is still somewhat of an unknown however hybrid manufacturers are offering good warranties on most or all of the hybrid components toyota offers an eightyear100000mile warranty on its hybrid components in the prius hondas hybrid battery pack comes with an 8 year80000mile warranty or a 10year150000mile warranty if you happen to live in california or a dozen other states as well as the district of columbia and theres some good news emerging on the hybrid repair front a recent report shows that repair costs of hybrids are about the same of nonhybrid cars it used to be true that repairing a prius sent you to your home equity line of credit with the average repair of a prius running about eight percent more than a similar sized sedan but now that more hybrids are on the road  and as a result more used parts are available  repair costs for hybrids are now about equal to their nonhybrid equivalent isnt it true that no one knows how long the batteries will last and that having to replace them could cost several thousand dollars the jury is still out on the longevity of the hybrid battery bank to date however theyve proven themselves to be fairly hardy toyota is pretty confident they say that their batteries are expected to last the lifetime of the vehicle and that lab tests show that they can go the equivalent of 180000 miles with no deterioration we have no idea if fords results will be similar honda says its battery packs are designed to last 10 years under normal driving conditions honda ford and toyota all warrantee their battery packs for eight years or at least 80000 miles still the batteries are the unknown variable in the longterm costs of maintaining a hybrid vehicle all we can say for sure is that if you drive a hybrid far enough youll eventually need to replace the battery pack as an example the prius battery pack will set you back a little over 2000 when the time comes but if youve driven a car for 150000 or 200000 miles thats not so terrible is it its actually more of a concern for people buying high mileage used hybrids will hybrids break down more often we certainly hope so remember were mechanics but so far hybrids have proven remarkably durable theres a good reason for this most of each hybrid vehicle is made from existing technology brakes tires exhaust system the conventional gas engine shocks  even the classic pine tree air freshener as of this writing the earliest hybrids are now more than 10 years old were about to find out how the cost of replacing the batteries will impact the perception of hybrids  especially those that are about to come onto the used car market ive heard that hybrid vehicles involved in a crash pose a danger to emergency personnel because those workers might get electrocuted by cutting through a highvoltage cable id hate to live with the guilt of zapping my neighborhood volunteer emtsthe automakers have addressed this concern by painting the highvoltage lines a bright orange color and encasing the lines in metal housings beneath the passenger compartment where theyre well out of the way in addition theyve put their rescue procedures online and offered training courses to emergency responders in fact the california air resources board has found that these vehicles pose no additional risks over a conventional vehicle and the national highway traffic safety administration is not aware of any deaths of emt personnel  and theres about a million hybrid vehicles on the road we do worry however about those folks who arent trained such as tow truck drivers and good samaritans what federal tax incentives are available for hybrid owners currently the federal government provides a onetime incometax credit ranging from 250 for a twowheel drive chevy silverado to 3400 for the ford fusion but the credits will be phased out as each manufacturer reaches sales of 60000  the idea is to help get hybrids onto the nations roads not to provide every hybrid buyer with a tax break once 60000 sales are rung up a oneyear phase out will begin with the ensuing quarter of the calendar year half the credit will be offered for the first two quarters and a fourth of the credit in the final two quarters of the year forget about getting a credit on the bigselling toyota prius federal tax credits for both toyota and honda have already been phased out credit is still available for ford gm and nissan hybrids at the state and local levels theres a confounding mess of deductions and exemptions including legislation that welcomes hybrids in highoccupancyvehicle or hov lanes its all too much to go into here check out the environmental protection agencys fuel economy website to find out whats up in your neck of the woods how cost effective are hybrids is it true that i might not make back the upfront investment the catch with hybrids used to be that they would only pay for themselves for the average driver if the price of gasoline hovers around 3 a gallon or more the civic hybrid for example costs 4000 more than its nonhybrid counterpart even if gas were 200 a gallon it would take around 200000 miles to break even on fuel costs alone while its currently true that hybrids arent likely to pay for their premium in fuel savings alone there are other cost savings to consider it is possible to lower that breakeven point with tax breaks there are tax advantages to owning a hybrid but they vary widely depending on the vehicle and the state you live in you should also consider repair and maintenance costs insurance and depreciation when factoring in the real cost of a hybrid until recently there was cause for worry that your local dealer or independent shop wasnt equipped to handle hybrids but thats not much of a worry with so many of them on the road now still you will need to sit down take an hour or two and do the math you might be surprised to find that while you do have to shell out some extra cash up front and repair costs could be higher a hybrid might still be worth the extra dough then you can run a few different scenarios with gasoline at 2 3 4 and just for fun 5 6 and 7 then theres the morality factor how much is it worth to you to pollute less to make the country less dependent on oil to smirk quietly to yourself while the guy in the tahoe in front of you at the pumps is putting 30 gallons into his rig for the second time in a week while you fill up so infrequently you cant even remember which side your gas filler is on finally before you run out and join the ranks of the silentatthestopsign elite take a moment to consider buying a vehicle with a traditional engine do the math and see if the hybrid premium makes sense for you there are a number of conventional cars that are just as fuelefficient as some hybrids what about the resale value of a hybrid when it comes to holding their value hybrids do reasonably well compared to conventional vehicles take a toyota prius for example for instance a 2008 base model prius sold for 20930 when it was new a used similarly equipped 2008 prius in excellent condition now lists for 13120 in kelly blue book even the ford escape hybrid fairs well a 2008 4wd model listed for 27775 a used 2008 is now 15442 thats not bad for a car of that vintage the conventional 08 ford escape which lost over 4000 during its first year how about down the road when youve racked up 75000 miles burned through a pallet of airfresheners and left your buttprint permanently etched on the seats at that point the resale value of hybrids seems to have depreciated about the same percentage as comparable conventional vehicles according to kelly blue book after five years a prius is expected to hold 46 percent of its sticker price compared to 48 percent for the toyota corolla the prius closest nonhybrid equivalents the toyota camry and camry hybrid each holds onto 37 percent of their resale value after five years the ford escape hybrid hangs onto 24 percent of its sticker price compared with 19 percent for the conventional ford escape our projections are subject to plenty of error along with the whims of the marketplace in general however recent popular hybrids have tended to hold their resale values so far why is this it could be the coolness factor or maybe its the fear of yoyoing gas prices or the lust for new technology whatever the reason hybrids like the prius are in pretty steady demand  more so obviously when gas prices spike during times of high gas prices hybrid buyers can expect to find themselves on waiting lists and paying top dollar when their names finally come up all of which makes a used prius that much more valuable a caveat about hybrids not depreciating all that quickly is that theyre fairly expensive as used cars sometimes it just pays to buy new what about operating costs okay so youve plunked down the money and bought yourself a hybrid now what can you expect a recent study by consumer reports showed that drivers can expect to save between 500 to 4250 over a fiveyear period by driving a hybrid when compared to a similarly sized conventional car and that number doesnt include any possible tax credits the consumers study also found that it could take as little as one year to pay off the hybrid price premium in some instances how can this be because the savings arent based on fuel savings alone once you factor in all the costs of car ownership  depreciation maintenance repairs insurance fuel and sales tax  that extra dinero you fork out upfront could come back to you sooner than expected besides what else are you going to do with it put it in the stock market of course your actual savings will depend on gas prices which rebates and tax incentives are available and how many miles you rack up visiting greataunt gilda available models hybrids have come a long way since the first honda insight appeared in 1999 back then being a freerange tofumunching hybrid driver just meant that you had to sacrifice a few small things  like looks comfort space for your groceries a quiet ride safety and  oh yes  room for more than one passenger then in 2001 along came the prius a small but morenormalsized fourdoor sedan that looked and drove like a real car now there are no fewer than a dozen true hybrid vehicles on the market including popular sedans like the prius with the v wagon the c compact and the plugin hybrid added to the lineup honda civic insight and crz and ford fusion and utility vehicles like the ford cmax hybrid toyota highlander and lexus ct and es if that isnt enough there are also even more fuelefficient plugin hybrids to choose from including the aforementioned prius the chevy volt the fisker karma and the ford
