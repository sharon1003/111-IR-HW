with such uncertainty at large it seems incredible that the high renaissance could have occurred at all yet it did indeed the years between 1490 and the sack of rome in 1527 saw a huge outpouring in italy of all the visual arts this golden age  perhaps the most creative era in the history of art  set the standards in both fine art painting and sculpture for centuries to come rome the centre of the high renaissance rome now superceded florence as the focal point of the early renaissance not least because of papal ambition to make rome even greater than its florentine rival the exorbitant patronage of pope julius ii 150313 and pope leo x 151321 secured and retained the services of painters like raphael leonardo and michelangelo all of whom created oils and mural painting of startling novelty plus architects like donato bramante a key figure in the redevelopment of st peters basilica driven by popes who wished to use art to reinforce the glory of rome the high renaissance marked the zenith of the return to classical humanist values based on ancient greek art and culture as the church was the major patron christian art remained the major genre for the leaders of the florentine high renaissance once leonardo and michelangelo had departed see fra bartolommeo 14721517 leader 150812 replaced by andrea del sarto 14861530 meanwhile in venice  giovanni bellini 14301516 was busy developing a separate school of venetian painting based on the primacy of colorito over disegno his pupils included the shortlived enigmatic giorgione 14771510 sebastiano del piombo 14851547 and titian c14771576 arguably the leading colourist of the italian renaissance as well as provincial masters like lorenzo lotto 14801556 see in particular giorgiones tempest 1508 venice academy gallery and sleeping venus 1510 gemaldegalerie dresden for information about portraiture see venetian portrait painting c14001600 elsewhere in italy high renaissance values also influenced provincial centres like the parma school of painting and the later bolognese school 1580s on note much pioneering work on the attribution of paintings during the italian renaissance was done by the art scholar bernard berenson 18651959 who lived most of his life near florence and published a number of highly influential works on the italian renaissance high renaissance aesthetics ever since giotto abandoned medieval hieratic art in favour of depicting nature his successors from the quattrocento managed to find more and more ways to improve their portrayal of the real world techniques involving linear perspective and vanishing points foreshortening illusionistic devices chiaroscuro and sfumato shading  all these methods were mastered during the high renaissance during the cinquecento the near universal adoption of oil painting eliminated the matt colours of the 15th century and made it possible for distance to be conveyed solely through the gradation of tones  a process known as aerial or atmospheric perspective even so despite the growing realism being achieved in their art high renaissance artists aspired to beauty and harmony more than realism their paintings may have been based on nature but they had no interest in mere replication instead they looked for ultimate truth in a study of the classical world of greek and roman culture it was this that provided artists with an ideal of perfection their aesthetics thus greek philosophy provided the secret of the perfect human type with its proportions muscular structure oval face triangular forehead straight nose and balance  with the weight on one hip  all of which can be seen in the paintings of raphael and the immensely expressive sculpture of michelangelo the latter in particular was never afraid to bend the realistic rules of anatomy and proportion in order to increase his power of expression it was through classical greek philosophy that renaissance theorists and artists developed their idea of humanism humanism was a way of thinking which attached more importance to man and less importance to god it imbued renaissance art with its unique flavour as exemplified in works like leonardos mona lisa a nonreligious painting michelangelos david  a more human than religious statue  and raphaels cool secular fresco school of athens even when high renaissance artists painted religious paintings or sculpted a religious scene very often they were not glorifying god but man they were exalting the ideals of classical aesthetics paradoxically a few mythological works  such as jupiter and io 1533 by correggio  do the opposite they dont glorify men but godsnote in the eyes of at least one european renaissance expert  jacob burckhardt 181897 professor of art history at basel university and author of the civilization of the renaissance in italy die kultur der renaissance in italien published in 1860 the first fifty years of the 16th century represented the golden era of renaissance art for details of european collections of quattrocento and cinquecento italian painting see art museums in europe high renaissance architecture the rediscovery of greek architecture and later roman architecture and its rejuvenation by italian renaissance architects such as filippo brunelleschi 13771446 leon battista alberti 140472 guiliano da sangallo 14431516 donato bramante 14441514 raphael 14831520 michelangelo 14751564 baldessare peruzzi 14811536 michele sanmicheli 14841559 jacopo sansovino 14861570 giulio romano 14991546 andrea palladio 150880 and vincenzo scamozzi 15481616 led to the reintroduction of classical values in nearly all building designs of the time greek orders of architecture were discovered along with ideal building proportions while doric and corinthian columns were incorporated into a variety of religious and secular structures renaissance domes began to appear crowning the tops of churches and palaces high renaissance architecture is best exemplified by the works of donato bramante notably the initial design for the dome of the new st peters basilica in rome as well as the tempietto 1502 at s pietro in montorio a centralized dome that recalls greek temple architecture he was also closely involved with pope julius ii in planning the replacement of the 4th century old st peters with a new basilica of gigantic size part of the enduring legacy of italian renaissance art is the beauxarts style of architecture a lavish mix of renaissance and baroque styles beauxarts designs emerged during the 19th century and were championed by graduates of the ecole des beauxarts in paris in america the style was introduced by richard morris hunt 182795 and cass gilbert 18591934
