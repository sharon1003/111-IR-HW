history of the united states of america politics of the united states of america who was the first u s president answer wiki george washington 1789–9771 answers dave neary updated apr 12 2018originally answered who was the first president of the united states the simplest answer is george washington the first president after the adoption of the constitution elected unopposed to the office in 1789 but the usa declared its independence in 1776 and in between there were a number of people who presided over the continental congress this was not a very powerful position as the individual states kept total autonomy over almost all matters under the articles of confederation before the adoption of the constitution however they all had the title of “president of the united states in congress assembled” the first of those was peyton randolph in 1774 during the first continental congress who was in office for about 6 weeks until he fell ill most of the length of the session of the congress the president of the 2nd continental congress during the time of the declaration of independence in july 1776 was john hancock the president of the continental congress at the time of the treaty of paris in 1783 when us independence was recognised by the uk was elias boudinot however in 1775 the congress decided to name a commander in chief of the continental armed forces  given that the modern president is the commander in chief you might consider that this person is the supreme leader of the united states during this period where presiding over congress was not considered a very powerful position that person was george washington until december 1783 when the us continental army stood down after the treaty of paris so the answer depends on when you consider the united states came into being and the importance you attach to the speaker presiding over the continental congress1k views · view upvoterspromoted by truth finder have you ever googled yourself do

states do we mean the confederation of states or the sovereign government that eventually went a step beyond the continental congress was the first national us government by design presidents of the continental congress had little authority the president could not set legislative agenda make committee appointments or meet privately with foreign leaders the president received no salary he basically acted as an impartial moderator during debates when discussion moved to the committee of the whole the president relinquished his chair to the chairman of the committee of the whole the president dealt with a lot of official correspondence but he couldnt answer a letter without instruction from congress presidents signed but did not write congresss official documents these limitations meant a delegate elected as president lost much of his influence this was offset by designating a term of one year officially in 1781 when the articles of confederation were ratified thats

user bureaucratic minion answered dec 25 2014 · author has 960 answers and 33m answer views the first president of the united states of america in anything like the sense we know today was george washington so whats up with the alternate answers we sometimes hear prior to george washingtons terms as president the united states operated under a completely different constitutional structure the articles of confederation under the articles of confederation the country was literally governed by committee referred to in the articles as the united states in congress assembled anyone whos ever been part of something run by committee knows why this government didnt work out anyway each year one delegate was selected to preside over the committee this person is sometimes referred to as the president of the united states in congress assembled based on the wording of the articles of confederation the powers of this office were nothing like those of the president under the constitution of 1789 the president of the congress was literally just the person who presided over meetings it was an almost entirely ceremonial job its holder had no executive authority there was no separate executive branch under the articles nor was he seen as a national figurehead the way presidents have been under the current constitution its not entirely clear who the first person to hold this office was because it depends how how we think about it samuel huntington was already president of the continental congress when the articles went into force soon afterward he resigned for health reasons the first man elected to the office under the article of confederation was samuel johnston but he declined then thomas mc kean was elected but he only served a few months before resigning his replacement was john hanson the first man to serve a full term as president of the congrss under the articles of confederation but were any of these men really the first no all the articles of confederation did was formalize the power of the continental congress a bit neither the congress nor the role of its president changed significantly when the articles were ratified and who was the first president of the continental congress a man named peyton randolph but as quora user pointed out in the comments the first continental congress didnt claim sovereignty so it couldnt be considered a government sovereignty wasnt claimed until the declaration of independence two years later and who was the first president of the continental congress after independence was declared that was john hancock does that make john hancock the first president no the first president was george washington the stories of these other men are interesting but compared to the influence of george washington or adams or jefferson they were minor historical footnotes as shocking as it may seem most of what you were taught in grade school was accurate even if it wasnt the whole story29k views · view upvoters james

states that the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america bold mine the confusion comes in when people try to say that peyton randolph was the first president of the united states of america because he was the first president of the continental congress that was a very distinct role that was most assuredly not an executive position the closest equivalent today would be the speaker of the house under the articles of confederation the united states wasnt a sovereign nation but rather a collection confederation to use their terms of sovereign states it also did not have any executive authority and no executive offices the united states at that time had less powers than the european union does today so in conclusion the correct answer is the same answer

nationstates they finally succeeded in uniting themselves and forming the united states in 1781 what enabled this was the ratification of the first united states constitution the articles of confederation on march 1 1781 the articles specified that the new government would be seated on the first monday of november that year on november 5 the states delegates met and as the governments first act elected john hanson of maryland as president of the united states it is thus this date november 5 1781 which is the factual birth date of the united states until then the states were united in purpose but not in law and had no sovereignty higher than themselves during the 149 days between the ratification of the articles and the formation of the government samuel huntington of connecticut and thomas mc kean of pennsylvania served as presidents of the second continental congress the nongovernmental consultative body among the states which had authored the articles and continued in existence until the government was formed samuel johnston of north carolina was elected president between the two but refused to serve huntington and mc kean never served as head of government though some even a few historians who ought to know better mistakenly believe that they did based on the date of the articles ratification but no government existed for another 149 days the same exact situation existed when the constitution was ratified in the summer of 1788 at that time cyrus griffin was president but the government authorized by the constitution did not come into being
