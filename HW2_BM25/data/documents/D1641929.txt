production of carbonfilament lamps and other electrotechnical products in 1892 this first factory has been adapted and is used as a museum 7in 1895 after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy the philipses brought in anton gerards younger brother by sixteen years though he had earned a degree in engineering anton started work as a sales representative soon however he began to contribute many important business ideas with antons arrival the family business began to expand rapidly resulting in the founding of philips metaalgloeilampfabriek n v philips metal filament lamp factory ltd in eindhoven in 1908 followed in 1912 by the foundation of philips gloeilampenfabrieken n v philips lightbulb factories ltd after gerard and anton philips changed their family business by

in 1928 with host eddie startz hosting the happy station show which became the worlds longestrunning shortwave program broadcasts from the netherlands were interrupted by the german invasion in may 1940 the germans commandeered the transmitters in huizen to use for pro nazi broadcasts some originating from germany others concerts from dutch broadcasters under german control philips radio was absorbed shortly after liberation when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed radio netherlands worldwide the dutch international service some pcj programs such as happy station continued on the new station stirling engine  editphilips was instrumental in the revival of the stirling engine when in the early 1930s the management decided that offering a lowpower portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain engineers at the companys research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten stirling engine would be most suitable citing its quiet operation both audibly and in terms of radio interference and ability to run on a variety of heat sources common lamp oil – cheap and available everywhere – was favored 8 they were also aware that unlike steam and internal combustion engines virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and knowhow should enable great improvements 9encouraged by their first experimental engine which produced 16 w of shaft power from a bore and stroke of 30 mm × 25 mm 10 various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout world war ii by the late 1940s the type 10 was ready to be handed over to philips subsidiary johan de witt in dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned the result rated at 180200 w electrical output from a bore and stroke of 55 mm × 27 mm was designated mp1002ca known as the bungalow set production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951 but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced 11in parallel with the generator set philips developed experimental stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s though the only commercial success was the reversed stirling engine cryocooler however they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information which they later licensed to other companies 12shavers  editthe first philips shaver was introduced in the 1930s and was simply called “the philishave ” in the usa it was called the “ norelco ” which remains a part of their product line today world war ii  editon 9 may 1940 the philips directors learned that the german invasion of the netherlands was to take place the following day

system in the uk featuring comedian denis norden 20 the concept was quickly copied by the japanese makers whose tapes were significantly cheaper philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the video 2000 system with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time as philips only sold its systems on the pal standard and in europe and
