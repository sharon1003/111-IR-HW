o ne of our missions is to conduct research publish results and provide consultation services to the academic community for the purpose of investigating and documenting the mechanisms and benefits of taiji and qigong practice a summary of published research conduted to date by dr yang yang and the cts is available here although the perception of taijiquan as a mysterious oriental practice will always yield a baseline of interest we believe that only when the benefits and mechanisms of taiji practice are thoroughly examined and documented in western scientific terms will taiji be acceptable to the medical community and therefore mainstream western culture at the same time we remain committed to the view that that many valuable aspects of the art form are not quantifiable and that understanding the philosophical cultural spiritual and creative components of the art of taiji are equally important to good practice of immediate concern the common misconception of taiji as simply a slow movement exercise is prevalent in the scientific literature of the 90 or so studies published in scientific journals since 1980 not a single article has mentioned the sitting and standing qigong meditation exercises that are a foundation of not only taijiquan but of all of the internal martial arts of china as yang laoshi points out in his book the martial arts of china were long veiled in a tradition of secrecy while the slow form practice that is most commonly recognized as taijiquan is certainly a cornerstone of taiji training it is only one aspect of the art sitting and standing qigong meditation and other essential taiji training exercises were often omitted from public teaching and were known only to the masters of the various styles and their closest disciples a very famous saying from the oral tradition of taijiquan illustrates the traditional secrecy of the arti will teach you quan external form movements or technique but not gong the essential foundation the standing meditation exercises are now an open secret but little information has been disseminated as to how or why the sitting and standing meditation exercises are an essential foundation of all internal martial arts systems traditionally form movement performed without the foundation afforded by sitting and standing meditation was often referred to as external or empty movement it is likely that any reasonable exercise can measurably improve the health of the more sedentary or at risk populations that commonly comprise academic study groups it is also true that the slow movements of a choreographed taiji form may be particularly suited to certain populations however it is traditionally recognized that the benefits of correct practice of all taiji curricula are exceedingly greater than what may be obtained from any narrow incomplete understanding of the art a discussion of the interrelatedness and interdependency of various taiji exercises as well as hypotheses of mechanisms that afford the benefits of taiji practice is provided in dr yangs recent book dr yang has refined both his lifelong traditional training and teaching experience and research experience into an evidencebased taiji ebt tm and qigong program five papers have been published in the scientific peer reviewed literature that have used dr yang yangs ebt program all of the papers are of controlled longitudinal studies and two were fully randomized controlled trials rcts a sixth paper concerning qualitative methods of analysis of holistic mindbodyspirit benefits is currently under final review before publication an abstract of the papers including dr yangs comments on the significance of the findings is available here the studies conclude that the ebt program is effective for healthy older adults for lower body strengthforce control a neurological functionimproved functional balanceimproved vestibular function a mechanism of improved balanceimproved immune function response to flu vaccine andcomplex holistic benefits combining five dimensions of experience physical mental emotional social and spiritual the study on persons with early dementia was a multimodal intervention which included taiji exercises cognitivebehavioral therapies and a support group this study reports significant improvements in mental ability and selfesteem but due to the study design it is not possible to discern which or to what extent the different intervention modalities contributed to these benefits the cts remains committed to conducting research on taiji and qigong a rct is currently being planned in partnership with the mayo clinic to evaluate the efficacy of ebt for cardiovascular rehabilitation
