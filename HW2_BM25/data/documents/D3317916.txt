for george age 60 of raleigh north carolina quitting marijuana was no problem he began using marijuana in college sometimes once every other day sometimes once every couple of months and he kept using after graduation“it’s recreational” he said in an interview with healthline “why do people have a drink at the end of the workday just because they like it”but at the age of 50 he experienced some health problems and decided it was time to quit for george that wasn’t a challenge“there was no withdrawal” he said “there was certainly no physical addiction if you stopped eating chocolate you would want to have chocolate again but it’s not really addictive”millions of other americans are like george — they can pick up and put down marijuana relatively easily but that’s not the case for everyone for an unfortunate few marijuana poses a substantial risk of addiction“i can now admit that ive been psychologically addicted to weed for the past decadeplus” confessed writer kitty gray in a story published in vice last year “if i need to eat sleep relax be amused calm down forget a horrible experience practice selflove run errands of any kind watch tv or create something i smoke”about 9 percent of people who use marijuana will become abusers according to a study endorsed by the national institute on drug abuse nida other estimates have placed that number even higher with young people particularly susceptible to dependency however millions of americans use marijuana for all kinds of purposes — anxiety control social lubricant artistic muse pain reliever — without the drug becoming a problem in their lives so who is at risk for marijuana addiction and how does this drug abuse develop read more if marijuana is medicine why can’t we buy it in pharmacies »who becomes addicted genes are one strong predictor of addiction said dr alex stalcup medical director of the new leaf treatment center in lafayette california studies of identical twins raised in different families support this theory — they have higher rates of addiction cooccurring meaning that if one is addicted the other is at greater risk for addiction than fraternal twins raised apart but family ties may also help some people avoid addiction“when we look at the criteria for addiction it has a lot to do with people tempering their behavior” explained carl hart ph d an associate professor of psychology at columbia university and author of “ high price ” in an interview with healthline “it has a lot to do with responsibility skills  it’s not perfect but when you look at the people who are addicted and you look at people who have jobs and families they have responsibilities they’re plugged into their societies they have a social network the addiction rates within those kind of groups are dramatically decreased from people who are not plugged in with jobs families social networks”those who do not become addicted also tend to have more options“most of us have a lot of choice in life of things that make us feel good” said gantt galloway pharm d executive and research director of the new leaf treatment center and senior scientist at the california pacific medical center research institute in an interview with healthline “those who have fewer choices who perhaps don’t have as rich a set of social interactions because their family life is difficult or because they have emotional problems that are stopping them from forming close friendships  those people may find drugs such as marijuana more attractive and be at greater risk for addiction”for a lot of individuals marijuana is pleasurable reinforcing and reliable galloway added if you’re talking about someone who has a chaotic home situation someone who isn’t doing well in school who isn’t getting praise for good school performance those people may be at higher risk to use marijuana and to have problems with it”the idea that having choices lowers the risk of addiction is backed up by animal studies they have shown that if put into a box with a lever that releases a drug like cocaine or opiates rats will push the lever endlessly but if they’re placed in a rat park full of objects to play with and other rats to socialize with they will strongly prefer drugfree water over druglaced water another factor that plays a large role in addiction risk is mental illness which has both genetic and environmental causes“mental health is a huge risk factor for addiction” said stalcup “drugs work very well at first for mentally ill people if you’re anxious it’ll go away with a couple of hits a beer it’s like magic but then the tolerance sets in so not only do they need to drink more to relieve the anxiety but every single time they try to stop the underlying anxiety comes back worse we conceptualize it as a biological trap it works at first it turns on you it stops working and then you still have a problem“stress also responds very well to drug use the same trap occurs someone is working hard they come home they have a few drinks and it works they can relax chill out not worry about the day after a few years of that — and the fuse can be very long — now they’re drinking three or four drinks after work eventually they’re having a bottle of wine and a couple of drinks and the stress just isn’t managed like it was before now they depend on alcohol not to get more stressed”stalcup estimates that 50 to 60 percent of marijuana abusers his clinic treats have some sort of underlying mental illness the majority he sees have depression anxiety ptsd or schizophrenia at first marijuana offers a benefit to each of them it makes the world more interesting to counteract the loss of pleasure in depression it soothes anxiety for those with ptsd who experience nightmares it shuts down the process by which dreams form in the brain and ptsd often arises from another predictor of addiction trauma particularly sexual trauma at a young age“trauma in general sexual trauma specifically is a grossly underappreciated and potent risk factor for addiction” said stalcup “i just had this conversation with my last patient of the day“i said ‘you seem to want to get sober’ now this is a wealthy beautiful ph d thoughtful lady really addicted to cocaine and alcohol and she can’t get sober she got a degree then dropped out of school and drug use exploded”“i said ‘i’m missing something here i don’t get the problem’”“she says ‘i was raped’”read more legalization of marijuana doesn’t increase teen use researchers say »the drug of choice the conversation around marijuana use has become more nuanced since the world war ii era film “ reefer madness ” portrayed the drug as destructive and dangerous the pain relieving properties of the drug make it a potential

lecturer at the university of california berkeley shed light on this trend a study she conducted on medical marijuana users revealed that 40 percent of them had substituted marijuana for alcohol 26 percent had substituted it for other illicit drugs and 66 percent for prescription drugs reasons they gave included marijuana had fewer unwanted side effects it managed their symptoms better and it presented fewer problems with withdrawal one marijuana user conrad age 47 of san francisco said that when he can’t smoke he drinks more“i’ve always found quitting marijuana to be easy when i needed to because of travel reasons or personal reasons or professional or what have you” he told healthline “i do know for certain that when i’ve been on vacation for a long time and obviously i’m not smoking i subconsciously substitute alcohol i do drink more alcohol to ‘take the edge off’”read more colorado marijuana engineered to get you higher »building up a tolerance about 42 million americans are dependent on marijuana according to the latest results of the national survey on drug use and health that dependence happens when users build up a tolerance for the substance and need more and more of it to experience the same effect when a drug enters the brain it overrides the brain’s natural processes boosting a specific function far above or below normal levels the brain may become resistant to the effects of the drug in an effort to protect itself so that next time the person uses the drug it doesn’t have as strong an effect in order to feel the same high the person has to take larger and larger doses over time users may graduate from smoking marijuana to using it in highdosage edible forms or propaneextracted concentrates called dabs one study found that people who use marijuana have fewer receptors in their brain for endogenous cannabinoids the signaling molecules that marijuana’s active component thc mimics thc also affects the brains reward system and the release of the pleasure hormone dopamine“it is very well known that dopamine is one of the most important neurotransmitters that regulates reward motivation and selfcontrol” said dr nora volkow director of nida and one of the authors of the study “all of the drugs whether legal or illegal that can cause addiction apparently can stimulate dopamine signaling in the main pleasure center of the brain  by stimulating dopamine they activate the main reward centers of the brain this is why when someone takes a drug it is pleasurable”volkow also conducted a study that found that the brains of marijuana abusers have a decreased response to dopamine when given a chemical methylphenidate that caused dopamine levels to rise in the brain the marijuana users didn’t respond as strongly or feel as high as nonusers and the more blunted their response to the methylphenidate the more negative emotions they felt including irritability anxiety depression and aggressiveness“the problem isn’t that they are releasing less dopamine but that the dopamine stimulation in the brain is having a very attenuated effect” volkow said “the brain doesn’t know what to do with the dopamine the dopamine signal is not being heard not communicating properly downstream”volkow thinks that this decreased response to dopamine is likely caused by marijuana use another possibility is that marijuana users who become abusers have a dopamine system that’s naturally less responsive making them more vulnerable to abusing the drug“the most common genetic legacy relating to addiction is inherited boredom” explained stalcup “it’s a group of kids we call born bored what they have scientifically is a pleasure system that’s about 20 percent below normal when they first try a drug like cannabis the lights go on they say ‘doc this is the way i’m supposed to feel i’m so bored but i don’t care if i’m bored when i’m high’”“here’s the bummer it does benefit them their grades often will go up for a period of time they’re more sociable they do more things stalcup added the tragedy is they get tolerant”this explanation matches the experience that gray the writer for vice described“i smoke just to get through the boring parts of my day grunt tasks like making breakfast showering running errands and walking to work” she wrote her habit had increased from once to at least three times a day smoking “between one and infinity joints at night depending on how much weed i have”volkow explained that the patterns of activity in the brain shift from the drug activating reward centers to activating other nearby regions related to the formation of habits she said “they start to recruit instead other brain networks that are associated with habits and routines this allows a transition from a behavior that is predominantly driven initially because it’s pleasurable and rewarding to one that’s automatic because it creates a habit or routine”read more should a worker be fired for using marijuana at home »dependence and withdrawal once tolerance sets in dependence can form if someone uses a drug often enough the brain will become accustomed to it in an attempt to return to baseline it will compensate for the difference raising a function that the drug lowered like heart rate or reducing a function that the drug boosted like mood this means that when the drug wears off the person’s heart could start to race he or she could become irritable or depressed or any number of other reactions called withdrawal“a person is not dependent on a drug unless they experience some kind of negative outcome upon stopping their use” said reiman “for example if i am prescribed vicodin for pain and i use it as directed that does not make me dependent if i try to cut down or stop my intake and have negative consequences — cravings irritability upset stomach chills etc — that could be a sign that my use has become dependence this can happen to people who take prescription medication for a long time even if they are taking it as directed by their doctor”so a drug can cause dependence but not abuse as is the case for some people prescribed opiate painkillers or a drug can cause no withdrawal at all as in the case of cocaine but still be quite risky for abuse although not nearly as extreme as heroin or alcohol withdrawal quitting marijuana does appear to cause withdrawal symptoms in heavy frequent users in a 2013 article for salon writer m welch described his first week without marijuana after about a decade of daily use as one filled with sleepless nights and irritable days“then on the fifth day i began to calm by the eighth day the monkey vanished and i haven’t seen him since” welch wrote it’s not that easy for everyone stalcup said“withdrawal is the mirror image of what the drug does” he explained “if cannabis makes you mellow then you’re irritable grumpy” instead of marijuana’s sedating effects a person might get insomnia loss of appetite and nausea replace the munchies and instead of marijuana’s characteristic dream suppression someone in marijuana withdrawal might have intense vivid dreams when asleep“for many people that’s really unpleasant stalcup added especially the irritability that gets a lot of my patients into trouble i hear ‘doc i open my mouth all this poison came flooding out of my mouth i knew i didn’t mean it i just couldn’t shut up’”read more dabbing is the new explosive way to smoke marijuana »a pathway to abuse most marijuana users never let their use become a problem they’re not driving high or getting high at work they don’t get caught with marijuana and never enter the legal system some are even dependent on the drug using it daily and suffering withdrawal if they try to quit but still remain functional“there are people who have a glass or two of wine a day” said hart “in fact a glass or two of wine a day is considered healthy  now you certainly might see some sort of withdrawal symptom if someone’s been drinking for a few years and they abruptly stop doing that but that person they’re going to work they’re meeting their obligations they’re handling their responsibilities we wouldn’t call that person an addict”for some people however marijuana use gets out of control and starts to create problems “marijuanaaddicted people rarely present for treatment” said stalcup “so a lot of the people we see have gotten caught up in the legal system the typical example is a 16yearold who got caught with a bong in his backpack stoned at school a lot of our marijuana referrals come through probation parole the courts lawyers and we see a fair number of those we see people after they’ve experienced an adverse consequence”hart said “the bottom line is ‘do you have a problem with drugs’ a problem being defined by having disruptions in your psychosocial functioning disruptions in your occupational functioning your personal interactions and relationships your educational functioning all these sort of things are disrupted and that’s what we call substance use disorder”one recent study examined drug users who came to the emergency room with drugrelated problems a strong indicator that something is out of control ninetyone percent of drug users whose primary drug of choice wasn’t marijuana met the criteria for abuse compared to 47 percent of primary marijuana users of the marijuana users the 47 percent who met the criteria for abuse were also more likely to smoke tobacco and binge drink than the nonabusers — potential warning signs that those people may naturally run a greater risk of substance abuse in general“if you are getting in trouble because you are using or going after an illegal drug the illegality and the fact that you don’t stop and the fact that you keep getting in trouble over it says that you have a high degree of a substance use disorder and that you need treatment” said michael kuhar ph d a professor of neuropharmacology at emory university’s school of medicine and author of “ the addicted brain why we abuse drugs alcohol and nicotine ” in an interview with healthline “if you’re doing something that’s wreaking havoc in your life you need help forget what we call it”read more using medical marijuana doesn’t increase risk of drug abuse »the cycle of addiction unlike opiate abuse which can set in fairly quickly with heavy use marijuana abuse can take months or even years to develop a user might not immediately realize that they’ve crossed the line into addiction“a part of the process for some people is to rationalize continued use despite having adverse consequences” said galloway “they may not readily admit to themselves or discuss with others what impact these drugs are having on their life so they get stuck in the cycle of use and adverse consequences”for many it’s difficult to imagine a life in which doing drugs is more important than spending time with friends or doing favorite hobbies it’s certainly difficult to imagine doing drugs despite major consequences such as a suspended driver’s license or prison time but as galloway explains an addicted person isn’t making decisions the same way a nonaddicted person would “part of the problem with prevention and deciding whether you should use a drug or not is that it’s hard to imagine with one’s current brain having a brain that isn’t making those evaluations rationally you or i presumably can have a glass of wine in front of us and decide to pick it up or not neither of us feels a lot of compulsion we feel a lot of choices — we’re going to weigh ‘do i have to drive do i have work in the morning am i taking care of a child how many drinks have i already had’”“an alcoholic doesn’t weigh things the same way they look at the immediate benefits and immediate costs to a greater extent than they do at the longterm costs and benefits of using alcohol galloway added the person who’s addicted may not think through or may not acknowledge that there are consequences of use — that they’re not going to be as effective at work if they’re stoned that they’re not going to be engaging with their family as well”stalcup recommends this simple test for addiction “to make the diagnosis we propose an experiment in the experiment we ask you for a defined period of time not to use the basic question that we ask is ‘okay so you smoke pot that’s not the issue can you not smoke pot’ someone who’s not an addict that’s not a problem being unable to not smoke it when you’re trying not to smoke it defines addiction i encourage anyone who’s using any substance to do this experiment from time to time”editor’s note this story was
