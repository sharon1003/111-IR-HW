bowel disease part iv restoring healthful gut flora posted by paul jaminet on july 27 2010 leave a comment 379go to comments a healthy gut is a multispecies society it is the cooperative product of the human body with trillions of bacterial cells from a thousand or more species an unhealthy gut is more often than not the product of a breakdown in this collaboration often it is triggered by displacement of cooperative commensal species of bacteria by pathogenic bacteria fungi viruses and protozoa this is why a long course of antibiotics killing commensal bacteria is often the prelude to bowel ailments it is difficult for the immune system to defeat gut infections without the help of commensal bacteria think about what the immune system has to deal with the ulcers in ulcerative colitis are essentially the equivalent of infected skin abscesses but in the colon here is a description of a bowel lesion in crohn’s disease ileal lesions in crohn’s disease cd patients are colonized by pathogenic adherentinvasive escherichia coli aiec able to invade and to replicate within intestinal epithelial cells 1now imagine an infected skin abscess but with feces spread over it three times a day or stomach acid and digestive enzymes how quickly would you expect it to heal commensal “probiotic” bacteria are like a mercenary army fighting on behalf of the digestive tract by occupying the interior lining of the digestive tract they deprive pathogens of a “home base” that is sheltered from immune attack if commensal bacteria dominate the gut the immune system can usually quickly defeat infections this suggests that introduction of probiotic bacteria to the gut should be therapeutic for bowel disease probiotic supplements are inadequate most supermarket probiotics contain lactobacillus or bifidobacterium species these species are specialized for digesting milk they populate the guts of infants as they start breastfeeding and are used by the dairy industry to ferment cheeses and yogurt these supplements are very effective at fighting acute diarrhea from most foodborne infections a fistful of probiotic capsules taken every hour will usually quickly supplant the pathogens and end diarrhea however against more severe bowel diseases caused by chronic infections and featuring damaged intestinal mucosa these species are usually not helpful one issue is that they provide only a tiny part of a healthful adult microbiome a recent study surveyed the bacterial species in the human gut and found these species to be most abundant 2 figure abundant gut bacterial species as this figure shows bacteroides spp are the most common commensal bacteria with bacteroides uniformis alone providing almost 10 of all bacterial genes in the gut lactobacillus and bifidobacterium do not appear among the 57 most abundant species this study showed by the way that patients with irritable bowel syndrome have 25 fewer types of bacterial gene in their gut than healthy people and that the composition of bacterial genes in feces clearly distinguishes ulcerative colitis crohn’s disease and healthy patients in other words in the bowel diseases a few pathogenic species have colonized the gut and entirely denuded it of about 25 of the commensal species that normally populate the gut this finding supports the idea that restoring those missing species might be therapeutic for ibs bacterial replacement therapies work so if ibs patients are missing 25 of the thousand or so species that should populate the gut or 250 species and if common probiotics provide only 8 or so species and not the ones that are missing how are the missing species to be restored the answer is simple but icky recall that half the dry weight of stool consists of bacteria a healthy person daily provides a sample of billions of bacteria from every one of the thousand species in his gut they are in his stool so a “fecal transplant” of a healthy person’s stool into the gut of another person will replenish the missing species scientists have known for a long time that this was likely to be an effective therapy but it is only now entering clinical practice the new york times recently made a stir by telling this story in 2008 dr khoruts a gastroenterologist at the university of minnesota took on a patient suffering from a vicious gut infection of clostridium difficile she was crippled by constant diarrhea which had left her in a wheelchair wearing diapers dr khoruts treated her with an assortment of antibiotics but nothing could stop the bacteria his patient was wasting away losing 60 pounds over the course of eight months “she was just dwindling down the drain and she probably would have died” dr khoruts said dr khoruts decided his patient needed a transplant but he didn’t give her a piece of someone else’s intestines or a stomach or any other organ instead he gave her some of her husband’s bacteria dr khoruts mixed a small sample of her husband’s stool with saline solution and delivered it into her colon writing in the journal of clinical gastroenterology last month dr khoruts and his colleagues reported that her diarrhea vanished in a day her clostridium difficile infection disappeared as well and has not returned since the procedure — known as bacteriotherapy or fecal transplantation — had been carried out a few times over the past few decades but dr khoruts and his colleagues were able to do something previous doctors could not they took a genetic survey of the bacteria in her intestines before and after the transplant before the transplant they found her gut flora was in a desperate state “the normal bacteria just didn’t exist in her” said dr khoruts “she was colonized by all sorts of misfits”two weeks after the transplant the scientists analyzed the microbes again her husband’s microbes had taken over “that community was able to function and cure her disease in a matter of days” said janet jansson a microbial ecologist at lawrence berkeley national laboratory and a coauthor of the paper “i didn’t expect it to work the project blew me away” 3fecal transplants can be done without a doctor’s help someone else’s stool can be swallowed or inserted in the rectum if taking feces orally swallow a great deal of water afterward to help wash the bacteria through the stomach and its acid barrier dogs and young children sometimes swallow feces it is unpleasant to consider but desperate diseases call for desperate measures perhaps one day healthy stools will be available in pleasanttasting capsules and sold on supermarket shelves not yet attacking pathogenic biofilms most bacterial species will build fortresses for themselves called biofilms these are polysaccharide and protein meshworks that like bone become mineralized with calcium and other minerals these mineralized meshworks are built on bodily surfaces like the gut lining and protect bacteria from the immune system antibiotics and other bacterial species pathogenic species known to generate biofilms include legionella pneumophila s aureus listeria monocytogenes campylobacter spp e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium vibrio cholerae and helicobacter pylori 4biofilms favor the species that constructed them so once pathogens have constructed biofilms it is hard for commensal species to displace them therapies that dissolve pathogenic biofilms can improve the likelihood of success of probiotic and fecal transplant therapies strategies include enzyme supplements chelation therapies and avoidance of biofilmpromoting minerals like calcium specifically polysaccharide and protease digesting enzymes human digestive enzymes generally do not digest biofilm polysaccharides but bacterial enzymes that can are available as supplements potentially helpful enzymes include hemicellulase cellulase glucoamylase chitosanase and betaglucanase nonhuman protease enzymes such as nattokinase and papain might also help 5chelation therapy  since biofilms collect metals compounds that “chelate” or bind metals will tend to gather in biofilms some chelators – notably edta – are toxic to bacteria so edta supplementation tends to poison the biofilm driving bacteria out of their fortressshelter this prevents them from maintaining it and makes the biofilm more vulnerable to digestion by enzymes and commensal bacteria it also tends to reduce the population of pathogenic bacteria mineral avoidance the supply of minerals especially calcium iron and magnesium can be a ratelimiting factor in biofilm formation removal of calcium can cause destruction of biofilms 6 we recommend limiting calcium intake while bowel disease is being fought since the body can meet its own calcium needs for an extended period by pulling from the reservoir in bone upon recovery bone calcium can be replenished with supplements iron is another mineral which promotes biofilms and might be beneficially restricted we do not recommend restricting magnesium some commercial products are available which can help implement these strategies for instance klaire labs’ inter fase  httpwwwklairecomimagesinter faseupdatearticlepdf is a popular enzyme supplement which helps digest biofilms and a version containing edta is available inter fase plus attacking biofilms with berries herbs spices vinegar and whey plants manufacture a rich array of antimicrobial compounds for defense against bacteria there is reason to believe that traditional herbs and spices which entered the human diet during the paleolithic and have been passed down through the generations for tens of thousands of years were selected by our huntergatherer ancestors as much for their ability to promote gut health as for their taste dr art ayers notes that plants are adept at producing a wide array of chemicals with refined abilities to block bacterial functions so when researchers sought chemicals to solve the problem of pathogens forming biofilms it was natural to test plant extracts for inhibiting compounds in a recent article 7 d a vattem et al added extracts from dietary berries herbs and spices to bacterial pathogens including the toxin producing escherichia coli ec o157 h7 and checked for the ability to produce a chemical that signals the formation of a biofilm the effective phytochemicals inhibited the bacteria from recognizing a critical density of bacteria ie quorum sensing and responding with the production of the biofilmtriggering chemical blueberry raspberry cranberry blackberry and strawberry extracts were effective as quorum sensing inhibitors qsis common herbs such as oregano basil rosemary and thyme were also effective turmeric ginger and kale were also tested and found to contain qsis 8a few other remedies can weaken biofilms acetic acid in vinegar can solubilize the calcium iron and magnesium in biofilms removing these minerals and weakening the biofilm citric acid binds calcium and can disrupt biofilms 9lactoferrin a molecule in milk whey binds iron and inhibits biofilm formation and growth 10nacetylcysteine can destroy or inhibit biofilms 11conclusion fecal transplants are the best probiotic tactics to disrupt pathogenic biofilms can assist probiotics in bringing about recolonization of the digestive tract by commensal bacteria along with a nontoxic diet  discussed in part ii and nutritional support for the immune system and gut  discussed in part iii  these steps to improve gut flora make up a natural program for recovery from bowel disease update please read the cautions by two health professionals annie and jesse about potential dangers of selftreatment with fecal transplants and edta it is always better to pursue these therapies with a doctor’s assistance and
