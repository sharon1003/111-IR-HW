what is an addend simply put an addend is one of the numbers in an addition math sentence that is being added in the math sentence 235 the numbers 2 and 3 are addends while the number 5 is the sum often when we are teaching young learners about addition sentences we refer to partpartwhole so in the above example 2 and 3 are parts and they add together for the whole of 5 a fancier way of saying partpartwhole would be addendaddendsum all of this is important because we are trying to get young learners to think algebraically when i show a student the problem 25 id like them to automatically start solving for the blank  ok one addend is 2 and the other addend is blank the sum is 5 what addend do we have to add to 2 to get 5 ahhhh i know the missing addend is 3 consider this bit of algebra for elementary aged students as long as the kids are thinking in terms of addends things like this can be a breeze on the left side we see that two addends which are the same add up to the sum of square it reads  triangle plus triangle equals square  the problem goes on to say that square12 if a young learner is thinking clearly about addends he will say  now what two addends can i use that are the same add up to 12 hmmmm let me think about what double i know that will give me 12 i have it double six adds up to 12 if each of the addends shown as triangles are 6 then the problem works out triangle plus triangle equals square triangle plus triangle equals 12 6612 posted by kerstan at 639 pm no comments labels addends are just the numbers being added
