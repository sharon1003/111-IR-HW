breakdown of a molecule in solution to form ions hydration sphere the sheath of water that surrounds an ion in a solution hydrophilic molecules that act readily with water molecules are called  the molecule binds to water strongly as does glucose it will be carried into a solution in other words it will dissolveelectrolytes soluble inorganic molecules whose ions will conduct an electrical current in a solution sodium chloride essential in muscle contractions because of the electrical currents carried by ionshydrophobic molecules that do not readily interact with water because they either lack covalent bonds or have very few nonpolar because of this no hydration sphere is formed and the molecules do not dissolve colloid a solution containing dispersed proteins or other large molecules molecules or particles will remain in a solution indefinitely suspension contains even larger particles that will if undisturbed settle out in a solution due to the force of gravity explain how sodium chloride dissolves in water it dissociates in water as the positive poles of the water molecules are attracted to the negatively charged chloride ions and the negative poles of the water molecules are attracted to the positively charged sodium ions how do the chemical properties of water affect the solubility of organic and inorganic molecules because water is polar it has a negative and a positive pole this is due to the asymmetrical positions of the hydrogen atoms that are attached by covalent bonds because of this molecules that are water soluble hydrophilic or dissolveable are pulled apart by their polar covalent bonds what is the importance of p h and the role of buffers in body fluid  hydrogen ion h when a hydrogen atom involved in a chemical bond or participating in a chemical reaction can easily lose its electron it becomes a  are extremely reactive in a solution hydroxide ion ohp h the negative exponent of the hydrogen ion concentration expressed in moles per liter acidosis an abnormal physiological state characterized by a plasma p h below 735 more acidic than normalalkalosis the condition characterized by a plasma p h greater than 745 associated with a relative deficiency of hydrogen ions or an excess of bicarbonate ionsacid any solute that dissociates in solution and releases hydrogen ions thereby lowering p hbase a solute that removes hydrogen ions from a solution and thereby acts as a proton acceptor salt an ionic compound consisting of any cation except a hydrogen ion and any anion except a hydroxide ion buffers compounds that stabilized the p h of a solution by removing or replacing hydrogen ions what is the significance of p h in the physiological systems the p h of various body fluids must remain relatively constant if the body is to maintain homeostasis and remain healthy carbohydrate an organic molecule that contains a carbon hydrogen and oxygen in a ratio near 121monosaccharide a simple sugar that is a carbohydrate containing from three to seven carbon atoms it can be called a triose threecarbon a tetrose fourcarbon a pentose fivecarbon a hexose sixcarbon and a heptose sevencarbon an example is glucose glucose a hexose that is the most important metabolic fuel in the body isomers molecules that have the same molecular formula same type and number of atoms but have different structures are called  disaccharide when two monosaccharides are joined together they form a  an example is sucrosedehydration synthesis when two molecules are joined together by the removal of a water molecule hydrolysis reverses the steps of dehydration synthesis a complex molecule is broken down by adding a water molecule polysaccharide more complex carbohydrates that are a result of repeated dehydration synthesis reactions add additional monosaccharides or disaccharides an example is a starchpredict the reactants and the type of chemical reaction involved when muscle cells make and store glycogen muscle cells make synthesize glycogen by linking numerous glucose molecules via a series of dehydration synthesis reactions lipids  contain carbon hydrogen and oxygen and have a carbontohydrogen ratio typically near 12 however these contain much less oxygen then do carbohydrates with the same number of carbon atoms they for essential structural components of all cells fatty acids long carbon chains with hydrogen atoms attached one end of the carbon chain called the head always bears a carboxylic acid group saturated fatty acid each carbon atom in the tail has four single covalent bonds unsaturated fatty acids one or more of the single covalent bonds between carbon atoms has been replaced by a double covalent bond as a result each carbon atom will bind only one hydrogen rather than two glyceride lipids composed of glycerol bound to fatty acidsmonoglyceride a lipid consisting of a single fatty acid bound to a molecule of glyceroltriglyceride a lipid that is composed of a molecule of glycerol attached to three fatty acids hydrolysis breaks these down into fatty acids and glyceroleicosanoids lipids derived from arachidonic acid a fatty acid that must be absorbed in the diet because it cannot be synthesized by the body steroids large lipid molecules that share a distinctive carbonring framework  hormones are involved in regulation of sexual function cholesterol all animal membranes contain  cells need  to maintain their plasma membranes as well as for growth cell growth and division phospholipids an important membrane lipid whose structure includes both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions glycolipids compounds created by the combination of carbohydrate and lipid components micelle a droplet with hydrophilic portions on the outside a spherical aggregation of bile salts monoglycerides and fatty acids in the lumen of the intestinal tract what are the basic functions of phospholipids and glycolipids  and  function as important components of cellular membranes eicosanoids primary function acts primarily as a chemical messenger steroids primary function act primarily as both components of cellular membranes and sex hormones androgens and estrogensproteins most abundant organic components of the human body and in many ways the most important structure of proteins all proteins contain carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen with smaller quantities of sulfur and phosphorous possibly being present amino acids long chains of  acids make up protein they each have an amino acid group a central carbon a carboxylic acid group and an r group polypeptides a chain of amino acids strung together by peptide bonds those containing more than 100 peptides are called proteinspeptide bonds the bond between amino acids is known as substrate a participant product or reactant in an enzymecatalyzed reaction active site the location on an enzyme where substrate binding occursrelate an enzymes structure to its reaction specificity results from the unique shape of its active site which permits only a substrate with a complementary shape to bind where do cells obtain their energy for needed vital functions atp and other high energy compounds that contain high energy bonds covalent bonds whose breakdown releases energy under controlled conditions describe atp it is a compound consisting of adenosine to which three phosphate groups are attached highenergy bonds attach the second and third phosphates compare and contrast the structures and functions of dna and rna  nucleic acid a polymer of nucleotides that contains a pentose sugar a phosphate group and one of four nitrogenous bases that regulate the synthesis of proteins and make up the genetic material in cells dna a nucleic acid consisting of a double chain of nucelotides that contains the sugar
