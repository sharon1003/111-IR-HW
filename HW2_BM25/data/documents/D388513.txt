their own local time known as calcutta time and bombay time until 1948 and 1955 respectively 3 the central observatory was moved from chennai to a location at shankargarh fort in allahabad district so that it would be as close to utc 530 as possible approved by himanshu sharma  daylight saving time dst was used briefly during the china–indian war of 1962 and the indo–pakistani wars of 1965 and 1971 4criticism and proposals  editthe countrys east–west distance of more than 2933 kilometres 1822 mi covers over 29 degrees of longitude resulting in the sun rising and setting almost two hours earlier on indias eastern border than in the rann of kutch in the far west inhabitants of the northeastern states have to advance their clocks with the early sunrise and avoid the extra consumption of energy after daylight hours 5in the late 1980s a team of researchers proposed separating the country into two or three time zones to conserve energy the binary system that they suggested involved a return to british–era time zones the recommendations were not adopted 5 6in 2001 the government established a four–member committee under the ministry of science and technology to examine the need for multiple time zones and daylight saving 5 the findings of the committee which were presented to parliament in 2004 by the minister for science and technology kapil sibal did not recommend changes to the unified system stating that the prime meridian was chosen with reference to a central station and that the expanse of the indian state was not large 7though the government has consistently refused to split the country into multiple time zones provisions in labour laws such as the plantations labour act 1951 allow the central and state governments to define and set the local time for a particular industrial area 8 in assam tea gardens follow a separate time zone known as the chaibagaan or bagan time tea garden time which is one hour ahead of ist 9 still indian standard time remains the only officially used time the filmmaker jahnu barua has been campaigning for a separate time zone daylight saving time for the past 25 years in 2010 he suggested creating a separate time zone for the development of northeastern region 10in 2014 chief minister of assam tarun gogoi started campaigning for another time zone for assam and other northeastern states of india 11 however the proposal would need to be cleared by the central government of india in june 2017 department of science and technology dst indicated that they are once again studying feasibility of two timezones for india a proposal for both creating an additional eastern india timezone eit  utc600 shifting default ist to utc 500 and daylight saving idt for ist and eid for eit starting on 14 april ambedkar jayanti and ending on 2 october gandhi jayanti was submitted to dst for consideration 12time signals  editofficial time signals are generated by the time and frequency standards laboratory at the national physical laboratory in new delhi for both commercial and official use the signals are based on atomic clocks and are synchronised with the worldwide system of clocks that support the coordinated universal time features of the time and frequency standards laboratory include high frequency broadcast service operating at 10 mhz under call sign ata to synchronise the user clock within a millisecondindian national satellite system satellitebased standard time and frequency broadcast service which offers ist correct to ±10 microsecond and frequency calibration of up to ±10 −10 and time and frequency calibrations made with the help of pico and nanoseconds time interval frequency counters and phase recorders ist is taken as the standard time as it passes through almost the centre of india to communicate the exact time to the people the exact time is broadcast over the national all india radio and doordarshan television network telephone companies have dedicated phone numbers connected to mirror time servers that also relay the precise time another increasingly popular means of obtaining the time is through global positioning system gps receivers 13see also  editequation
