rhombus with equal diagonalsa convex quadrilateral with successive sides a b c d whose area is 4 corollary 15properties a square is a special case of a rhombus equal sides opposite equal angles a kite two pairs of adjacent equal sides a trapezoid one pair of opposite sides parallel a parallelogram all opposite sides parallel a quadrilateral or tetragon foursided polygon and a rectangle opposite sides equal rightangles and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes namely 5the diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at 90°the diagonals of a square bisect its angles opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal in length all four angles of a square are equal each is 360°4  90° so every angle of a square is a right angle all four sides of a square are equal the diagonals of a square are equal the square is the n2 case of the families of n hypercubes and n orthoplexes a square has schläfli symbol 4 a truncated square t 4 is an octagon 8 an alternated square h 4 is a digon 2 perimeter and area the area of a square is the product of the length of its sides the perimeter of a square whose four sides have length isand the area a is in classical times the second power was described in terms of the area of a square as in the above formula this led to the use of the term square to mean raising to the second power the area can also be calculated using the diagonal d according to in terms of the circumradius r the area of a square issince the area of the circle is the square fills approximately 06366 of its circumscribed circle in terms of the inradius r the area of the square is because it is a regular polygon a square is the quadrilateral of least perimeter enclosing a given area dually a square is the quadrilateral containing the largest area within a given perimeter 6 indeed if a and p are the area and perimeter enclosed by a quadrilateral then the following isoperimetric inequality holdswith equality if and only if the quadrilateral is a square other facts the diagonals of a square are about 1414 times the length of a side of the square this value known as the square root of 2 or pythagoras constant was the first number proven to be irrational a square can also be defined as a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles if a figure is both a rectangle right angles and a rhombus equal edge lengths then it is a square if a circle is circumscribed around a square the area of the circle is about 15708 times the area of the square if a circle is inscribed in the square the area of the circle is about 07854 times the area of the square a square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter 7a square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon  the square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions hypercube and the crosspolytope the schläfli symbol for the square is 4 the square is a highly symmetric object there are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 through 90° 180° and 270° its symmetry group is the dihedral group d 4 if the inscribed circle of a square abcd has tangency points e on ab f on bc g on cd and h on da then for any point p on the inscribed circle 8if is the distance from an arbitrary point in the plane to the i th vertex of a square and is the circumradius of the square then 9 coordinates and equationsplotted on cartesian coordinates the coordinates for the vertices of a square with vertical and horizontal sides centered at the origin and with side length 2 are ±1 ±1 while the interior of this square consists of all points  x y with −1  x i 1 and −1  y i 1 the equationspecifies the boundary of this square this equation means  x 2 or y 2 whichever is larger equals 1 the circumradius of this square the radius of a circle drawn through the squares vertices is half the squares diagonal and equals then the circumcircle has the equation alternatively the equationcan also be used to describe the boundary of a square with center coordinates  a b and a horizontal or vertical radius of r construction the following animations show how to construct a square using a compass and straightedge this is possible as 4  2 2 a power of two square at a given circumcircle square at a given side length right angle by using thales theorem square at a given diagonal symmetry the dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices  d for diagonal or edges  p for perpendiculars cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders full symmetry of the square is r12 and no symmetry is labeled a1 the square has dih 4 symmetry order 8 there are 2 dihedral subgroups dih 2 dih 1 and 3 cyclic subgroups z 4 z 2 and z 1 a square is a special case of many lower symmetry quadrilateralsa rectangle with two adjacent equal sidesa quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right anglesa parallelogram with one right angle and two adjacent equal sidesa rhombus with a right anglea rhombus with all angles equala rhombus with equal diagonals these 6 symmetries express 8 distinct symmetries on a square john conway labels these by a letter and group order 10each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular quadrilaterals r8 is full symmetry of the square and a1 is no symmetry d4 is the symmetry of a rectangle and p4 is the symmetry of a rhombus these two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the square d2 is the symmetry of an isosceles trapezoid and p2 is the symmetry of a kite g2 defines the geometry of a parallelogram only the g4 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as a square with directed edges squares inscribed in triangles main article triangle § squares every acute triangle has three inscribed squares squares in its interior such that all four of a squares vertices lie on a side of the triangle so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle in a right triangle two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangles right angle so a right triangle has only two distinct inscribed squares an obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square with a side coinciding with part of the triangles longest side the fraction of the triangles area that is filled by the square is no more than 12 squaring the circle squaring the circle is the problem proposed by ancient geometers of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge in 1882 the task was proven to be impossible as a consequence of the lindemann–weierstrass theorem which proves that pi  π is a transcendental number rather than an algebraic irrational number that is it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients noneuclidean geometry in noneuclidean geometry squares are more generally polygons with 4 equal sides and equal angles in spherical geometry a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance which meet at equal angles unlike the square of plane geometry the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle larger spherical squares have larger angles in hyperbolic geometry squares with right angles do not exist rather squares in hyperbolic geometry have angles of less than right angles larger hyperbolic squares have smaller angles examples two squares can tile the sphere with 2 squares around each vertex and 180degree internal angles each square covers an entire hemisphere and their vertices lie along a great circle this is called a spherical square dihedron the schläfli symbol is 42 six squares can tile the sphere with 3 squares around each vertex and 120degree internal angles this is called a spherical cube the schläfli symbol is 43 squares can tile the euclidean plane with 4 around each vertex with each square having an internal angle of 90° the schläfli symbol is 44 squares can tile the hyperbolic plane with 5 around each vertex with each square having 72degree internal angles the schläfli symbol is 45 in fact for any n ≥ 5 there is a hyperbolic tiling with n squares about each vertex crossed square crossedsquare a crossed square is a faceting of the square a selfintersecting polygon created by removing two opposite edges of a square and reconnecting by its two diagonals it has half the symmetry of the square dih 2 order 4 it has the same vertex arrangement as the square and is vertextransitive it appears as two 454590 triangle with a common vertex but the geometric intersection is not considered a vertex a crossed square is sometimes likened to a bow tie or butterfly the crossed rectangle is related as a faceting of the rectangle both special cases of crossed quadrilaterals 11the interior of a crossed square can have a polygon density of ±1 in each triangle dependent upon the winding orientation as clockwise or counterclockwise a square and a crossed square have the following properties in common opposite sides are equal in length the two diagonals are equal in length it has two lines of reflectional symmetry and rotational symmetry of order 2 through 180° it exists in the vertex figure of a uniform star polyhedra the tetrahemihexahedron graphs3simplex 3dthe k 4 complete graph is often drawn as a square with all 6 possible edges connected hence appearing as a square with both diagonals drawn this graph also
