multipayment installments based on gross amount discount and basis date parameters understanding payment terms payment terms are used to calculate net due date discount due date and discount amount calculations you need to define the payment terms and timing methods that the system uses for supplier payments the system supports percentage and fixed amount discount calculations people soft payables uses these payment terms and timing methods to schedule payments for invoices and to calculate amounts remitted to suppliers you can establish separate payment terms for single and multiple payments before you can establish the actual payment terms however you must define a payment terms timing for each time frame that you reference in the payments you do this on the payment terms timing codes page once you have established timing codes you can set up payment terms for single payments timing codes are directly referenced in single payment terms and must be defined as a prerequisite to defining single payment terms single payment terms are directly referenced in multiple payment terms and likewise must be defined first payment terms timing codes page use the payment terms timing codes page pymttermstiming to define payment terms timing codes for each time frame that you reference in the payments these codes define the number of days or months that must be added to the basis date to calculate the scheduled pay date navigation set up financialssupply chain product related procurement options payments payment terms timing codespayment terms timing codes image payment terms timing codes page this example illustrates the fields and controls on the payment terms timing codes page use the timing basis option and timing adjustment group boxes to specify timing options the timing basis option group box enables you to select a basic calculation approach the timing adjustment group box enables you to fine tune this approach by adding or subtracting a fixed number of days months or years people soft supports these timing methods add days to the basis date select the timing basis option of none basis date and set the day increment counter to the number of days that you want to add a variety of userdetermined basis dates such as the invoice date are supported you define these basis dates when you set up the people soft payables control hierarchy and can override them on the voucher in the example above the timing code is defined as 10 days after the basis date see payables definition  payments page add days and number of months to the basis date select the timing basis option of none basis date and set the day increment and month increment counters to the number of days and months that you want to add due on a specific day relative to the month select the timing basis option of end of relative month leave the counter at zero if the payment is to be made at the end of the month entering a value in the end of relative month field changes the month that is used entering a value in the day increment field adds days for example if you set the end of relative month counter to 1 designating the end of prior month and enter 10 in the day increment field a basis date of july 26 2006 gives you a due date of july 10 2006 the field values tell the application to calculate the due date by returning to the end of the previous month and adding 10 days due on a specific day select fixed monthday values and select the month due and day due the day due option enables you to specify for example endofquarter dates such as march 31 without fixing the particular year value due on a specific date select specific due date and enter the date example of using timing ids to define payment terms suppose that you want to create timing ids for the standard payment terms of 2 percent 10 days and net 30 days first establish a timing id of 10 days with a day increment of 10 days and a timing id of 30 days with a day increment of 30 days then use these two timing ids when defining the actual payment terms or suppose that you want to create a timing id for payments due on the 15 th day of the month for this timing id select end of relative month as the timing basis option and set the counter to 1 to indicate the last day of the prior month as the start day to which the relative day value of 15 is added this ensures that the resulting date falls within the current month then enter 15 in the day increment field search where used page use the search where used page timingwhereused to view payment terms that use the timing id navigation click the search where used link on the payment terms timing codes page net terms occurrences displays the number of times that the timing id is used within the net calculation of the payment terms id this value is greater than one if the terms are split and a timing id is used more than once this is more likely to occur in the discount calculation than in the net discount terms occurrences displays the number of times that the timing id is used within the discount calculation of the payment terms id calculate example due dates page use the calculate example due dates page timingclcduedts to calculate the

payment terms control terms applicability describes the customers or suppliers to which these payment terms apply split net terms select to define payment terms that contain multiple net terms and any associated discounts this allows for a variable due date depending on the invoice date for example select this option to use one timing id if the basis date is between the 1 st and 15 th and another timing id if the basis date is between the 16 th and end of the month split terms definitions enable you to set up variable net due date terms there are terms that depending on the basis date result in more than one possible set of net or discount due dates note the split payment terms functionality cannot calculate staggered discount payments which are graduated discounts that are based on a certain number of days past the invoice date for example a 2 discount when paid within seven days then a 1 discount when paid within fourteen days then zero discount when paid within thirty days number of terms indicates the number of terms that apply to this single payment term this field is available when you select the split net terms check box net due terms basis from day indicates the beginning day of the basis day range the basis dates day value must be equal to or greater than this day or the terms definition does not apply this field is available when you select the split net terms option basis to day indicates the ending day of the basis day range the basis dates day value must be equal to or less than this day or the terms definition does not apply this field is available when you select the split net terms option note all available days 1 to 31 must be accounted for in the basis from day and basis to day range timing iddisplays the timing id used to

id used for the discount portion of this single payment term adjustment days displays the number of days used to adjust the discount due date for this single payment term use this field to define flexible discount terms by specifying either basis date relative or due date relative discount due dates this is useful if the discount terms are often calculated as for example 2 percent for the first 10 days following the startofterms basis date or 2 percent up to 10 days before the payment due date discount terms percent displays the discount percent that is applied to the invoice gross amount to calculate the discount amount note the discount is less nonmerchandise charges freight miscellaneous charges and sales tax in a valueadded tax vat environment you may configure the system to include vat in the amount upon which the discount is calculated discount terms amount displays the flat amount discount that is applied to the invoice entering a value in this field causes a constant

installment percentage the system initially calculates the installment percentage based on the number of installments that you specify for example if you set the number of installments to 2 the system inserts two rows in the installment terms grid and sets the installment percent for each row to 50000 you may change this value freeze pct freeze percentselect to freeze or set the installment percentage at the entered amount freezing the percentage prevents the system from trying to recalculate it the freeze percent settings are temporary they apply only to your session they are not saved as part of the terms definition but they are used only during initial setup to help allocate the wanted percentage to each installment for example suppose that the display is initialized to two installments of 50 percent each to set up terms with three installments with a 40 percent30 percent30 percent split entering 40 percent for the first installment automatically sets the freeze pct check box for it and results in 60 percent being allocated to the unfrozen second installment from this point you can increment the number of installments from two to three and the unfrozen percentage is now split between the second and third installments calculate example payment data page use the calculate example payment data page mlttrclcpaydta to calculate example payment data for the payment
