available description negative pressure wound therapy npwt consists of the use of a negative pressure or suction device to aspirate and remove fluids debris and infectious materials from the wound bed to promote the formation of granulation tissue and wound healing the devices may also be used as an adjunct to surgical therapy or as an alternative to surgery in a debilitated patient although the exact mechanisms has not been elucidated it is hypothesized that negative pressure contributes to wound healing by removing excess interstitial fluid increasing the vascularity of the wound reducing edema andor creating beneficial mechanical forces that lead to cell growth and expansion negative pressure wound therapy npwt devices are classified as either powered ie requiring an electrical power source or nonpowered mechanical most evidence found in the literature is for electrically powered devices with large canisters eg such as vacuumassisted devices a number of portable devices have entered the market for use in the outpatient setting some portable devices are designed specifically for surgical incisions conventional npwt using a powered negative pressure wound therapy system can be bulky and intrusive for patients who are ambulatory and active disposable nonpowered negative pressure wound therapy or single use nonpowered negative pressure wound therapy have been proposed for the treatment of small to medium sized slow to heal wounds and also for the management of surgical incisions the goal of these devices is to make it easier to use by both the clinicians and patients specifically the device should be one that clinicians can take off the shelf like any other wound care dressing it is quick and easy to apply and the patients can wear under their clothes and will not impinge on normal activities the idea was to make it practical and cost effective allowing more patients to benefit from npwt in the outpatienthome setting nonpowered single use npwt devices sna p ®wound care system the smart negative pressure sna p ® wound care system spiracur sunnyvale ca is a disposable ultraportable npwt device that does not require an electricallyorbattery powered pump the sna p system is a mechanicallypowered npwt system comprising spring technology that reduces air density within an enclosure in a controlled manner the specialized springs equilibrate even in the presence of exudate so that a constant controlled amount of negative pressure is delivered to the wound bed because there is no electrical pump operation of the sna p system is completely silent and it is small enough to be worn on a patients leg arm or belt and hidden underneath clothing the sna p ® wound care system consists of three basic elements the cartridge with activationreset key the hydrocolloid dressing layer and the strap with attachment clip cartridge with activationreset key comes in three different preset pressure levels 75mm hg 100mm hg and 125mm hg the cartridge has two functions 1 it is a small canister that stores fluids removed from the wound canister capacity of approximately 60m l of wound exudate and 2 it generates the negative pressure or suction the sna p system also incorporates bio lock technology that isolyzes or gels the wound exudate that collects in the cartridge this helps to control potential contamination and odor hydrocolloid dressing layer with integrated nozzle and tubing and choice of foam or antimicrobial gauze wound interface layer a proprietary hydrocolloid dressing provides protection to the often fragile periwound skin improves dressing applications handling properties and provides a robust seal around the wound for negative pressure delivery the suction port and tubing which can be cut to length are fully integrated into the hydrocolloid dressing simplifying the application process the hydrocolloid dressing is used over a wound filling material consisting of specialized sna p blue foam dressing or antimicrobial gauze dressing the blue foam dressings allows for similar mechanical transduction of stress and strain to the wound bed as other foam wound interfaces the bright blue color of the foam dressing also allows for easy visualization within the wound helping to prevent retention of the foam at dressing changes in general the foam dressing is used when more robust granulation tissue formation is required or in deeper wounds the antimicrobial gauze dressing is used in more superficial wounds or in wounds at higher risk of infection treatment indications the sna p system is indicated for the removal of small amounts of exudate from the following types of wounds chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers venous ulcers and pressure ulcers traumaticacute wounds subacute and dehisced partialthickness burns surgicallyclosed incisions flaps and grafts contraindications the sna p system should not be used over actively infected wounds inadequately drained wounds necrotic tissue such as eschar or adherent slough exposed blood vessels anastomotic sites organs tendons or nerves wounds containing malignancy fistulae untreated osteomyelitis actively bleeding wounds it is recommended that the dressing be changed at least two times per week by the patient’s healthcare provider the frequency of the dressing changes will depend on a number of factors eg the level of exudate bacterial load and rate of granulation tissue in 2011 armstrong and colleagues reported results of a planned interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial rct comparing the sna p ® device and the v a c ® negative pressure therapy assisted closure ® therapy™ kinetic concepts inc san antonia tx for the treatment of chronic lower extremity wounds the study randomized 132 patients with lower extremity venous or diabetic ulcers of varying size and present more than 30 days despite appropriate care dressings were changed per manufacturer direction 2 times per week in the sna p ® group and 3 times per week in the v a c ® group patients were assessed for up to 16 weeks or until complete wound closure 83 patients 63 completed the study intentiontotreat analysis with the last observation carried forward showed noninferiority in the primary outcome of wound size reduction at 4 8 12 and 16 weeks when adjusted for differences in wound size at baselinesna ptreated subjects showed noninferiority to the vactreated subjects at 4 12 and 16 weeks kaplanmeier analysis showed no significant difference in complete wound closure between the two groups at the final follow up 656 of the vac group and 636 of the sna p group had wound closure survey data indicated that dressing changes required less time and the use of the sna p ® device interfered less with mobility and activity than the v a c ® device this study is limited by the high loss to followup and the lack of comparison with standard treatment protocols a 2010 retrospective study with historical controls compared negative pressure wound therapy using the sna p ® device n28 with wound care protocols that included the use of apligraf ® novartis regranex ® healthpoint ltd and skin grafting n42 for treatment of lower extremity ulcers seven patients 25 in the sna p ® treated group could not tolerate the treatment and were discontinued from the study because of complications allergic skin reaction wound infection bleeding after debridement preventing reapplication worsening lower extremity edema and the development of maceration severe enough to require discontinuation and were considered treatment failures betweengroup estimates of timetowound healing by kaplanmeier analysis favored the sna p ® treatment group the study is limited by the use of historical controls the multiple modalities used in treatment of controls and the large number of dropouts the authors noted that patients in the sna p®treated group may have benefitted from being in an experimental environment particularly because wounds in this group were seen twice per week compared to variable followup in the historical controls other publications have described use of the sna p® device in case series with small numbers of patients fewer than 15 patients pico™ single use negative pressure wound therapy pico™ single use negative pressure wound therapy smith and nephew st petersburg fl is a pocket sized disposable single use negative pressure wound therapy system the pico™ device consists of a small portable pump with a lifespan of up to 7 days the pico™ pump generates an effective negative pressure of 80mm hg yet is small enough to fit discretely into a pocket the pico™ pump is connected to a specially designed dressing which 1 maintains the negative pressure across the wound bed and 2 removes the exudate from the wound bed through absorbency and evaporation in each carton there is one pump plus two aa lithium batteries and two separately packed dressings complete with fixation strips this enables a dressing change to be carried out within the lifespan of the pump if this is clinically necessary pico™ single use negative pressure wound therapy system is indicated for patients who would benefit from a suction device negative pressure wound therapy as it may promote wound healing via removal of low levels of exudates and infectious materials examples of appropriate wound types include chronic wounds acute wounds traumatic wounds subacute and dehisced wounds partial thickness burns ulcers such as diabetic or pressure flaps and grafts closed surgical incisions in 2016 karlakki et al reported an rct with 220 patients that evaluated use of the pico device in the surgical center immediately after hip and knee arthroplasties the primary outcome was to measure the impact of single use i npwtd incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressing on wound healing and effect on length of stay los the device was left on for 7 days including time after the hospital stay strengths of the study included power and itt analysis but evaluators were not blinded there were trends toward reductions in hospital length of stay 09 days 95 ci 02 to 25 days p007 and postoperative surgical wound complications 84 control vs 20 pico p006 most of the difference in length of stay was due to wound complications in 2 outliers in the control group up to 61 days the level of wound exudate was significantly reduced by the pico device p0007 with 4 of the study group and 16 of the control group having grade 4 scale grade 04 exudate blisters were observed in 11 of patients treated with the pico system although the occurrence of blisters was reported to be reduced when the dressing was stretched less there were a number of limitations to this study a this was nonblinded study b the routine practice of changing wound dressings at second day postsurgery and working towards expected date of discharge four days postsurgery at the time of study period was difficult to control due to the number of nursing staff involved in patient care c the incidence of surgical wound complications was recorded rather than directly inspected as the information was obtained over the telephone at the two week telephone check d woundrelated data were not collected following protocol failure which meant an itt analysis was not possible for los and e unable to standardize the wound closure methodology as this would have meant changing surgeons’ practice in 2015 schwartz et al reported an industry funded pilot study with 12 patients who had lower extremity chronic small wounds of various types total 13 wounds treated with single use negative pressure wound therapy npwt the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of single use npwt on chronic lower extremity wounds that are usually deemed to small or superficial for traditional npwt a key inclusion criterion was complete failure to progress over the previous 4 weeks during the 4 weeks of pico application wound size decreased and wound appearance improved there was no control group in this pilot study and no wound closures during short followup period v a c via™ therapy system v a c via™ therapy system kci san antonio tx is a portable single patient use negative pressure wound therapy device that offers 7 days of therapy provides dynamic pressure control and continuous negative pressure options of 75mm hg or 125mm hg the system is designed for moderate to lowerseverity wounds and provides the same clinical efficacy as current v a c® therapy products the v a c via™ system creates an environment that promotes healing by 1 maintaining a moist wound healing environment 2 remove excess wound fluids and infectious material and 3 creating an environment that promotes perfusion and granulation tissue formation v a c via™ therapy system is indicated for open wound types including chronic acute traumatic subacute and dehisced wounds partial thickness burns ulcers such as diabetic pressure or venous insufficiency flaps and grafts when used on closed surgical incisions it is intended to manage the environment of surgical incisions that continue to drain following sutured or stapled closure by maintaining a closed environment and removing exudates via the application of negative pressure wound therapy in a retrospective study gabrielle et al 2013 evaluated use of the disposable singlepatientuse npwt system spnpwt v a c via™ therapy over dermal regeneration template drt andor skin grafts spnpwt was initiated over a drt andor skin graft in 33 patients with 41 graft procedures endpoints were recorded and compared to a historical control group of 25 patients with 28 grafts bolstered with traditional rental npwt v a c mean age was less for the spnpwt group versus the control and there were significantly more patients with peripheral vascular disease pvd in the spnpwt group compared with the control 12 versus 0 respectively a greater number of acute wounds were present in the spnpwt group versus the control 26 versus 10 respectively all other patient demographics and wound characteristics were similar mean followup time was 64 months for the spnpwt group and 127 months for the control group primary endpoint was time to hospital discharge duration of spnpwt and graft take rate were collected and compared to a historical control group of patients who received traditional rental npwt over dermal regeneration template drt andor skin grafts average length of inpatient hospital stay was 0 days for the spnpwt group and six days for the control group the average duration of spnpwt postdrt or skin graft was 56 days and 70 days for the control this study is limited by small sample size lack of a comparator and observer bias in estimating graft take the authors reported that considerably more controlled research is necessary to measure efficacy of spnpwt in the adjunctive management of various wound typesci sna p ®closed incision systemci sna p ® closed incision system spiracur sunnyvale ca is a single use portable nonpowered disposable negative pressure wound therapy system that is intended for wound management through the removal of small amounts of exudate from surgical
