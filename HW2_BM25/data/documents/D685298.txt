partner purchased southern sales a san antoniobased armynavy surplus chain comprising six stores that were by that year no longer making any profit at the time gochman was a practicing attorney in san antonio he had not been formally educated as a businessman but he had learned much about the surplus retail business from his father max gochman who had owned a surplus goods outlet in san antonio and in 1935 still owned and operated a small chain of stores in austin1970s gochman bought out his partner in 1973 and changed the companys business name from southern sales to academy corp the academy name was borrowed from his fathers stores it came from a nowdefunct san antonio catholic school named st henrys academy max gochman had opened his first store across the street from the school in the 1930s selling preworld war ii surplus goods later when he moved to austin he used the name for his four armynavy surplus stores because many university of texas students and graduates lived in the houston area and were familiar with the austin stores max gochman permitted his son to use the name knowing that it would help his sons business in 1978 the younger gochman gave up his law practice and moved to houston to assume active control of the company and complete the overhaul of its basic merchandising policies the chain grew from eight stores in 1980 to 12 in 1985  citation neededby
