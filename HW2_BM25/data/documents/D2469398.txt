with his brother william and a mutual friend from law school he became a founding partner of the cincinnati law firm keating muething  keating 24 beginning in the late 1950s they took on carl lindner jr as a client lindner was rapidly accumulating ice cream stores supermarkets real estate and savings and loans and soon essentially became keatings sole client 25 in 1956 he filed requests for q clearances on behalf of a small company of former los alamos scientific laboratory scientists with an office in newtown ohio unknown to keating the fbi suspected the application was fraudulent and launched an investigation of him but no charges were made 26 27 keating was admitted to the u s supreme court bar in 1958 28in 1960 lindner and keating created american financial corporation a holding company of lindners disparate businesses that created further subsidiaries and financial instruments all doing business with each other 29 keating was named to the board of directors of the company in 1963 30antipornography activism  editin 1956 keating joined a priest leading a group of concerned catholics in cincinnati who were concerned about the dangers of pornography and he began giving talks on the subject to parents and other groups 28 in 1958 keating testified before the house judiciary committee on mailorder pornography saying that it was capable of poisoning any mind at any age and of perverting our entire younger generation and that it was closely tied to juvenile delinquency while also quoting a senate committee report that part of the communist conspiracy was to print obscene materials 28 31 keating mentioned links between pornography and communism at other times but distanced himself from the more fervent anticommunist groups of the early 1960s 32 he stated that 90 percent of obscene materials were produced for profit not ideological reasons and told congress in 1960 i had better say  that i am not blaming obscenity in america on the communists 32keating founded citizens for decent literature cdl in 1958 later renamed a number of times the best known of which is citizens for decency through law 15 which advocated reading classics not smut 33 it would grow to 300 chapters and 100000 members nationwide and become the largest antipornography organization in the nation 33 it absorbed some other groups such as national citizens for decent literature and the pittsburgh national better magazines council 32 the structure of cdl was initially decentralized but keating grew frustrated with some local chapters taking aggressive actions he did not approve of and so he gave it a more controlled focus with a national magazine film production and a greater role in legal actions 34over the next two decades cdl mailed some 40 million letters on behalf of its position and filed a series of amicus curiae briefs before the u s supreme court 34 35 keating gained the nickname mr clean 36in 1964–65 keating produced perversion for profit a film featuring announcer george putnam it was a survey of thenavailable prurient and obscene materials and asserted that pornography led to moral decay 37 it along with two lesserknown films produced or distributed by cdl was screened frequently throughout the country and remained in print for a long time 38in 1969 keatings national reputation on the issue led president nixon to appoint him to the presidents commission on obscenity and pornography which had been begun under nixons predecessor lyndon b johnson 30 39 the majority on the commission issued a report which concluded that pornography does not degrade the morals of adults or cause crime and recommended that all federal state and local laws preventing consenting adults from obtaining pornographic materials be repealed keating nixons only appointee on the 18person commission was the leading commission dissenter from the report 39 40in september 1970 keating was granted a temporary restraining order from the d c federal district court to delay publication of the report stating that he needed access to all the reports backing materials and time to write a dissent 40 several days later keating was given the desired materials and two weeks to write his report by the committee 41keating filed his dissent saying at a time when the spread of pornography has reached epidemic proportions in our country and when the moral fiber of our nation seems to be rapidly unravelling the desperate need is for enlightenment and intelligent control of the poisons which threaten us – not the declaration of moral bankruptcy inherent in the repeal of the laws which have been the defense of decent people against the pornographer for profit 42 keating wrote one can consult all the experts he chooses can write reports make studies etc but the fact that obscenity corrupts lies within the common sense the reason and the logic of every man 43the nixon administration tacitly supported keatings legal efforts 39 and counsellor to the president john ehrlichman assigned white house speechwriter pat buchanan to help draft the dissenting report 44 the commissions majority report was denounced by congressional leaders of both parties as well as by the administration 44the commission involvement earned keating further national attention which he used to push towards stringent behavior in cincinnati 45 in 1969 keating obtained an injunction preventing the showing in cincinnati of softcore sexploitation master russ meyer s film vixen claiming it was obscene 46 and the film was seized by the police the first day it opened 47 showing of the film was successfully stopped in other parts of ohio as well and meyer spent 250000 in defense against keating legal actions 47 keating said meyer had done more to undermine morals in the nation than anyone else meyer responded that i was glad to do it 47 the cincinnati vixen case was appealed and in 1971 the supreme court of ohio upheld the prohibition 46in 1970 keating tried to block a closedcircuit showing of the musical oh calcutta in cincinnati saying that it appeals to a prurient interest in sex 48 during 1972 a keating legal action kept a sex film theater shut as a public nuisance 45 he tried to prevent newsstands near his office from selling playboy and oui magazines 49 he denounced the ramada inn chain for offering adult programming on cable television to guests 36 other local actions involving shutting stores and removing books from public libraries were attributed by civil liberties advocates to the oppressive trend that keating had set 45 such was keating and his organizations effectiveness that when the u s supreme court handed down the 1973 miller v california decision establishing that obscenity definitions be based upon local community standards every adult bookstore and movie house in cincinnati was closed within hours 35citizens for decent literature and keating often warned about homosexuality as an example of what they saw as perverse behavior 50 the film perversion for profit had included a claim that homosexuals had a slogan saying that todays conquest is tomorrows competition 50 in a 1977 speech in miami keating repeated this phrase concluding from it that homosexuality represented an endless seduction of the innocent 51in 1975 oui magazine gave keating the top spot on its enemies of pornography list 49 hamilton county prosecutor simon l leis jr put ohio pornographer larry flynt on trial in 1976 for pandering obscenity and for engaging in a form of organized crime 52 local public opinion ran against flynt 52 flynt was convicted on both counts and received the maximum sentence of 7 to 25 years in prison 52 while the conviction was later overturned on appeal the verdict again established cincinnatis community standards in this regard and even after keating left for arizona his influence remained in cincinnati being a center of antipornography fervor 36 52 in the 1996 biopic the people vs larry flynt which reportedly exaggerated keatings role in the prosecution and trial 53 54 keating was portrayed by actor james cromwell attempts to show vixen in cincinnati would continue 46 but by the late 1990s it was still illegal to do so 55american financial corporation  editwhile officially an outside lawyer keating functioned as a public face for carl lindner and american financial corporation and the two were close associates on business as well as legal matters 49 lindner would sometimes refer to keating as a founder of american financial 30 the company had easy access to credit lines which allowed it to continually grow 29 the web of transactions involving the company and its subsidiaries was large and complex and one stock analyst stated in 1977 that he had never come across a company that has so much strange paper on its books 49keating left his law practice in 1972 and formally joined american financial corporation by now a 1 billion enterprise as executive vice president 56 keating became lindners person in charge of firing employees from newly acquired companies 57 within business circles keating gained a reputation for aggressiveness and arrogance 49 he took on an operational involvement in the cincinnati enquirer the towns only morning newspaper 45 he interfered in editorial decisions such as adding coverage to high school sports that he or lindners sons were involved in the paper was then sold to a group including his brother william 49 who had been a republican congressman from ohios 1st congressional district in the early 1970s charles keating was involved in american financials 1974 sale of bantam books 58 and its decision that year not to enter the investment banking field 59in 1975 and 1976 several stockholder lawsuits were filed against american financial and keating was under fire for aspects involving unsecured loans stock warrants and the sale of the enquirer 49 the securities and exchange commission sec launched a major investigation of the company and charged lindner keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false sec reports 30 60 at particular issue was a 14 million loan that the sec said was made on preferential terms 11 keating resigned from american financial in august 1976 with conflicting stories as to whether or not keating and lindner had remained close or whether they had fallen out 9 49 61american continental corporation  editkeating moved to phoenix arizona in 1976 9 to run the real estate firm american continental homes a struggling millionslosing homebuilding spinoff of american financial that was given over to keating for 300000 as part of his departure package 11 30 49 61 the move was completed when his family followed him in 1978 61 in 1979 the sec case with american financial was settled 30 with keating signing a consent agreement where he neither admitted nor denied guilt but agreed not to violate federal fraud and securities statutes 60 62 in practice keating was blamed for much of the irregular financial practices that had gone on and his reputation was significantly damaged 63keating reaped benefits from the move to arizona a wideopen territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed someone a fresh start 64 he turned the nowrenamed american continental corporation around adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of american financial as chairman and controlling stockholder keating relied heavily upon family members employing his son and four of his sonsinlaw in prominent positions 16 30 charles keating iii had a fast career rise within the company 9 16in 1979 keating served as head of fundraising in the southwest for john connally s campaign for the 1980 republican party presidential nomination 65 connally was a favorite of the business community but his campaign had difficulty parlaying its fundraising successes into popular support in early december 1979 keating was named campaign manager with the existing manager being demoted to campaign strategist 65 66 keatings first action was as a pruner who immediately fired twenty workers at the campaigns virginia headquarters 65 the campaign continued to struggle and by late february 1980 keating was out as manager with connally taking the role 67 connallys campaign ended two weeks later famously known for having spent 11 million and gaining only one delegate 66having won the 1980 election president reagan contacted keating about becoming u s ambassador to the bahamas where keating had spent considerable time 30 when keatings runin with the sec resurfaced in press reports however he was dropped from consideration 11 30 this dismayed keating who subsequently said to keep people like me out of positions like that because of yellow journalism i dont know what good it does 11by the early 1980s american continentals profits were in the millions 30 and it had become the biggest singlefamily home builder in phoenix and denver 63 at its peak it would have 6 billion in assets a large number of subsidiaries 2500 employees and a headquarters complex on phoenixs camelback road 16 it had three corporate jets and a helicopter 9 he was a very hard worker and a strong presence to his employees one later said its almost magnetic when he moves things happen the office would come alive when he walked in 16 he inspired both camaraderie and fervent loyalty in them 9 16 while he demanded long hours he often rewarded employees monetarily and with gifts 9 businesspeople outside his company often found keating arrogant and difficult to deal with 16 congressman william keating who was wellliked 49 said of his brother charlie is impatient aggressive always on the move he has clearly defined goals i dont think he worries about the popularity of his positions 9 a fortune profile in 1977 reported it seems almost impossible to find anyone who actually likes charlie keating 49 the story rankled keating who later had over five thousand large yellow i like charlie keating buttons made up which he handed out to employees and visitors 16 68 69 keating said there are a lot of people that would say nasty things im sure about me but it aint true that nobody ever liked charlie keating 68a devout catholic keating became a heavy donor to charity when he moved to phoenix donating 100000 to the society of saint vincent de paul more than 1 million to covenant house and another more than 1 million to mother teresa s operations including lending her his helicopter when she was in arizona so that she could visit remote indian reservations in the state 9 16 covenant houses father bruce ritter said of keating he makes you believe in providence 9 in 1983 keating and his companies made legal but unusually large campaign donations in races for the phoenix city council who were responsible for approving his building projects 9 16 including water usage for residential developments built around artificial ponds 70 the scale of donations represented a change from past practice in local phoenix politics some council figures opposed the trend while others readily asked for the funds 9 16lincoln savings and the keating five  editsee also keating five in 1984 american continental corporation bought lincoln savings and loan association for just over 50 million 30 71 up through the early 1980s lincoln had been a conservativelyrun enterprise with almost half its assets in home loans and only a quarter of its assets considered at risk 72 it made slow growth at best and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983 once he took over keating fired the existing management 72savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s allowing them to make highrisk investments with their depositors money a change of which keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage 71 73 when keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans he said i know the business inside out and i always felt that an s  l if theyd relax the rules was the biggest moneymaker in the world 11over the next four years lincolns assets increased from 11 billion to 55 billion 71 lincolns particular investments took the form of buying land taking equity positions in real estate development projects and buying highyield junk bonds 74 a sales document from this period urges staff to always remember the weak meek and ignorant are always good targets 75beginning in 1985 the federal home loan bank board fhlbb feared that the savings industrys risky investment practices were exposing the governments insurance funds to huge losses 74 it instituted a rule whereby savings associations could hold no more than 10 percent of their assets in direct investments 74 and were thus prohibited from taking ownership positions in certain financial entities and instruments 76 lincoln had become burdened with bad debt resulting from its past aggressiveness and by early 1986 its investment practices were being investigated and audited by the san francisco office of the fhlbb 74 in particular whether it had violated these direct investment rules lincoln had directed accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation into commercial real estate ventures 77 by the end of 1986 that office of the fhlbb had found that lincoln had 135 million in unreported losses and had surpassed the regulated direct investments limit by 600 million 74keating believed that the regulators were against him because he opposed their rules 78 he also told his staff that some of the san francisco regulators were likely homos who were out to get him for his strong moral views 78 79 keating took measures to oppose the fhlbb including recruiting a study from thenprivate economist alan greenspan saying that direct investments were not harmful 74 trying to hire fhlbb members or their wives 62 and getting president ronald reagan to make a recess appointment of a keating ally real estate developer lee h henkel jr to the fhlbb 74 by march 1987 however the ally had resigned upon news of his having large loans due to lincoln 74 it appeared as though the government might seize lincoln for being insolvent 76starting in january 1987 keating looked for help from what would become known as the keating five  democratic u s senators alan cranston of california dennis de concini of arizona john glenn of ohio and donald w riegle of michigan and republican u s senator john mc cain of arizona 80 keating had or would soon make legal political contributions of about 13 million to the senators and he called on them to help him resist the regulators 81 keating became a personal friend of mc cain following their initial contacts in 1981 82 and mc cain was the only one of the five with close social and personal ties to keating 83 84 mc cain and his family had made several trips at keatings expense sometimes aboard american continentals jet for vacations at keatings opulent bahamas retreat at cat cay 76keating asked that lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the fhlbb so it could limit its high risk investments and get into the relatively safe home mortgage business allowing the business to survive 76 a letter from audit firm arthur young  co bolstered keatings case that the government investigation was taking a long time 82 mc cain initially refused to meet with keating over the fhlbb matter and keating called mc cain a wimp behind his back 82 the two had a heated contentious meeting in which mc cain said he had not spent years in north vietnamese prisonerofwar camps to have his courage or integrity questioned the friendship ended and they would not speak again 82 in april 1987 the group of senators met twice with fhlbb members who were investigating american continental corporation and lincoln in an attempt to end the investigation meanwhile keating filed a lawsuit against the fhlbb saying it had leaked confidential information about lincoln 74 the outgoing head of the fhlbb in washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to keating 76 77 in may 1988 the fhlbb agreed to an unprecedented memorandum of understanding giving lincoln a clean slate and forgiveness for any violations up to that point 85 in 1991 the senators would be rebuked to various degrees by the senate ethics committee with cranston receiving the harshest verdict and glenn and mc cain the least mc cain later testified against keating in a civil lawsuit brought by lincoln bondholders while the other four refused to testify 86 87failure of lincoln and american continental  editlincoln stayed in business from mid1987 to april 1989 its assets grew from 391 billion to 546 billion 74 following keatings past practices with lindner american continental amassed a large collection of confusingly connected subsidiaries in real estate banking and insurance businesses these numbered at least 54 and there were some overseas ones that auditors were not aware of 88 keating was triumphant in having defeated the regulators whom he despised as useless relics from an outmoded financial past and defended his high salary and business practices 62 89 he spent about 500000 on radio advertisements in the phoenix area to improve his public image the commercials stressed his real estate projects and his familyoriented values a 1988 los angeles times profile assessed keating as a businessman without apparent peer in arizona in terms of riches clout and color 9 while keating had taken citizens for decency through law with him 16 he had generally deemphasized his antipornography work when he moved to arizona 11 nevertheless xrated movies and playboy magazine were banned from his hotels 16in october 1988 keating opened his most extravagant real estate project ever the 250acre 10 km 2  600room the phoenician resort at the base of camelback mountain 16 90 its construction cost 300 million included many opulent imported features and saw a number of instances of keating or his decorator wife making wholesale late design changes at great expense 16 91 his other grand project was estrella a 20000acre 81 km 2 mixeduse development outside of phoenix in goodyear arizona in the direction of the sierra estrella 16 incorporating homes offices industrial buildings schools shopping a resort and a hospital it was intended to eventually house 200000 people and become a model 21stcentury city 9 16 30 american continental wrote rules saying that estrella homeowners could not intentionally terminat e a human pregnancy or possess adult material but removed them once keating was informed that such covenants were unconstitutional 9 16 a late 1980s downturn in the sun belt real estate market put estrella in jeopardy before much building could be done 30asked in an interview if he ever worried about going broke keating responded all the time every day i come into the office with this hollow feeling in my stomach lots of time you get trapped almost you get too many responsibilities its a bellyfull to carry its risky dangerous theres the possibility of failure with it every day and every night but in a way its a challenge its invigorating there isnt any point in not being a player – youre here its not only the money its the disgrace yourself your manhood im not sure id have a big problem with that on the other hand im not sure i wouldnt 62as lincoln grew money was siphoned from lincoln to the parent american continental corporation under a variety of schemes and american continental spent lavishly on speculative investments and personal expenses 62 a new regulatory investigation began in july 1988 62 after arthur young  co indicated doubts about some accounting practices keating fired them in september 1988 and switched to touche ross 85 american continental was desperate for cash inflow to make up for losses in real estate purchases and projects 92 lincolns branch managers and tellers convinced customers to replace their federally insured certificates of deposit with higheryielding bond certificates of american continental the customers later said they were never properly informed that the bonds were uninsured and very risky given the state of american continentals finances 92 the regulators had already adjudged the bonds to have no solvent backing 93 federal deposit insurance corporation chair l william seidman would later write that lincolns push to get depositors to switch was one of the most heartless and cruel frauds in modern memory 93 in late 1988 keating began desperate attempts to sell lincoln regulators rejected one 50 million potential sale due to the buyers not meeting federal requirements 85a december 1988 audit by the fhlbb found lincoln in violation of many regulations and in danger of default 85 the following month they ordered keating to stop transferring cash from lincoln to american continental which imperiled the latters survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive 30 85 keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with michael milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash but the moves failed and he lost 11 million in one month alone 85 keating got senators de concini and cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through but this time the lawmakers were ignored 85 94american continental went bankrupt in april 1989 and lincoln was seized by the fhlbb 77 about 23000 customers were left with worthless bonds 95 many investors often ones living in california retirement communities lost their life savings and later claimed to have suffered emotional trauma for having been duped on top of their financial devastation 92 96 the total bondholder loss came to between 250 million and 288 million 95 97the federal government was eventually liable for 34 billion to cover lincolns losses when it seized the institution 98 in talking to reporters in april 1989 keating maintained that he was the victim of a federal government that had spent years trying to destroy him 99 and then said one question among many raised in recent weeks had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause i want to say in the most forceful way i can i certainly hope so 100in september 1989 keating was hit with a 11 billion fraud and racketeering action filed against him by the regulators 101 he proclaimed that weve lost everything in this thing my wife and i its devastating 102 in november 1989 keating was subpoenaed to testify before the house banking committee but refused to answer questions invoking his right against selfincrimination under the fifth amendment 103 also in november his phoenician resort was seized by the fbi under their operation it became known as club fed before later being sold to a kuwaiti group 16 91 104 the vastly ambitious estrella project would remain deserted 16 and was sold in 1993 to an investment group 105by november 1989 the estimated cost of the overall savings and loan crisis had reached 500 billion and the medias coverage often highlighted keatings role as part of what became a feeding frenzy 106 keating and lincoln savings became convenient symbols for arguments about what had gone wrong in americas financial system and society 107 as well as for 1980s greed in general 15 and were featured in popular culture references 107 108 a deck of playing cards would be marketed called the savings and loan scandal that featured on their face charles keating holding up his hand with images of the keating five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers 76 107legal consequences  editkeating blamed government regulators for the failure of lincoln savings and sued for control over the bank the suit was dismissed in august 1990 with the judge calling the seizure fully justified 109 keatings legal fees were running at 1 million per month 16in september 1990 keating and his associates were indicted by the state of california on 42 counts related to having duped lincolns customers into buying worthless junk bonds of american continental corporation keating went to jail when he could not post a 5 million bond 96 he was convicted in december 1991 of 17 counts of fraud racketeering and conspiracy 110 mother teresa asked the court to show leniency to keating in recognition of the considerable sums he had donated to her charitable operations 111 in april 1992 california superior court judge lance ito gave keating the maximum 10year prison sentence quoting woody guthrie to wit more people have suffered from the point of a fountain pen than from a gun 110 keating was sent to the mediumsecurity federal correctional institution tucson to serve his time 8in may 1992 keatings soninlaw robert m wurzelbacher jr a senior vice president of american continental and chief executive of an investment firm owned by lincoln savings 112 was also implicated pleaded guilty to three federal fraud counts in connection with the collapse of the lincoln savings and loan association and agreed to testify against keating 112 in december 1993 wurzelbacher was sentenced to a 40month prison term 113in january 1993 a federal conviction followed on 73 counts of fraud racketeering and conspiracy 114 in july 1993 keating was given a 12½ year sentence 114 the judge ordered keating to pay restitution of 122 million to the government but keating said he was 10 million in debt and had no assets to sell 114one case filed by the u s securities and exchange commission was settled in 1994 keating said he was bankrupt but agreed to repay millions should any hidden assets be discovered 115 a third case filed by the resolution trust corporation resulted in a summary judgment of 43 billion against keating and his wife in 1994 116 the largest judgment ever against a private person 15 the judgment was overturned on appeal in 1999 on grounds that keating could not be held personally liable to the government without a specific criminal conviction or some other decision at trial 117 throughout his incarceration keating maintained his innocence saying he was a  political prisoner  of the u s government and a scapegoat for the largest banking scandal in the nations history 8in april 1996 the 9th u s circuit court of appeals in san francisco ruled that state trial judge ito had given the jury faulty instructions about the law regarding fraud 118 the conviction was overturned 118 in december 1996 the same court of appeals ruled that some of the jurors in the federal case might have been influenced by their knowledge and discussion of the results of the state case and threw out the federal conviction 119 keating was freed after 4½ years in prison 119 he later said that staying tough during his incarceration was the thing he was proudest of 15 he was said to have gotten along well with other prisoners and served as best man at weddings for some that he met there 120in april 1999 on the eve of the retrial of the federal case keating entered a plea agreement he admitted to having committed four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud by extracting nearly 1 million from american continental corp while already anticipating the collapse that happened weeks later the federal prosecutors dropped all other charges against him and his son charles keating iii he was sentenced to time served 121in october 2000 the u s supreme court refused to hear the governments appeal of the overturning of the state conviction 122 this left keating without any convictions other than that from his plea bargain 122 state prosecutors declined to move for a retrial saying it would bring no more than a sixmonth jail sentence and that many witnesses had died in the interim or were in bad health 123 keating replied that if the government had left him alone investors would all be rich 123final years and death  editfollowing his release from prison keating separated from his wife mary 124 he moved in with his daughter mary and soninlaw gary hall sr in the paradise valley neighborhood of phoenix 124 125during the 2000s keating worked as a business consultant 125 and as of 2008 was involved in some successful real estate developments in the phoenix market 15 126 he kept a low profile in his business operations 15 and declined comment during john mc cains 2008 presidential campaign when the keating five scandal was brought up again by the press 125 during his final years keating maintained good physical shape through swimming and walking and was able to go out in public without being recognized 120charles keating died in a phoenix hospital on march 31 2014 at the age of 90 after an undisclosed illness for several weeks 120legacy  editthe chicago tribune  s lengthy profile of keating in 1990 said in summary to say that charles keating is a complex man seems a gross understatement some see him as an aggressive man who got desperate when the real estate market bottomed out and crossed the line between business as usual and fraud others see him as a con artist who finally got caught a hyprocrite who masked his greed with phony piety 16michael binstein and charles bowden s 1993 book trust me charles keating and the missing billions also presents keating as a complex individual with contradictory tendencies and concludes charlie keating built things and at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records he thought his schemes would work he did not simply rob a bank he broke a bank with his dreams if he is simply a thief why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket if he is just a hardworking businessman simply trying to make a profit and create jobs why the need for jets fancy meals big paychecks to his family if he is such a devout communicant of his faith why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy 127keating steadfastly maintained that it was not his mistakes or criminal deeds but regulators actions that were responsible for the major losses 15 a 2004 milken institute study also made the claim that regulators actions were responsible for the lincoln failure and presents keatings actions in a favorable light 128 the milken institute was founded by michael milken the  junk bond  king also convicted on felony charges for violating u s securities laws 129some of keatings 1980s judgment as a developer was later vindicated the phoenician became a successful hotel in the luxury segment 91 104 and the estrella project achieved at least some of keatings vision and was acquired again in 2005 130 131references  edit whos who
