the attack on bourgeois freedommarx was a german of jewish origin who lived much of his life in exile in france and great britain he found much to object to in the prevalent political philosophy of his host countries  a philosophy then known generally as liberalism as elaborated by such thinkers as john locke adam smith voltaire and jeanbaptiste say liberals saw themselves as advocates of liberty and by liberty they meant the right of individuals to do as they pleased with their own lives and their own property today these liberals would probably be called libertarians  while liberalism in the modern sense of the term tends to see the freedom to live as one pleases as quite distinct from the freedom to dispose of property as one pleases the liberals of marxs time usually saw these freedoms as closely connected personal freedom as locke for example saw it was nothing else than selfownership  every man has a property in his own person this no body has any right to but himself the labour of his body and the work of his hands we may say are properly his whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided and left it in he hath mixed his labour with and joyned to it something that is his own and thereby makes it his property  second treatise of government or as robert overton one of lockes predecessors explained it to every individual in nature is given an individual property by nature not be to invaded or usurped by any for everyone as he is himself so he hath a selfpropriety no man hath power over my rights and liberties and i over no mans i may be but an individual enjoy myself and my selfpropriety and may write myself no more than myself or presume any further if i do i am an encroacher and an invader upon another mans right an arrow against all tyrants marx did not deny the close connection between personal freedom and property rights rather he accepted their connection and denounced both as manifestations of what he called bourgeois freedom the doctrine of the rights of man was faulty according to marx because none of the supposed rights of man therefore go beyond the egoistic man man as he is as a member of civil society that is an individual separated from the community withdrawn into himself wholly preoccupied with his private interest and acting in accordance with his private caprice thus man was not liberated from religion he received religious liberty he was not liberated from property he received the liberty to own property he was not liberated from the egoism of business he received the liberty to engage in business on the jewish question to succeed in chaining the multitude you must seem to wear the same fetters voltaire philosophical dictionary for marx freedom of religion or the freedom to own property are hollow freedoms or at least grossly inadequate stepping stones to something better  political emancipation itself is not human emancipation  bourgeois freedom of conscience is nothing but the toleration of all possible kinds of religious freedom of conscience and that for its part socialism endeavors rather to liberate the conscience from the witchery of religion  critique of the gotha program  rather than advocating freedom for all people liberals really value only the freedom of the ruling class of capitalist society viz the bourgeoisie but dont wrangle with us so long as you apply to our intended abolition of bourgeois property the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom culture law etc your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class manifesto of the communist party marx accuses the liberal tradition of slighting the social nature of man liberty is therefore the right to do everything which does not harm others it is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated monad withdrawn into himself marx elaborates the right of property is therefore the right to enjoy ones fortunes and dispose of it as he will without regard for other men and independently of society it leads every man to see in other men not the realization but rather the limitation of his own liberty  on the jewish question marxs solution the route to human emancipation was communism which would give people the freedom that bourgeois society denies them communism is he explains the positive transcendence of private property or human selfestrangement  and therefore the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man the complete return of man to himself as a social being  economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844innumerable social thinkers disagree with much of marxs thought but praise his reflections upon human freedom the depth of his insight in contrast to the shallowness of liberalism yet it is difficult to understand how marxs concept of freedom is anything more than a defense of tyranny and oppression no dissident or nonconformist can see society as the realization of his own liberty and what can the attack on the right to do everything which does not harm others amount to in practice except a justification for coercing people who are not harming others the problem with broad notions of freedom is that they necessarily wind up condoning the violation of narrow notions of freedom under bourgeois notions of religious liberty people may practice any religion they wish a private whim or caprice as marx calls it how could this liberty be broadened without sanctioning the persecution of some religious views earlier antiliberals directly attacked liberty as an evil marx adopted a different stance  to attack liberty under the guise of expanding it in so doing he repackaged despotism to please modern sensibilities  a feat of intellectual marketing which would have profound consequences for hundreds of millions of people in the next century czarist origins of communism the evils of capitalism
