how do you date a pregnancy04092012 26 comments in the first casebased class of medical school students are asked to answer a virtual patient’s question about the development of the fetus these students are smart and they know all about beta hc g and are anxious to showcase their knowledge of the menstrual cycle with fluctuating levels of various hormones fsh progesterone etc yet one question brings confusion “how pregnant is this women” the related question “when does pregnancy start” leaves the students flummoxed is it at conception but how do you know when that happens or does implantation make more sense it’s a great example of how detailed facts need the larger context the usual dating is gestational age based on the first day of your last menstrual period however you can also date a pregnancy with embryological age starting at conception how you date a pregnancy can depend on your perspective my very general guideline pregnant woman is the focus  gestational age eg obstetricians 1focus on embryologicalfetal development  embryological age eg developmental biologist 2but why are there two types of dates we might need a bit of a primer on the menstrual cycle and how it relates to pregnancy graphic updated to remove the implantation step implantation happens between day 20 and 22 pregnancy is often detected after the first missed period this graphic is intentionally simple removing all the hormones and other fun stuff you’ll note that it says approximately day 14 and day 28 in textbooks we often see that women have 28 day cycles and everything has a nice schedule however women are not textbooks and sometimes have shorter or longer cycles andor have ovulation at slightly different times therefore knowing when fertilization and conception happen can be a bit tricky an obvious marker is the first day of the last menstrual period lmp why the first day well another variable is the length of menses but everyone has a first day so to be consistent that is the marker used we generally use gestational age when discussing pregnancy so when someone says that they are 8 weeks pregnant they mean it has been 8 weeks since the first day of the lmp last menstrual period but that means that the first two weeks of pregnancy has nothing happening if you are concerned about development you don’t start counting at week 3 but start at the time of fertilization two weeks later therefore the embryological age is generally two weeks later but remember we have essentially picked gestational age as the convention for discussing pregnancy dates if there are markers in development to suggest that the embryological age is different for example the fetus is 12 weeks not 13 weeks the gestational age is often reported to the mother in our example the dating would be changed to 14 weeks due to the difference in these dates we see confusion beyond medical students thinking about this for the first time it was recently reported that arizona had changed its abortion law to be the most restrictive – but it hadn’t it had just joined other states in making the limit 20 weeks gestational age remember this is the accepted convention for pregnancy dating – but many articles picked up on that initial two weeks of nothingness in gestational age and confused it with embryological age was this an example of details without understanding of the greater context——synonyms include obstetrical and menstrual age synonyms include developmental conception and fetal age share twitter facebook google pinterest reddit more related adapted paper from students28122012in sci edpeek into science11012013in sci edgenetic counselling should be nondirective15012013in med gen introfiled under science tagged with pregnancy science education
