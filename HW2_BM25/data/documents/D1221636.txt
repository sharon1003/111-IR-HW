cars  transportation maintenance  repairs on average how many of gallons of paint would it take to paint an oldsmobile cutlass2 following 7 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer i have been painting cars for 25 years so you can go by what i tell you paint for cars is mixed in pints quarts half gallons gallons and five gallons i would buy 2 gallons then you will have left over paint just incase you need to make a repair you can have the primer tented so that it will not take as many coats of paint to cover it metallic colors do not cover as well as nonmetallic colors follow the instructions on the can also the jobber paint store will have printed info that they can give you for free if the paint that you are using is a very expensive color to mix like some of the metallic and special effects colors you can paint the car with a coat or two of less expensive paint but it must be of the same kind of paint and of the same tone it is also best if the car is of one color to start with so if the car is silver and one fender is black paint that fender with the same tone of gray as the silver that is on the car if the paint that you are going to use is very translucent it is best to paint the car in a reflective color first like silver gold or white as any light that makes it’s way through the paint will have something to bounce off of a lot of times i have the jobber leave the metallic out of the paint for me then i paint the car silver before i spray the color on and i end up with a cheep man’s candy paint job basecoatclearcoat uses less color but that will be offset by the cost of the clear so the price will be about the same as single stage paint imho single stage paint holds up better is easier to repair and care for what ever you do start with a clean surface wash the car with a good precleaner before you start and a finalwash before you paint only use fisheye eliminator as a last resort as it will make the paint job look like crap talk to your jobber before you start print this and take this into your jobber and he will explane any thing that you do not understand he did not say what year the car was and older cutlasses are not small cars also 2 quarts of pant reduced by 25 would only be 2 quarts and 1 pint of mixed paint this is not enough to paint a car the least i would buy is a gallon and a half but that will not cost you that much less then two gallons now a gallon and a half reduced by 25 would make a little less then 1 gallon and three quarts of mixed paint 173 gallons would be just maybe just enough to do the job if you also painted the jams that is to say under the hood trunk inside of the fenders and the door openings i still stand by my two gallons this way you will have some left over and no two mixes will be exactly the same color mysticrel… is using 100 reduction that is ok if you like to spray paint that is the viscosity of water the more paint is reduced the less it is going to hid and the less it is going to shine back in the day we did not add any thing to thin the paint down we heated and the heat made it thinner you should have seen the shine it is better to buy more paint thing you think you will need then not have enough to do the job and running out of paint before you are done source s painting two cars a day five days a week for 25 yearsidotusa · 1 decade ago8 1 1 comment

years ago0 0 commenti own a 1980 olds cutlass and have been working on cars for over 20 years and the guy that has been painting for 25 years is a moron and so is every one else first i need to know if ur doing door jams and under the trunk and hood as this will take more paint but most for most cars if u use a base clear paint u only need 2 qts of paint and prolly 2 or 3 qts of clear 1gal reducer and the activator for the paint and here is why u reduce paint with a reducer 11 ratio so 2 qts makes 1 gallon of paint and to recoat the exterior of most cars including a cutlass u should only need about a gallon depends on quality of paint job and how much time u have put into the body work anyways to repeat for a base clear job u need 2qts paint 2qts clear 1 gal reducer and the
