antianxiety agents carcinogenesis mutagenes is impairment of fertility longterm carcinogenic studies have not been done with cyproheptadine cyproheptadine had no effect on fertility in a twolitter study in rats or a two generation study in mice at about 10 times the human dose cyproheptadine did not produce chromosome damage in human lymphocytes or fibroblasts invitro high doses 104m were cytotoxic cyproheptadine did not have any mutagenic effect in the ames microbial mutagen test concentrations of above 500 mcgplate inhibited bacterial growth pregnancy pregnancy category breproduction studies have been performed in rabbits mice and rats at oral or subcutaneous doses up to 32 times the maximum recommended human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cyproheptadine cyproheptadine has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when given by intraperitoneal injection in doses four times the maximum recommended human oral dose two studies in pregnant women however have not shown that cyproheptadine increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during the first second and third trimesters of pregnancy no teratogenic effects were observed in any of the newborns nevertheless because the studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility of harm cyproheptadine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed nursing mothers it is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from cyproheptadine a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother see contraindications  pediatric use safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of two have not been established see contraindicationsnewborn or premature infants and warnings pediatric patients  geriatric use clinical studies of cyproheptadine hcl tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients in general dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious usually starting at the low end of the dosing range reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy see warnings activities requiring mental alertness
