new york fortune magazine � in late 1995 six months after toyota decided to move forward with its revolutionary hybrid the prius and two years before the car was supposed to go into production in japan the engineers working on the project had a problem a big problem the first prototypes wouldnt start on the computer the hybrid power system worked very well says satoshi ogiso the teams chief power train engineer but simulation is different from seeing if the actual part can work it took ogiso and his team more than a month to fix the software and electrical problems that kept the prius stationary then when they finally got it started the car motored only a few hundred yards down the test track before coming to a stop the prius is toyotas hottestselling u s car more from fortune will

theyre tops its hard to imagine toyota  research  with its aura of invincibility running into such trouble but the story of how it brought the prius to market  a tale of technological potholes impossible demands and multiple miscalculations  reveals how a great company can overcome huge obstacles to make the improbable seem inevitable the gaselectric auto represents only a tiny fraction of the nine million cars and trucks the japanese company will produce this year but it is the first vehicle to provide a serious alternative to the internal combustion engine since the stanley steamer ran out of steam in 1924 it has become an automotive landmark a car for the future designed for a world of scarce oil and surplus greenhouse gases for all its success as a highquality manufacturer before the prius toyota had never been much of a pioneer it was known as a fast follower a riskaverse company in which process  the famous toyota lean production system  trumped product indeed toyota based in rural aichi prefecture 200 miles from tokyo enjoys depicting itself as a slowmoving company of simple country farmers but as interviews with company executives in japan and the u s make clear toyota is capable of breaking its own rules when it needs to in rushing the prius to market it abandoned its traditional consensus management as executives resorted to such unusual practices at least for toyota of setting targets and enforcing deadlines that many considered unattainable toyotas push into hybrids is only going to accelerate although the prius first came to life under hiroshi okuda and fujio cho toyotas two previous presidents new boss katsuaki watanabe wants hybrids to become the automotive mainstream watanabe 64 who became the companys top executive last june has the deferential air of a longtime family retainer but he is intent on continuing toyotas explosive growth of the past five years in which worldwide production rose by nearly half in an interview earlier this year at company headquarters in toyota city he stressed that a key part of his strategy is making hybrids more affordable for consumers we need to improve the production engineering and develop better technology in batteries motors and inverters he said my quest is to produce a thirdgeneration prius quickly and cheaply by early in the next decade he expects toyota to be selling one million hybrids a year since no other automaker can even approach that quantity toyota is way out in front  an unusual place for a fast follower is toyota a conservative company asks jeffrey liker an engineering professor at the university of michigan and author of the toyota way yes does it seem to be very plodding and slow to make changes yes is it innovative remarkably so go slow build on the past and thoroughly consider all implications of decisions yet move aggressively to beat the competition to market with exceptional products if hes right toyota is becoming a double threat the worlds finest manufacturer and a truly great innovator the story of the prius suggests that he is ignitionthe car that became the prius began life in 1993 when eiji toyoda toyotas chairman and the patriarch of its ruling family expressed concern about the future of the automobile yoshiro kimbara then executive vice president in charge of rd heard the rumblings and embarked on a project known as g21 for global 21st century to develop a new small car that could be sold worldwide he set two goals to develop new production methods and to wring better fuel economy from the traditional internal combustion engine his target was 475 miles per gallon a little more than 50 better than what the corolla toyotas popular small car was getting at the time by the end of 1993 the development team had determined that higher oil prices and a growing middle class around the world would require the new car to be both roomy and fuelefficient other than that they were given no guidance i was trying to come up with the future direction of the company says watanabe who headed corporate planning at the time i didnt have a very specific idea about the vehicle direct responsibility for the project lay with executive vice president akihiro wada to lead the team wada went looking for an engineer with the right blend of experience and openmindedness he found it in takeshi uchiyamada as wada now an advisor to aisin seiki a toyota brake supplier explains uchiyamada was originally an expert in noise and vibration control but he was serious and hardworking and we thought it would develop his capability to make him chief engineer of a product that could go rapidly into production at first uchiyamada assumed he could increase the g21s fuel economy by making refinements to existing technology in a plan he submitted to wada in 1994 he wrote that the introduction of an improved engine and transmission system could boost fuel efficiency by 50 but that wasnt audacious enough for wada who didnt want to be remembered for producing yet another japanese econobox it was not enough to be a simple extension of existing technology wada says one possible solution intrigued him a hybrid power system the concept wasnt new toyota had been dabbling for 20 years with the idea of placing a traditional gasoline motor alongside an electric one powered by batteries that are recharged whenever the car coasts or brakes  honda  research was working on a version too masatami takimoto now an executive vice president says he was developing a hybrid minivan at the time but that the project had run into trouble there was a split between the engineers and sales executives he says engineers had the firm belief that the hybrid was the answer to all those questions  oil depletion emissions and the longterm future of the automobile society  but the business people werent in agreement they thought the premium price for the hybrid would make it impossible to sell wada sided with the engineers and ordered the team to develop a concept car with a hybrid powertrain for the 1995 tokyo motor show just 12 months away to reinforce his directive he demanded that they raise the fueleconomy target even higher to compensate for higher hybrid costs dont settle for anything less than a 100 improvement he says he told uchiyamada otherwise competitors would catch up quickly as uchiyamada now an executive vice president and a member of toyotas board concedes at that moment i felt he demanded too much to find the right hybrid system for the g21 by now called the prius uchiyamadas team went through 80 alternatives before narrowing the list to four based largely on fuel efficiency we had to go through numerous problems  heat reliability noise and cost recalls takimoto who shifted over to the project we had experience in mechanical elements but we didnt have much experience with electronic components like motors and batteries especially highpowered ones then the team factored technical feasibility and cost to come up with its final choice in june 1995 toyota got serious about putting the prius into production and set a target to begin manufacturing by the end of 1998 two months later hiroshi okuda became president of the company which only increased the heat on uchiyamada okuda liked to move fast and he told wada he wanted the prius to go into production a year sooner by december 1997 that meant uchiyamadas team had to develop the car hybrid powertrain and all in only 24 months  about twothirds the time an automaker might take with a conventional vehicle okuda believed the technology was critical to the future of toyota but his directive wasnt very popular i have to admit that we were against the decision uchiyamada says our team believed it was too demanding even mr wada was initially against it today wada explains okudas order philosophically this is always how it is he says the top management is not going to give detailed instructions on technology as long as engineers come up with solutions by the deadline that is fine as watanabe who also had a lot riding on the decision puts it everything was challenging about the development of the prius the engine coughswatching developments from across the pacific were the product planners at the companys u s division toyota motor sales in torrance calif the tms planners had first heard about hybrids at a meeting in japan in 1995 it was all new and unconventional recalls marketing executive mark amstock there was skepticism within the company about whether the hybrids were really cars early consumer research in the u s supported the skeptics it wasnt clear that better fuel economy alone could drive premium pricing says andrew coetzee now vice president of product planning for tms but another factor was at play at tms the ever more stringent emission targets set by the california air resources board gradually support began to build around hybrids ecological potential thirty miles to the south at toyotas design studio in newport beach stylists were competing with colleagues in japan to develop body concepts for the prius like everything else it was a rush job ordinarily we get two to three months to make sketches and prepare models recalls designer erwin lui for prius we got two to three weeks luis design for a fourdoor sedan was one of three that toyota executives in japan liked and he went there in the summer of 1996 to develop an engineering production model but some of his colleagues were unenthusiastic the exterior design was polarizing says amstock with the corolla already in our lineup we wondered if we would be able to sell another fuelefficient small car meanwhile the engineers in japan kept running into problems according to a 1999 account written by hideshi itazaki and published in japan the batteries continued to be a nightmare the prius needed a large battery pack to power the car at low speeds and to store energy but it would shut down when it became too hot or too cold during road tests with toyota executives a team member had to sit in the passenger seat with a laptop and monitor the temperature of the battery so that it wouldnt burst into flames okuda kept up the pressure he told wada in december 1996 that he wanted to announce by the following march that toyota had developed a hybrid technology but despite 1000 toyota engineers racing to get the prius ready uchiyamadas team still didnt have a workable prototype during coldweather testing in february on hokkaido island the cars ground to a halt at temperatures below 14 degrees fahrenheit a media testdrive was conducted in may but each participant was limited to two laps around the track because battery performance was so poor but one by one the problems were corrected a radiator was added to an electronic component to prevent overheating two months were spent redesigning a semiconductor to keep it from breaking down and after endless fussing and tweaking the team finally reached 66 miles per gallon  the 100 mileage improvement wada had asked for making repairstoyota unveiled the prius in japan in october 1997 two months ahead of schedule and it went on sale that december the total cost of development was an estimated 1 billion  after all the anguish about average for a new car but the priuss initial reception took some executives including watanabe by surprise i did not envisage such a major success at that time he says some thought it would grow rapidly and others thought it would grow gradually i was in the second camp production was quickly doubled to 2000 cars a month over in california tms executives were still worried about sales prospects in the u s introducing cars with novel powertrains wasnt something they were used to its difficult to build consumer technology awareness says chris hostetter now vice president of advancedproduct strategy consumers would have to be taught that the car didnt come with an extension cord dealers would have to be trained on how to sell the car and service it when the first prius arrived in california in may 1999 tms gave it a thorough goingover there was still concern about the design ernest bastien now vice president of vehicle operations thought an suv configuration would work better because it would carry batteries more easily hostetter was sure that an suv would send the wrong environmental message what the california team needed was to gauge public reaction so they took what few cars they had  all of them righthand drives for the japanese market  to orange county to let potential buyers try them out the cars barely passed muster some drivers didnt like the feel of the brakes others complained that the interior looked cheap that the arm rest was too low that the rear seats didnt fold down tms planners also discovered that a baby stroller wouldnt fit in the trunk it was a japan car says bill reinert national manager of advancedtechnology vehicles and it seemed out of context in the u swhen lefthanddrive models finally arrived the testers fanned out across the country for a demonstration program the cars had been modified for the u s market with more horsepower and additional emissions equipment and the battery pack was now lighter but the team had a hard time figuring out who the car would appeal to it quickly learned that extreme environmentalists werent interested in hybrids they were turned off by the technology and tight with a buck and some dealers were still skeptical salt lake city dealer larry miller who owns nine toyota and lexus outlets liked the way the prius drove but wasnt sure about the design it was passable he says it looked like it wouldnt embarrass us focus groups further tempered the early hopes when we told the dealers how difficult it was to predict who the buyer would be bastien says they lost their enthusiasm to have a lot full of them meanwhile honda which had been racing to get a hybrid the insight to the u s market first launched its car in december 1999 seven months ahead of the prius but the insight was more an experiment than a serious car it had extreme aerodynamic styling no back seat and a smaller engine that used less sophisticated technology coming in second provided a benefit for toyota an insight buyer in the u s posted his owners manual on his website and tms used the information to modify its warranties the two biggest decisions tms had to make were how many cars to order and how much to charge the latter causing friction between california and japan under the toyota system the u s sales group buys cars from the parent company at a negotiated price then resells them to dealers japan wanted the prius to sell for more than 20000 putting it in camry territory but the americans saw a car about the size of the smaller corolla and produced research showing that buyers would balk at paying that much a compromise was reached when tms cut the dealer margin on the car from 14 to 10 so that it could pay japan more and still make a decent profit since the prius was expected to account for less than 1 of their total sales dealers didnt complain the car went on sale with a base price of 19995 japan lost money on the first batch  not unusual for a small car worried about the hybrids economics the stateside prius team armed itself with contingency plans to boost sales if they started to sag cutrate leases rental coupons free maintenance roadside assistance but with profit margins scant and volumes low there was no money for advertising when hostetter wanted to buy newspaper ads on earth day tms chairman yoshi inaba turned him down instead he relied on grassroots marketing public relations events and the internet since no one really knew who might buy these things toyota created a special internet ordering system to ensure priuses were allocated wherever demand popped up some 37000 interested consumers signed up and 12000 eventually became buyers preselling the cars on the internet also enabled toyota to identify customer hot spots it came as no surprise that the san francisco area accounted for 30 of prius sales compared with 6 for all other toyota models but some toyota dealers liked the old system better they felt they were being cut out of the process online was hard to get used to says miller then head of the toyota dealer council i said boy if toyota has misestimated it would fall to us to market this turkey sleeper hitthe prius made its u s debut in july 2000 it wasnt a delight to drive requiring 13 seconds to get to 60 miles per hour the corolla needed just ten a car and driver writer reported the prius alternatively lurches and bucks down the road its engine noise swelling and subsiding for no apparent reason but the prius caught on anyway and as in japan sales were much higher than the company dared hope buyers didnt care about the jerky ride or premium price  they focused on the improved fuel economy lower emissions as much as 80 lower and advanced technology resale value protected them on the downside the prius retained 57 of its value after three years pride of ownership was so high that only 2 of buyers opted to lease then celebrities discovered the prius and it really took off leonardo di caprio bought one from a hollywood dealer in 2001 cameron diaz soon followed a california public relations agency asked toyota to provide five priuses for the 2003 academy awards toyota says no money changed hands but the value of seeing harrison ford and calista flockhart step out of a chauffeur driven prius was as they say priceless the boost from the oscars and steadily rising gasoline prices stoked interest in the second generation prius which was in development even before the first version went on sale in the u s launched in the fall of 2003 the new model became a fashion statement it had a unique hatchback body style that made it stand out in traffic it was faster and more powerful than its predecessor used less gas and produced fewer emissions and thanks to a successful effort by american planners it did not have a complicated touchpad control that required scrolling through several menus just to operate the defroster we had some pretty bareknuckled fights with japan because it was already packaged in says reinert people waited months to get their priuses as production struggled to keep pace with demand u s sales doubled to 53991 in 2004 and nearly doubled again to 107897 the following year  about 60 of global prius sales its the hottest car weve ever had says jim press president of tms going mainstreamwith success has come the inevitable backlash critics complain that hybrids are inherently uneconomical because the 3000 or more the technology adds to the cost of the vehicle cant be recouped with greater gas mileage that they dont improve fuel efficiency that much and that some american models were being built more for performance than to benefit the environment carlos ghosn ceo of japanese rival nissan likes to poke fun at toyotas supposed social responsibility some of our competitors say they are doing things for the benefit of humanity he says well we are in a business and we have a mission of creating value the knocks against hybrids are all true but what the critics didnt put a price on was the value of being seen as ecosensitive without giving up performance does it save enough money to pay for itself asks press thats not the idea whats the true cost of a gallon of gas if you factor in foreign aid middle eastern wars and so on the truth is on our side the most prominent convert to the hybrid cause has been general motors  research vice chairman bob lutz as recently as 2004 lutz dismissed hybrids as an interesting curiosity adding that they didnt make sense with gas at 150 a gallon besides gm had its own powertrain of tomorrow fuel cells a year later with gas heading to 250 a gallon lutz was backpedaling admitting that gm had missed the boat the manifest success of the prius caused a rethink on everybodys part now gm is bringing out hybrid pickup trucks suvs and buses other makers are also rushing to develop models lordly mercedesbenz research showed a dieselelectric sclass at the frankfurt auto show last fall ford  research  which licenses toyota technology has promised the capacity to build 250000 hybrids by the end of the decade even ghosn is bringing hybrids to market under the nissan brand toyota is relentlessly adapting hybrid technology to more models with the goal of offering it in every vehicle it makes last october the company invited a dozen journalists to its test track outside tokyo in the shadow of mount fuji to drive two future hybrid vehicles on a cold rainy day both cars performed flawlessly the hybrid camry proved roomy yet thrifty capable of achieving a combined city and highway fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon the silvery lexus gs450h was quick  zero to 60 in 58 seconds  and still got combined mileage in the high 20s if toyota can continue to reduce costs and it most probably will the potential for hybrids may be nearly unlimited with its huge headstart better technology enormous scale and powerful will to make hybrids an everyday alternative to the internal combustion engine  a combination no other auto maker can match  its hard to see toyota not dominating the industry for years to come reporter associates cindy kano joan levinstein see fortunes full list of americas most admired companies
