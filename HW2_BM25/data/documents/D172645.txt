eureka moment by having on fall on his head thats just not true pinstockgetty imagesby andrew zimmerman jones updated january 11 2018newtons law of gravity defines the attractive force between all objects that possess mass understanding the law of gravity one of the fundamental forces of physics offers profound insights into the way our universe functions the proverbial apple the famous story that isaac newton came up with the idea for the law of gravity by having an apple fall on his head is not true although he did begin thinking about the issue on his mothers farm when he saw an apple fall from a tree he wondered if the same force at work on the apple was also at work on the moon if so why did the apple fall to the earth and not the moon along with his three laws of motion newton also outlined his law of gravity in the 1687 book philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles of natural philosophy which is generally referred to as the principia johannes kepler german physicist 15711630 had developed three laws governing the motion of the five thenknown planets he did not have a theoretical model for the principles governing this movement but rather achieved them through trial and error over the course of his studies newtons work nearly a century later was to take the laws of motion he had developed and apply them to planetary motion to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for this planetary motion gravitational forces newton eventually came to the conclusion that in fact the apple and the moon were influenced by the same force he named that force gravitation or gravity after the latin word gravitas which literally translates into heaviness or weight in the principia newton defined the force of gravity in the following way translated from the latin every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them mathematically this translates into the force equation f g  gm 1 m 2 r 2in this equation the quantities are defined as f g  the force of gravity typically in newtonsg  the gravitational constant which adds the proper level of proportionality to the equation the value of g is 667259 x 10 11 n  m 2  kg 2 although the value will change if other units are being usedm 1  m 1  the masses of the two particles typically in kilogramsr  the straightline distance between the two particles typically in metersinterpreting the equation this equation gives us the magnitude of the force which is an attractive force and therefore always directed toward the other particle as per newtons third law of motion this force is always equal and opposite newtons three laws of motion give us the tools to interpret the motion caused by the force and we see that the particle with less mass which may or may not be the smaller particle depending upon their densities will accelerate more than the other particle this is why light objects fall to the earth considerably faster than the earth falls toward them still the force acting on the light object and the earth is of identical magnitude even though it doesnt look that way it is also significant to note that the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects as objects get further apart the force of gravity drops very quickly at most distances only objects with very high masses such as planets stars galaxies and black holes have any significant gravity effects center of gravity in an object composed of many particles every particle interacts with every particle of the other object since we know that forces  including gravity are vector quantities we can view these forces as having components in the parallel and perpendicular directions of the two objects in some objects such as spheres of uniform density the perpendicular components of force will cancel each other out so we can treat the objects as if they were point particles concerning ourselves with only the net force between them the center of gravity of an object which is generally identical to its center of mass is useful in these situations we view gravity and perform calculations as if the entire mass of the object were focused at the center of gravity in simple shapes — spheres circular disks rectangular plates cubes etc — this point is at the geometric center of the object this idealized model of gravitational interaction can be applied in most practical applications although in some more esoteric situations such as a nonuniform gravitational field further care may be necessary for the sake of precision gravity index newtons law of gravity gravitational fields gravitational potential energy gravity quantum physics  general relativity introduction to gravitational fields sir isaac newtons law of universal gravitation ie the law of gravity can be restated into the form of a gravitational field which can prove to be a useful means of looking at the situation instead of calculating the forces between two objects every time we instead say that an object with mass creates a gravitational field around it the gravitational field is defined as the force of gravity at a given point divided by the mass of an object at that point both g and fg have arrows above them denoting their vector nature the source mass m is now capitalized the r at the end of the rightmost two formulas has a carat  above it which means that it is a unit vector in the direction from the source point of the mass m since the vector points away from the source while the force and field are directed toward the source a negative is introduced to make the vectors point in the correct direction this equation depicts a vector field around m which is always directed toward it with a value equal to an objects gravitational acceleration within the field the units of the gravitational field are ms2 gravity index newtons law of gravity gravitational fields gravitational potential energy gravity quantum physics  general relativity when an object moves in a gravitational field work must be done to get it from one place to another starting point 1 to end point 2 using calculus we take the integral of the force from the starting position to the end position since the gravitational constants and the masses remain constant the integral turns out to be just the integral of 1  r 2 multiplied by the constants we define the gravitational potential energy u such that w  u 1  u 2 this yields the equation to the right for the earth with mass m e in some other gravitational field m e would be replaced with the appropriate mass of course gravitational potential energy on earth on the earth since we know the quantities involved the gravitational potential energy u can be reduced to an equation in terms of the mass m of an object the acceleration of gravity  g  98 ms and the distance y above the coordinate origin generally the ground in a gravity problem this simplified equation yields a gravitational potential energy of u  mgy there are some other details of applying gravity on the earth but this is the relevant fact with regards to gravitational potential energy notice that if r gets bigger an object goes higher the gravitational potential energy increases or becomes less negative if the object moves lower it gets closer to the earth so the gravitational potential energy decreases becomes more negative at an infinite difference the gravitational potential energy goes to zero in general we really only care about the difference in the potential energy when an object moves in the gravitational field so this negative value isnt a concern this formula is applied in energy calculations within a gravitational field as a form of energy gravitational potential energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy gravity index newtons law of gravity gravitational fields gravitational potential energy gravity quantum physics  general relativity gravity  general relativity when newton presented his theory of gravity he had no mechanism for how the force worked objects drew each other across giant gulfs of empty space which seemed to go against everything that scientists would expect it would be over two centuries before a theoretical framework would adequately explain why newtons theory actually worked in his theory of general relativity albert einstein explained gravitation as the curvature of spacetime around any mass objects with greater mass caused greater curvature and thus exhibited greater gravitational pull this has been supported by research that has shown light actually curves around massive objects such as the sun which would be predicted by the theory since space itself curves at that point and light will follow the simplest path through space theres greater detail to the theory but thats the major point quantum gravity current efforts in quantum physics are attempting to unify all of the fundamental forces of physics into one unified force which manifests in different ways so far gravity is proving the greatest hurdle to incorporate into the unified theory such a theory of quantum gravity would finally unify general relativity with quantum mechanics into a single seamless and elegant view that all of nature functions under one fundamental type of particle interaction in the field of quantum gravity it is theorized that there exists a virtual particle called a graviton that mediates the gravitational force because that is how the other three fundamental forces operate or one force since they have been essentially unified together already the graviton has not however been experimentally observed applications of gravity this article has addressed the fundamental principles of gravity incorporating gravity into kinematics and mechanics calculations is pretty easy once you understand how to interpret gravity on the surface of the earth newtons major goal was to explain planetary motion as mentioned earlier johannes kepler had devised three laws of planetary motion without the use of newtons law of gravity they are it turns out fully consistent and in fact one can prove all of keplers laws by applying newtons theory of universal gravitationcite
