response to he pharmacologicaily related naloxone thegerbil has been used extensively as a model for studying the pathophysiology of cerebral infarction 59 14 ever since the discovery by levine and payan 17 of this animals unique susceptibility to cerebral ischemia the gerbil lacks an artery communicating the major anterior blood supply from the internal carotid artery with the posterior basilar arterial blood supply 3° this allows a relatively simple common carotid artery occlusion to produce closed head cerebral ischemi for ex perimental study using this model a number of investigators have examined the value of exmenmt drug therapies to improve the morbidity or mortality conse quent to the induced isehemia 13 15 191 some agents such as phenoxybenzamie 21 atropine thiosernicarbazide phenyoin theophylline 15 and annophylline 20 have proven to be deleerious to the recovery or to the amelioration of neuroloc damage thyrotropinreleasing hormone trh was chosen for evalu tion in the gerbil stroke model because of its beneficial effects in a snal trauma model in cats 7 the rationale also included the improvement of neurologic deficits in the rgerbil stroke model by the pharmacolocally related compound naloxone  in conducting the research described in this report the investigators adhered o the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals as promulgated by the

johansson and coworkers 16 prompted their citing the known physiological relationship of rierves in exocrine glands some of which contain both acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal ptide vip and thers which contain norepineprin¢ and avian pancreatic plypeptide app both acetylcholine and vip potentiated the secretion of the gland via stimulating their respective receptors to increase blood flow  in conra s the co existing norepinephrincapp nerve produced vasoconstriction probably by an app blockade of he vp response together with direct adrenergic receptor stimula tion the potential complexity of central peptidetransmitter interactions is evident the intertion of trh on the ischemic brain with energy metabolism neurotransmitter systeras and blood flow is yet to be established in comparable detail because of its many crgotropic properties in healthy organisms exogenous trh has been proposed to upplement postanesthesia recovery of consciousness and respiration and to the diagnosis of brain death 22l the deleterious effect in this present study of exogenous trh in the gerbil stroke model should provoke con siderable caution on its use in therapy of pathological or compromised situations un til further elaboration of trhs role can be undertaken 18 1 agarwai r a rastogi r b and singhal r l enhancemem of locomotor activity and catechoiamine and 5hyflroxytrypmmine
