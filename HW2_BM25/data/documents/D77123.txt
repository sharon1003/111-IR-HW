camellia sinensis the plant that makes green and black tea though it is thought to be a healthy drink improper preparation can cause toxicity and has resulted in multiple deaths this page features 25 unique references to scientific papers history summary things to know how to take scientific research citations summary of kombucha primary information benefits effects and important facts kombucha sometimes called mushroom tea though it does not contain bioactive mushrooms is a fermented tea from the plant camellia sinensis kombucha is a green or black tea that is fermented for a week after sugars fungi and bacteria have been added to it the fermentation process produces a variety of acidic compounds that are claimed to benefit health through detoxification and antioxidation kombucha is also thought to promote longevity though kombucha is a popular product its actual effects on health are lacking kombucha contains more antioxidants than other teas but there is not enough evidence to compare it against other standards like green tea catechins and vitamin c hypothetically kombucha can aid detoxification through its main bioactive which is called saccharolactone but this has not been tested in people improper sanitation and too long of a fermentation period can contribute to kombucha’s toxicity which can result in death usually this is because an individual was brewing their own kombucha but death has also resulted from drinking too much kombucha more than 14oz most of the evidence supporting kombuchas potential benefits is limited to rodents while much of the evidence demonstrating its risks extends to humans therefore it is not recommended to drink kombucha for its health benefits follow this page for updates things to know also known as fungal tea mushroom tea do not confuse with camellia sinensis plant from which it comes fromthings to note improper preparation has been noted to cause adverse effects sometimes resulting in death is a form of tea caution notice kombucha improperly prepared and in high doses is linked to numerous instances of toxicity examinecom medical disclaimer how to take recommended dosage active amounts other details there are several case reports of adverse effects occuring following kombucha consumption this may be due to toxins pathogens or excess acid as a result of overfermentation due to this potential harm regular kombucha consumption is not recommended although rare most adverse effects occurred after a person drank more than 4 ounces 125m l therefore it is not recommended to ingest more than 4 ounces of kombucha a day in order to minimize the chance of an adverse effect if kombucha is brewed at home it must be properly prepared in a sanitized environment and fermented for less than a week to be safe

is a fermented beverage made from tea and sugar where the addition of inoculum and subsequent fermentation is thought to produce unique health bioactives 1 this inoculum is commonly referred to as tea fungus and contains a mixture of bacteria and fungi which act during the fermentation process a pellicle which forms during this process is referred to as the fungus and the fungus produces alcohol which helps the bacteria produce the aforementioned bioactives 2the tea used is from the camellia sinensis plant and usually refers to the black tea although green tea is sometimes used when black tea is used as black tea itself requires fermentation to be produced the final kombucha product is sometimes referred to as being doubly fermented kombucha is produced by making a tea from the plant camellia sinensis basic extraction being called green tea fermenting it initially to make black tea and then fermenting it again with a mixture of bacteria and fungi and sugars to produce kombucha in this sense it is doubly fermented the essential organisms that make up the tea fungus are an aceticacid producing strain of bacteria usually the acetobacter genus both and being identified and yeast 1 strains of lactic acidproducting  lactobacillus and gluconic acidproducing  gluconobacter oxydans being identified bacteria can also be present 1there are various yeast fungi that are seen including brettanomycesdekkera candida kloeckera pichia saccharomyces saccharomycoides shizosaccharomyces torulospora and zygosaccharomyces 1 3 although most have been unidentified up to 163 strains of yeast have been detected 1 with four major yeasts being zygosaccharomyces bailii tdelbrueckii cstellata and spombe 1although kombucha contains a variety of bacteria and fungi it appears to be safe for human consumption when properly processed and consumed in moderation details in the safety and toxicology section the strains of bacteria used in kombucha fermentation are those that are acidresistant and produce acids upon metabolizing ethanol and sugars and while there are no standard yeast fungi used during this process the ones that are mostoften found also tend to also be acidresistant and acidproducing components of kombucha that are preexisting in the tea  camellia sinensis prior to fermentation include green tea catechins which experience variable degradation rates 1848 with less degradation seen with green tea relative to black tea and less with egcg relative to other catechins 2 epigallocatechin egc and epicatechin ec were noted to be markedly 3050 elevated after 12 days fermentation thought to be due to the degragation or their gallated forms egcg and ecg respectively 2theaflavins found in black teas where 5 is lost during 18 days fermentation 2thearubigins found in black tea where 11 is lost during 18 days fermentation 2the standard tea polyphenols found in the camellia sinensis plant and those produced during the intitial fermentation to get black tea theaflavins and thearubigins persist in kombucha with the losses during the second fermentation being fairly minimal components of kombucha tea produced during the fermentation process include alcohol produced from added sugars via yeast reaching 06g100m l after 10 days 4acetic acid produced from the alcohol via bacteria 5 reaching 16g100m l after 10 days 4 this may be a high estimate as other studies have noticed a plateau at 095g100m l after 15 days followed by a decline 2dsaccharic acid 14lactone saccharolactone 6succinic acid reaching 065g100m l after 10 days 4lactic acid 5 peaking after three days of fermentation when other acids required 15 days 2 resulting in around 001g100m l after 12 days 2gluconic acid 5 reaching 020g100m l after 10 days 4glucuronic acid produced from glucose in the medium 7 reaching 038g100m l after 10 days 4 although elsewhere a plateau of 023g100m l has been noted around 712 days 2 7usnic acid 8 5citric acid has been noted to transiently occur after three days fermentation less than 001g100m l although its undetectable after 12 days 2carbon dioxide produced from the acetic acid via bacteria produced which separates the pellicle from the broth and creates an anaerobicserumstarved environment 2studies comparing the fermentation of green tea and black tea by the same fungal and bacterial colonies have failed to find any significant differences in the production of acids aside from possibly more acetic acid with green tea relative to black tea 2the fungal fermentation that produces kombucha creates a large variety of small acidic compounds with the most notable one thought to mediate the detoxification effects being dsaccharic acid 14lactone saccharolactone12 known contaminants kombucha is known to have a somewhat specific processing method and similar to most fermentation products requiring heat there is a possibility for contamination during the cooling phase 9the formation of alcohol during the fermentation process is necessary for the production of acetic acid and while the alcohol content of kombucha is usually under 1 after fermentation 9 excessive fermentation for one month has been noted to raise it up to 3 10 commercial products tend to have less than 05 alcohol content to avoid being mandated as an alcoholcontaining product 9overfermentation of kombucha during the standard 710 day period is possible if not refrigerated soon after which may cause an elevation of acetic acid levels above what is desirable 9 acetic acid has the potential to leech metals from the container in which kombucha is fermented so care should be taken to ferment kombucha in nonmetallic containers 9improper processing of kombucha either contamination or by needlessly prolonging the fermentation period is known to cause bacterial and fungal overgrowth and has been noted to covert kombucha into a toxic food product13 physicochemical properties the brewing of kombucha from teas of camellia sinensis green or black results in a p h around 5 which can be reduced to around 25 variable between 2328 after one week 9 7 the increase in acidity occurring within one day of fermentation 1 is due to production of organic acids during bacterial fermentation 9 although a perfect correlation does not exist between p h and organic acid content thought to be due to some buffering agents in the medium 7  this is necessary for proper fermenting since it as well as antimicrobial metabolites produced from the tea are thought to prevent competing bacterial and fungal strains from contaminating the final product 1the p h of the final product is increased acidity reduced after 12 days perhaps explaining why traditional fermentation is halted at around this time 2 it is also around this time that sucrose continually produced into increasing quantities of fructose and glucose reaches peak levels where afterwards they decline 714 formulations and variants the standard processing of kombucha starts with boiling of water and adding both the tea and sugar to steep for 10 minutes although unlike other teas which would be drunk at this stage manufacturing kombucha requires that the tea leaves be removed and an inoculum bacteria and fungi which would conduct the fermentation be added this is then left to ferment at room temperature over the course of 710 days and then refrigerated 9the yeast tends to proliferate after two to four days fermentation when the p h drops with levels of yeast in the pellicle removed from final product spiking after four days and remaining steady until the end of standard fermentation 10 days where a slight decline is seen 1if not consumed locally kombucha is then packaged with additional measures taken to prevent excessive microbial growth pasteurization or addition of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate for example 92pharmacology21 phase ii enzyme interactions it has been hypothesized that kombucha can increase glucuronidation in the body after ingestion either directly by providing dietary glucuronic acid 7 or secondary to inhibiting the βglucuronidase enzyme which hydrolyzes the bond between glucuronide and its conjugation target 6 dsaccharic acid 14lactone saccharolactone is a competitive inhibitor of βglucuronidase with an ic 50 of 36µm 11 and exerts complete inhibition at 1m m 12 fecal βglucuronidase is inhibited in both healthy controls and in subjects with colon cancer who have elevated βglucuronidase concentrations 13 at a concentration of 30150µgm l 14the inhibition of βglucuronidase and supposed augmentation of glucuronic acids conjugation ability seen with saccharolactone is thought to also underly the detoxifying anticancer properties of kombucha by facilitating the elimination of toxic substances from the body 15 similar to the mechanism of calciumdglucarate the detoxifying properties of kombucha refer to the ability of some acids produced during the fermentation process to increase glucuronidation in the human body which is involved in eliminating some drugs and xenobiotics from the body by conjugating them3inflammation and immunology31 immunosuppression when tested in vitro in lymphocytes exposed to γradiation kombucha at 2501000µl in whole blood samples prior to irradiation appeared to dosedependently preserve lymphocyte chromosomal structure reaching approximately 50 preservation relative to control 16 kombucha at 1000µl by itself did not alter lymphocyte structure without any irradiation relative to control 16the antioxidative properties of kombucha appear to preserve white blood cell integrity in vitro when exposed to radiation which is an expected effect from antioxidant compounds practical significance of this information is not known4peripheral organ systems41 liver a study of male rats examined the protective effects of black tea from camellia sinensis or kombucha prepared from the aforementioned batch of black tea to ccl 4 induced hepatotoxicity it found that doses of both black tea and kombucha of 25m lkg for 30 days prior to preventative or alongside curative induced hepatotoxicity were protective as assessed by liver enzymes and malondialdehyde in the liver but the reductions noted with black tea 5074 in preventative and 6165 in curative were less than kombucha 7583 and 7076 respectively 4protective effects from kombucha have been noted elsewhere in rats against acetominopheninduced liver toxicity 17 and isolated liver cells subject to oxidative death via tbhp 18 thought to be due to the dsaccharic acid 14lactone content of the tea which may function through antioxidation or by increasing the glucuronidation and elimination of toxic substances through inhibiting βglucuronidase 17 this substance alone is also known to exert hepatoprotective effects 19kombucha at least when given to rodents appears to be beneficial in reducing toxicity of known stressors on the liver this is likely due to the saccharolactone content and is thought to be due to either antioxidative mechanisms or increased glucuronidation of toxins perhaps a combination of both while the protective effects are thought to be due to a combination of antioxidative mechanisms plus the potential increase in glucuronidation of the toxins via saccharolactone the toxic effects of kombucha thought to be due to improper preparation can manifest themselves as hepatotoxicity 20 or gastrointestinal toxicity 21when kombucha is improperly processed the potential benefits are lost and ingestion will result in hepatotoxicity instead of hepatoprotection5safety and toxicology51 case studies kombucha in general appears to be associated with numerous case studies where the subject was harmed these instances include an increase in oral intake from 4oz to 14oz in a person making kombucha at home this person may have had a predisposition to acidosis resulting in death 9 death has been reported in other instances 22 and there exist numerous cases of nonlethal hepatoxicity 23 20 instances of gastrointestinal toxicity with and without jaundice 21 cutaneous anthrax 23 unspecified acute illness resulting in hospitalization 22 and acute renal failure 24based on these case studies it has been suggested to limit daily kombucha ingestion to 4oz 125m l 9 or to omit it fully due to the risk of contamination from nonsterile production 25kombucha tea can be produced safely but even then the recommended intake of safelyproduced tea is still quite low half of a metric cup such a low dose may preclude the health benefits seen in rat studies and expected to occur with the dsaccharic acid 14lactone content kombucha also carries the possibility to exert a wide variety of negative effects due to mishandling of the fungal and bacterial strains used in its production scientific
