what thyroid nodules not to biopsy according to ultrasound criteria do we need more uncertainty may 1 2009topic s onographic appearance of cystic thyroid nodules title partially cystic thyroid nodules on ultrasound probability of malignancy and sonographic differentiation authors lee mj kim ek kwak jy  kim mj reference thyroid 19 341346 2009summary background thyroid nodules are very common and a large portion of them are mixed echoic with both solid and cystic areas purpose to evaluate the frequency of malignancy in mixed echoic thyroid nodules and ascertain the ultrasound findings that help distinguish benign from malignant nodules methods among 1056 thyroid nodules undergoing ultrasound with fnab 392 nodules 371 were mixed echoic from this group the nodules that were read as benign or malignant on histopathology examination after surgery and the nodules that were not resected but were considered benign or malignant on cytology were analyzed retrospectively for their ultrasonographic features the nodules were divided into 3 groups group 1  n  93 included nodules in which the solid portion was 50 group 2  n  216 comprised nodules in which the solid portion was 50 and group 3  n  26 included mixed echoic spongy nodules the solid portion of the nodule namely its position eccentric or not shape margin and echogenicity and whether there were micromacrocalcifications were also analyzed results in the fna sample 52 nodules were inadequate for cytological diagnosis and the remaining 340 867 were adequate eighteen nodules were malignant and 317 benign yielding a malignancy rate of 54 by group the malignancy rate was 22 in group 1 74 in group 2 and 0 in group 3 there were more malignancies in group 2 than in the other groups p  004 among the sonographic findings eccentric placement p  0007 and presence of microcalcifications p 0001 were significantly correlated with malignancy conclusions about 5 of partially cystic nodules in this series were malignant when more than 50 of the nodule is solid and the solid portion of the nodule is eccentric the risk of malignancy is higher as has been noted for completely solid nodules microcalcifications were associated with increased risk of malignancy commentary this investigation provides another ultrasonographic us clue that enhances assessing the risk of cancer among thyroid nodules and may improve needle biopsy by revealing where to puncture a complex nodule the authors examined retrospectively us features of 392 thyroid nodules that had solid and cystic components for characteristics that were predictive of malignancy and assessed the prevalence of thyroid cancer in that population they report that there is an increased risk of cancer in a complex nodule when us reveals that more than 50 of the nodule is solid and the solid portion of the nodule is eccentric the article can also be interpreted as showing where and possibly when not to biopsy and this aspect is the particular focus of present comment the difference between these two approaches results in a big difference in the risk of missing a cancer the difference is similar to misjudging that a dog will bite and giving it wide berth to avoid getting bitten and mistaking that a dog does not bite and getting mauled using us as a reason not to biopsy may result in missing an unusual cancer and can complicate patient’s management informed consent third party decisions of medical necessity and tort physicians and patients have been educated that ultrasoundguided fnab of thyroid nodules is the goldstandard of triage for cancer and thyroid surgery however some specialists in imaging are now advocating that based on us criteria there are “ leave me alone nodules ” that do not require biopsy or further treatment see moon wj et al in acta radiologica 2516 2009 their opinion derives from us characteristics associated with low cancerrisk that include hyperechogenicity spongiform appearance napoleon pastrylike layering of sheets of increased and decreased echoes and comet tail appearance of a bright spot lesions that meet these criteria probably are a colloid nodule or nodular hyperplasia and that is useful to know the associations for the population that has been investigated are reasonably robust but the supporting data were mainly retrospective and drawn from lowpowered statistics they are therefore imperfect especially when applied to a single patient the rationale behind not biopsying such nodules is that fewer biopsies will lead to less delay of the ‘truly necessary’ biopsies less falsepositives fewer surgical operations and reduced costs these goals are understandable but the predicament is that cancer in a goiter or thyroiditis or in a small portion of a degenerated hemorrhagic complex nodule is difficult to identify and constitutes a wellknown clinical trap creating an ultrasound image is an art interpreting it is subjective and making it relevant for specific patientencounter remains a clinician’s challenge well structured properly powered and prospective investigation of the specificity and accuracy of us features that permit deselection for biopsy are required before observations can be extrapolated into management such triage of thyroid cancernonrisk is premature and is an entirely different philosophy from using us to support performing a biopsy of nodules that exhibit features that correlate more highly with malignancy complex nodules remain a conundrum and this writer believes that as much of the solid portion as possible should be sampled especially the parts that meet lee’s criteria in summary we should not use tentative data from limited investigation to make a pivotal decision not to biopsy certain thyroid nodules and selection against surgery there is a relatively simple reasonably safe inexpensive and more reliable protocol use the us to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of biopsying nodules
