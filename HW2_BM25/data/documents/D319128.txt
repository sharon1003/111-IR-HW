physics waves wave speed wave speed a wave is defined as a disturbance which is moved medium for example the wave of the ocean moves in medium water and we can see the movement of wave crest from one side to the other side in a given time period the motion of objects is described in terms of speed which shows the fastness of the object speed is the covered distance per units of time the general mathematical formula of speed is distance divided by time for example if a crest of wave is covered distance of 30 meter in 10 sec then the sped of wave is 3 m per sec but if other crest covered 35 meter in 10sec then its speed is 35 ms thus we can see that fast wave is covered long distance in the same time period we know that frequency of wave is the number count of waves in the gives point of time it also affects the speed of wave let’s discuss wave speed examples and how frequency can affects the speed of wave as with the particle the waves too have speed if we observe the sea waves we see that the crests and troughs travel the distance from one point of another sometimes they travel faster which means that the wave reaches to the shore quickly while other time it is too slow to reach the shores wave speed definition back to top the wave speed is measured as the distance travelled by the crests or trough in a given time interval the relationship is similar to the relationship of speed distance and time in the classical physics speed of the wave  distance travelled by crest or trough of the wave t  time taken to travel the distance this equation is the speed of any particle according to the classical theory of physics and it is equally applicable to the waves due to their dual nature wave speed formula back to top as we know that the distance travelled by the wave can be obtained in terms of its wavelength and hence we can say that the distance travelled by the wave is equal to the number of wave length  it covers and the inverse of the time is taken to be the frequency f then the above equation can be rewritten asthis equation is known as wave speed formula or wave speed equation t ake an example to understand the wave speed better you are at the peak of a mountain and you shout loudly your name facing the valley the valley between the peak of mountains is 175 meters deep after around 1 sec you hear your echo would you be able to tell the speed of the sound the answer is 350 msec i know you are surprised now that how is it possible the answer to this question is for finding the speed of the sound waves we need to calculate total distance traveled by the sound waves before you hear back your echo that distance is two times the distance from peak of mountain to the valley and hence the speed is 350 msec does frequency affect wave speed back to top the speed of the wave is not affect by its wavelength and its frequency rather the speed of wave is not affected by the characteristics of the wave but by the characteristics of the medium in which it is traveling so the answer to an obvious question “ does frequency affect wave speed “ is that the wave speed is not affected by the frequency of the wave for a sound wave the denser the medium the faster the wave will travels while the light travels at slow speed in the denser medium factors affecting wave speed we know that each particle vibrate in a medium by itself the phenomenon of wave is produced by the fact that each and every particle in the medium is connected to its neighbor s by some bond like elastic forces the speed of the wave through the medium is determined by a competition between two factors the elasticity factor  in the medium with high density the particles are bonded more closely and hence the wave travels at the faster rate in these mediums the inertia factor  when the density is high it is very difficult to avoid the effect of inertia between the particles and hence they compromised the speed gains due to the denser medium the speed of wave is the trade off between these two factors of the medium in which wave is traveling for example the equation for speed of the wave in a stretched string is where  tension force  linear mass density electromagnetic wave speed back to top the electromagnetic waves by nature have speed equal to thespeed of the light ie ms depending upon the medium the speed may vary but the variation is very less in comparison to their high magnitude since the radio waves also comes in the category of the electromagnetic wave and hence radio wave speed is also equivalent to the speed of light wave propagation speed back to top the wave propagation speed is the speed by which the wavefront of the wave passes through a medium the wavefront is the locus of the same phase point in the wave it is also known as velocity factor vf the velocity factor has different equation for different medium in optical fiber it is the reciprocal of the refractive index of the medium it is also equal to the square root of the dielectric constant of the material velocity factor  velocity factor  where k  dielectric constant of the medium c  speed of light l  inductance c  capacitance there are few other types of velocities associated with the wave namely1 group velocity it is the velocity with which the amplitude of the wave travels in the medium it is given by the formulaso it can also be defined as the rate of change of the angular frequency of the wave with respect to the angular wave number of the wave2 phase velocity it is the velocity with which one of the phase of the wave travels in the medium it is given by the formula   wherev p  phase velocity   angular frequency k  wave number calculating wave speed back to top let us find the methods by which we can calculate wave speed solved examples question 1 calculate the velocity of a water wave if the frequency is 400 hz the wavelength is 6 m and the amplitude of the wave is 376 cm solution we know that the distance travelled by the wave in one complete cycle is 6 m and it completes 400 cycles per second so the velocity of the wave is given byv  400 6v  2400 msecv  24 kmsec question 2 a sound wave is travelling with a speed of 343 ms calculate its frequency if the wavelength of the wave is 500m solution we know that the speed of the wave is related to the frequency and wavelength asso 0686 per sec so the frequency of the sound wave is 0686 cycle per second which means that it is covering only 0686 of its wavelength in one second amplitude of a wave wavelength related topics physics help physics tutor
