 note you must read only those linked materials that are preceded by the capitalized word read  immanuel kant the categorical imperative an ethics of duty for kant the basis for a theory of the good lies in the intention or the will those acts are morally praiseworthy that are done out of a sense of duty rather than for the consequences that are expected particularly the consequences to self the only thing good about the act is the will the good will that will is to do our duty what is our duty it is our duty to act in such a manner that we would want everyone else to act in a similar manner in similar circumstances towards all other people kant expressed this as the categorical imperative act according to the maxim that you would wish all other rational people to follow as if it were a universal law for kant the good involves the principle of universalizabilitykant argues that there can be four formulations of this principle the formula of the law of nature act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature the formula of the end itself act in such a way that you always treat humanity whether in your own person or in the person of any other never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end the formula of autonomy so act that your will can regard itself at the same time as making universal law through its maxims the formula of the kingdom of ends so act as if you were through your maxims a lawmaking member of a kingdom of ends never treat a person as a means to an end persons are always ends in themselves we must never use or exploit anyone for whatever purpose the categorical imperative is not the golden rule kant’s deontology is presented in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals kant in his critique of practical reason wanted to find a basis for ethics that would be based on reason and not on a faith in a god or in some cold calculation of utility that might permit people to be used for the benefit of the majority kant thought carefully about what it is that all humans would find reasonable as a guide for human conduct people think it wrong to kill lie steal and break promises why is this so kant arrives at the idea that humans think these acts wrong because they cannot will that others would do these things because it would mean the end of civilized life perhaps even the life of the actor contemplating the right way to behave one can not will that people lie all the time for that would mean the end to human communications if we could not trust what was said to be true most if not all of the time kant thought that there would be perfect and imperfect duties perfect duty is that which we are all obliged to do all of the timeeg no killing no physically harming others no lies no theft no breaking promises imperfect duties are those which we should do as often as possible but can not be expected to do always eg be charitable lovingcomplete overview of kant and the ethics of

receiving end of like action make it permissible if masochists are willing to suffer others sadism would that make sadism right more generally can acceptance of being on the receiving end of like action legitimate anything kants improvement on the golden rule the categorical imperative act as you would want all other people to act towards all other people act according to the maxim that you would wish all other rational people to follow as if it were a universal law the difference is this with the golden rule a masochist or a sadist would be justified in causing or receiving pain this is not what the kantian principle would support from don berkich some make the mistake of thinking that the first formulation of the categorical imperative is but a badly worded version of the biblical golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you nothing could be further from the truth the golden rule as kant well knew is a deeply misguided ethical principle to see this consider the following somewhat salacious example the horny martin example suppose that martin is 20 yearold college student suppose further that martin has never been out on a date the woman of his dreams finally agrees to go out with him so martin gets all dressed up and takes her out to a nice dinner after which they drive up to lookout point and martin does unto others as he would have done unto himselfwith disastrous consequences because the same result cannot be obtained by application of the categorical imperative it follows that the golden rule and the categorical imperative are notextensionally equivalent the categorical imperative is not the golden rule problems with kant”s theory1 the theory applies only to rational agents it would not apply to nonhumans or to humans who are not rational eg humans with brain malfunctioning illness or persistent vegetative coma2 the theory cannot resolve conflicts between dutiesa between two perfect dutiesb between a perfect duty and an imperfect duty how would a person resolve a conflict between two perfect duties such as never tell a lie and avoid harming someone what if telling the truth were to harm someone how would you resolve the conflict between the perfect duty say to keep a promise to pick your friend up with you auto at a certain time and an imperfect duty say to stop on the way to pick up your friend in order to give cpr to someone a stranger and save that stranger’s life3 a clever person could phrase the maxim to be universalized in such a manner as to permit almost anything by placing qualifiers on the maxim or peculiar definitions on terms a clever actor could satisfy the categorical imperative and yet be acting in a manner otherwise not consistent with it what if someone were to promise to be faithful to his mate and not have sex with another woman then that person engages in oral and anal forms of physical interaction leading to orgasm and yet thinks that the promise was not broken because the meaning of “sex” did not include those forms of interaction resources and suggested readings on kant glossary of kant’s terms kant links· groundwork for the metaphysics of morals gr groundwork for the
