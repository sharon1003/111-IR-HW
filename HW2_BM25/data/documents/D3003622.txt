good question how much should i pay for a couch alec sep 27 2005share email dear at la how much should a good couch cost there are so many options and prices out there i just dont know where to begin thanks w a w dear w a w well break it up into three basic categories if you cant spend more than 500 or so we think vintage is the way to go if you allow your style to be open you can find some great mostly 50s and 60 pieces that were built when construction and staying power mattered we do not recommend the ikea route as we have tried this with a funky 400 white leather couch that lost its shape within months if youve got a grand or more we suggest looking into the bigger stores like room and board crate and barrel et al and wait for the sale we got a stunning slate grey sectional in the sale corner at civilization a few weeks ago for 1500 well worth it if you have some cash we do think that a good couch is worth the investment usually for around 25003000 you can get a beauty look for things like kilndried frames handtied springs and downwrapped foam cushions hope this helps note include a pic of your problem and your question gets posted first you might also like20 smart ways to organize your bedroom closet the best thing you can do for your bathroom for 25what not to do when decluttering your home the home mistake we keep seeing over and over again save this story share email17 comment sae 13 years ago i bought the neo three seater from dwr great sofa and very well made if you are looking for something around 3000 you should definitely take a look flag reply ap 13 years ago enrique thanks for the tips pcc is this weekend and ill be sure to be there flag reply cr 13 years ago enrique thanks for letting me know about the c  b connection with mitchell gold  it explains why i like their furniture so much but cant afford it i love everything about c  b flag reply show 14 more comments join the conversationenter your email to sign in or to create an account next need help click here
