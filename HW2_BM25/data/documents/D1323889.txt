shorten pulling chromatids towards opposite ends of the cell anaphase the cell begins to lengthen telophase a nuclear membrane forms around chromatin telophase chromosomes begin to unwind telophase spindle fibers begin to break down telophase two identical nuclei form prophase copied dna condenses into chromosomes prophase the nucleolus disappears and the nuclear membrane breaks down prophase spindle fibers begin to form cell cycle process of cellular reproduction occurring in three main stages  interphase growth mitosis nuclear division and cytokinesis cytoplasm divisionchromatin relaxed form of dna in the nucleus of a cell chromosome dnacontaining structure that carries genetic material from one generation to another cytokinesis third main stage of the cell cycle during which the cells cytoplasm divides creating a new cell interphase first stage of the cell cycle during which a cell grows matures and replicates its dnamitosis second main stage of the cell cycle during which the cells replicated dna divides and two genetically identical diploid daughter cells are produced anaphase third stage of mitosis in which sister chromatids are pulled apart and microtubules along with motor proteins move the chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell centromere cell structure that joins two sister chromatids metaphase second stage of mitosis in which motor protons pull sister chromatids to the cells equator prophase first stage of mitosis during which the cells chromatin condenses into chromosomes sister chromatid structure that contains identical dna copies and is formed during dna replication spindle apparatus structure made of spindle fibers centrioles and aster fibers that is involved in moving and organizing chromosomes before the cell divides telophase last stage of mitosis in which nucleoli reappear two new nuclear membranes begin to form but the cell has not yet completely divided apoptosis programmed cell death cancer uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can be caused by changes in control of the cell cycle and may be caused by environmental factors carcinogen cancercausing substance cyclin one of the specific proteins that regulate the cell cycle cyclindependent kinase enzyme to which cyclin binds during interphase and mitosis triggering and controlling activities during the cell cycle stem cell unspecialized cell that can develop into a specialized cell under the right conditions cell cycle the stages that take place between the time a eukaryotic cell divides and the time the daughter cells divide stages of growth preparation and division interphase and mitosiscancer a malignant growth or tumor caused by abnormal uncontrolled cell division interphase cell grows performs its normal functions and prepares for division consists of g1 s and g2 phases period of normal growth and maintenance 3 stagesg1 in interphase  cell grows rapidly builds new organelles also performs regular cell functions s phase the synthesis phase of the cell cycle the portion of interphase during which dna is replicated doubles each chromosomesg2 final preparation phase cell checks for dna errors and begins to form centrosomes prepares for mitosismitosis 1 diploid parent cell splits into 2 identical diploid daughter cells in order to grow why do cells divide to make more cells instead of just getting bigger reason  1 large cells would have to wait too long to diffuse nutrients in and waste out in order to grow why do cells divide to make more cells instead of just getting bigger reason  2 one set of dna cant make enough proteins and enzymes fast enough for a large cell in order to grow why do cells divide to make more cells instead of just getting bigger reason  3 the volume of a cell increases a lot faster than the membrane too much volume for the surface area and the cell membrane will burst prophase nucleolus has disappeared and duplicated chromosomes are visible centrosomes begin moving apart and spindle is in process of forming prophase the chromosomes coil up and become visible while the nuclear envelope disappears sister chromatids are present a centriole forms at each pole and spindle fibers made of microtubules grow out of it short microtubules stick out from the centriole in a star shape known as an aster metaphase centromeres of duplicated chromosomes are aligned at plate fully formed spindle attach to the sister chromatids from opposite poles metaphase second phase of mitosis during which the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell anaphase third phase of mitosis in which sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell anaphase the kinetochores reel in or gobble up the spindle fibers this pulls the sister chromatids apart by splitting their centromere the split chromatids are pulled towards opposite poles of the cell telophase the fourth and final stage of mitosis in which nuclei are forming and cytokinesis has typically begun telophase chromosomes become indistinct daughter cells are forming once the chromatids have reached the opposite sides the spindle fibers disappear the chromosomes unravel nuclear envelope reappears on the two new nuclei cytokinesis the cytoplasm forms a cleavage furrow at the equator to split the cytoplasm in plants a cell plate forms at the equator chromatids bodies of tightly coiled chromatin visible during cell division two chromatids bound at a centromere make a chromosome spindle fibers special strands of microtubules which grow out of the centrioles connect to chromosomes at the centromeres and pull them apart during anaphase of mitosis chromosomes dna that is coiled together and condensed into small packages like dna suitcases each has 23 from mom 23 from dad consists of 2 sister chromatids bound at a centromere chromatin unpackaged unwound dna in the nucleus of a cell centromere holds sister chromatids together metaphase prophase anaphase telophase interphaselongest part of cell cycle when cells grow develop and duplicate dna and organelles to prepare for mitosis cell cycle consists of these three phases interphase mitosis and cytokinesis phase of cell cycle that is much longer than the other three interphasecell growth and development duplicating dna and organelles to get ready for division part of cell cycle that is the shortest after mitosis is complete cytokinesiscytokinesis occurs after telophase after mitosis is complete to complete the cell cycle cytokinesis
