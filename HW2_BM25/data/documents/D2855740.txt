swimmers use the front crawl i am guessing the front crawl would be more efficient in terms of energyspeed ratiopermalink embed save parent – hollowdh 3 points 4 years agomarathon swimmers use front crawl due to the speed by comparison side stroke to freestyle front crawl would be similar to walking a marathon vs running one i supposepermalink embed save parent – mystery thrill  s 3 points 4 years ago ohk so i suppose the marathon swimmers have slightly modified the front crawl to be able to swim long distances so are there any articles that teach marathon swimming strokemarathon front crawlpermalink embed save parent – the great cthulhu channel swimmer 2 points 4 years ago theres no such thing as marathon front crawl theres a lot of training and also working on stroke problems which might cause injury on long swims also check this weeks open water wednesday where stroke isnt mentioned you can check my site one of the few times ive written about strokes specifically are the problems of total immersion in long distance swimming specifically to your question front crawl is best for long distance as it maintains stroke rate which aids thermogenesis heat generation while reducing exposure to adverse conditions all contingent on training of course any exception to fc is where the swimmer has also trained for another stroke as people do swim marathons distances in breaststroke fly  backstroke bc being the rarestpermalink embed save parent – normaversion moist 3 points 4 years ago coincidentally here is some of the worst advice ever published about open water swimminghttpwwwswimwellblogcomarchives2008a longer lowertempo hipdriven freestyle is a clear advantage in 50m pools distances over 200 yards and especially in open water ignore terry laughlin listen to paul newsome andor gerry rodriguezpermalink embed save parent – mystery thrill  s 1 point 4 years ago it sounds intuitive though relaxing in the water and using the least amount of energy should be able to get you long distances without tiring shouldnt itpermalink embed save parent – normaversion moist 2 points 4 years ago in calm warm water and if time is no object  yes in cold andor rough water andor if you actually want to be fast  nopermalink embed save parent – mystery thrill  s 1 point 4 years ago i am reading the articles so marathon front crawl is the same regular front crawl used for competition how to improve breathing technique i breathe every third stroke and breathe continuously yet after 300m i start panting and i need to back float to catch my breathe i just dont seem to get past the 300m markpermalink embed save parent – the great cthulhu channel swimmer 3 points 4 years ago yes relax work on rotation and keeping a long stroke do plenty of drill work look at the drill of the week link in the sidebar and especially the very first drill for front crawl which is a rotation drill which looks easy but is one of the most important for all levelspermalink embed save parent – pillowsnack 1 point 4 years ago why dont you breathe every second stroke when you obviously run out of air when breathing every third stroke alternatively mix it up a bit twice on one side three strokes twice on the other side etcpermalink embed save parent – mystery thrill  s 1 point 4 years ago i meant i breathe regularly i tried breathing every second stroke it didnt work i run out of air even if i breathe every single stroke only in backstroke the problems not there i guess its due to the changing of the normal breathing rhythm since you need to breathe consciously and theres a time between every inhale and exhale cycle so what do marathoners do for breathe trainingpermalink embed save parent – tazunemono moist 1 point 4 years ago we just swim youre going too fast and hitting the red slow down and youll be finepermalink embed save parent – tazunemono moist 1 point 4 years ago you are swimming too fast  slow down you dont need as much o2 as you think you do most breathing problems are related to having xs co2 work on string exhalation into waterpermalink embed save parent – hollowdh 1 point 4 years ago i dont know of any articles off the top of my head but from my experience as a competitive swimmer a large part of the key to stroke efficiency when it comes to front crawl is in the beat of your kick if you watch a sprinter and count his kicks you will find that many will use a 6 or 8 beat kick and you will notice a minute break before they reset their cycle watch a marathon swimmer and you will find they use a 2 or 4 beat kick some use 3 stroke frequency is also key in efficiency i am no good at explaining it so you should definitely look for some detailed articles on it i personally take slower longer deliberate strokes and it is not efficient at all but it is powerful and i like itpermalink embed save parent
