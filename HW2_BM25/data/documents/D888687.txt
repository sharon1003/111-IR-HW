david brewster brewster sir david1781–1868 scottish physicist and natural philosopher he is noted especially for his research into the polarization of light the invention of the kaleidoscope was one result of his studies click the link for more informationin 1816 the device is usually a handheld tube a few inches to as much as twelve feet in length and looks like a smalltelescope at one end of the tube is an eyepiece at the other end colored chips of glass are looselysandwiched between two glass disks between the ends of the tube are two rectangular planemirrors the long edge of one of the two mirrors lies against the long edge of the other at an angletheir intersection lying close to the axis of the tube the glass chips form patterns where they lieand these patterns change as the chips fall into new positions when the tube rotates each patternundergoes multiple reflections in the mirrors in such a way as to produce a resulting symmetricalpattern as seen through the eyepiece the worlds largest kaleidoscope located in mt tremper n y is 64 ft 195 m tall there is no eyepiece people stand inside the base to view the image which is projected downward onto threereflective panels to

containing three longitudinally arranged reflecting plates that are mounted at an angle of 60° to one another at one end the tube is closed by a piece of frosted glass on which are scatteredfragments of multicolored glass that are separated from the remaining tube space by a piece of clear glass at the other end there is a cap with a round viewing hole upon rotation of the tubewhich is held horizontally the fragments are scattered around forming colored patterns in thetriangular central portion of the field of view bordered by the three mirrors the reflections of thepatterns in the mirror plates create a colored triradially symmetrical design which is repeated threemore times along the edges of the field of view the kaleidoscope was invented in 1817 by the english physicist d
