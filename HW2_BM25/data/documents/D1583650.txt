current articles  archives  search motivational interviewing in advising working with students to change robert f pettay kanas state university there is a metaphor about the individual who walks down a street falls in a hole in the sidewalk gets up and then does it again and again initially the individual feels no responsibility for the outcome then enlightenment comes and the individual simply chooses to walk down another street to get to the same destination this metaphor reminds me of students who visit with advisors yet continue to engage in behaviors detrimental to academic success even after advisors recommend different directions the students continue to miss classes utilize poor study habits and employ poor selfmanagement skills then they are surprised to find themselves on continued academic probation or returning from prior academic dismissal to experience the same outcome is there some way advisors can help these students overcome their ambivalence to change and initiate a new type of behavior prescriptive advising is based on authority with the primary responsibility for the dispensing of information and the prescribing of remedies for problems falling to advisors winston  sandor 1984 but advice and information are only effective if the individuals receiving them actually internalize and engage in the behaviors being prescribed compare this approach to developmental advising which involves the facilitation of rational processes environmental and interpersonal interactions behavioral awareness problemsolving decision making and evaluation skills crookston 1972 the developmental approach encourages the use of a variety of communication and motivational skills including motivational interviewing motivational interviewing mi as defined by miller and rollnick 1991 is a directive clientcentered counseling technique for eliciting behavior change by helping clients explore and resolve ambivalence this method has the advisor leading the session in a way that is subtle gentle responsive and imaginative as opposed to prescribing a solution to solve a problem the implicit theory behind motivational interviewing is that mi will lead to an increase in client in our case student change talk and diminish student resistance the extent to which a student defends the status quo will be inversely related to behavior change and the extent to which a student verbally argues for change will be directly related to behavior change for an advisee to initiate productive behaviors the advisee must be ready able and willing to make a change motivational interviewing is based on four general principles expressing empathy developing discrepancy rolling with resistance and supporting selfefficacy empathy has been defined as experiencing an accurate understanding of the students awareness of his or her own experience to sense the students private world as if it were our own but without ever losing the as if quality rogers 1957 developing discrepancy involves helping the student recognize the difference between the current behavior and the desired behavior rolling with resistance requires the advisor to avoid arguing with the student but continue to use openended questions to draw the student back to the discrepancy in the current behavior perceived selfefficacy is defined as peoples beliefs about their capabilities to produce designated levels of performance that exercise influence over events that affect their lives bandura 1994 even when an advisee recognizes the need to change a current behavior actual change will require both a belief in the capability to engage in the new behavior and belief in the likelihood that this change will lead to a desired outcome one challenge to using motivational interviewing in the advising environment is maintaining the spirit of mi in the typical constraints of the environment the three characteristics that represent the spirit of mi include collaboration evocation and autonomy miller  rollnick 2002 collaboration involves setting a nonjudgmental supportive environment conducive for selfexploration and evocation involves facilitation of the issues related to behavior change both pro and con autonomy involves respect for the students decisionmaking process as the student is the ultimate agent of change the advisor must establish principles for the use of mi that maintain the integrity of the concept but work within the time constraints and number of sessions available for working with the advisee on behavior change strategies for using mi in the advising setting vary one approach that has been used in the communitybased intervention field is to negotiate the students agenda rollnick asserts that starting with the students agenda for the session is an effective way to establish rapport and focus on student priorities rollnick mason  butler 1999 the advisor may state that the purpose of the meeting is to look at the reasons for academic dismissal but allow the student to talk about the main concerns he or she holds right now rather than try to choose an issue for the student another approach might include the use of a decisional balance scale worksheet to examine the pros and cons of the targeted behavior hecht borrelli breger de francesco ernst  resnicow 2005 with the student a final strategy may involve providing personal feedback to the advisee based on testing and monitoring results this approach would assist in helping the advisee develop awareness of the behavior and examine the discrepancy between the current behavior he or she is engaging in and the desired behavior and outcome motivational interviewing was developed to treat addictive behaviors but has also been found to be effective in changing health behaviors such as physical activity hecht et al 2005 dietary behaviors burke arkowitz  menchola 2003 and obesity carels et al 2007 advisors may recognize a number of advisee behaviors that may benefit from the use of mi poor study skills low engagement low academic selfefficacy and poor timemanagement skills all can negatively impact the academic success of students instead of handing materials to the student or giving advice in a prescriptive manner mi would allow the student and advisor to work in collaboration with the student choosing initial behavioral changes to improve the current situation these small first steps can lead to additional behaviors beneficial to the academic success of the student and this facilitative empathic approach can enhance the advisoradvisee relationship in future
