and google the google toolbar for internet explorer does more than give ie a mere shot of nitro with a set of features both useful and selfpromoting google toolbar 6 feels like it adds eight cylinders to ies engine turning it into a powerhouse of personalized functionality for both ie 8 users and those who are stuck on earlier versions theres the dedicated google search window the effective popup blocker the form autofiller the translation utility the spell checker and the map tool that automatically links addresses in web pages to maps then theres the full integration with the google suite google earth google news froogle google maps blogger and others every single one of the integrated tools including the toolbar itself is fully customizable new in version 6 is a slick redo of the translation tool allowing for oneclick translations of single words or entire web pages note that using advanced features such as page rank automatically sends the url of the site youre viewing back to googles servers this can be enabled or disabled during installation or at any time by clicking the toolbars options button unfortunately theres no way to remove the search bar which wasnt featured in ie 6 but came standard in ie 7 and duplicates ies own search bar still by permanently setting the two search bars to different engines you can at least avoid a waste of space you can even use the google toolbar without a google account but considering all that comes with it why would youread more publishers description from google google toolbar enhances internet explorer with a google search
