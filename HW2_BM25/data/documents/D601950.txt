cannes attractions fort royal was once home to the infamous prisoner the man in the iron mask whose identity has been lost in time anthony peregrine  destination expert25 july 2017 • 100pm expert guide to cannes overview hotels attractions restaurants nightlife itineraries a n insiders guide to the best things to do and attractions in cannes including walking along la croisette viewing the palais des festivals and visiting fort royal by anthony peregrine telegraph travels cannes expert t here’s surprisingly little to do in cannes itself – no vital gallery outstanding historical monument or particularly vibrant memories of great former residents which might strike you as ideal it releases the visitor to do what he or she really wants to do – which is stroll around a bit shop a little and make full use of the farniente potential of the beach before retiring for drink food and whatever else the evening might promise having said that it helps to stroll with some particular destinations in mind more telegraph travel expert guides what to do la croisette this is the splendid promenade curving around the bay where at film festival time you might think you have spotted a star or two they’re usually lookalikes at other times it is the stage for the spectacle that is cannes with a sparkling acreage of briny out front and exotic greenery on the prom itself even ugly people look good this is the splendid promenade curving around the bay where at film festival time you might think you have spotted a star or two credit robert casacci  fotolia you’ll see beautiful youth handsome families and overtanned ladies with brushhead dogs still wearing furs in june the ladies that is not the dogs – though… weaving in and out will be joggers rollerbladers clowns on stilts and perhaps even a particularly impressive chap i once saw there he would light a cigarette place it in his mouth then on his tongue then swallow it and blow smoke out of his ears then pass the hat round palais des festivals despite its redcarpet fame as hq of the annual film thrash the palais des festivals used to have the architectural eloquence of a nuclear power station clearly whoever designed it didn’t much like cannes the seaside people beauty elegance or in all probability movie stars in recent times though its dull stone exterior has been turned bright white this is a serious improvement and a far better backdrop for photos of chaps in tuxedos and star ladies in shiny frocks palais des festivals has seen some serious improvement and is now a far better backdrop during the film festival credit credit john kellerman  alamy stock photojohn kellerman  alamy stock photo talking of whom… down the side of the building very many of the most prominent movie figures have left their handprints in coloured bricks set in the pavement frankly this allée des stars is looking a bit neglected now – it’s a collecting area for cigarette butts – but gradually they are replacing the brick handprints with stainless steel this is another good move the grand palace hotels more glorious to my mind are the palais’s immediate environs amble along the seafront and revel in a prospect which has been enchanting elites for generations the palace hotels line up like grandees on the other side of the road the majestic hotel and beyond it la malmaison a private 19thcentury mansion open to the public the belle époque carlton hotel the more modern palais stéphanie now known as the jw marriott incorporating the façade of the former palais des festivals pulled down in1988 after serving as the venue for the cannes film festival for 40 years and the art deco hotel martinez more glorious to my mind are the palais’s immediate environs amble along the seafront and revel in a prospect which has been enchanting elites for generations in between are gardens the odd playground and stretches of water where you may loose a child or a husband on the remotecontrolled boats pointe de la croisette by the time you arrive opposite the hotel martinez you’ve done the essentials of the stroll but i’d continue round the coast past the newish portcanto to the pointe de la croisette headland there used to be a little cross “une croisette” here protecting sailors setting out to sea hence the name of the headland and of the promenade the cross is no longer there’s a casino in its place that’s cannes in a nutshell le suquet before the great good and filthy rich discovered the place cannes was a small fishing village concentrated on suquet hill this rises quite sharply back from the port fishermen and associated folk lived doubtless tough lives in the wriggling labyrinth of sinuous streetlets and steep stairways the labyrinth survives of course – these days colonised by bars restaurants and shops selling mainly inessentials before the great good and filthy rich discovered the place cannes was a small fishing village concentrated on suquet hill credit nyiragongo  fotolia don’t complain and for heaven’s sake don’t say “touristy” for a start we’re all tourists secondly if you had told the fishermen that they could make a far better living flogging postcards and decorative earthenware they’d have dropped their nets in a flash anyway le suquet retains a certain atmosphere go in the morning or very late at night and you might still get a sense of the place and of the closeknittedness of lives lived there head in on rue st antoine and then wander the warren as you will musée de la castre a t the top of suquet hill this fine 11thcentury pile was once the landbased hq of the monks of lérins see below now it’s a diverting museum of eclectic collections – from archaeomaterial to musical instruments… and a firstclass assembly of ethnic art and artefacts from the five continents it’s well worth a look especially on the first sunday of the month from november to march when it’s free and the views from the top of the tower are outstanding if you can

€6 £5 €3 for under25s free for under18s and students under 26 ile stemarguérite some 10 to 15 minutes offshore from cannes lie the iles de lérins two lovely islands free from bling where you can breathe free and easy – ile stemarguérite and ile sthonorat ferries to the islands are based on quai laubeuf on the western side of the old port in cannes for annoying reasons too complex to go into you cannot take a round trip to both islands if you want to go from st honorat to ste marguérite or vice versa you must return to cannes and start again ile stemarguérite whose pine and eucalyptus aromas hit you the moment you step off the ferry is the larger of the two islands first port of call should be the island’s fort royal see below less fascinating to my mind is the adjacent musée de la mer – though if you’re passionate about marine archaeology you may disagree some 10 to 15 minutes offshore from cannes lie the iles de lérins two lovely islands free from bling where you can breathe free and easy credit copyright © alexis borgalexis borgi’d prefer to wander the forest and rocky edges of the island it’s easy to do – stemarguérite is but two miles long by half a mile across and the trails are well marked so it’s more of a park stroll than a country hike inebriating though with nice minicoves where you might settle with a picnic – by far the best bet there’s a handful of eateries on the island but i find them pricey riviera lines  rivieralinescom and trans côte d’azur  transcoteazurcom run regular trips from cannes to ile stemarguérite return fares €1350 adults €9 children aged 510 €1250 children aged 1114 over65s and students prices are a touch cheaper if booked ahead online fort royal like so many french coastal forts this one on the ile stemarguérite wasn’t much use for defence but proved an admirable prison – notably for the man in the iron mask he was banged up there for 10 years from 1687 nobody yet is sure who he was the adulterous brother of louis xiv a noble debtor the child of an affair between a black manservant and louis xiv’s wife the guesses go on…whatever the truth the mask’s cell has been preserved as have those of protestant pastors imprisoned for their faith during france’s religious wars they are fascinating contact fort royal 00 33 493 38 55 26 cannescom  ilestemarguérite opening times octobermay 1030am115pm 215pm445pm until

ile sthonorat with modesty in mind it still belongs to cistercian monks there are some 25 of them in the island monastery see below they allow us on if we dress decently don’t make too much noise and if possible buy something very expensive from the monastery shop in the middle ages the original monastery – founded in the fourth century by of course st honorat – was among the most important in christendom popes visited pilgrims rolled in and the monks effectively ran cannes from what is now the musée de la castre see above they also had a dickens of a job keeping pirates and saracens at bay the woodland and coastal wandering on ile sthonorat is quite as enjoyable as on stemarguérite look out for the many chapels which dot the landscape ferries for st honorat depart from the planaria
