emphasized personal and governmental morality correctness of social relationships justice and sincerity his followers competed successfully with many other schools during the hundred schools of thought era only to be suppressed in favor of the legalists during the qin dynasty following the victory of han over chu after the collapse of qin confuciuss thoughts received official sanction and were further developed into a system known in the west as neoconfucianism and later new confucianism modern neoconfucianism confucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the chinese classic texts including all of the five classics but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to confucius himself aphorisms concerning his teachings were compiled in the analects but only many years after his death confuciuss principles have commonality with chinese tradition and belief he championed strong family loyalty ancestor veneration and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives recommending family as a basis for ideal government he espoused the wellknown principle do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself the golden rule he is also a traditional deity in daoism throughout history confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in affecting the lives of humanity his teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and still linger in todays society 4 5 6contents  hide 1 name2 life21 early life22 political career23 exile24 return home3

confucius was born on september 28 551 bc 2 9 in the district of zou  鄒 邑 near presentday qufu china 9 10 the area was notionally controlled by the kings of zhou but effectively independent under the local lords of lu his father kong he  孔 紇 or shuliang he 叔梁紇 was an elderly commandant of the local lu garrison 11 his ancestry traced back through the dukes of song to the shang dynasty which had preceded the zhou 12 13 14 15 traditional accounts of confuciuss life relate that kong hes grandfather had migrated the family from song to lu 16kong he died when confucius was three years old and confucius was raised by his mother yan zhengzai  顏 徵 在 in poverty 17 his mother would later die at less than 40 years of age 17 at age 19 he married qiguan 亓官 and a year later the couple had their first child kong li 孔鯉 17 qiguan and confucius would later have two daughters together one of whom is thought to have died as a child 18confucius was educated at schools for commoners where he studied and learned the six arts 19confucius was born into the class of shi 士 between the aristocracy and the common people he is said to have worked in various government jobs during his early 20s and as a bookkeeper and a caretaker of sheep and horses using the proceeds to give his mother a proper burial 17 20 when his mother died confucius aged 23 is said to have mourned for three years as was the tradition 20political career a western han 202 bc  9 ad fresco depicting confucius and laozi  from a tomb of dongping county shandong province china in confuciuss time the state of lu was headed by a ruling ducal house 21 under the duke were three aristocratic families whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the lu bureaucracy the ji family held the position minister over the masses who was also the prime minister the meng family held the position minister of works and the shu family held the position minister of war in the winter of 505 bc yang hu—a retainer of the ji family—rose up in rebellion and seized power from the ji family however by the summer of 501 bc the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling yang hu from lu 22 by then confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government thus that year 501 bc confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town eventually he rose to the position of minister of crime 23confucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city—strongholds belonging to the three families this way he could establish a centralized government however confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself in 500 bc hou fan—the governor of hou—revolted against his lord of the shu family although the meng and shu families unsuccessfully besieged hou a loyalist official rose up with the people of hou and forced hou fan to flee to the qi state the situation may have been in favor for confucius as this likely made it possible for confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities eventually after a year and a half confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the shu family to raze the walls of hou the ji family in razing the walls of bi and the meng family in razing the walls of cheng first the shu family led an army towards their city hou and tore down its walls in 498 bc 24soon thereafter gongshan furao or buniu a retainer of the ji family revolted and took control of the forces at bi 25 26 he immediately launched an attack and entered the capital lu 24 earlier gongshan had approached confucius to join him which confucius considered even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution the ji family dominated the lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke although he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice confucius gave up on this idea in the end 25 creel 1949 states that unlike the rebel yang hu before him gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke 27 however dubs 1946 is of the view that gongshan was encouraged by viscount ji huan to invade the lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the bi fortified walls 26 whatever the situation may have been gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of lu even after he was forced to flee 27 28during the revolt by gongshan zhong you 仲由 had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court 28 zhong you was one of the disciples of confucius and confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the ji family 29 when confucius heard of the raid he requested that viscount ji huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds 30 thereafter the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the jis palace complex and ascended the wuzi terrace confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels 31 at least one of the two officers was a retainer of the ji family but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke viscounts and court 30 the rebels were pursued and defeated at gu immediately after the revolt was defeated the ji family razed the bi city walls to the ground 31the attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord through confuciuss actions the bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord thus forcing viscount ji huans hand in having to dismantle the walls of bi as it could have harbored such rebels or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official dubs 1949 suggests that the incident brought to light confuciuss foresight practical political ability and insight into human character 30when it was time to dismantle the city walls of the meng family the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the meng family not to do so 31 the zuo zhuan recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made cheng vulnerable to the qi state and cause the destruction of the meng family 30 even though viscount meng yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls 30later in 498 bc duke ding personally went with an army to lay siege to cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground but he did not succeed 32 thus confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke 33 he had made powerful enemies within the state especially with viscount ji huan due to his successes so far 34 according to accounts in the zuo zhuan and shiji confucius departed his homeland in 497 bc after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful ji meng and shu families 35 he left the state of lu without resigning remaining in selfexile and unable to return as long as viscount ji huan was alive 34exile this section

confucius was involved in the government of the lu state according to this account qi decided to sabotage lus reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of lu the duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave lu and seek better opportunities yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler confucius was serving confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake soon after the duke neglected to send to confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom and confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the lu state after confuciuss resignation he began a long journey or set of journeys around the principality states of northeast and central china including wey song zheng cao chu qi chen and cai and a failed attempt to go to jin  at the courts of these states he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented return home tomb of confucius in kong lin cemetery qufu shandong province according to the zuo zhuan confucius returned home to his native lu when he was 68 after he was invited to do so by ji kangzi the chief minister of lu 36 the analects depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 disciples and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the five classics during his return confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in lu including ji kangzi on matters including governance and crime 36burdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples he died at the age of 71 or 72 he died from natural causes confucius was buried in kong lin cemetery which lies in the historical part of qufu in the shandong province  citation needed the original tomb erected there in memory of confucius on the bank of the sishui river had the shape of an axe in addition it has a raised brick platform at the front of the memorial for offerings such as sandalwood incense and fruit philosophy main article confucianism the dacheng hall the main hall of the temple of confucius in qufu although confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the chinese many argue that its values are secular and that it is therefore less a religion than a secular morality proponents argue however that despite the secular nature of confucianisms teachings it is based on a worldview that is religious 37 confucianism discusses elements of the afterlife and views concerning heaven but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought such as the nature of souls however confucius is said to have believed in astrology saying heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly 38the analects of confucius in the analects confucius presents himself as a transmitter who invented nothing he puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study and it is the chinese character for study  學 that opens the text far from trying to build a systematic or formalist theory he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events as recorded in the annals or the past expressions of commoners feelings and noblemens reflections as in the poems of the book of odes  ethics one of the deepest teachings of confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior his moral teachings emphasized selfcultivation emulation of moral exemplars and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules confucian ethics may therefore be considered a type of virtue ethics his teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly through allusion innuendo and even tautology his teachings require examination and context to be understood a good example is found in this famous anecdote廄焚。子退朝，曰：“傷人乎？” 不問馬。when the stables were burnt down on returning from court confucius said was anyone hurt he did not ask about the horses analects x11 tr waley  10–13 tr legge  or x17 tr lauby not asking about the horses confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow confuciuss and to pursue selfimprovement if it would not have confucius serves not as an allpowerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles but rather the ultimate model for others for these reasons according to many commentators confuciuss teachings may be considered a chinese example of humanism one of his teachings was a variant of the golden rule sometimes called the  silver rule  owing to its negative form己所不欲，勿施於人。what you do not wish for yourself do not do to others 子貢問曰：“有一言而可以終身行之者乎？”子曰：“其恕乎！己所不欲、勿施於人。”zi gong a disciple asked is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life the master replied how about reciprocity never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself analects xv24 tr david hinton often overlooked in confucian ethics are the virtues to the self sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought which begins with knowledge a virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for ones own sake the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness the confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in lǐ  禮 is based on three important conceptual aspects of life a ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types b social and political institutions and c the etiquette of daily behavior it was believed by some that lǐ originated from the heavens but confucius stressed the development of lǐ through the actions of sage leaders in human history his discussions of lǐ seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony in the early confucian tradition lǐ was doing the proper thing at the proper time balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good training in the lǐ of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when lǐ must be adapted in light of situational contexts in confucianism the concept of li is closely related to yì  義  which is based upon the idea of reciprocity yì can be translated as righteousness though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context the term contrasts with action done out of selfinterest while pursuing ones own selfinterest is not necessarily bad one would be a better more righteous person if ones life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good thus an outcome of yì is doing the right thing for the right reason just as action according to lǐ should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to yì so yì is linked to the core value of rén  仁  rén consists of 5 basic virtues seriousness generosity sincerity diligence and kindness 39 rén is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling ones responsibilities toward others most often translated as benevolence or humaneness translator arthur waley calls it goodness with a capital g  and other translations that have been put forth include authoritativeness and selflessness confuciuss moral system was based upon empathy and understanding others rather than divinely ordained rules to develop ones spontaneous responses of rén so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of yì confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes for example the properly generous person gives the right amount—not too much and not too little 39politics confuciuss political thought is based upon his ethical thought he argued that the best government is one that rules through rites  lǐ and peoples natural morality and not by using bribery and coercion he explained that this is one of the most important analects if the people be led by laws and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of shame if they be led by virtue and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety they will have the sense of the shame and moreover will become good translated by james legge in the great learning  大學  this sense of shame is an internalisation of duty where the punishment precedes the evil action instead of following it in the form of laws as in legalism confucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days and urged the chinese particularly those with political power to model themselves on earlier examples in times of division chaos and endless wars between feudal states he wanted to restore the mandate of heaven  天命 that could unify the world  天下 all under heaven and bestow peace and prosperity on the people because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times confucius is often considered a great proponent of conservatism but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used and perhaps twisted past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own a revival of a unified royal state whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage these would be rulers devoted to their people striving for personal and social perfection and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules confucius did not believe in the concept of  democracy  which is itself an athenian concept unknown in ancient china but could be interpreted by confuciuss principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them or that anyone is capable of selfgovernment he expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves and that in his view since not everyone is created equal not everyone has a right of selfgovernment 40while he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers he argued for representing truth in language and honesty was of paramount importance even in facial expression truth must always be represented confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly by action that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler in discussing the relationship between a king and his subject or a father and his son he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors this demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong confucius believed in ruling by example if you lead correctly orders by force or punishment are not necessary 41legacy this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material

disciples and followers who organized his teachings into the analects 42 43 confuciuss disciples and his only grandson zisi continued his philosophical school after his death 44 these efforts spread confucian ideals to students who then became officials in many of the royal courts in china thereby giving confucianism the first widescale test of its dogma two of confuciuss most famous later followers emphasized radically different aspects of his teachings in the centuries after his death mencius  孟子 and xun zi  荀子 both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with confucius mencius 4th century bc articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards rén yì and lǐ while xun zi 3rd century bc underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of confucian thought stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training in time their writings together with the analects and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of confucianism this realignment in confucian thought was parallel to the development of legalism which saw filial piety as selfinterest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state a disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 bc when the qin state conquered all of china li si prime minister of the qin dynasty convinced qin shi huang to abandon the confucians recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the zhou dynasty before them which he saw as being against to the legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler when the confucian advisers pressed their point li si had many confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and chinese scholarship under the succeeding han dynasty and tang dynasty confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence under wudi the works of confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 bc which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century as mohism lost support by the time of the han the main philosophical contenders were legalism which confucian thought somewhat absorbed the teachings of laozi whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with confucianism and the new buddhist religion which gained acceptance during the southern and northern dynasties era both confucian ideas and confuciantrained officials were relied upon in the ming dynasty and even the yuan dynasty although kublai khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them during the song dynasty the scholar zhu xi ad 1130–1200 added ideas from daoism and buddhism into confucianism in his life zhu xi was largely ignored but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what confucian texts actually meant modern historians view zhu xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking neoconfucianism neoconfucianism held sway in china japan korea and vietnam until the 19th century confucius philosopher of the chinese published by jesuit missionaries at paris in 1687 the works of confucius were first translated into european languages by jesuit missionaries in the 16th century during the late ming dynasty the first known effort was by michele ruggieri who returned to italy in 1588 and carried on his translations while residing in salerno matteo ricci started to report on the thoughts of confucius and a team of jesuits— prospero intorcetta philippe couplet and two others—published a translation of several confucian works and an overview of chinese history in paris in 1687 45 46 françois noël after failing to persuade clement xi that chinese veneration of ancestors and confucius did not constitute idolatry completed the confucian canon at prague in 1711 with more scholarly treatments of the other works and the first translation of the collected works of mencius 47 it is thought that such works had considerable importance on european thinkers of the period particularly among the deists and other philosophical groups of the enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of confucius into western civilization 46 48in the modern era confucian movements such as new confucianism still exist but during the cultural revolution confucianism was frequently attacked by leading figures in the communist party of china this was partially a continuation of the condemnations of confucianism by intellectuals and activists in the early 20th century as a cause of the ethnocentric closemindedness and refusal of the qing dynasty to modernize that led to the tragedies that befell china in the 19th century confuciuss works are studied by scholars in many other asian countries particularly those in the chinese cultural sphere such as korea japan and vietnam many of those countries still hold the traditional memorial ceremony every year the ahmadiyya muslim community believes confucius was a divine prophet of god as were laotzu and other eminent chinese personages 49in modern times asteroid 7853 confucius was named after the chinese thinker disciples zengzi right kneeling before confucius center as depicted in a painting from the illustrations of the classic of filial piety song dynasty main article disciples of confucius there is not much known of confuciuss disciples and a little over half of them had their surnames recorded in the zuo zhuan 50 the analects records 22 names that are most likely confuciuss disciples while the mencius records 24 names although it is quite certain that there have been many more disciples whose name were not recorded 50 most of confuciuss disciples were from the lu state while others were from neighboring states 50 for example zigong was from the wey state and sima niu was from the song state 50 confuciuss favorite disciple was yan hui most probably one of the most impoverished of them all 50 sima niu in contrast to yan hui was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the song state 50 under confuciuss teachings the disciples became welllearned in the principles and methods of government 51 he often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history poetry and ritual 51 confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen in which reform was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence 51 even though confucius denounced them for their practices the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable 51 in fact the disciple zilu even died defending his ruler in wei 51yang hu who was a subordinate of the ji family had dominated the lu government from 505 to 502 and even attempted a coup which narrowly failed 51 as a likely consequence it was after that that the first disciples of confucius were appointed to government positions 51 a few of confuciuss disciples went on to attain official positions of some importance some of which were arranged by confucius 52 by the time confucius was 50 years old the ji family had consolidated their power in the lu state over the ruling ducal house 53 even though the ji family had practices with which confucius disagreed and disapproved they nonetheless gave confuciuss disciples many opportunities for employment 53 confucius continued to remind his disciples to stay true to their principles and renounced those who did not all the while being openly critical of the ji family 54visual portraits no contemporary painting or sculpture of confucius survives and it was only during the han dynasty that he was portrayed visually carvings often depict his legendary meeting with laozi since that time there have been many portraits of confucius as the ideal philosopher the oldest known portrait of confucius has been unearthed in the tomb of the han dynasty ruler marquis of haihun died 59 bc the picture was painted on the wooden frame to a polished bronze mirror 55in former times it was customary to have a portrait in confucius temples however during the reign of hongwu emperor taizu of the ming dynasty it was decided that the only proper portrait of confucius should be in the temple in his home town qufu in shandong in other temples confucius is represented by a memorial tablet in 2006 the china confucius foundation commissioned a standard portrait of confucius based on the tang dynasty portrait by wu daozi memorials first entrace gate of the temple of confucius in zhenhai soon after confuciuss death qufu his home town became a place of devotion and remembrance the han dynasty records of the grand historian records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers it is still a major destination for cultural tourism and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples in panchina cultures there are many temples where representations of the buddha laozi and confucius are found together there are also many temples dedicated to him which have been used for confucian ceremonies the chinese have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of confucius  祭孔 every year using ceremonies that supposedly derived from zhou li  周禮 as recorded by confucius on the date of confuciuss birth this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland china where the official stance of the communist party and the state was that confucius and confucianism represented reactionary feudalist beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the aristocracy is a part of the natural order all such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume as it is now considered a veneration of chinese history and tradition even communist party members may be found in attendance in taiwan where the nationalist party  kuomintang strongly promoted confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior the tradition of the memorial ceremony of confucius 祭孔 is supported by the government and has continued without interruption while not a national holiday it does appear on all printed calendars much as fathers day does in the west in south korea a grandscale memorial ceremony called seokjeon daeje is held twice a year on confuciuss birthday and the anniversary of his death at confucian academies across the country and sungkyunkwan in seoul descendants see also family tree of confucius in the main line of descent confuciuss descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility

one in the north in qufu and the other in the south at quzhou an invitation to come back to qufu was extended to the southern duke yansheng kong zhu by the yuan dynasty emperor kublai khan the title was taken away from the southern branch after kong zhu rejected the invitation 67 so the northern branch of the family kept the title of duke yansheng the southern branch remained in quzhou where they

descendant of confucius h h kung was the premier of the republic of china one of his sons kong lingjie 孔令傑 married debra paget 81 who gave birth to gregory kung 孔德基 confuciuss family the kongs have the longest recorded extant pedigree in the world today the fathertoson family tree now in its 83rd generation 82 has been recorded since the death of confucius according to the confucius genealogy compilation committee he has 2 million known and registered descendants and there are an estimated 3 million in all 83 of these several tens of thousands live outside of china 83 in the 14th century a kong descendant went to korea where an estimated 34000 descendants of confucius live today 83 one of the main lineages fled from the kong ancestral home in qufu during the chinese civil war in the 1940s and eventually settled in taiwan 80 there are also branches of the kong family who have converted to islam after marrying muslim women in dachuan in gansu province in the 1800s 84 and in 1715 in xuanwei city in yunnan province 85 many of the muslim confucius descendants are descended from the marriage of ma jiaga 马甲尕 a muslim woman and kong yanrong 孔彦嵘 59th generation descendant of confucius in the year 1480 and are found among the hui and dongxiang peoples 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 the new genealogy includes the muslims 96 kong dejun 孔德軍 is a prominent islamic scholar and arabist from qinghai province and a 77th generation descendant of confucius because of the huge interest in the confucius family tree there was a project in china to test the dna of known family members of the collateral branches in mainland china 97 among other things this would allow scientists to identify a common y chromosome in male descendants of confucius if the descent were truly unbroken fathertoson since confuciuss lifetime the males in the family would all have the same y chromosome as their direct male ancestor with slight mutations due to the passage of time 98 the aim of the genetic test was the help members of collateral branches in china who lost their genealogical records to prove their descent however in 2009 many of the collateral branches decided not to agree to dna testing 99 bryan sykes professor of genetics at oxford university understands this decision the confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance he said its not just a scientific question 99 the dna testing was originally proposed to add new members many of whose family record books were lost during 20thcentury upheavals to the confucian family tree 100 the main branch of the family which fled to taiwan was never involved in the proposed dna test at all in 2013 a dna test performed on multiple different families who claimed descent from confucius found that they shared the same y chromosome as reported by fudan university 101the fifth and most recent edition of the confucius genealogy was printed by the confucius genealogy compilation committee cgcc 102 103 it was unveiled in a ceremony at qufu on september 24 2009 102 103 women are now included for the first time 104there is also a sacrificial official to mencius for a descendant of mencius a sacrificial official to zengzi for a descendant of zengzi and a sacrificial official to yan hui for a descendant of yan hui 105 106 107 108the descendants of confucius still use generation poems for their names given to them
