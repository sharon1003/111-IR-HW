the human impact on air pollutionby chris dinesen rogers aug 14 2017air pollution can have both manmade and natural sources the eyjafjallajokul volcano in iceland and mount st helen in washington illustrate the effect of natural causes of air pollution however humans continue to negatively impact their environments and contribute to air pollution air quality reports and ozone alerts indicate that air pollution can have serious health consequences video of the day error loading player flash plugin failed to load significance despite the best efforts total emissions of greenhouse gases increased 17 percent during the years 1990 to 2007 according to the u s state departments report inventory of u s greenhouse gas emissions and sinks 1990â€“2007 the report specified that these emissions are anthropogenic or manmade this represents a direct impact of human activities on air pollution sources include industrial activities agricultural soil management and vehicle exhaust causes the primary cause for the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is fossil fuels according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change this trend coincides with the increase in industrial activity since the industrial revolution the report further goes on to attribute the increases of atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide to agriculture both of these contributions also correspond with an increase in the human population during this same time period effects ironically we are affected by the manmade air pollution we cause groundlevel ozone is caused by a concentration of greenhouse gases at the earths surface if you breathe ozone you are likely to suffer throat and lung irritation if you have asthma you may find your attacks come more frequent and more intense a 2002 study published in the journal of the american medical association found a direct link between longterm exposure to air pollution and lung cancer and other respiratory conditions environmental effects the effects of humancaused air pollution are not limited to people acid rain for example is formed when emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide combine with moisture in the air to create acidic precipitation this acid rain can acidify lakes and soils it can also cause structural damage to buildings and monuments especially those made of limestone or marble many of the historic structures in washington d c are vulnerable to the destructive action of acid rain with the u s capitol building itself showing signs of damage preventionsolution just as people have caused an increase in air pollution so too can they mitigate its effects sulfur dioxide emissions for example have been significantly reduced in part due to revisions of the clean air act of 1971 installation of scrubbers on smokestacks has contributed to a more than 70 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions during 1980 to 2008 perhaps similar provisions can reduce other greenhouse gases and reduce the environmental impact of air pollution lose weight feel greatchange your life with my plate by live strong  comgoalgender ageweight heightget my calorie goalyou might also likehealth effects of poor air quality how do factories pollute the air seven causes of air pollution how does land pollution effect your health diseases caused by air pollution the effects of air pollution on plants future effects of pollution air pollution effects on skin physical effects of pollution the 50 u s cities with the best air quality longterm effects of air pollution the causes effects  solutions for air pollution the effects of soil pollution on humans what is the definition of indoor air pollution how do ionizers work natural ways to add oxygen to the air in your home soil pollution types natural water purification process types of environmental pollutants ways to prevent soil pollution
