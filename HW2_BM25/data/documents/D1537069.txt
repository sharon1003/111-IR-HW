linear functionsit is necessary to recall how to graph an equation in two variables such as 2x  3y  27 begin by choosing a pair lines called axes which intersect at right angles and call this point of intersection the origin the horizontal axis is called the xaxis and the vertical axis is called the yaxis hence the plane is divided into four regions called quadrants and each quadrant is named using a roman numeral beginning in the upper righthand region and continuing in a counterclockwise direction the solution set of an open sentence in two variables is the set of ordered pairs xy for which the sentence is true the sentence 2x  3y  27 may be transformed into an equivalent expression hence the equation has been solved for y in terms of x next arbitrary values of x may be chosen substituted into the equation and find the corresponding value of yx 9  23x y0 9  230 91 9  231 2533 9  233 79 9  239 33 9  23 3 116 9  23 6 13it follows that the points 09 1253 37 93 311 613 satisfy the equation 2x  3y  27 indeed there are infinitely many solutions of  xy  2x  3y  27 begin plotting the points on the coordinate system the first coordinate is the xcoordinate and the second coordinate is the ycoordinate also known as abscissa and ordinate respectively although only two points are required to graph a line it is good practice to choose a third point as a test point a relation is defined as a set of ordered pairs of numbers the set consisting of all first coordinates is the domain the set of all second coordinates is the range hence 2x  3y  27 is a relation whose domain is 013936 and whose range is 9253731113 only a partial listing of the domain and range may be given since there are infinitely many elements in both notice that each element in the domain maps itself to one and only one element in the range this type of relation is known as a function like any other set a function may be named by a letter such as f g or h consider the function f x2x this is read f the function that assigns x to the number 2x however f x  2x is the rule for the function not the function itself the graph of a function is the set of all points xy in a coordinate plane for which the rule of the function assigns y to x the most fundamental example of a linear function is f x  x as its name implied the graph of a linear function is simply a line notice that a onetoone correspondence exists between each element in the domain with each element in the range consider the following functions in the above diagram the red line is a graph of the function f x  x and this function will be called the parent graph from this point on because comparisons of linear functions will be made against this one the function f x  x  4 is represented by the blue line f x  x  1 is represented by the green line f x  x  2 is represented by the gold line and f x  x  3 is represented by the purple line these lines are all in the same family of functions in general if f x  x and y f x  c where c is some real number greater than 0 a vertical shift will take place specifically if y  f x  c the graph will shift upward c units if y  f x  c the graph will shift downward c units for this reason f x  x  4 was the same graph as f x  xjust shifted 4 units upward f x  x  3 was the same graph as f x  x but shifted 3 units downward it is also interesting to note that c is also the yintercept which is the point where the graph intersects the yaxis since the yintercept is a point it may be expressed in the form 0c in addition to creating a table of values and plotting points to draw the graph of a linear function it is possible to use the steepness of the line or slope consider the function f x  2x  3 and a few points3 92 71 50 31 12 13 3if the two points are chosen say 21 and 33 the slope of the line may be found by plotting one of the points and counting the number of units along the yaxis and the number of units along the xaxis necessary to plot the second point this technique of counting in order to find the slope may become complicated if the graph is not sketched accurately or if the first or second point does not consist of integers for this reason it is necessary to provide the following formal definition of slope let l be a line that is not parallel to the yaxis and p 1 x 1 y 1 and p 2 x 2 y 2 be distinct points on l the slope of l is since y  f x  c is a function whose yintercept is c and the slope may generate as many points as necessary the slope and yintercept together may provide a quick yet accurate sketch of the graph of any linear function an equation of the form ymx  c is said to be in slopeintercept form  where m is the slope and c is the yintercept consider the function in order to graph this function it is necessary to first plot the yintercept next use the slope to locate a second point on the line it is demonstrated above that the slope may be used to find other points on the line as well it should also be noted that if two lines have the same slope then they are parallel consider the functions f x  3x  4 and g x  3x  1 it is necessary to note that the function f has a slope of 3 and a yintercept of 4 the second function has a slope of 3 and a yintercept of 1 by graphing these two functions it is visually obvious that these two lines are parallel if two lines are perpendicular then their slopes are negative reciprocals of one another consider the functions the line in red represents the function f and the green line represents g these two lines intersect and form four 90degree angles it may also be generalized that lines with positive slopes begin in the third quadrant and move into the first quadrant reading the graph from left to right and lines with negative slopes begin in the second quadrant and move into the fourth quadrant reading the graph from left to right summarya linear function will graph as a line the graph may be constructed by either creating a chart of values and plotting pointsor by using the slope and yintercept the function f x  x is referred to as the parent graph for all linear functions if y  f x  c the graph moves c unitsupward if y  f x  c the graph moves c units downward parallel lines have the same slope perpendicular lines have slopes which are negative reciprocals of each other return
