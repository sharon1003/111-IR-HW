birmingham  editthe history of the uhf channel 42 allocation in the birmingham market traces back to 1949 when the birmingham news company owners of the birmingham news and birmingham ageherald newspapers filed a construction permit application with the federal communications commission fcc for a television station license under the call letters wsgntv for the s ouths g reatest n ewspaper which would have served as a sister station to radio station wsgn 610 am now wagg and 937 fm now wdjc  owned by the news  southern broadcasting subsidiary the station partnered with the voice of alabama inc owners of wafmtv channel 13 later wabt and wapitv and now wvtmtv  to construct a broadcast tower next to its newly completed studio facility on red mountain adjcent to vulcan park plans called for wsgntv to operate from the radio stations radio park building 3the application however faced multiple delays on its approval the first such moratorium on the license approval resulted from a freeze on broadcast licenses that imposed by the fcc the previous summer however bascom hopson president and general manager of wsgn radio requested an extension to the agencys consideration of the license at one point southern tried to forge a deal with the owners of wcbitv in columbus mississippi to forfeit its vhf channel 4 assignment in order to allow the allocation to be reassigned to birmingham for use by the proposed station the fcc reassigned the channel 4 frequency to columbus in 1953 when wbrctv moved to channel 6 to alleviate signal interference issues with wsmtv now wsmvtv in nashville  in 1954 months after the news decided to purchase wafmtv johnston broadcasting – thenowners of radio stations wjld 1400 am and wjlnfm 1047 now wzzk – applied to launch a television station on uhf channel 48 after southern broadcastings effort to acquire the channel 4 frequency failed it sold the permit to johnston in order for that group to operate its planned television station on the channel 42 frequency 4as wbmg  editin 1956 southern broadcasting renewed its efforts to build a third commercial television station in birmingham when it formed a partnership with chicago film salesmanturnedinvestment banker bill du bois to file for a new construction permit although the new permit application was granted that year 5 the stations debut was delayed due to a shortage of broadcast transmission equipment following the korean war the station would not sign on the air until october 17 1965 as wbmg standing for b ir m in g ham 6 1 the first program to air on channel 42 when it debuted at 530 pm that evening was nbc s broadcast of the capitol chronicle of freedom du bois and southern broadcasting served as coowners of the station under the licensee birmingham television corporation with southern acting as minority partner many members of channel 42s early staff consisted of onair personalities and other employees from wsgn radio including bill bolen who would later move to wbrctv who served as one of wbmgs initial news anchors as was the case at the time with most uhf television stations in markets served by at least two commercial vhf stations – in birminghams case fellow nbccbs affiliate wapitv and then abc affiliate wbrctv – wbmg experienced considerable competitive disadvantages from the outset that would plague the station for over 30 years at the time of its signon many households in the market did not have television sets capable of tuning into uhf broadcast signals without the aid of a converter television set manufacturers had only begun including uhf tuners built into the sets one year earlier per a 1962 directive from the fcc even with a converter the picture quality from uhf stations was marginal at best the stations signal also left much to be desired the birmingham market is a fairly large market geographically stretching across nearly the entire width of the state from near the alabama mississippi state line eastward to the alabama georgia state line much of the terrain within this area is also hilly to mountainous particularly in the eastern part of the state which lies within the foothills of the appalachian mountains this was a major reason as to why it took longer for birmingham to get a third television station in comparison to other cities of its size on paper the markets population had been large enough to support a third full network affiliate since the 1950s the fcc had actually allocated four vhf channels to what would become the birmingham market however two of them channels 7 and 10 were acquired by alabama educational television now alabama public television for its two original charter stations wbiq in birmingham and wciq in mount cheaha both had signed on in 1955 and were donated to the alabama educational television commission by storer broadcasting – which owned wbrc from 1953 to 1957 – both due to the companys support of educational broadcasting and as an attempt to stave off additional commercial competition at the time most uhf stations did not get good reception in areas with rugged terrain and their signals did not travel nearly as far as their vhf counterparts usually resulting in these stations not producing sufficient enough signal coverage in those instances as a result channel 42s coverage area was effectively limited to birmingham itself and some innerring suburbs over red mountain the station originally broadcast for four hours each evening carrying a mix of prime time programming from both cbs and nbc before expanding its broadcast day from 700 am to 1200 am two weeks later on november 1 1965 on paper wbmg took the cbs affiliation from wapitv however cbs continued to allow channel 13 to air some of its more popular programs in part due to the aforementioned signal shortfalls with channel 42 wbmg was thus left with cbs news programming and numerous lowerrated cbs shows to help fill out its schedule it also aired some nbc programs that wapitv didnt carry among these programs was strangely given its popularity elsewhere in the country the tonight show which wapi would not clear until 1969 albeit on a onehour tape delay  as well as the infamous heidi game event between the american football league s oakland raiders and new york jets in november 1968 7one benefit though was that wbmg cleared the cbs evening news which began airing in birmingham for the first time in over two years after cbs and nbc expanded their evening news programs to 30 minutes in 1963 nbcs the huntleybrinkley report which was carried by wapitv was the only national network newscast seen in birmingham until channel 42 signed on wbrc did not carry abcs national newscast john daly and the news and its successors until september 1963 wbmg also carried certain locally produced and syndicated programs that aired on channel 13 such as the university of alabama football coaches program the bear bryant show  which were rebroadcast on channel 42 in different time slots both wbmg and wapi listed their affiliation as cbsnbc one advantage that wbmg had over its rivals was that it was the first television station to be equipped for color broadcasts at the time the station signed on it had acquired a color film chain specialized projection equipment that allowed it to air films and slides in color although most of the stations camera consisted of monochrome equipment previously used by wbrc which channel 42s original chief engineer worked for before being hired by wbmg by 1970 though wapis owners the newhouse family opted to sign an exclusive affiliation contract with nbc leaving wbmg to take a fulltime cbs affiliation more or less by default both stations became exclusive affiliates of the respective networks on may 1 of that year with a poor signal the lack of television sets with uhf tuning capability and two of the south s oldest and most respected stations as its competitors wbmg found the going very difficult due in part to wbmgs weak signal cbs opted to affiliate with two other central alabama stations wcfttv channel 33 now heroes  icons affiliate wses in tuscaloosa and whmatv channel 40 later wjsutv and now heroes  icons affiliate wgww in anniston wcft signed on ten days after wbmg made its debut whma would not sign on until october 1969 and the signals of both the tuscaloosa and anniston stations reached some households in birmingham proper that had uhf rooftop antennas installed wcft and whma carried an identical selection of prime time programming from cbs and nbc as wbmg did when all three stations were dual affiliates of the two networks furthermore when cbs decided to cancel many of its ruraloriented sitcoms and variety shows in 1971 – especially the country music showcase hee haw and shows hosted by sylacauga native jim nabors – in order to comply with the prime time access rule the move was a probable cause in hampering wbmgs ability to attract viewers in rural alabama where those programs were highly popular among viewers for example when hee haw returned as a syndicated program in the fall of 1971 it aired on wapi because of that stations greater attractiveness to the distributor because of its longevity and larger audience however many of wbmgs problems were of its own making for instance its newscasts were widely perceived as unprofessional still wbmg gained publicity in central alabama for some locally produced shows such as live studio wrestling and the childrens program sergeant jack which aired weekdays on the station from november 1965 to september 1976 before being relegated to weekends from that point until june 1982 hosted by former wsgn disc jockey neal miller who donned a sheriffs deputy uniform for the character which was named by jack caddell founder of homewood based fast food chain jacks hamburgers which sponsored the show miller would be sworn in by then jefferson county sheriff mel bailey with whom caddell collaborated with in developing the sergeant jack character as an honorary deputy as a prerequisite to be allowed to wear the official jefferson county sheriffs uniform onair and in promotional appearances the program revolved around dick tracy and mr magoo cartoon shorts and incorporated wraparound segments in which miller interacted with various puppet characters typical for childrens programs of its day it also featured a studio audience made up of elementary school aged children by the time the program ended the audience had been dropped with miller simply sitting in front of a curtain and providing introductions to the cartoons the station also assumed the local rights to the romper room preschool program franchise from wapitv in june 1970 the second host of the birmingham version former teacher carol aldy remained with the program after its move to channel 42 before she was replaced that september by rita sparling who hosted the show until it ended in june 1971 mother angelica – who in 1981 would launch an christian oriented cable network based in irondale the eternal word television network ewtn – began her career by taping faithrelated programs at the wbmg studios for distribution on the station and other broadcast outlets du bois and southern broadcasting tried vigorously to increase channel 42s signal coverage area and the quality of its local programming production first by constructing a transmission tower that operated at 12 million watts in 1969 next they built a larger studio facility for the station on golden crest drive atop red mountain where the studios of wbrc and wapi were also located however this did not significantly improve the stations situation likely prompting du bois and southern to sell wbmg to park communications for 55 million in 1973 becoming its tenth station and bringing that company to the fccs national television station ownership limit at the time 8 park significantly boosted the stations signal erecting yet another new tower in 1974 even still wbmgs signal remained rather weak after the signal boost effectively limiting its coverage area to birmingham itself and closein suburbs in chilton and shelby counties this came back to haunt the station when cable arrived in birmingham later in the 1970s while this should have eliminated the disadvantage of being a uhf station serving such a large market many cable providers in the western and eastern portions of the market refused to pick up channel 42 because its signal in those areas was weak to the point of unacceptability with this in mind cbs retained affiliations with wcft and whmawjsu which regularly trounced wbmg in the ratings for their respective regions this was especially true in anniston since wbmgs signal did not cover eastcentral portions of alabama well at all during that period because of the higher elevations of the appalachian foothills what little market share wbmg had accrued in those areas dwindled even further when arbitron separated tuscaloosa and anniston into separate markets despite the fact that wcft wjsu and wciq were the only television stations in either market which were otherwise served by the three vhf stations out of birmingham in 1977 9even when local news programming returned to the station in 1987 after a sevenyear hiatus wbmg had no luck whatsoever competing with wvtmtv and wbrc in news or signon to signoff viewership leading many industry insiders to deem birmingham a de facto twostation market channel 42 was perennially one of cbs weakest affiliates in marked contrast to its competitors which were two of their networks strongest affiliates it even trailed wtto channel 21 now a cw affiliate an independent station and later a fox affiliate that had only been on the air since april 1982 by some measures it was the weakest majornetwork affiliate in the nation the stations performance was so weak that by the early 1990s wbmg was only ahead of another independent station wabm channel 68 now a my network tv affiliate in the birmingham ratings in many cases a c nielsen couldnt even rate cbs programs in birmingham since the sample sizes were too small to generate a rating to absolve ownership conflicts caused by its nearconcurrent purchases of wvtm and wbrc new world communications decided to establish an outside trust company that it would place wbrc into with the intent to sell the station to foxs television station subsidiary fox television stations on october 12 1994 10 11 fox in turn planned to convert wbrc into an ownedandoperated station of the network new world had signed an affiliation agreement with fox in may 1994 to switch most of the television stations it already owned or was in the process of acquiring from argyle communications and citicasters to the network but exempted wvtm from the agreement due to its sale of wbrc to fox however abcs affiliation with that station did not expire until august 31 1996 forcing fox to continue to run wbrc as an abc affiliate while that network sought another station to become its new affiliate for central alabama after abc broke off discussions with wtto after it expressed interest in only carrying the networks prime time and sports programming abc then approached wbmg for a deal despite channel 42s anemic ratings abc wanted to align with a station that at least had a functioning news department wttos owner sinclair broadcast group did not budget for local news programming on its non big three stations at the time and expressed unwillingness in forming a news department for wtto abc saw enough promise that it even offered to buy wbmg outright instead for undisclosed reasons park communications signed a longterm deal that renewed wbmgs affiliation with cbs in january 1996 abc signed an affiliation agreement with allbritton communications for its newly acquired stations wcfttv and wjsutv the latter of which allbritton had agreed to operate under a local marketing agreement with thenowner osborne communications corporation weeks prior which developed a unique arrangement in which both would combine their operations to act as fullpowered satellites of lowpower station w58ck channel 58 now wbmald  whose signal did not extend outside of jefferson and shelby counties the arrangement was due to the fact that wcft and wjsu would not be counted in nielsen ratings reports for birmingham since tuscaloosa and anniston were separate markets which would have prevented abc programming in the market from being counted toward the networks national viewership counts 12 13 at that time the switch took place on september 1 1996 cbs decided to affiliate with another central alabama station wnaltv channel 44 now ion television oo wpxhtv in gadsden a former fox affiliate and onetime repeater of wttos tuscaloosa satellite wdbb channel 17 which had a decent signal reach into the eastern portions of the birmingham area as well as eastern alabama sale to media general and callsign change to wiat  editfirst logo as wiat with daily news logo and station slogan on bottom used from 1998 to 2004 in 1997 park communications was sold to richmond virginia based media general however the new ownership brought no change to the stations flagging ratings by late 1997 wbmgs market share had dropped to a mere 1 leaving it significantly behind not only wbrc wvtm and wbmalp but also wtto and even behind wabm at times the latter two stations did not air any news programming at the time per an agreement with cbs which had become increasingly concerned about its lackluster performance in a fastgrowing market media general invested millions of dollars into turning wbmgs fortunes around as a first step media general boosted wbmgs overall transmitting power to 5 million watts the highest level allowed by the fcc this finally put the stations broadcast signal on an equal footing with the other birmingham area stations the upgrades made by media general also allowed channel 42 to become the first television station in the market to broadcast a digital television signal and effectively the first to broadcast network programming in high definition an accomplishment that was important to media general as it fought the wide perception among viewers and those in the media industry that the station had a weak signal wiat logo used from 2007 to 2010 wiat cbs 42 logo used from 2010 to may 12 2014 similar to the previous logo but was enhanced for hd in order to signify a new start as channel 42 prepared to reboot its news department see below media general also applied to change the stations callsign to wiat for  i ts a bout t ime the stations new slogan on february 1 1998 one month earlier eric land whom the group hired as the stations general manager fired all but one member of its news department staff and replaced channel 42s evening newscasts with a countdown clock to signal the forthcoming relaunch of the station as the new wiat on february 5 the wbmg call letters are now used by a lowpower station on uhf channel 38 in moody  on that date preceding the debut of its relaunched 500 pm newscast under the new 42 daily news format land appeared in the parking lot outside the stations studios just before the countdown clock expired speaking to an unseen audience of birminghamarea community leaders on the meaning behind the stations relaunch before throwing a switch that blew up an image of the logo wbmg had been using since the fall of 1995 to unveil the new wiat logo further allowing wiat to be able to gain some footing in other parts of central alabama paxson communications now ion media networks chose not to renew wpxhs contract with cbs and cede the networks rights in central alabama to wiat in january 1999 in preparation of turning channel 44 into the pax tv now ion television ownedandoperated outlet for all of central alabama in 2003 bill ballard who took over as wiats president and general manager forged a new path for the station which included numerous changes to its newscasts and programming including the acquisition of a stronger slate of syndicated programs such as dr phil jeopardy and entertainment tonight and a much more aggressive approach to its news coverage the moves which were implemented dramatically altered the landscape of central alabama television and allowed channel 42 to become a factor in the local ratings for the first time in the stations history at that time wiat discontinued all references to its callsign and erstwhile slogan its about time within its onair branding instead concentrating on establishing the stations association with cbs and restructuring the news departments focus towards more indepth investigative reporting new vision television ownership  editon april 6 2006 nbc universal announced that it would sell wvtmtv and three of its other smallermarket ownedandoperated stations – wjartv in providence rhode island wcmhtv in columbus ohio and wncn in raleigh north carolina – to media general for 600 million as the fcc media ownership regulations for television duopolies prohibit broadcasting companies from owning two of the four highestrated television stations within the same media market media general subsequently announced that it would it seek a buyer for its existing station in the birminghamtuscaloosaanniston market wiat and acquire wvtm which at the time was the higherrated of the two stations in terms of total day viewership 14 15 16the fcc subsequently granted the company a temporary waiver of its ownership rules that allowed it to keep both wvtm and wiat for six months after the purchase of the former was completed media generals purchase of all four stations was finalized on june 26 2006 17 on august 2 media general announced that it had sold wiat and fellow cbs affiliate kimt in mason city iowa to new vision television for 35 million the sale was finalized on october 12 2006 18the extensive changes that helped wiat become a ratings force in the market in the latter years under media general ownership continued as a new visionowned station under new vision channel 42 saw some of its largest ratings increases in the stations history it is now one of the strongest cbs affiliates in the nation after spending the better part of its history as one of the weakest wiat has particularly benefited from the networks broadcasts of college football games from the southeastern conference which garner higher ratings on channel 42 than on any other station in the country sec game telecasts particularly those involving the alabama crimson tide and auburn tigers are among the highestrated programs in birmingham during the ncaa division i football season typically delivering higher ratings in the market than network telecasts of the super bowl this includes the iron bowl rivalry game between alabama and auburn which – through cbs – has aired on wiat for all but three years since 2000 in the summer of 2009 the

fcc duopoly restrictions based on total day viewership that prompted media general to sell wiat to new vision eight years earlier media general was once again required to sell either wiat or wvtm to another station owner in order to comply with fcc ownership rules in this situation the sales that media general and lin voluntarily chose to conduct in birmingham and four other markets were also in response to the fccs plan to restrict sharing agreements involving two or more television stations in the same market 22 23 24 on may 12 2014 when it unveiled a new proprietary graphics and imaging

newscasts consistently languished at an often distant third place among the birmingham markets television news operations according to local legends the stations newscasts often – inadvertently or not – became comedy shows examples of this include tommy charles a local radio personality formerly with wsgn and waqy who served as a sports anchor for wbmg during the mid1970s wadding up scripts and tossing them over his shoulder during the sports segment after he read them as well as even letting deflating balloons fly around the set for no apparent reason under park communications ownership the station made concerted moves to professionalize its newscasts under general manager hugh smith it hired thom gossom as lead anchor and acquired the first color remote vehicle in birmingham which incorporated equipment originally purchased in 1972 for its broadcasts of dawson memorial baptist churchs weekly services although these efforts led to little success in increasing its ratings wbmg discontinued longform local news programming in 1980 instead airing syndicated shows at both 500 and 1000 pm the only news programming that aired on channel 42 for the next seven years consisted of hourly cutins during regular programming wbmg reestablished a fullfledged news department in 1987 but its newscasts barely registered much higher than hashmarks less than one ratings share point in the ratings the station managed to make a name for itself while john harrod served as its news director from 1990 to 1995 harrod built a very aggressive and hardhitting news department concentrating exclusively on local stories and investigative reporting it also gradually expanded its news programming adding two additional newscasts at 600 am and 600 pm on weekdays by 1995 the station won a number of awards from the associated press for its reporting during harrods tenure however critical acclaim was not rewarded with a ratings win despite making a more credible effort than before wbmgs newscasts barely registered as a blip in the ratings lagging well behind wbrc and wvtm it even fell to fourth shortly after the wbma trimulcast launched its news department after it took over the abc affiliation from wbrc when that station switched to fox in september 1996 at one point in 1997 the stations news programming scored less than a 1 ratings share with its 1000 pm newscast scoring lower

research 45 during that time the station began filling the 600 am and 600 pm time slots respectively with religious and syndicated programming meanwhile it also showed a muchtalkedabout slide of a computeranimated digital countdown clock during the 500 and 1000 pm halfhours where newscasts would air once the department was relaunched during this time the station sent coverage of the january 29 bombing of the new woman all women clinic in birminghams southside neighborhood by eric rudolph to cbs newspath cnn and to stations in neighboring markets even though it did not have a formal news department at the time 46 47the new format debuted on february 5 1998 – coinciding with cbss broadcast of the opening ceremonies of the winter olympics – under the title 42 daily news land had overseen less drastic relaunches during earlier stints at weyitv in saginaw michigan and wgrztv in buffalo new york however in an interview with the american journalism review land later said that the decision to overhaul the news department in such a dramatic manner was because even with its associated press award wins earlier in the decade the stations research found that our people were so closely identified with a poorly performing product that we had to create a new brand and start over again 45 television news analyst don fitzpatrick called the drastic changes an extremely rare  act of desperation 45 the timing of the relaunch was chosen for a reason partly due to the merger of wcft wjsu and wbmalp into birminghams abc affiliate two years earlier nielsen merged the previously separate tuscaloosa and annistongadsden markets back into the birmingham market a move which took effect in september 1998 that resulted in the newly reenlarged market jumping twelve spots on nielsens annual media market rankings at one stroke from 51st to 39th place at the same time nielsen converted birmingham to a metered market in the fall of 1998 for ratings purposes 43the rebooted newscasts initially did not employ any onair reporters instead in a style similar to the modernday multimedia journalist concept the station used crews of photographers with either reporters or field producers and oneman bands to produce and edit stories in an approach that emphasized content over personalities 46 all stories were narrated by the anchors in the manner most television stations provided reports during their newscasts well into the 1960s designed as news for busy people the station imposed strict time limits on story packages with all segments structured in the form of news minutes such as top story in a minute weather minute neighborhood minute and a 2minute drill sportscast in order to be able to incorporate a broad array of local national and international stories and feature segments within each halfhour newscast one anchor manned the news desk while the other read stories from various places on the new set al primo who created the  eyewitness news  format at kywtv in philadelphia back in 1965 delivered sharp criticism of what he felt was a product that was generated solely by research and implemented by people who dont know anything about the news business and the most disjointed presentation of a newscast that i have ever seen in my life 48 land responded to primos scathing remarks by comparing the format to the al schottelkotte news a longtime staple of wcpotv in cincinnati from the 1960s until 1990 for which he had been a reporter  the al schottelkotte news was very nontraditional but jampacked with information 48the new anchor team was mostly made up of talent who had not previously worked in the birmingham market original coanchor keith cate – who coanchored the weeknight newscasts with sherri jackson who herself remains with wiat as of 2016 – had previously been a main anchor at wmartv in baltimore his reaction to the fastpaced news style was according to him this looks like  headline news  gone local 45 except for the twoperson sports team of sam smith and sports director paul finebaum finebaums established popularity from his highly opinionated column in the birmingham postherald and radio show on werc 960 am sparked some interest from sports fans however his sportscasts were often seen as incomplete since he had only two minutes to convey the days sports headlines and scores smith the only holdover from the old wbmg left the station after only a few months under the revamped news department even with the time constraints wiat was seen as making a more credible effort at news than ever before ratings for its newscasts increased immediately the 1000 pm newscast in particular had increased from a paltry 13 share in february 1997 to a 7 share in february 1998 partly due to having the winter olympics as a leadin 49 but were still not enough to overtake the competition ratings also increased once birmingham became a metered market moving to 3 and 4 shares on most nights early in the fall of 1998 50 at that time fellow cbs affiliate wnal tv in gadsden – which did not create a news department of its own when it joined the network in september 1996 – entered into an agreement to air simulcasts of wbmgs newscasts which aired on wnal until it became an independent station in january 1999 media general would later expand the daily news format to fellow cbs affiliate whlt in hattiesburg mississippi that same year the station notched its first three emmy award nominations in its history winning two keith cate won best news anchor and the news department as a whole won for best live reporting however the station became embroiled in behindthescenes disputes with management and former onair talent that were let go after media general took over and land decided to relaunch the news department this led to a number of breach of contract fraud and defamation of character and racial discrimination lawsuits against the station andor media general by former onair and production employees including former sports anchor doug bell and former longtime general manager hoyle broome lands direct predecessor who had been with the thenwbmg since 1977 as well as a group of former africanamerican employees calling themselves the birmingham seven 51 over the next few years more newscasts would be added to wiats schedule the station debuted a halfhour newscast at 600 pm on monday through saturday evenings in september 2001 followed by the addition of a twohour weekday morning newscast in september 2004 bill ballard who succeeded land as general manager in 2003 brought in larry ragan a seasoned news director who quickly hired wvtm veteran ken lass and wbma meteorologist mark prater formerly the understudy of veteran birmingham meteorologist james spann  the station subsequently rebranded its newscasts as news 42 began hiring assignment reporters to present and narrate stories and gradually eased its limits on story lengths the ratings for wiats newscasts continued to steadily improve over the next several years allowing it to become more competitive than ever before since the early 2000s wiat has had a spirited threeway battle with wvtm and wbma for second place behind longdominant wbrc and since 2006 its lateevening newscasts has consistently finished in second place in the 1000 pm time slot on some occasions it has even surged all the way to first placeamong the few times in the last halfcentury that wbrc has lost any timeslot in recent years wiat has won many regional and national journalism awards for its reporting in 2007 and 2008 wiat won
