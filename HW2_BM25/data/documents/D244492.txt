have been true 15 or 20 years ago australia has in recent years undergone a food and drink revolution and the typical australian now expects and demands higher quality products while the number of smaller breweries in countries typically known for the high quality beers for example germany and belgium are on the decline the number of microbreweries in australia currently growing at an almost exponential rate there are too many beers to name them all here youll just have to ask your local bottle shop attendant to recommend some but to get you started here are a few popular ones popular craftmicro beers mountain goat moo brew pilsner 4 pine esb feral hop hog ipa murrays angry man pale ale popular high quality mass produced beers coopers original pale ale cascade james boags premium james squire varieties little creatures pale ale average quality mass produced beers to try just to say that you have vb victorian bitter melbourne bitter carlton draught xxxx fosters hahn tooheys

globalisation for you but if you want more details about australian beer in general make sure you check this great website wwwbeeradvocatecom3  the aussie bbqwho could come to australia and not have a typically australian bbq there are barbecues literally everywhere many public parks and gardens have free barbecues or 20 cents for 10 minutes of cooking time which is close enough to free dotted around as do many beach side park areas camping grounds and virtually every house in australia has a barbecue of some description the typical australian bbq involves a lot of meat a lot of cold beer on ice inside and esky a portable insulated cooling box a lot of white sandwich bread a lot of tomato sauce ketchup and not a lot else you may find the odd token salad then again you may not for those who enjoy more than just meat with their meal may be a little disappointed but for those who love meat you will be in paradise youll find everything from sausages hamburgers lamb chops steaks of various varieties chicken wings skewers andor a variety of fish and sea foods4  learn to throw a boomerang while you’re in australia you should try throwing a boomerangthe first time you throw one and it comes back is an amazing experience there is nothing like throwing a piece of wood away from you only to have it come backwhat you’ll need is a boomeranga big empty space you dont want to hit someone with it by mistake an empty sports oval is perfect a lot of patience it takes a while to get the hang of it courage if you want to try to catch it if you ever manage to get it to come back to you for more details on the actual technique involved in throwing a boomerang i recommend these two online resources wwwboomerangeorghow and wwwyoutubecomboomerangs5  learn to play the didgeridoo play one of the worlds most ancient musical instrument the didgeridoo the first record of people playing the didgeridoo is from aboriginal rock paintings dating back about 2000 years but it is thought that they have been playing it for much longer perhaps as long as 40000 years ago playing the didgeridoo is not easy like any musical instruments it takes hours of practice to get your first true tune and years to become a master to be able to play it continually you must first learn how to blow air out of your mouth while sucking it in through your nose at the same time try it now i bet you cant do it many people learn this skill by practising blowing bubbles in a glass using a straw however if you get the chance i highly recommend giving it a try you should be able to get some interesting sounds even if you are not a bubble blowing master just think you may just be playing the worlds oldest musical instrument here is a great video by david hudson wwwyoutubecomdidgeridoo6  sleep out under the stars in a swag sleeping out under the australian stars on a clear night is an amazing experience and in case you are wondering what a swag is it is a something like a large canvas sleeping bad which is waterproof in which you can put a small camping mattress some bedding and a pillow it also has a small hood which can be done up to keep the insects out once you get out into remote australia where there is no light pollution from cities street lights etc you wont believe what the sky looks like  it will take your breath away due to the huge size of australia and the small population once you get just a short distance away from the cities the night sky lights up with virtually no air or light pollution out in country it is one of the clearest night skys you will find anywhere in the world and the good thing about sleeping in a swap or camping is that it also usually involves points 2 and 3 bbq and beers from above i think it is a perfect combinationaboriginal dream time legend says the rainbow serpent is up in the sky can you find it and while youre at it can you find the southern cross star constellation used to find true south much like the north star is in the northern hemisphere if you want some more information about camping in australia or free camp sites make sure you have a look at this website it has everything you need wwwexploreaustralianetaucamping7  swimming with whale sharks original image supplied from wwwwhalesharkdivecom swimming with whale sharks is an experience that will stay with you for a lifetime the best spot to do this is ningaloo reef on the coral coast in western australia about 1150 kms north of perth the best time to see whale sharks is between midmarch and the end of july being a reef there is a lot more there than just whale sharks but they are certainly a major attraction for those who dont know whale sharks are in fact shark but not the man eating kind you may be thinking of they are graceful creatures who can grow up to 14 m 46 ft long they only eat microscopic plankton by filtering them through their open mouths you will not get eaten by these beautiful creatures for more information just visit wwwwhalesharkdivecom8  go on a crocodile cruise another large water based creature of australia that interests a lot of people is the salt water crocodile unlike the whale sharks mentioned in the point above these creatures are deadly and you can not go swimming with them the only safe way you can view these creatures in their wild habitat is on a crocodile boat cruise this is a truly amazing experience which will also stay with you for life youll be out on a smallish boat with crocodile up to 5 meters in length swimming past you if you get on a good tour the captain will dangle bits of meat over the edge getting the crocodiles to jump up out of the water to get the meat some of the best places to do a crocodile cruise are around cairns in queensland or around darwin in the northern territory  make sure you take your camera and get some amazing shots of these amazing prehistoric animalsif you are interested in finding out some more information about croc cruises have a look at these two website near darwin northern territory wwwadelaiderivercruisescomau and in the daintree rainforest queensland near cairns wwwcrocodileexpresscom9  not getting killed by deadly animals i get a lot of questions about deadly animals so i thought i would put this one dont get killed by a deadly animalthis should be pretty obviously but one thing to do while in australia is to make sure you don’t get killed by an animal unfortunately almost every year there is a tourist or australian or two who fail in this here is a selection is some potentially deadly animals in australia 21 of the worlds top 25 most venomous snakes including the top 11 all of which are deadly more information can be found here wwwwhatcanilearntodaycom 4 types of man eating sharks the deadly blue ringed octopus 2 types of jellyfish box jellyfish and irukandji stingrays remember steve irwin  2 types of spiders the sydney funnel web and the redback the salt water crocodile cone shells thats right there are pretty shells that can kill you the stone fish known as the most venomous fish in the world okay i should make it perfectly clear right here right now that it is not like these creatures are everywhere and that youll have a hard time just surviving a 3 week holiday in australia no one has died from a spider bite in australia since the 1970s you have a much higher chance of being hit by a car than attacked by a shark jelly fish deaths are very rare but please use a little common sense if you see an animal in the wild leave it alone dont pick up the spiders and dont try to catch a snake dont go swimming in the tropics unless you know it is safe crocodile do kill people who are stupid enough to go swimming near them on a regular basis enjoy australia10  a cruise on sydney harbour if you get the chance i highly recommend going on a cruise on the sydney harbour there is something magical about this it is hard to put a finger on it but on a warm summers night cruising around the harbour and sipping on a beer or wine while talking to other guests is pretty hard to beat you get to see the city and its waterfront in a completely new way and it is unfortunate that more people dont take up this experience watching the sun set over the horizon and the city lights start to come on while gently rocking on a cruise boat is beautiful do it if you get the chanceif you are interested in finding out more information about the cruises on the harbour or sydney in general be sure to have a look at wwwsydneycom please share this postshare on facebook share on twitter share on google more recommended
