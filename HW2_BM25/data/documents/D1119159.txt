bile duct obstruction is a blockage in the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine  in serious cases the common bile duct can be surgically moved so that it empties further down the small intestine hi clinical signs of bile duct obstruction include jaundice yellow discoloration of the skin easiest to detect in the whites of the eyes and dark discoloration of urine i still dont know exactly what is contracting gallbladder bile duct my mother was recently diagnozed with bile duct cancer in the liver which is a rare form for liver cancer do you know if your gallbladder is inflammed at all or if you have stones in the common bile duct overview abdominal pain in the upper right side dark urine fever itching jaundice lrb yellow skin color rrb nausea and vomiting pale  colored stools symptoms the goal of treatment is to relieve the blockage  stones may be removed using an endoscope during an ercp in some cases  surgery is required to bypass the blockage  the gallbladder will usually be surgically removed if the blockage is caused by gallstones  your health care provider may prescribe antibiotics if an infection is suspected if the blockage is caused by cancer  the duct may need to be widened  this procedure is called endoscope or percutaneous lrb through the skin next to the liver rrb dilation  a tube may need to be placed to allow drainage  treatment bile is a liquid released by the liver  it contains cholesterol  bile salts  and waste products such as bilirubin  bile salts help your body break down lrb digest rrb fats  bile passes out of the liver through the bile ducts and is stored in the gallbladder  i thought for sure it was my gallbladder i have a history of gallstones but my ultrasound came back normal except for an enlarged bile duct after a meal  it is released into the small intestine when the bile ducts become blocked  bile builds up in the liver  and jaundice lrb yellow color of the skin rrb develops due to the increasing levels of bilirubin in the blood the possible causes of a blocked bile duct include  cysts of the common bile duct enlarged lymp nodes in the porta hepatis gallstones inflammation of the bile ducts trauma including injury from gallbladder surgery tumors of the bile ducts or pancreas other tumors that have spread to the biliary system the risk factors include  history of gallstones  chronic pancreatitis  or pancreatic cancer injury to the abdominal area recent biliary surgery recent biliary cancer lrb such as bile duct cancer rrb the blockage can also be caused by infections  some common causes are hepatitis alcoholic liver disease primary biliary cirrhosis drug effects hormonal changes during pregnancy a stone in the bile duct bile duct narrowing bile duct cancer pancreatic cancer inflammation of the pancreas hope this helps this is more common in persons with weakened immune systems  causes your health care provider will examine your abdomen and may be able to feel the gallbladder the following blood test results could be a sign of a possible blockage  increased bilirubin level increased alkaline phosphatase level increased liver enzymes the following tests may be used to investigate a possible blocked bile duct  abdominal ultrasound abdominal ct scan ercp lrb endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography rrb percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram lrb ptca rrb magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography lrb mrcp rrb my bile duct was very short so cholangiogram could not be done which was disappointing since it looks for stray stones tests  diagnosis if the blockage is not corrected  it can lead to life  threatening infection and a dangerous build up of bilirubin if the blockage lasts a long time  chronic liver disease can result  i guess three ways you can get infection of eye 1put germs in eye ie rubbing eye etc 2 unable to get rid of germ ie duct blockage and dont drain infection 3 poor immune system i guess recent eye infection can set you up for more infection most obstructions can be treated with endoscopy or surgery  obstructions caused by cancer often have a worse outcome  prognosis be aware of any risk factors you have  so that you can get prompt diagnosis and treatment if a bile duct becomes blocked  they have to wait so the poisons thats been blocked in her bile duct can come out i think that if you had a blocked bile duct or infection your pain would be a lot more severe the blockage itself may not be preventable  prevention left untreated  the possible complications include infections  sepsis  and liver disease  such as biliary cirrhosis  i have a biliary duct disorder so one of the problems i have is the possibility of this occuring complications call your health care provider if you notice a change in the color of your urine and stools or you develop jaundice
