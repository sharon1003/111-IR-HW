within the scope of the criminal law in northern ireland criminal justice and policing powers were devolved to northern ireland in 2010 law concerning abortion  editthe abortion act 1967 does not extend to northern ireland 13 the pieces of legislation governing abortion in northern ireland are sections 58 and 59 of he offences against the person act 1861 and sections 25 and 26 of the criminal justice act northern ireland 1945 which are derived from the corresponding provisions of the infant life preservation act 1929  an offence under section 58 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term 14performing an abortion in northern ireland is an offence except in specific cases 15 an offence under section 25 1 of the criminal justice act northern ireland 1945 is by the proviso to that section not committed if the act which caused the death of a child was done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother the word unlawfully in section 58 of the offences against the person act 1861 imports the meaning expressed by the said proviso and thus section 58 must be read as if the words making it an offence to use the instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage were qualified by a similar proviso 16 in other words a person who procures an abortion in good faith for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother is not guilty of an offence 17 in northern ireland health and social services board v a and others 1994 nijb 1 mac dermott lj said at p 5 that he was satisfied that the statutory phrase for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother does not relate only to some lifethreatening situation life in this context means that physical or mental health or wellbeing of the mother and the doctor’s act is lawful where the continuance of the pregnancy would adversely affect the mental or physical health of the mother the adverse effect must however be a real and serious one and there will always be a question of fact and degree whether the perceived effect of nontermination is sufficiently grave to warrant terminating the unborn child in western health and social services board v cmb and the official solicitor 1995 unreported pringle j stated the adverse effect must be permanent or longterm and cannot be short term … in most cases the adverse effect would need to be a probable risk of nontermination but a possible risk might be sufficient if the imminent death of the mother was a risk in question 18 in family planning association of northern ireland v minister for health social services and public safety 8 october 2004  nicholson lj stated at paragraph 73  it is unlawful to procure a miscarriage where the foetus is abnormal but viable unless there is a risk that the mother may die or is likely to suffer longterm harm which is serious to her physical or mental health 19 sheil lj stated at paragraph 9  termination of a pregnancy based solely on abnormality of the foetus is unlawful and cannot lawfully be carried out in this jurisdiction 20thus northern irish women have two solutions to have an abortion they can either have a legal abortion via the nhs or in a private clinic in northern ireland provided they meet the criteria of a serious and long term risk to mental or physical health that is probable and not possible 21 or in all other circumstances travel in england scotland or wales and pay to terminate their pregnancy in a private clinic provided they meet the legal criteria for accessing abortion services under the abortion act 1967 22on 30 november 2015 horner j in the high court in belfast made a declaration of incompatibility under the human rights act 1998 to the effect that northern irelands law on abortion specifically its lack of provision in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest could not be interpreted in a manner consistent with article 8 of the european convention on human rights

difficult situation but should the ultimate victim of that terrible act rape—which is the child—should he or she be punished for what has happened by having their life terminated no 28according to ulster unionist party party leader mike nesbitt we are waiting for the consultation and the justice minister has been liaising with the minister for health my view is that we need a consultation and that a womans voice should be stronger by a long way in that consultation 29following the report to the united nations on the elimination of discrimination against women in july 2013 jenny willott mp then the liberal democrat parliamentary undersecretary of state for employment relations consumer and postal affairs and women and equalities stated that the uk government were obliged to submit to the committee a report on the steps taken to implement their recommendations on abortion laws and services in northern ireland by november 2014 30under dawn purvis the progressive unionist party provided strong support for the establishment of the independent marie stopes uk clinic in belfast 31at its 2012 conference sinn féin adopted a policy of allowing abortion in both parts of ireland under certain circumstances 32 although deputy first minister martin mc guinness had already stated sinn fein is not in favour of abortion and we resisted any attempt to bring the british 1967 abortion act to the north 31social democratic and labour party sdlp representative fearghal mc kinney has stated that he is fundamentally opposed to any extension of the 1967 act to northern ireland 29whilst the alliance party treats abortion as a matter of conscience their former leader david ford introduced the abortion fatal foetal abnormalities bill in december 2016 this would have allowed women the right to a termination up to 24 weeks in cases of ffa the bill fell with the collapse of the northern ireland executive in january 2017 although mr ford has indicated his desire to reintroduce the bill if the assembly is restored 33religious group positions  editcatholic  editthe catholic church position on abortion is based upon the sixth commandment  thou shalt not kill   exodus 2013  the church holds the view that every human from conception has an inalienable right to life and thus considers abortion a mortal sin the procuring of which automatically incurs for any catholic the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae by the very commission of the offence the catechism of the catholic church 1992 states since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law 34 it has been claimed that catholic opposition to abortion follows from the  doctrine of the doubleeffect  which originated with st thomas aquinas 35protestant  editthe presbyterian church in ireland is strongly prolife and maintains that abortion should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances eg where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother subject to the most stringent safeguards the church has affirmed the sanctity of human life that human life begins at conception and that complex medical and social issues such as abortion need to be handled with sensitivity and compassion 36the church of ireland affirms the right to life as a fundamental ethical value from which all other values derive and therefore places value on the right to life of an unborn child and the life of hisher mother however the church also recognises that in circumstances of strict and undeniable medical necessity the care that medical professionals need to give to the mother may result in the termination of her pregnancy in cases of what the church describes as lethal foetal abnormality the church objects to feticide as a form of termination but accepts an option of expediting birth and providing perinatal palliative care and support ie when the child is viable outside the womb in keeping with its position on the value of life the church believes that the circumstances of the conception do not alter the value of the childs life alongside this it contends that it is selfevident that ongoing support for victims of sexual crime must be readily available and of the highest standards 37the methodist church in ireland believes that a foetus should progressively be accorded rights as it develops through its stages of gestation culminating with full respect as an individual at birth it maintains that abortion is a permissible choice in a small number of very specific cases namely where the mothers life is at risk where there is risk of grave injury to the physical or mental health of the mother in cases of rape or incest or where the foetus is incapable of survival whether due to the gross abnormality of the foetus eg anencephaly or otherwise however the church is opposed to abortion on demand and contends that a foetus cannot be regarded as just an appendage of the mothers body 38the smaller protestant churches are generally conservative on the issue of abortion and include the free presbyterian church formerly led by ian paisley lord bannside also founder of the democratic unionist party who opposed abortion except where the life of the mother was in danger in the house of commons in 1993 paisley stated my views on abortion are well known in the historic protestant tradition i totally oppose it except where the life of the mother is in danger 39the reformed presbyterian church of ireland explains its prolife position through a biblical narrative of the human status of the unborn child it also acknowledges that women facing a crisis pregnancy often are confronted with the most difficult decision of their lives and encourages support which helps women to choose an alternative to abortion the church has expressed a particular concern about abortions for minor abnormalities such as club foot cleft lip or cleft palate 40churches and their members support women in crisis pregnancies andor who have experienced a miscarriage or abortion through practical support and advice and counselling services either through personal initiative the ministries of individual churches or through nondenominational charities such as life ni 41campaign groups  editan amnesty international poll in october 2014 indicated that a majority within northern irelands population appeared to agree to change abortion law in three particular cases rape incest and fatal foetal abnormality 42for british leftwing journalist polly toynbee the current situation is discriminatory against women we have to end the discrimination against women in northern ireland which as citizens of the uk forbids them from having an abortion in their own home country 43according to bernadette smyth the leader of the belfastbased group precious life which is opposed to abortion womens health is not in danger women are not dying because they cannot get abortion 44situation in 2013  editin march 2013 northern ireland health minister jim wells proposed an amendment to restrict lawful abortions to nhs premises except in cases of urgency when access to nhs premises is not possible and where no fee is paid 45in response amnesty international asked the ni assemblys justice committee to reject the full amendment declaring that the restrictive abortion laws and practices and barriers to access safe abortion are genderdiscriminatory denying women and girls treatment only they need 46finally northern ireland justice minister david ford issued a call for public consultation on amending the criminal law on abortion the call for consultation took into consideration cases where there is a diagnosis in pregnancy that the foetus has a lethal abnormality 47 and cases where women have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime 47ford also wrote that it is not a debate on the wider issues of abortion law – issues often labelled as prochoice and prolife 47 the consultation was closed on 17 january

editabortion was dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts in england scotland and wales until the reformation it was dealt with under the laws of the catholic church the ecclesiastical courts dealt mainly with the issue due to problems of evidence in such cases the ecclesiastical courts had wider evidential rules and more discretion regarding sentencing 54 although the ecclesiastical courts heard most cases of abortion some cases such as the twinslayers case were heard in the secular courts the old ecclesiastical courts were made defunct after the reformation later under scottish common law abortion was defined as a criminal offence  citation needed unless performed for reputable medical reasons a definition sufficiently broad as to essentially preclude prosecution  when the law on abortion started to be codified in legislation and dealt with in government courts under sections 1 and 2 of lord ellenboroughs act 1803 the offences created by this statute were replaced by section 13 of the offences against the person act 1828 under section 1 of the 1803 act and the first offence created by section 13 of the 1828 act the crime of abortion was subject in cases where the woman was proved to have been quick with child to the death penalty or transportation for life under section 2 of the 1803 act and the second offence created by section 13 of the 1828 act all other cases the penalty was transportation for 14 years section 13 of the 1828 act was replaced by section 6 of the offences against the person act 1837 this section made no distinction between women who were quick with child and those who were not it eliminated the death penalty as a possible punishment transportation was abolished by the penal servitude act 1857 which replaced it with penal servitude section 6 of the 1837 act was replaced by section 58 of the offences against the person act 1861 section 59 of that created a new preparatory offence of procuring poison or instruments with intent to procure abortion from 1870 there was a steady decline in fertility linked not to a rise in the use of artificial contraception but to more traditional methods such as withdrawal and abstinence 55 this was linked to changes in the perception of the relative costs of childrearing of course women did find themselves with unwanted pregnancies abortifacients were discreetly advertised and there was a considerable body of folklore about methods of inducing miscarriages amongst working class women violent purgatives were popular pennyroyal aloes and turpentine were all used other methods to induce miscarriage were very hot baths and gin extreme exertion a controlled fall down a flight of stairs or veterinary medicines socalled backstreet abortionists were fairly common although their bloody efforts could be fatal estimates of the number of illegal abortions varied widely by one estimate 100000 women made efforts to procure an abortion in 1914 usually by drugs the criminality of abortion was redoubled in 1929 when the infant life preservation act 1929 was passed the act criminalised the deliberate destruction of a child capable of being born alive this was to close a lacuna in the law identified by lord darling which allowed for infants to be killed during birth which would mean that the perpetrator could neither be prosecuted for abortion or murder 56 there was included in the act the presumption that all children in utero over 28 weeks gestation were capable of being born alive children in utero below this gestation were dealt with by way of evidence presented to determine whether or not they were capable of being born alive in 1987 the court of appeal refused to grant an injunction to stop an abortion ruling that a fetus between 18 and 21 weeks was not capable of being born alive 57 58 in may 2007 a woman from levenshulme manchester who had an illegal lateterm abortion at 7½ months in early 2006 was convicted of child destruction under the infant life preservation act 1929 the case is believed to be the first of its kind in britain 59in 1938 the decision in rex v bourne 60 allowed for further considerations to be taken into account this case related to an abortion performed on a girl who had been raped it extended the defence to abortion to include mental and physical wreck mc naghtan lj the gynaecologist concerned aleck bourne later became a founder member of the prolife group spuc 61  society for the protection of unborn children in 1966 the prochoice group the abortion law reform association was formed in 1936 in 1939 the birkett committee recommended a change to abortion laws but the intervention of world war ii meant that all plans were shelved postwar after decades of stasis certain highprofile tragedies including thalidomide and social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena the 1967 act  editthe abortion act 1967 sought to clarify the law introduced by david steel and subject to heated debate it allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds with the added protection of free provision through the national health service the act was passed on 27 october 1967 and came into effect on 27 april 1968 62the act provided a defence for doctors performing an abortion on any of the following grounds to save the womans life to prevent grave permanent injury to the womans physical or mental health under 24 weeks to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman under 24 weeks to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the existing child renif the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped before the human fertilisation and embryology act 1990 mended the act the infant life preservation act 1929 acted as a buffer to the abortion act 1967 this meant that abortions could not be carried out if the child was capable of being born alive there was therefore no statutory limit put into the abortion act 1967 the limit being that which the courts decided as the time at which a child could be born alive the c v s case in 1987 reconfirmed that at 19–22 weeks a foetus was not capable of being born alive 57 the 1967 act required that the procedure must be certified by two doctors before being performed later laws  editsince 1967 members of parliament have introduced a number of private members bills to change the abortion law four resulted in substantive debate 1975 63 1976 64 1979 65 1988 66 and 1990 67 but all failed the lane committee investigated the workings of the act in 1974 and declared its support human fertilisation and embryology act 1990  editchanges to the abortion act 1967 were introduced in parliament through the human fertilisation and embryology act 1990 the time limits were lowered from 28 to 24 weeks for most cases on the grounds that medical technology had advanced sufficiently to justify the change restrictions were removed for late abortions in cases of risk to life fetal abnormality or grave
