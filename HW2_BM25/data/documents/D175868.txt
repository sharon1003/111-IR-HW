againstpersonal liability it is however usually treated as a noncorporate business organization for taxpurposes history the llc is a relatively new business form in the united states although it has existed in othercountries for some time in 1977 wyoming became the first state to enact llc legislation it wanted to attract capital and created the statute specifically for a texas oil company w s 1977 ยง 1715101 et seq laws 1977 ch 158 ยง 1 florida followed with its own llc statute in 1982 wests f s a ยง 608401 laws 1982 c 82177 ยง 2 at this point states had little incentive to form an llc because it remained unclear whether the internal revenue service irs would treat an llc as a partnership or as a corporation for tax purposes in 1988 the irs issued a ruling that an llc in wyoming would be treated as a partnership for taxpurposes this allowed the taxable profits and losses of an llc to flow through to the llcsindividual owners unlike a typical corporation an llc would not be taxed as a separate businessorganization after the 1988 irs ruling nearly every state in the united states enacted an llcstatute and the llc now is a widely recognized business form many legal issues concerning the llc are still developing however in 1995 the commissioners on uniform laws approved the uniform limited liability company act it was amended in 1996 unlike other uniform acts related to business entities such as the uniform partnership act the uniform law governing llcs has not been influential as of 2003 onlyeight states and the u s virgin islands had adopted the uniform law the remaining states havedrafted their own laws formation state law governs the creation of an llc persons form an llc by filing required documents withthe appropriate state authority usually the secretary of state most states require the filing of articles of organization these are considered public documents and are similar to articles of incorporation which establish a corporation as a legal entity the llc usually comes into existence on the same day the articles of organization are filed and a filing fee is paid to the secretary of state the minimum information required for the articles of organization varies from state to state generally it includes the name of the llc the name of the person organizing the llc the duration of the llc and the name of the llcs registered agent some states require additional informationsuch as the llcs business purpose and details about the llcs membership and managementstructure in all states an llcs name must include words or phrases that identify it as a limitedliability company these may be the specific words limited liability company or one of variousabbreviations of those words such as llc or ltd liability co structure the owners of an llc are called members and are similar in some respects to shareholders of a corporation a member can be a natural person a corporation a partnership or another legalassociation or entity unlike corporations which may be formed by only one shareholder llcs in most states must be formed and managed by two or more members llcs are therefore unavailable to sole proprietors in addition unlike some closely held or s corporations which are allowed a limited number of shareholders llcs may have any number of members beyond one generally state law outlines the required governing structure of an llc in most states membersmay manage an llc directly or delegate management responsibility to one or more managers managers of an llc are usually elected or appointed by the members some llcs may have onetwo or more managers like a general partner in a limited partnership or an officer in a corporation an llcs manager is responsible for the daytoday management of the business a manager owes a duty of loyalty and care to the llc unless the members consent a managermay not use llc property for personal benefit and may not compete with the llcs business in addition a manager may not engage in selfdealing or usurp an llcs business opportunitiesunless the members consent to a transaction involving such activity after being fully informed of themanagers interest operating agreement nearly every llc maintains a separate written or oral operating agreement which is generallydefined as the agreement between the members that governs the affairs of the llc some statescall an operating agreement regulations or a member control agreement although some states do not require an operating agreement nearly all llcs create and maintain a written document thatdetails their management structure the operating agreement typically provides the procedures for admitting new members outlines thestatus of the llc upon a members withdrawal and outlines the procedures for dissolution of the llc unless state law restricts the contents of an operating agreement members of an llc are free to structure the agreement as they see fit an llc can usually amend or repeal provisions of itsoperating agreement by a vote of its members membership interests a member of an llc possesses a membership interest which usually includes only an economicinterest a membership interest is considered personal property and may be freely transferred to nonmembers or to other members the membership interest usually does not include any right to participate in the management of the llc accordingly if a member assigns or sells a membershipinterest to another person that other person typically receives only the right to the assigningmembers share of profits in the llc persons who receive a membership interest are not able to participate as voting members or managers unless they are admitted as new members state law and an llcs operating agreement or articles of organization provide the circumstancesunder which a person may be admitted as a new member these circumstances vary usually theadmission of a new member requires the consent of existing members and in most cases theconsent must be unanimous in some cases the articles of organization do not allow for admission of new members in others the recipient of a membership interest may be automatically admitted as a new member member contributions members of an llc contribute capital to the llc in exchange for a membership interest there is no minimum amount of capital contribution and members usually can contribute cash property or services by default the total amount of a members capital contribution to an llc determines themembers voting and financial rights in the llc in other words unless an llcs operatingagreement provides for a different arrangement the profits and losses of the llc are sharedproportionally in relation to the members contributions to the llc for example if a memberscapital contributions constitute 40 percent of an llcs capital that member typically has a 40 percent stake in the llc and has more voting power than a member with a 20 percent interest a member may promise a future contribution to an llc in exchange for a membership interest if the member later fails to make the contribution the llc generally may enforce the promise as a contract or sell the members existing interest to remedy the failure distributions of profits or assets to members are usually governed by an llcs operating agreement most state llc laws do not require distributions to members other than when a member withdraws or terminates membership members vote to determine all aspects of distributions to membersincluding amount and timing because a members share of any distribution or loss depends on themembers share of all capital contributions to an llc the llc maintains records of each memberscapital contribution liability state llc statutes specifically provide that members of an llc are not personally liable for the llcs debts and obligations this limited liability is similar to the liability protection for corporateshareholders partners in a limited partnership and partners in a limited liability partnership undercertain circumstances however a member may become personally liable for an llcs debts an individual member is generally personally liable for his or her own torts and for any contractualobligations entered into on behalf of the member and not on behalf of an llc in addition a member is personally liable to a third person if the member personally guarantees a debt or obligation to thethird person a person who incurs debts and obligations on behalf of the llc prior to the llcsformation is jointly and severally liable with the llc for those debts and obligations members may also become personally liable for an llcs debts or obligations under the piercingthecorporateveil theory this doctrine imposes personal liability upon corporate shareholders andapplies primarily if a corporation is undercapitalized fails to follow corporate formalities or engages in fraud although the law of llcs is still developing piercing the corporate veil is likely applicable to an llc that fails to follow the legal formalities required to manage the llc llc statutes in colorado illinois and minnesota specifically apply the corporate veilpiercing theory to llcs a member is generally considered an agent of an llc and thus may bind the llc for the debts andobligations of the business when a member has apparent or actual authority and acts on behalf of an llc while carrying on the usual business of the llc the member binds the llc if a third personknows that the member is not authorized to act on behalf of the llc the llc is generally not liablefor the members unauthorized acts some states also limit a members authority to act as an agent of an llc records and books many llc statutes require an llc to maintain sufficient books and records of its business andmanagement affairs this requirement varies from state to state the books and records generallydetail the members contributions to the llc the llcs financial and tax data and other financialand management information like a partnerships books an llcs books generally must be kept at the llcs principal place of business and each member must have access to and must be allowed to inspect and copy the books upon reasonable demand taxation prior to 1997 the irs generally treated an llc as a partnership for federal income tax purposes if an llc is taxed as a partnership its members are taxed only on their share of the llc profits anygains losses credits and deductions flow through the llc to the members who report them as income and losses on their personal tax return the irs developed a system for determining whether an llc was formed more like a corporation or more like a partnership under prior regulations if the irs determined that the llcs operation wasmore similar to a corporation the llc is taxed as a corporation meaning that both the llc and itsmembers were taxed specifically the irs observed whether the llc had such characteristics as limited liability centralized management free transferability of interests and continuity of life however the irs passed regulations in 1996 effective in 1997 that allowed llc members to electwhether the company is a corporation or a partnership for taxation purposes 26 c f r ยง 30177013 2002 the regulations known as checkthebox regulations generally freed llc owners fromworrying about whether their method of operation would require them to pay corporate taxes instead of partnership taxes accordingly many llcs may operate similar to a corporation centralizedmanagement with member owners yet the members may enjoy taxes that flow through the entity member withdrawal members may withdraw from an llc unless the operating agreement or articles of organization limittheir ability to do so a member must usually provide to the llc written notice that he or sheintends to withdraw if a withdrawal violates the operating agreement the withdrawing member may be liable to the other members or the llc for damages associated with it state law frequently setsforth the circumstances under which a member may withdraw from an llc in many states a member may withdraw only if he or she provides six months written notice of the intent to withdraw in a few states an llc cannot prevent a members withdrawal a member who withdraws is usually entitled to a return of his capital contribution to an llc unlessthe withdrawal is unauthorized some llcs instead pay a withdrawing member the fair market value of his or her membership interest the operating agreement typically provides for the method andmanner of payment of a withdrawing members interest state law also governs those issues dissolution dissolution means the legal end of an llcs existence in most states an llc legally dissolvesupon the death disability withdrawal bankruptcy or expulsion of a member these occurrencesare generally called disassociations other circumstances that bring about dissolution includebankruptcy of the llc a court order or the fulfillment of the llcs stated period of duration most states provide for the continuation of an llc after the disassociation or withdrawal of a member continuation after a members disassociation usually requires the remaining membersunanimous consent some states require that the articles of organization or operating agreementallow for the continuation of the business after a members disassociation some states allow an llcs articles of organization or operating agreement to require the continuation of the businessafter a members dissociation even if the remaining members do not provide unanimous consent if an llc dissolves state law and the llcs operating agreement usually outline the process forwinding up the llcs business in this process the llc pays off its remaining creditors anddistributes any remaining assets to its members the llcs creditors receive priority althoughmembers may be creditors they are not creditors in determining the members distributive shares of any remaining assets after the llc pays off its creditors and only then it distributes the remainingassets to its members either in proportion to the members shares of profits or under some otherarrangement outlined in the operating agreement after an llc winds up its business most statesrequire it to file
