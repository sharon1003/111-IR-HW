live science animals why koalas hug trees by tia ghose staff writer  june 3 2014 0701pm etmorekoalas live in trees in australia and eat mostly eucalyptus leaves credit cbriscoe the mention of a koala bear often conjures up an image of an adorable spoonnosed creature cocking its head to one side while clinging to a tree now scientists have figured out why the iconic australian marsupials hug trees the trunks help the koala bears keep cool according to a new study it can be a really useful way of getting rid of heat on a hot day said study coauthor michael kearney an ecologist at the university of melbourne in australia tree huggers given that koalas spend so much time in trees — the marsupials live in australias woodlands where they munch on leaves and sleep — nobody wondered why they hugged the trunks people just thought they were taking a break on a more stable spot after eating leaves in the branches kearney said  marsupial gallery a pouchful of cuteas such the discovery came as a surprise kearney and his student doctoral candidate natalie briscoe were trying to predict how the woodland creatures on french island near melbourne would regulate their body temperatures as the continent heats up due to climate change the region is cool most of the year but during the summer the temperature routinely spikes above 104 degrees fahrenheit 40 degrees celsius kearney said briscoe measured wind and shade levels using a portable weather station but didnt find any striking trends then she pointed to an infrared thermometer which measures temperature based on thermal radiation at the tree trunks the koalas were hugging the trunks were considerably cooler than the ambient air temperature — sometimes by as much as 9 degrees f 5 degrees c kearney said she also noticed the koalas clinging to acacia trees even though they normally eat eucalyptus leaves  see images of the treehugging koalasas it got hotter the koalas went farther down the trees and started to really hug onto the tree trunks kearney told live science that seemed strange to us until we figured out that the trees are a bit cooler stay cool koala bears pant to keep cool letting evaporated moisture from their mouths carry heat away from their bodies when the team modeled koala bear heat transfer they found the treedwellers save half the water they would have used panting if they hug trees instead koalas get most of their water from their diet but because eucalyptus leaves are laced with a toxin the koalas can eat only a limited amount before the toxin harms the animals kearney said so treehugging could be critical to their survival on hot days by allowing them to cool off without wasting precious water through panting kearney said its not clear exactly why their preferred tree trunks are cool but one possibility is that they pull in a lot of groundwater which stays closer to the annual average air temperature rather than the current air temperature he said climate change planning koalas food and hugging trees will change their range with the hotter and drier weather brought by climate change bill ellis a wildlife researcher at the university of queensland in australia who was not involved in the study wrote in an email to live science but the new study suggests that food may be a smaller consideration in preserving koala habitat than previously thought he said as long as we plant trees koalas will eat perhaps the other trees we plant just need to provide the right mix of shelter and heat sink characteristics ellis said its quite an interesting concept but nonnative trees might be the future for koalas — as long as they also have the right fodder farther north in the koalas range the air is muggy and it feels hotter so scientists should see how treehugging plays out in in different locations in the koalas habitat ellis said humidity means that the power of evaporation for cooling is reduced kearney said so treehugging may be even more important up north where evaporative cooling doesnt work as well he said the study was published today june 3 in the journal biology letters follow tia ghose on twitter and google follow live sciencelivescience facebook
