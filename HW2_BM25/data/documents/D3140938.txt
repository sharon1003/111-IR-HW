octavia chuckled at the comment“finn and bellamy” your eyes widened“really didn’t think you had it in you rave octavia tell us yours”“my only is lincoln” she finished still pondering the thought of raven with bellamy before you got a chance to tell them yours you caught bellamy looking at you o and raven both searched for where your eyes were leading to bell they knew why you were avoiding him only he didn’t know why“you’ll have to talk to him eventually yn” raven and octavia were your best friends and they always knew what was best for you o didn’t want to talk to her brother either but still wanted you to talk to him“why should i you’re not on good terms with him either octavia” you raised your voice a little bit and immediately regretted it“he needs you get yourself together and go help him” o was right he did need your help more than ever and you were the only one who could help him you immediately got up and started walking over towards him he grabbed your wrists and pulled you to his tent raven and octavia were watching you two giving you thumbs up once you got to his tent you could see how angry he was with you he zipped the tent door and turned to look at you “why have you been avoiding me”“i don’t know what you mean” of course you did but you didn’t want him to know“yes you do ever since pike became chancellor you’ve been avoiding me” you couldn’t lie now“what you did was wrong bellamy you massacred 300 innocent people who were sent to protect us” you started to get riled up knowing you’d start to yell so you clenched your fists and jaw to stop yourself from taking it out on him“they could’ve attacked us and you know it yn” he knew he was wrong but was too stubborn to admit it“but they didn’t that was all you” he hated himself for making you upset bellamy began“i was just trying to save my people our people” he put his hands on your arms in a comforting manner you pushed his hands back“by doing the wrong thing they were innocent they didn’t attack what don’t you get about that bell” he furrowed his eyebrows he knew you were mad but he didn’t know what to do about it”“yn i” he tried to hug you but you put your hands on his chest and pushed him away from you“ don’t ” you unzipped the tent and started to walk outside but bellamy’s large hands gripped your waist“you chose the wrong side bellamy blake” you felt tears brimming your eyes as you stormed out of his tent hugging yourself octavia and raven rushed up to you and held you in their arms as you walked back to an empty corridor to calm down and have some water you could feel bellamy watching you as you leave his eyes filling with tears he was genuinely sorry for hurting you and wished he could hold you in his arms to tell you that everything was going to be okay but it wasn’t not if he continues to do what he’s doing with pike it had been an hour since your meltdown and you needed space you went to your favorite waterfall you and bellamy would go there to be alone together before this mess happened the rebellion against marcus kane brought out the worst in bellamy someone you didn’t know was there your anger was diminished when you fought with lincoln it was a place where you felt you could lay out all of your anger and turn it into good self defense bellamy blake had been protective over you but started to let go once you became good at fighting even octavia looked up to you and your undeniable skills the waterfall was your sacred space only a place where you and bellamy knew every time you left arkadia to go find peace you’d leave all of your emotions behind and enjoy the moment you knew these small moments of happiness would soon turn into memories with that said spending them away from bellamy was hard once you reached the waterfall it only took you a second to realize that someone else was there you saw him in the water he was cooling off taking a break rather understanding the need for quiet you left him to be at peace you turned to walk away from him as a twig snapped under your foot“yn” bellamy turned to face you as your figure appeared from the trees“yeah it’s me” you didn’t know how to get out of this situation all you wanted was to relax and sit by the waterfall“what’re you doing here” bellamy furrowed his eyebrows as he walked closer to you still in the water“same reason why you’re here” you moved over to the water and sat down on the rocks bellamy looked at you with sad eyes he knew you could never say no to his puppy face“please join me yn i’m lonely in here” he made the face you couldn’t resist and you gave in you started to strip down starting with your boots the clothes you were wearing except for your bra and underwear disappeared poof gone bellamy’s grin grew wide across his lips as he reached his hand out for you you took it and shivered as the water was shockingly cold you started to warm up as your entire body was engulfed by water it was a struggle especially because you weren’t tall bellamy picked you up and held you by your waist as you wrapped your legs around his torso“i’m sorry yn i have my beliefs and you have yours but i don’t want to fight again” you didn’t know whether you should give your opinion or keep quiet and enjoy the moment“are you sorry because of your actions or sorry for me” it hurt you to say that but bellamy’s actions hurt you even more“both i can’t promise you that i’ll leave pike but what i can promise you is your boyfriend back and on fulltime duty” your cheeks flamed red as you blushed feeling like the only girl in the world bellamy had this effect on you as bell’s hand moved further down your back you leaned in to kiss him slowly yet passionately“i love you yn”“i love you even more bell”an second imagine requests open and please give
