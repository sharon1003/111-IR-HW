catalysis about transcript get a better appreciation for how enzymes and substrates bind together by ross firestone created by ross firestone google classroom facebook twitter email questions tips  thanks top recent video transcript so today im going to talk to you about the induced fit model of enzyme catalysis and how this concept can tell us a lot about how enzymes work but before we do that lets review the idea that enzymes make reactions go faster and when you look at a reaction on a reaction coordinate diagram youd see that the catalyzed reaction would have a much smaller activation energy than the uncatalyzed one also remember that because of this the energy of the catalyzed reactions transition state is far lower than the energy of the uncatalyzed reactions transition state so what do enzymes look like well most enzymes are proteins or at least partially made up of protein and substrates are any molecule that an enzyme will act on and often these substrates are the reactants that the enzyme will ultimately help turn into products through a reaction now enzymes also have what is called the active site which is the location on the enzyme where substrates bind and thats where the reaction ultimately happens and its important to recognize that every enzyme has a unique active site that will only bind to certain substrates and just to clarify ive referred to the active site here as both of the notches found on the enzyme and not the space in between them so here of the two substrates ive drawn the enzyme will only be able to bind to substrate 1 since they fit together like puzzle pieces whereas the shape of substrate 2 isnt going to fit nicely in the enzymes active site now since enzymes have unique active sites we say that enzymes are specific to certain substrates and by extension certain reactions but lets dive a little deeper into what happens when enzymes and substrates bind to each other and how that binding pattern changes as a reaction progresses so first youll have your enzyme here and your substrate over here and im just going to label this with the number 1 since itll be the first thing that happens in the sequence of events to come and at this stage nothing has happened yet and the enzyme and the substrate have yet to come in contact so next what will happen is the enzyme will bind to the substrate but this binding wont be perfect so well call this initial binding which is stage 2 of the process and what that means is that the forces holding these two together are strong but theyre not at their maximum strength just yet and enzymes and substrates dont actually fit together quite like puzzle pieces and they actually work a little bit more like two pieces of clay that will both mold together so that the fit is much tighter so in our next step this is exactly what happens the enzyme and the substrate will both change shape a little bit and bind to each other really strongly and we call this the induced fit because both the enzyme and the substrate have changed their shape a little bit so that they bind together really tightly and its at this point where the reaction that the enzyme is catalyzing is at full force and this would be stage 3 so our next stage occurs after the reaction is completed and the binding becomes similar to what it was in stage 2 but the difference here is that there was something different about the substrate so in this reaction the enzyme is cutting our substrate into two parts so now the two parts have become separated and this would occur after the reaction is finished and well call this stage 4 now in our next and last stage the products of the reaction have been released from the enzyme and our enzyme is back in the same state that it was in stage 1 and well call this stage 5 now lets look at this from a slightly different angle im going to label the enzyme as e the substrate as s and our two products as p1 and p2 and theyre going to represent this series of events these different steps in the sequence of reactions so first well have e and s separate and this is stage 1 and next e and s will bind to each other to form an enzyme substrate complex which i have called es and it corresponds to stage 2 from before now whats really interesting is that in the next step where we had the induced fit of stage 3 were actually at the transition state of the entire reaction and this is the same as that really high energy point that we saw at the beginning of this video and its at the point of the transition state where our enzyme is most tightly bound to its substrate now ive written the substrate out here with the letter x because of the reactions transition state our substrate isnt quite a reactant and it isnt quite our product either its somewhere in between so thats why ive written it out as x instead of s and ive also written this double dagger symbol which is just a universal symbol for transition states now in our next stage which is after the reaction has occurred since it exists after the transition stage we have the enzyme bound to the two products p1 and p2 and this was stage 4 from before and then finally in our last stage stage 5 we have our enzyme which is now separated from our two products p1 and p2 now the big m away from this is that binding between enzyme and substrate is strongest at the reactions transition state and this is because the enzyme and the substrate have molded together and thats why we call it the induced fit now some enzymes will actually bind to more than one substrate and if we look at a reaction that might be familiar which is lactic acid fermentation we can see that our enzyme lactase dehydrogenase will have space to bind to two different substrates in this reaction one space being for nadh and the other being for pyruvate so enzymes dont necessarily bind just to one substrate now sometimes things will bind to enzymes at places other than their active sites and we call this allosteric binding so if we have an enzyme here with its active site a regulating molecule like an inhibitor made by the enzyme at a different location than the enzymes active site now when something binds to an enzyme like this it usually has the effect of changing the shape of an enzyme in some way to affect its ability to catalyze reactions so in this case when an inhibitor binds top the enzyme it might change the shape of the active site thereby inhibiting the enzyme as its no longer able to bind to its intended substrate they dont quite fit together anymore so while enzymes bind to reactive groups at their active sites they can also bind to regulators at their allosteric sites and allosteric sites just refer to any binding site outside of the active site and remember allosterically binding molecules can either be activators or inhibitors any regulating molecule so what did we learn well first we learned that enzymes are specific and that they can each bind to only specific substrates to catalyze specific reactions next we learned about the induced fit model and how enzymes bind their substrates most tightly in the middle of a reaction at the reactions transition state and finally we learned that enzymes have both active sites and allosteric sites with active sites being where the reaction takes place and allosteric sites being where regulation takes place
