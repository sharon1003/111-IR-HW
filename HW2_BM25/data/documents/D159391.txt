they were in the car the whole time by that time woody and buzz have put all tensions aside and become friends later that year during christmas he receives a puppy though his bond with this new pet is never developed beyond his excitement about having one toy story 2in toy story 2 four years after the events in toy story andy is now 10 years old and is seen only at the beginning and for a short while at the ending however during the short time he is in the movie it is easy to tell that he still loves his toys very much and they still feel the same about him while woody is having a nightmare after his arm accidentally ripped while playing with buzz andy notices his rip saying that he does not want to play with woody anymore and drops him into the cards left on the floor by rex and mr potato head which lead woody to land into a trash can filled with severed hands woody sees this yelling andy not to do it and the severed hands grabs him by the neck sinking him and andy sadly says

years old and preparing to go away to college intending to put most of his toys in the attic except for woody whom he initially plans to take with him while he apparently hasnt played with them for some years ago he still cares about them and is visibly upset when he cant find them anywhere at the end of the film due to woodys interference he decides to give them other than woody to bonnie the daughter of a family friend who he realizes will look after them when she finds woody in the box as well andy shows great reluctance to pass on his favorite toy but ultimately relents allowing them to stay together in an environment where theyll be loved and played with he spends a while playing with bonnie and the toys one last time before leaving for college toy story of terroralthough andy doesnt appear in toy story of terror he is mentioned by ron when he notices andys name on woodys boot thinking that its his name toy story that time forgot andy was mentioned by rex in toy story that time forgot while trying to make trixie feel better about never being played with as a dinosaur gallery the disney wiki has a collection of images and media related to andy davis trivia the address of the davis second and current home is 234 elm street andy has been voiced by john morris in every single toy story movie toy story 3 was morris first role in more than a decade the end credits of the first toy story movie has andys mom credited as mrs davis confirming andys last name is davis the beginning chapter of the book that contains rex s pov of toy story 2 and the pixar pedia also show this however it as well as andys full name andrew is not displayed onscreen until toy story 3 where it is written on his high school graduation diploma the original plans for a woodys nightmare scene in toy story has andy throwing woody in a trash can that gets trucked out to an alley when he notices that buzz glows in the dark while woody doesnt however this was ultimately unused although only storyboards exist but finally found a place in toy story 2 when andy trashes woody because of his ripped arm andys cell phone number is 5550112 a number that is also seen in monsters university when mike shows sulley a newspaper with the mailroom ad on it at the end of toy story 3 he calls jessie and bullseye by their actual names it is unknown how he learned their names although he may have learned them from one of jessies pull string phrases which the reallife jessie doll does say or by either watching their show or investigating about them on the internet or from friends the shot of andy giving woody a ride on his back at the end of toy story 3 recalls one of the home videos his mom has made at the beginning of the film when young andy has done the same in the third film when andy is at his toy chest deciding whether he should keep woody or buzz it echoes the first film when he decides which to sleep with in toy story andy chooses buzz to sleep with in his bed in toy story 3 he chooses woody to take with to college woody and buzz mentioned andy when they were at the 2016 oscars if andy was six in toy story and if the film was set in the year it was released  1995  then andys birthday would have to be in 1989 this would also mean that toy story 3s release  2010 would not be the year of which the film would be set in it would have to be 2007 this would also mean that his sister molly would be born in 1994 and that she would be 13 in 2007 however since none of the films or sources state any specific year where the films take place in it is up to interpertation the
