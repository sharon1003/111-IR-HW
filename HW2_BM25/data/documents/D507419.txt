thyroxine is crippling my stomach been taking gaviscon but shouldntcatsndogs 4 years ago 13 replies since starting my levothyroxine my old stomach problems have erupted terrible heartburn indigestion and awful pain that radiates up into my very teeth especially troublesome when i try and lie down i have been using long term omeprazole but now also using gaviscon usually shortly beforeafter taking my pills on going to bed otherwise i need to get back up because my stomach is giving me bother i take the levo on going to bed due to not feeling wonderful after taking it i just read on an information leaflet that nothing like gaviscon should be taken for a few hours beforeafter levo medication any ideas please on what i can do these pills seem to be causing me more problems than solutions i certainly cant see my stomach being able to handle this long term feels like swallowing bleachmaybe there is an obvious solution but im not seeing it just now many thanks if anyone can think of anything regards read more about gaviscon levothyroxine omeprazole thyroxine underactive thyroid13 replies oldest â€¢ newest moggie4 years ago go straight back to your gps and tell him what is going on it could well be the fillers they put in the levo that is causing this and there are plenty of them but for cases are bad as yours there is a liquid eltroxin that can be given it is expensive so your gp might try and refuse you but if he does i would definately take this further as you obviously cannot go on like this does you gp know you are having these sort of problems and is heshe the kind of gp to want to go that extra mile to sort it out moggie x replycatsndogs4 years ago thank you moggie im afraid my gp is a little on the vile side lol he refused to give me the levothyroxine and i got a private script after seeing a certain well known dr s i fear that if i mention any of my troubles to the gp he will just gloat and want the medication stopped i have been to the gp with multiple other health issues and i just get fobbed off i even changed to another practice after much poor service but this practice is just as rotten to the core i should maybe try and contact the prescribing doc  dr s  but i find it most difficult to make contact as i can never get an answer on the phone and leaving a message is a hit and miss kind of thing thank you most kindly for your answer reply moggie4 years ago your welcome and i wish i could suggest something else is there not another doctor you can see at the practise i tried four at my practise until i found the right one well one that was better than all the others anyway you really cant go on like you are so maybe write to dr s and ask his advise wishing you the very best of luck moggie x replyshaws administrator4 years ago i am sorry you are having stomach problems you have to ask to be referred to a gastroenterologist i have read that omezaparole is only to be used short term about six weeks most of us do not know whether we have low acid or high acid as symptoms are the same this is a linkstopthethyroidmadnesscoms with hypo everything slows down i hope you are able to get some relief soon1 like replyvajra4 years ago the acid symptoms sound very familiar cd right down to taking too many rennies may not be a great idea either  lots of sugar and calcium i think i develop a tendency to a very acid stomach if i end up even slightly hypothyroid or get stressed at least i think thats the cause hypothyroidism is certainly known to compromise gut function so separately from any reaction to fillers etc if the t4 wasnt working so well or was triggering some sort of disimprovement in conversion to t3 andor use of it its possible it could be contributing i did better by managing my diet carefully to avoid foods that worsened it but could never quite escape it it was actually difficult to categorise exactly what the trigger was  but anything additive confectionery gluten related or less than very bland seemed to cause all sorts of problems i found that high cortisol levels probably caused by chronic stress contributed most of all to my problem  it messes with the digestive process todaysdietitiancomnewarch  but it can also causes hypothyroidism by messing with t3 use as above just a surmise  but cortisol andor related hypothyroidism could well be at the root of how the gut ends up so sensitive to filers etc in meds  too it cleared instantly a few months ago with increasing the proportion of t3 i was taking for the same equivalent dose of thyroid and more particularly with getting my cortisol levels under better control instant end to the acidity and to the alternating constipation an opposite that was more or less normal this certainly added a spring to my step  id been convinced that i had developed some sort of allergy issue or similar it was amazing to have it disappear in a day or two high cortisol can be a very subtle problem we get used to the feeling and dont notice it its nominally the result of short term stress and should clear  but in practice the brain can end up wiredthe hypothalmus can end up reprogrammed by months and years of wallowing in high levels of cortisol down to long term situational or maybe post traumatic or even foetal stress so that we produce much more than normal for the situation weve been discussing managing high cortisol in the last month or twoian replyhelvon4 years ago im sorry but i dont like to hear of pain which radiates up to someones teeth as this sounds like jaw pain and maybe angina linked to your heart maybe it is not but i think you should have it checked1 like replysarahstevenson4 years ago dr p says by using antacids we can be exacerbating the situation the body is over producing acid due to low levels so adding more alkali causes it to make even more acid taking nutri gest might give a clue as to whether this is whats happening for you might be worth a trial i find it helps me at times2 likes replyvajrain reply to sarahstevenson4 years ago it wasnt a fix but i found a small amount maybe 1 tea spoon of cider vinegar in water quite effective to relieve the acid tendency for periods tastes horrible thoughian1 like replysarahstevensonin reply to vajra4 years ago hi ian just logged on after my salad lunch with cider vinegar dressing to find your reply  havent tried it in water though i am trying to ignore my gallbladder flare at the moment  head in the sand and salads and soups with focus on protein and fermented foods too the packing agent questio is a really interesting one catsndogs  i am finding liothyronine issues as i am on t3 only it seems the nhs mercurypharma version is not suiting me whilst cynomel at the same dose helps much more significantly i seemed to be intolerant of levo alhtough eltroxin was the best for me no proof that it was conversion  cellular absorption or possibly a packing agent problem but endo decided t3 only was the way to go my physio acupuncturist has suggested i try lamberts candaway and acidophilus to kill any candida and promote good bacteria only  on day 3 and not sure yet seems to be in line with izabella wentz new book hashimotos root cause although im overwhelmed with all the foods that could be culprits  one step at a time1 like replyvajrain reply tosarahstevenson4 years ago hi s candida seems to be a fairly typical consequence of mixing modern sugar and carbohydrate heavy diets with stressunhealthy living sleeping and working habits it leads to chronically raised cortisol  which if maintained for extended periods may lead to eventual hypothyroidism adrenal fatigue and auto immune issues  and the often associated gut problems especially if weve been taking antibiotics for eg the oft associated colds sinus and urinary tract infections the classic anticandida diet no sugarno simple fast burning carbs no wheatflour or gluten no milk watch for problem foods and eliminate depending on sensitivities gut healing supplements minerals as suggested by tests issues etc with a reduction in stresslife changes is probably the first step in heading off andor reducing hashimotos and similar auto immune issues too i suspect  in those of us with gut issues failure to respond risks these issues progressing on into much harder to treat thyroid damagehypothyroidism and adrenal issues  not to mention the food sensitivities and absorbtion issues so many report theres even a developing a view that the various bug populations in our gut and the rest of out bodies communicate by quantum means at the energetic level  that they play an important part in the management of our wellbeing and effectively function as though they were organs itll be a while until conservative medicine gets its head around that possibility the pity in all of this is that problems require nipping in the bud which requires docs to recognise chronic stress and early stage metabolic illness for what it is and treat it  instead of blaming depression and the like until the situation becomes much more serious and infinitely more difficult to treat our own macho conditioning even the ladies makes it hard for us to even recognise that were ill and have real problems developing  we tend to try to bull on regardless its so important to respond to even subtle hints from the body like reduced energy and fatigue that all is not well were often not aware enough to do so those of us that eventually figure out whats going on for ourselves are typically by then far enough down the road that were well into the latter scenario i was consulting with doctors to find the cause of a fatigue from the late 80s but wasnt really ill with hypothyroidism until the mid 90s  and until then didnt know enough to realise that i was headed for serious troubleneeded to act decisively even then and despite obvious symptoms getting a diagnosis proved despite many attempts impossible your thyroid is normal must be depression and it was 2005 almost 20 years later before i ended up in hospital with what proved to be a thyroid cancer advanced auto immune disease and life threatening blood pressure
