answerscom ® wiki answers ® categories science physics electricity and magnetism electromagnetic radiation what part of the visible electromagnetic spectrum is most absorbed by water flag what part of the visible electromagnetic spectrum is most absorbed by water answer by delta wyatt water is cyan because it absorbs red light the froth in the waves is white because like clouds it is composed of variety of tiny water droplets that scatter light of all the visible frequencies water is transparent to light of nearly all the visible frequencies it strongly absorbs infrared waves water molecules resonate to the frequencies of infrared energy of the infrared waves is transformed into internal energy in the water which causes red light to be a little more strongly absorbed in water than blue light electromagnetic waves that stimulate the sensation of color when the vibrations interact with the coneshaped receiving antennae in the retinas of our eyes our eyeto brain interactions produce the beautiful colors we see1 person found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no quirkyquantummechanic 135338 contributions what is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum called we call that the visible or optical spectrum wardell lindsay 4673 contributions i am writing books promoting the use of quaternion mathematics because quaternions are natures numbers is most of the electromagnetic spectrum composed of visible light no only a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is composed of visible light roughly the range of 400 terahertz to 800 tera hertz is visible light the spectrum …the part of the electromagnetic spectrum most absorbed by water ishigher frequencies in the visble the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum falls between whatbetween the infrared and ultraviolet ranges srdgato 23 contributions visible light occupies which position in which part of the electromagnetic spectrum visible light is between 380 and 750 nm with lower wavelength you have ultraviolet xray and gammaray with higher wavelength infrared microwave and radio signals the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum falls between the balmer series halfmoonkick 23 contributions what part of the electromagnetic spectrum has the most energy the waves with higher frequencies have more energy and the gamma rays have the most energy in the electromagnetic spectrum what are not visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum you cant see the different colors that are shown mailikespie 35 contributions is any part of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to the human eye well only a small part of it the list from weakest radiation to strongest on the electromagnetic spectrum radio microwave infrared visible light ultra violet xray gamma al cohen 126337 contributions senior fellow in electrical engineering waves that make up the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum have   wavelengths between roughly 380 and 750 nanometers al cohen 126337 contributions senior fellow in electrical engineering who proposed that visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum james clerkmaxwell did al cohen 126337 contributions senior fellow in electrical engineering is visible light a large or small part of the electromagnetic spectrum visible light is a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum out of the more than 50 octaves of frequency that everyone would agree are included in the spectrum visi …al cohen 126337 contributions senior fellow in electrical engineering answered in electromagnetic radiation is visible light part of a larger electromagnetic spectrum yes it is a very small part in fact the phenomena you know as radio microwave heat infrared ultraviolet xrays and gamma rays are all exactly the same physical en …al cohen 126337 contributions senior fellow in electrical engineering answered in biology which part of visible spectrum is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments apparently pretty much everything except green al cohen 126337 contributions senior fellow in electrical engineering answered in visible light spectrum is the the visible spectrum occupies most of the electromagnetic and sonar spectrum the visible spectrum is a tiny almost negligible slice of the electromagnetic spectrum sonar has no place in this discussion its not even electromagnetic jeff acklin 351363 contributions you can maintain power over people as long as you give them something rob a man of everything and that man will no longer be in your power answered in physics what parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are not visible to the unaided human eye light in the range of 390700 nanometers roughly 430790terahertz is visible to most humans this is in the top third ofthe em spectrum roughly between the near ultraviolet …quirkyquantummechanic 135338 contributions answered in electromagnetic radiation what wave is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum it is visible light that is part of the visibleelectromagnetic em spectrum
