most probably during the high middle ages around the late 13th or the early 14th century the songs and styles cover a number of topics and the most common themes like the twa sisters are found all over the north sea the twa sisters is by far the most popular as the song is documented all over the areafrom iceland hörpukvædi to sweden systrarna denmark den fortrollede fiolen and norway where a number of related versions are documented this particular song is even found in finland a norwegian version traditionally sung click here origins people were at odds about where and when the ballad originated it was clear that the style owed a lot to the french medieval romance and arthurian legend but something didnt add up eventually scholars agreed upon it originating at the court of norwegian king hakon v who died 1319 thus the place the style was invented was actually oslo at the fortress of akershus and in the courts of the king development came gradually but the dance tunes at the norwegian court became high fashion in the late 13th century as the king held his court in town and had a good contact with the french by 1310 this chivalry style spread out and became high fashion most of this can be owed to the norwegian queen who saw to it that a lot of french romance was translated this trend had actually florished as early as in the 1260s when a good portion of european literature came in norse translations much of this material contributed to the ballad style later in the 1500s danish collectors gathered a large amount of songs as performed in denmark and those books were popular at the danish court in the time of king christian iv in denmark the ballad never was forgotten and at this point of time english and scottish ballads also florished see child ballads  in norway declining into a medieval stasis the songs were out of fashion when new instrumental music came in use but they were still sung as epics and never actually forgotten collections in the romantic nationalist movements folk music became interesting and about 1853 norwegian priest magnus brostrup landstad wrote and edited a whole lot of them careful to keep the old pronouncements and styles in the dialects this book became a breakthrough for more collectors for comparative cultural research giving the scholars opportunity to compare the english material the danish the norwegian and the swedish the faroe islands became particularly interesting because the people there also danced and still dances their songs as they apparently have done for hundreds of years norwegian enthusiasts who wished to revive a long lost tradition found their clues there and began a whole new way of performing the songs also to more recent melodies and songs because of immigration the style was bound for america and thus the strain of appalachian ballads emerged styles the medieval ballads has a number of subgroups not all of them chivalric some of them rather nonsensical the real chivalry ballads concerning a knight in shining armor and dames in high towers the troll ballads most of those are found in norway concerns pagan heroes and recycles elements from norse mythology even the god thor gets a cameo here the heroes fight trolls ballads of abduction and natural myth concerning the fair folk abduction mostly the mountain king getting a girl from a human community or a knight or suitor pissing off an elf maiden murder ballads feature here because the abductor often is a secondary world power in norway the heroine gets the better of him  in the us he gets the better of her  pretty polly  religious ballads or saintly stories often concerning the virgin mary the greatest ballad to be found the dream ballad draumkvedet stands out as this is equivalent of the divine comedy sung in ballad metre it was first written down in a secluded area of telemark and the song was found only there the source was a 19 year old girl who had learned the song from her father animal stories and joking songs like froggie went a courting or stories of wooing insects or of a beast so huge twenty feet long and forty feet wide that the sole killing of it is a feat in itself or stories om people who are complete jerkasses and social satire related material the ballad style serves as a father to the staff singing in norway stev particularly the old staves  gamalstev  who share the rythmic pattern with the ballad sometimes single verses can double as staves and as ballad verses this is very common in the telemark area melodies are abundant as the ballads were sung all over the country style the ballad comes in different metres and with different refrains the staff variety comes in four lines with or without refrains this variety is found all over the north sea area a second variety has two lines and an ending refrains while a third would put a repeating phrase in between the lines and an ending to boot sometimes one line is repeated twice with a follow up line in the end without any refrains mostly the repeated lines refer to dancing my maiden dances in the meadow the ballads are stock full of formulas sometimes to the point of meaninglessness this makes the songs easy to memorize but may also be bit bewildering the song tradition contains tropes like these the ace heming stated in tradition to be the best skier ever and he usually outwits the trolls and the king canon immigrant yvain hailing from arthurian legend is the main character and occasional buttmonkey in a number of scandinavian ballads cliché storm not surprising when you consider the ballads rely heavily on formulas over time the formulaic mode got stale with rather surreal results downer ending the ballads of abduction seldom ends well for the abducted the chivalric ballads usually ends
