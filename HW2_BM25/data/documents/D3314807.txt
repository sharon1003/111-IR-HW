if the park is calling your name this winter you’re probably in the market for one of the best freestyle skis these products differ slightly from other types of skis and i’ll show you everything you need to consider when making your decision – after you’ll see my top picks for men and women by the time you’re done reading i’m sure you’ll see a piece of equipment that suits you perfectly ready how to choose freestyle skis there’s a couple things you need to think about when selecting skis for the park the most important are picking a gender specific product look at length and width smaller features ski profile weight core etc first and foremost if you’re a man you’ll want a ski made specifically for you and if you’re a woman you’ll want a pair made specifically for you this has nothing to do with skill or ability but more the needs and size differences between the genders men tend to be taller and heavier and a men’s freestyle ski will cater to that – same with a woman after you have that figured out you’ll want to shift your attention to the length and width of the skis here’s a helpful graph to assist in this department because you’ll want a little more agility and mobility out of your freestyle skis you’ll want to go a little shorter so if you’re 5 ’10” choose a product closer to 165cm park skis almost exclusively deal with groomed trails too this means you’ll want a product a bit on the narrow side somewhere between 80mm to 85mm if you expect to ride trails with your new skis you’ll want to go a little wider than that around 90mm to 99mm this will make them a little more all mountain this is the exact opposite of powder skis which need to be wider this is because they don’t deal with groomed trails and are meant for fresh deep powder lastly you’ll want to look at the smaller features that make up the ski again park skis won’t deal with fresh powder too often and this mean they’ll have a camber and rocker tip profile that’s suited for the park you’ll also want a product that’s lightweight and easy to maneuver in the air all the skis on the list are designed specifically to excel in the park and will do fine in this area now that you know exactly what to consider when making your purchase let’s take a look at my top picks for men now directly after you’ll see my top picks for women best freestyle skis for men atomic infamous company atomic price rating 485the atomic infamous’ is not the first choice for an expert level or a very advanced park skier this is the perfect freestyle ski for anyone new to rails jumps and half pipes or if you’re in the intermediate range – it caters to this type of rider one thing i really like about the infamous’ is their lightweight design this is due to the fact it has a light wood core that minimizes overall weight and gives you more agility and liveliness it also comes with step down sidewall 20 that prevents damage and provides a smooth comfortable ride tough edges won’t chip or crack when you take on rails and boxes underfoot is designed to help give you more consistent landings when you hit jumps park rocker ski profile is handy in all things park related the price for this piece of equipment is excellent too what makes this price even better is the fact they have a 2 year warranty most skis won’t come with that type of guarantee and this is especially true for park skis think about all the different ways you can crack a ski when hitting rails if you decide on the infamous’ at least you know you’ll get a few years out of them before needing to replace them armada edollo company armada price rating 495if you’re looking for a playful ski that let’s you get creative out there you should definitely consider the armada edollo’s this product gives you a sense of freedom and allows you to tackle any part of the park you desire the edollo’s is the creation of x games gold medalist henrik harlaut – if it’s good enough for him it’s good enough for you some features that you’ll like include ar nose rocker ski profile that makes turning easy to initiate and helps you grip hybrid double core zone is very stable and gives you more control carbon fiber materials that add a bit of durability and make these ski lively s7 base that doesn’t take much to maintain i wouldn’t purchase the edollo’s if you have no experience on rails or in the park you need pretty good skill to click in to them this year at the very minimum you have to be a strong intermediate since this product is such quality it’s going to cost a little extra honestly this is a pretty fair price for what you’re getting though some things are worth paying a little extra for and a good pair of skis definitely fall into that category plus they’re pretty decent for trail skiing too k2 sight company k2price rating 475maybe you’ve been a trail skier your whole life and you’re tempted to take your talents into the park or maybe you have a little experience with big air and rails and want to get better this season if this sounds like you the k2 sight’s just might be the skis you’ve been looking for the slim waist on these make them perfect for groomed trails and the all terrain rocker will help when things get a little unpredictable you’ll also like that it has an aspen core that keeps things light and durable reinforcements in the tip and tail prevents cracking or breaking when you land too deep twin tech sidewalls ensure a lasting product if you have quite a bit of experience in freestyle skiing you’ll probably want a different product like the atomic skis you just saw – the sight’s are more of a learning tool also they’re pretty budget friendly this is the perfect price for a novice if you fall in love with the adrenaline of the park you’ll have this pair of skis for a while atomic punx company atomic price rating 495the skis you just saw were for people dipping their toes into the world of freeride – that’s not the case with the atomic punx this product is for those looking to really push themselves this season and already have a good amount of confidence in their ability the punx’s are meant to get air big air the landings will be soft and smooth with these skis too everything about this piece of equipment is meant to perform some awesome features include park rocker helps out with butters and ensures you won’t get caught on the lip of a jump when taking off stomp sidecut makes sure your landings are smooth and consistent slim waist grips hardpacked and groomed trails well power woodcore is lightweight and playful atomic base ensures you reach fast speeds and zip down trails you can even take the punx’s out of the park when you’re looking to mix things up too this is good for people that like to explore all parts of the mountain usually high quality skis like these are pretty expensive lucky for you and i that’s not really the case here that’s honestly a steal for what you’re getting volkl alley company volkl price rating 475if you have any amount of skill you’ll want a different ski than the volkl alley’s this product truly is meant for skiers trying out the park for the first time if you’re advanced in big air and rails the alley’s won’t perform the way you need them too these skis really shouldn’t be taken off trail at all either this is because there’s no rocker and you’ll sink into any deep powder this product is all camber and this comes in handy on trail and ensures you can grip hard packed snow well it also comes with multilayer woodcore that makes these skis durable and flexible tough box construction means this piece of equipment can stand up to rails stays stable at fast speeds and won’t be shaky when you kick it up a notch the alley’s are the cheapest skis on this list this is a really good deal but i wouldn’t go much lower than that if you go too cheap you’ll get a low quality piece of equipment wearing cheap equipment can lead to a whole bunch of problems ranging from poor performance to increasing your likelihood of getting injured so for a beginner its price is an acceptable amount to pay for intermediates and up you’ll want to pay a little extra to match your skills nordica soul rider company nordica price rating 485nordica is an excellent company and they make a ton of great gear you’ll find people wearing their gloves ski boots and more their soul rider is a quality piece of equipment and one you’d be lucky to wear this season although the soul rider’s excel in the park and will give you the performance you desire on jumps and rails they work when you’re downhill skiing too this makes them pretty versatile and perfect for anyone that likes to jump around the mountain some other features you’ll like include energy 2 carbon construction ensures a smooth ride at fast speeds and will help you stick your landings97mm is a little wider than some freestyle skis but comes in handy when you’re riding through crud and powder rockered tips mean you’re in control and will give you a hand in the handling department i wouldn’t purchase this product if you’re not a confident skier and just starting out or a mellow intermediate you need quite a bit of skill to have fun with the soul rider’s and the price isn’t terrible either that’s definitely a fair price for everything that you’re getting salomon tntcompany salomon price rating 475the salomon tnt is another piece of equipment that excels on all parts of the mountain if you get tired of hitting rails and the half pipe you can get some trail runs in – it has the design to do both what i really like about this product is the 2 year warranty there’s only a few skis on this list that have more than a 1 year warranty and the tnt’s are one of them salomon really believes in their gear and it shows with that type of guarantee it also has a woodcore that eats up annoying vibrations and ensures you have a good ski experience single ti laminates really helps with edging and gripping hard packed snow xl edges are extra thick and come with reinforcements that add to this products durability like many of the skis on this list you’ll need some skill to have fun with the tnt’s i wouldn’t say you

quality and you’ll realize what a good deal that is best freestyle skis for women k2 missconduct company k2price rating 485the first freestyle skis for women on this list come from a company you can
