literary mainstream commercial what genre is this anyway16 february 2015what’s the difference between commercial and literary and mainstream fiction what do those words mean anyway what about “upmarket” where does my book fit in sometimes it’s really obvious where your novel fits in with others other times you show up querying your book and have no idea where to put it it’s awkwardly similar to high school at least the movie version of high school everybody else seems so neatly sorted into groups and then there’s you…but you want your book to find readers which means your book needs to find something in common with other books ones that have readers hey you know which books have the most readers commercial fiction let’s start there commercial fiction commercial fiction is any fiction that has one of the following characteristics it sells a lot of copies orit has a tight fresh premise that’s easy to pitch like a logline orit has a very specific established audience so genre fiction is considered commercial fiction because genres can sell a lot of books to their target readers children’s books can often be considered commercial because all kids are encouraged to read but children’s books are categorized by age first genre second commercial writers are often prolific ones churning out book after book after book for their very happy fan base regardless of their genre bottom line don’t call your own work “commercial fiction”—that’s a term defined by sales know the difference between age categories adult young adult middle grade etc and genres what this post is about genre fiction genre fiction adheres to specific tropes for example if you’re writing a romance your story must have a happily ever after if it doesn’t it’s not a romance read heavily in your genre what do you expect when reading that genre that’s what readers will expect from your book if it’s put on that shelf established genre families often with their own shelves in stores or libraries mystery romance suspense  thriller speculative fiction includes fantasy science fiction horrorwestern adventure sometimes grouped with thrillersdid you write speculative fiction read about my guide to science fiction and fantasy subgenres crossgenre a crossgenre novel or story is one that borrows tropes from two or more genres if your book is about an elf and an ogre falling in love and living happily ever after you’re borrowing from the romance and fantasy families but do you call it fantasy romance or romantic fantasy the first word in a genre pairing is the adjective qualifying the second more prominent genre in other words a fantasy romance is primarily a romance with some fantasy elements a romantic fantasy borrows more from the fantasy genre than the romance genre but it still should have a happily ever after or you can’t call it “romantic”many stories have romantic elements that doesn’t mean they are romances if your story has romantic elements then say it’s “ with romantic elements” if you must but the romantic elements should be evident from your pitch a lot of colors have blue in them but when we add a bit of it to yellow and mix it throughout we call the result “green” or maybe “yellowgreen” not “yellow with blue elements”bottom line if you think your book fits in one or more genres look up the tropes for each genre read multiple authors of those genres to see where your book fits best your book doesn’t fit in with any of those genres don’t give up yet mainstream or general fiction if your book wouldn’t sit on one of the five “shelves” listed above it will likely be placed in a section called “general fiction” or simply “fiction”historical fiction will likely be shelved here along with contemporary fiction women’s fiction is general fiction promoted mainly to female readers if your book is one of these genres call it by one of those names it’s better to be specific than vague and it shows that you know your audience mainstream fiction might appeal to a broader audience but it can be more difficult to market marketers need to know where to direct their efforts without a specified audience your book will be a much harder sell literary fiction literary fiction has its own audience—one who has high expectations for prose and subtext if literary fiction gets its own shelf that shelf is often called “literature” though many readers are rightly annoyed at the suggestion that genre fiction can’t be considered literature we won’t get into what constitutes a work of fiction being considered “literature” here as far as i’m considered that’s the same as debating the definition or worth of “art”what we will talk about is what constitutes literary fiction elements of literary fiction the entirety of the prose is vivid fresh or experimental it might be more concerned with theme than action it might be more concerned with a character’s internal struggle than external conflict it might play with what defines a “novel” or “story” or “literature” see metafictionit might be delivered to a select few like the first collection from facsimile press which publishes fiction only via fax…it might be read in literature classes and not much elsewhere literary fiction is very hard to write and it can be hard for general audiences to read but it does have a specific audience with fairly clear expectations like “commercial” the term “literary” is subjective and is doubted by readers when selfapplied some readers might not agree with your label if you’ve studied or discussed literature at length or if your writing has been recognized or published by a literary community then you might be fine calling your work literary show that you understand what literary means in a query letter by including a statement in your bio paragraph like “i majored in literature at suchandsuch university” or “my fiction has won recognizable literary accolades not based on commercial genre”bottom line err on the side of calling your work contemporary or historical whichever fits until an authority in the literary sphere—an agent reviewer awardwinning author or publisher—assigns the “literary” qualifier to your work upmarket fiction or “book club books”upmarket fiction is mainstream fiction with both literary and commercial elements these are often books read by book clubs because not only are the books entertaining and accessible but they also have finely crafted prose universal themes or headscratching concepts that beg to be discussed with other readers you can call your work upmarket but there’s no shelf for upmarket books “upmarket” is an adjective use it paired with another genre or category label for example “upmarket fantasy” or “upmarket contemporary novel”bottom line upmarket fiction is approachable but beneath its fresh commercial premise lie layers of subtext conclusion when pitching your book you need to show how it’s both different from and similar to books on the market to be a success your book needs to fit in with others while having unique qualities of its own in a query letter the main content of the pitch should show how your story is unique the informational paragraph with word count genre and age category should show where it fits in this is where you can include comp titles books or related media that might share a specific audience with your readership “ my title in all caps would appeal to fans of two or three recently published books stillwriting authors or related media”click to save on pinterest share this pinterest facebook twitter tumblr loading
