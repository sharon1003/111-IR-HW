kitchen for ring jewelryseajewels0111 jan 2018i think the recipe is great i think a lot of you dont know that when adding the corn beef you put everything including the juice from the bag in your crock pot that is the brine from the meat it adds flavor i do also add a couple cloves of chopped garlic and instead of sliced carrots i put a handful of baby carrots and i put extra celery a sprinkle of celery seed and a bay leaf and if your meat did not come with seasoning the recipe says to adding pickling spice which is the same that comes with the meat a must add to get the great flavor replydazeylin19 jul 2017i made this when i invited a friend over and it was great i did add some extra veggies and two small turnips we both love veggies i kept the cabbage to one smallish head my tiny town didnt have or know what savoy cabbage was so i had to use what they had but it was the best corned beef and cabbage i have ever made thanks for this recipereplysuzannej10887441715 may 2017mustard sauce is great with corned brisket i use the following recipe 1 egg 14 cup sugar  1 heaped tbsp flour wisked together add 1 cup of cooking liquid and simmer until thickened then add 14 cup of vinegar and heat through replysuzannej10887441715 may 2017sorry forgot the mustard add 1 tsp mustard to the flour ms1068255824 mar 2017hmmm kinda bland glad i read another recipe that recommended serving w creme fraiche which helped a lot i cooked veggies from the beginning and they were perfect used tricolor bag of carrots pretty loved adding thyme could have used rosemary and salt replyjjmarkp18 mar 2017the meat turns out very moist but the recipe is bland it wasnt till i was done cooking that i remembered my mom always added rosemary i think that would make this better replycma1870414 mar 2017one thing that i would never do is add my potatos that early in 4 to 8 hrs over cooked i add mine 35 minutes before its done replykpagoda9794117 mar 2017potatoes are fine as per recipe still firmsherpagmai15 mar 2017totally agree the potatoes carrots will be mush corned beef will do fine cooked by it self i like to cook it in stoutjeffclearwater15 mar 2017i totally agree with cmal8704 there is no need to cook potatoes and carrots for four or eight hours it is a bad slow cooker myth that everything should go into the pot at the beginning this recipe needs major reworking the people who create slow cooker recipes need to test them and know how the food is supposed to taste this is most disappointingreynoldstracy08113 mar 2017instead of water use a bottle of lager beer makes a huge difference replyseanhunter197413 mar 2017they filtered my use of the word filteredes really i wasnt saying a derogatory term for hispanic people that was idiotic for sureseanhunter197413 mar 2017i agree with the previous posters martha stewarts written recipe is less than stellar im irishamerican and am aboveaverage at cooking this my grandmother was a keeley thus 1920s child irishamerican i dont know which generationbranch of her family tree emigrated to the usa from ireland i agree that the redheads video is much much better watch that prior to reading the recipe the redheads video is simpler and doesnt require fancy pickling filteredes  yay i have thyme on hand in a bottled filterede variety it keeps longer i dont like dealing with the fresh filteredes unless i know im making a baked potatothen i like to add fresh chives a bargain actually as far as fresh filteredes go thank you for the reading of my commentrolldda12 mar 2017this was the best so juicy and tender my mom always bought the round and it always seemed alittle dry i wanted to try the brisket it was wonderful thank you i so enjoyed itreplydavisshantel47 mar 2017this will be my first
