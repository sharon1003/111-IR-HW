voltagedependent magnesium block to open an ion conductive pore across the membrane bilayer despite the importance of the nmda receptor in the development and function of the brain a molecular structure of an intact receptor has remained elusive here we present xray crystal structures of the xenopus laevis glu n1–glu n2b nmda receptor with the allosteric inhibitor ro256981 partial agonists and the ion channel blocker mk801 receptor subunits are arranged in a 1212 fashion demonstrating extensive interactions between the aminoterminal and ligandbinding domains the transmembrane domains harbour a closedblocked ion channel a pyramidal central vestibule lined by residues implicated in binding ion channel blockers and magnesium and a ∼ twofold symmetric arrangement of ion channel pore loops these structures provide new insights into the architecture allosteric coupling and ion channel function of nmda receptors main glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain acting at ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors rapid excitation by glutamate in turn solely involves action at ampa kainate and nmda ionotropic glutamate receptors 1 the nmda receptor is central to the development and function of the nervous system and to neurotoxicity 2 as a linchpin of synaptic plasticity blockade of the nmda receptor interferes with memory formation and recall 3 moreover mutations within the coding regions of nmda receptor subunit genes are associated with a spectrum of neurological diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders from schizophrenia to epilepsy 4 autoimmune responses to the nmda receptor and presumed disruption in nmda receptor organization on neural cell surfaces probably underlie nmda receptor encephalitis 5 in keeping with the profound roles of the nmda receptor in brain function the receptor is a target of small molecules for the treatment of cognitive impairment depression schizophrenia and pain 2 although ampa and kainate receptors can be activated solely by glutamate 6 7 8 nmda receptors are hebbianlike coincidence detectors requiring the binding of glycine and glutamate to glu n1 and glu n2 subunits 9 respectively combined with membrane depolarization to relieve magnesium block 10 11 activation of the receptor opens a cationselective calciumpermeable channel thus causing further depolarization of the cell membrane and influx of calcium 12 nmda receptors are obligatory heterotetrameric assemblies 13 14 usually composed of two glycinebinding glu n1 subunits and two glutamatebinding glu n2ad subunits with the glu n1–glu n2a–glu n2b complex as the predominant nmda receptor at hippocampal synapses 15 glycine and d serinebinding glu n3 subunits are additional subunits expressed throughout the nervous system but with roles less well defined in comparison to the glu n1–glu n2 assemblies a hallmark of nmda receptors by contrast with ampa and kainate receptors is a wide spectrum of allosteric modulation from nanomolar concentrations of zinc to the small molecule ifenprodil polyamines and protons 16 and to voltagedependent ion channel block by mk801 ketamine and memantine 17 the glu n1 glu n2 and glu n3 nmda receptor subunits are related in amino acid sequence and like ampa and kainate receptor subunits possess a modular domain architecture with aminoterminal domains atds and ligandbinding domains lbds on the extracellular side of the membrane a transmembrane domain tmd spanning the membrane and defining the ion channel pore and an intracellular carboxyterminal domain ctd within the cytoplasm 1 multiple highresolution crystal structures of the isolated lbds from nmda ampa and kainate receptors show that these domains adopt similar clamshelllike structures that are organized in an approximately dimeric backtoback fashion 18 19 20 although crystal structures of isolated atds illustrate that they too possess a clamshelllike structure 21 22 23 in nmda receptors not only is the organization of each clamshell lobe distinct from that in ampa and kainate receptors but the interactions between subunits are also different 24 the functional properties of the nmda ion channel pore which harbours binding sites for magnesium and small molecule blockers are also distinct from ampa and kainate receptors 1 here we report crystal structures of the glu n1–glu n2b nmda receptor from xenopus laevis in complex with the glu n2bspecific allosteric inhibitor ro256981 ref 25  the glu n1 and glu n2b partial agonists 1aminocyclopropane1carboxylic acid acpc 26 and trans 1aminocyclobutane13dicarboxylic acid tacbd 27 respectively and the ion channel blocker mk801 to enhance the stability of the receptor in detergent micelles and to reduce conformational surface entropy we replaced the cytoplasmic c terminus of the glu n1 and glu n2b subunits with 11 residues from the glu a2 c terminus 28 and we introduced a number of mutations into each subunit ultimately finding a nmda receptor complex that preserved binding of full and partial agonists and ro256981 together with small but measurable conductance activated by glycine and glutamate and with channel block by magnesium to decrease conformational mobility of the extracellular domains we substituted glu n2b lys 216 to cys k216c resulting in spontaneous disulphide bond formation between glu n2b subunits improving crystal quality yet reducing agonistinduced ion channel activity  extended data table 1 and extended data figs 1 2 3 4  we determined crystal structures of the glu n1–glu n2b k216c receptor at resolutions of 37 å structure 1 and 39 å structure 2 and refined the structures to reasonable crystallographic residuals and good stereochemistry in addition we mapped cation sites in the atd by exploiting anomalous scattering from a tb 3 derivative and probed the mobility of the atd and lbd layers by comparing a non k216c crosslinked structure to the higher resolution k216c structures  extended data table 2 and supplementary discussion  architecture and symmetry the structure of the glu n1–glu n2b nmda receptor resembles a mushroom with a height of ∼ 150 å and widths of ∼ 125 × 120 å  fig 1a b and supplementary video 1  with an overall twofold axis of symmetry reminiscent of the intact glu a2 ampa receptor architecture and symmetry 28 the receptor domains are organized into three layers with the atd layer at the top the lbd layer in the middle and the tmd layer at the bottom by contrast with the ampa receptor the extracellular layers are more compact with the atd layer adopting an entirely different structure interdigitated within the crevices of the lbd layer the lbd layer caps the extracellular end of the transmembrane domain with loops from the glu n2b lbds drooping towards the extracellular leaflet of the membrane bilayer  fig 1a  the tmd hews to an ampalike topology and arrangement of helices 28 yet with electron density for the m2 segments and pore loops in structure 2 allowing us to define the structure of nearly the entire ion channel pore structure 1 and structure 2 are similar nevertheless with an overall root mean square deviation rmsd on main chain atoms of 06 å here we primarily use structure 1 to discuss the atds lbds and lbd to tmd linkages and structure 2 to describe the tmd figure 1 architecture symmetry and domain organization

receptor 28 with the glycinebinding glu n1 subunits occupying the a–c subunit positions and the glutamatebinding glu n2b subunits situated in the b–d subunit sites  fig 2a  in agreement with crosslinking studies on the glu n1–glu n2a receptor 28 29 30 and isolated atds 31 and in agreement with crystal structures of the glu n1–glu n2a lbds 32 and the glu n1–glu n2b atds 24 the atds and the lbds are organized as local glu n1–glu n2b heterodimers like the ampa receptor 28 there is subunit ‘crossover’ between atd and lbd layers such that the subunits of a given atd heterodimer are connected to subunits in a different lbd heterodimer thus knitting together the extracellular domain superstructure the tmds are further stitched together by the m4 helices interacting nearly exclusively with tm segments from an adjacent subunit the arrangement of subunits within this nmda receptor complex illustrates how the subunit nonequivalence first described for the homomeric ampa receptor 28 has been exploited in an obligatory heteromeric assembly figure 2 atd arrangement cation binding sites and conformational mobilitya view of the atd layer along the overall twofold axis

asymmetric unit illustrate the conformational mobility of the atd layers full size image download power point slide arrangement of aminoterminal domains the glu n1–glu n2b atds are perched above the lbd layer with the r2 lobes of the glu n2b subunits proximal to each other and near the overall twofold axis of symmetry while the glu n1 atds reside at the periphery of the receptor assembly  fig 2a b  the atd heterodimer is shaped like an inverted ‘v’ in which the open end of the ‘v’ straddles the glu n1 lbd beneath it with loops and residues of the glu n1 r2 lobe interacting with its glu n1 lbd and the glu n2b r2 lobe wedged into the interdimer lbd interface the conformation of an individual atd heterodimer from the intact receptor structure is slightly contracted compared to the structure of the isolated heterodimer perhaps because of interactions with the lbd layer or due to lattice contacts  extended data fig 5a b and extended data table 3  there is prominent electron density at the interface between the glu n1 and glu n2b subunits for the allosteric antagonist ro256981 where it stabilizes the intersubunit interface  extended data fig 5c 24 a small interface formed between the atd heterodimers is centred at the engineered disulphide crosslink at residue 216 of the α5 helix on the glu n2b r2 lobe  fig 2a  zinc acts as an antagonist at nanomolar concentrations on glu n2acontaining receptors and at micromolar concentrations on receptors harbouring the glu n2b subunit 33 because lanthanum also antagonizes the nmda receptor in a voltageindependent manner 34 and lanthanides can bind to zinc sites 35 we exploited the anomalous scattering signal of terbium and measured xray diffraction data near its f” maximum anomalous difference electron density maps show two peaks near the interdomain hinge of the r1–r2 lobes of the glu n2b subunit  fig 2c and extended data fig 5d  the tb2 site overlaps with the previously determined zn1 site 23 whereas the other site tb1 near residues glu 146 asp 176 and asp 349 is unique these data support the notion that ions and small molecules can bind to the atd clamshells 36 in a position to modulate atd conformation although future experiments are required to establish the roles of these sites in allosteric regulation of glu n2bcontaining nmda receptors the first structure of the nmda receptor was derived from the low resolution data set 4  extended data table 2 and involved a construct lacking the glu n2b k216c mutant in this crystal form there are two halves of a receptor in the asymmetric unit and application of crystal symmetry creates two intact receptors each with a different conformation of the atds in which the angles of the atd domains range from 59° to 84° across the overall twofold axis  fig 2d  we further observed that helix α5 of the glu n2b r2 lobes face each other proximal to the overall twofold axis of symmetry because we speculated that these structures were indicative of substantial mobility in the atd layer we made single cysteine substitutions on the exposed face of helix α5 and screened for redox dependent crosslinking of glu n2b subunits indeed the k216c mutant as well as other residues on the face of α5 spontaneously form subunit–subunit crosslinks  extended data figs 1 2 and 4  bringing the glu n2b atds in close apposition  extended data fig 5e  diminishing ion channel activity and increasing the resolution to which the crystals diffract in two electrode voltage clamp experiments reduction of oocytes using dithiothreitol enhances current responses from the k216c mutant suggesting that movements of the atds allosterically modulate the activity of the ion channel  extended data fig 2  ligandbindingdomain layer the agonistbinding lbds of the nmda receptor are organized as a nearly equivalent pair of glu n1–glu n2b heterodimers in which each glu n1–glu n2b heterodimer  fig 3a c closely resembles the watersoluble heterodimers of the isolated glu n1–glu n2a lbds 32 and the homodimeric assemblies of ampa 18 and kainate receptor 37 lbds in nondesensitized conformations moreover the arrangement is similar to that previously observed in the structure of the fulllength ampa receptor  fig 3b d 28 although here the electron density for the glu n1 and glu n2b lbds in chains b and c is weak perhaps due to an absence of lattice contacts in comparing this nmda receptor structure to the antagonistbound state of the ampa receptor the extent to which the local twofold axes of each lbd dimer are angled off of the overall molecular twofold axis of symmetry differ  fig 3a b  in addition inspection of the glu n1–glu n2b and ampa receptor lbd layers viewed from the top  fig 3c d  shows that there is a relative translation or shift of the lbd dimers along the interdimer interface  fig 3e  using helix j to align the b–c lbds the a–d lbd dimer in the ampa receptor has undergone a translational ‘shift’ of ∼ 15 å relative to the a–d nmda receptor lbd heterodimer although we do not know if these differences in lbd dimer ‘roll’ angle  fig 3a b and translational ‘shift’  fig 3e are due to inherent differences between nmda and ampa receptors or to the closedblocked state of the nmda receptor versus the competitive antagonistbound form of the ampa receptor or to both factors this analysis illustrates conformational mobility of the lbd dimers perhaps related to how the lbd couples agonistbinding to the tmd figure 3 lbd layer forms a ringlike structurea the glu n1–glu n2b lbd and tmd showing that the pseudo twofold axes of the b–c and a–d lbd heterodimers diverge with an angle of 60° the boxed areas define regions of lbd dimer–dimer contacts shown in panels g and h b view of the antagonistbound state of the glu a2 ampa receptor which shows

subunits in the ampa receptor dotted lines the asterisk indicates the dimer–dimer interface f–h closeup view of the canonical d1–d1 intradimer interface 32 together with views of the interactions at the interdimer interfaces in panels g and h the domains from structure 2 are shown with glu n1 subunits in blue and glu n2b subunits in orange full size image download power point slide within the lbd layer there are two major interfaces one within a heterodimer at the d1–d1 interface of glu n1 and glu n2b subunits and the second between heterodimers the intradimer d1–d1 interface is a region of allosteric modulation in nmda receptors 38 39 and within one heterodimer buries ∼ 1100 å 2 of solvent accessible surface area on each subunit  fig 3c f boxed region there are two nearly equivalent interdimer interfaces between the heterodimeric lbds each burying ∼ 600 å 2 of solventaccessible surface area and comprising two loci  fig 3a boxed regions one involves helix g on glu n1 interacting with residues on loop 1 of glu n2b  fig 3g and the second includes residues on helix k glu n2b making contacts with residues on helix e glu n1 fig 3h  both sets of interactions involve contacts between residues on the d1 and d2 lobes of the glu n1 and glu n2b subunits providing a direct route by which modulation of lbd clamshell closure could be translated into rearrangement of the lbd layer as previously suggested both the nmda receptor lbd intradimer interface and the dimer–dimer interface may adopt different conformations depending on the functional state of the receptor the initial trigger for the eventual opening of the ion channel gate resides in agonist binding to the lbd clamshells nmda receptors require binding by agonists at both the glu n1 and glu n2 sites 9 and here we have crystallized the receptor in complex with the partial agonists acpc 40 and tacbd 41 agonist binding results in closure of the lbd clamshell 42 and separation of the region proximal to the m3 transmembrane helix 18 analysis of the glu n1 and glu n2b lbds demonstrates that each of the two glu n1 and glu n2b clamshells adopt similar conformations  extended data table 3  moreover the degree of closure is similar to that observed for the isolated lbds  extended data fig 6  except that they are both slightly more open in comparison to the isolated domains perhaps owing to direct linkage to the ion channel separation of the region proximal to the m3 helices is similar between the equivalent residues in the lbd dimers of the full length receptor and in the glycine–glutamate complex of the isolated glu n1–glu n2a lbds yet longer than in an lbd antagonist 57dichlorokynurenic acid dcka–glutamate complex  extended data fig 6f–h  thus by this metric the lbd dimers adopt an agonistbound activated conformation atd–lbd interactions and allosteric coupling the molecular puzzle of how allosteric inhibitors such as ro256981 and ifenprodil promote closure of the ion channel gate despite the binding of agonists to their cognate lbd dimers must be resolved at least in part through communication between the atd and lbd layers and perturbation of the lbd layer from an active conformation to an inactive state in the glu n1–glu n2b structure the atd heterodimers ‘straddle’ lbd subunits  fig 4a b  with the r2 lobe of each glu n1 subunit making extensive contacts with the d1 lobe of the cognate glu n1 lbd and the r2 lobe of the glu n2b subunit insinuated into the lbd dimer–dimer interface positioned to make contacts with its cognate glu n2b lbd and with the neighbouring glu n1 lbd thus we see that the atds are judiciously positioned to mediate conformational changes at both lbd intradimer 18 38 39 and interdimer interfaces nevertheless because the intradimer lbd interface is intact the action of ro256981 and related compounds may not necessarily involve rupture of this interface and other conformational changes with the lbd layer may be involved in rendering the lbd layer in the apparently inactive conformation observed in the present structures however additional studies with robustly active receptor constructs will help to resolve these questions figure 4 the atds participate in extensive contacts with the lbd layera b surface representation of the atd and lbd domains illustrating how the r2 lobe of the glu n1 subunit is poised above its cognate glu n1 lbd and also near the d1–d1 lbd dimer interface  a and how the r2 lobe of the glu n2b subunit participates in contacts with its cognate glu n2b lbd near an inter lbd dimer interface  b  c d closeup views of potential interactions between the glu n1 r2 lobe and the glu n1 lbd  c and between the glu n2b r2 lobe with regions on its glu n2b lbd  d  the glu n2b r2 lobe is also near helices g and f and loop 2 of the glu n1 lbd in a and b the black dots define the approximate intra and interdimer lbd interfaces respectively structure 1 is shown in all panels full size image download power point slide in the glu n1 subunit the atd α5 helix c terminus which harbours exon 5 in an alternatively spliced form of the gene 43 in combination with the α4–β7 loop resides close to the lbd dimer interface near the c terminus of helix j and in a plausible position to perturb the conformation of the lbd layer  fig 4c  the glu n2b α4 helix c terminus along with the loop connecting α4 to β7 a region implicated in regulation of the nmda receptor by polyamines 44 rest on top of the f and g helices of the glu n1 lbd and close to residues in loop 1 of the glu n2b lbd  fig 4d  thus although the linking peptides connecting the atds to the lbds have an important role in the transduction of conformational changes between the two layers 45 direct contacts that harness the predicted largescale motions of the atds 36 also play a central role in transmitting changes to the transmembrane ion channel domain transmembrane domain nmda receptors are calcium permeable and toxic to cells upon overexpression and therefore we introduced mutations known in ampa receptors to increase receptor desensitization 46 finding that in the context of the glu n1–glu n2b nmda receptor they lead to decreased current amplitudes and enhanced stability of the receptor in detergent micelles because native glu n1–glu n2b receptors have a low open probability  p o 47 and the modifications we have introduced further reduce p o the functional state of the receptor should be an ro256981 partial agonist bound closedblocked channel state the electron density associated with data set 2structure 2 allowed us to position the polypeptide main chain for the m1–m4 helices of all subunits  supplementary video 1  to trace the polypeptide associated with the pore loop we exploited the continuous electron density for this region in the glu n2b subunit d and by applying noncrystallographic symmetry defined by the transmembrane segments of the other subunits we traced the three remaining pore loops  fig 5a b  the arrangement of transmembrane helices is like that of the glu a2 ampa receptor 28  extended data fig 7a  although in the nmda receptor we have a more complete representation of the ion channel pore and putative selectivity filter the prem1 region of the nmda receptor forms a ‘collar’ around the extracellular regions of the m3 helices residing near the boundary of the extracellular side of the membrane the m1 helix descends across the membrane and makes interactions with the porelining m3 helix of the same subunit and the m4 helix of a neighbour electron density for the cytoplasmic loop connecting m1 to m2 is weak or missing and thus this region is absent from the structure we can visualize the m2 pore helix and most of the extended region of the pore loop forming the selectivity filter and its connection to the n terminus of m3 figure 5 transmembrane domain architecture symmetry and coupling to lbda view of the tmd parallel to the membrane glu n1 subunits are blue and the glu

hole parallel to the membrane showing that the m3 bundle crossing near the extracellular side of the membrane and the entry into the selectivity filter region from the central aqueous vestibule form constrictions in the pore green dots indicate a pore radius of 115–23 å and blue dots define a pore radius greater than 23 å because a number of side chains are not included in the structure due to the moderate resolution of the diffraction data the size of the pore is approximate d view of the extracellular ends of the m3 helices of the nmda receptor we have highlighted as spheres the αcarbon

and phases from the refined structure the map is contoured at 28 σ data set 2 and structure 2 were used in all panels  extended data table 2  full size image download power point slide the conformation of the polypeptide chain throughout the m2 helix and the pore loop are reminiscent of a potassium channel 48 although there are differences in the local conformation of the nmda pore loops perhaps due to nonglycine residues svp within the canonical gyg motif of potassium channels in the glu n2b subunit  extended data fig 7b c or to the lower resolution of the present structures asn residues implicated in voltagedependent magnesium block 49 are situated at the turn between the end of m2 and the beginning of the extended filter sequence in a position to project their side chains into an aqueous vestibule  fig 5c f  forming the core of the ion channel is the m3 segment in a similar conformation as the m3 segment in the glu a2 receptor 28  extended data fig 7a  the extracellular ends of the m3 segments adopt a pyramidlike shape forming a physical constriction to the ion channel permeation pathway  fig 5c d  the m4 segment resides on the periphery of the transmembrane domain interacting primarily with the m1 and m3 helices of a neighbouring subunit and extending for several more turns into the cytoplasmicspace than that seen in the glu a2 receptor ion channel gate and central vestibule the solvent accessible pathway through the ion channel pore from the extracellular side of the membrane to the cytoplasm shows an occlusion near the predicted extracellular boundary of the membrane bilayer a central vestibule and a second occlusion at the beginning of the selectivity filter followed by a solvent accessible pathway to the cytoplasm  fig 5c  we speculate that the physical gate of this closedblocked state of the nmda receptor is at the bundle crossing of the m3 helices in a position similar to that of the shut gate of the antagonistbound glu a2 receptor 28 the narrowest constriction is defined by thr 646 of glu n1 and ala 645 of glu n2b within the highly conserved sytanlaaf motif crucial to ion channel gating near the extracellular boundary of the m3 helices 50 flanking the constriction is a narrow region too small for ion permeation spanning val 642–leu 653 of glu n1 and ala 641–ile 652 of glu n2 although the arrangement of the m3 helices at the ion channel gate diverges from the approximate fourfold symmetry of the ampa receptor  fig 5d 28 we do not yet know if this distinction is inherent to nmda receptors or is a consequence of their different ligandbound and functional states the pore expands immediately below the m3 bundle crossing to the central vestibule a cavity flanked by the m3 helices on the sides and the ends of the m2 helices together with the tips of the pore loops on the bottom a second constriction of the pore is immediately below the central vestibule and is defined by the residues at the beginning of the pore loop  fig 5c  because of the limited resolution of the diffraction data we are unable to position sidechain groups and to precisely define the location of main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms and thus are not able to determine if this region of the pore is large enough to conduct ions following this constriction the pore expands to the cytoplasmic space by contrast with fourfold symmetric potassium channels the pore loops of this specific ligandbound state of the nmda receptor are arranged with approximate twofold symmetry  fig 5e  in electron density maps derived separately from data set 1 and 2 and their respective structures  extended data table 2  we found positive difference electron density within the central vestibule  fig 5f and extended data fig 7d–f  because we crystallized the receptor in the presence of 1 m m mk801 we suggest this electron density feature could represent a trapped mk801 molecule that occupies multiple positions or orientations within the central vestibule unfortunately we have been unable to validate mk801 binding by direct binding assays or by electrophysiology experiments perhaps because of the very low p o of the receptor construct nevertheless several residues including ala 643 and tyr 645 on the glu n1 m3 helix and asn 614 glu n1 asn 612 glu n2b and asn 613 glu n2b on the pore loop ‘tips’ are near the electron density feature and have been implicated in mk801 binding 17 we speculate that ion channel blockers such as mk801 occupy the central vestibule and block ion conduction by preventing ions from entering the pore looplined selectivity filter coupling of ligand binding and transmembrane domains the coupling of the lbd to the tmd is similar in principle to the ampa receptor 28 with the crucial m3 connections to the lbds proximal or distal to the overall twofold axis for the glu n1 a–c subunits or the glu n2b b–d subunits respectively  extended data fig 8  however the relative orientation of the nmda receptor tmd with respect to the lbd is distinct from the glu a2 receptor specifically the lbd layer of the nmda receptor is rotated by ∼ 35° around an axis that is approximately coincident with the overall twofold axis of the receptor at this juncture we do not know if this difference is due to inherent differences between nmda and ampa receptors or because this specific nmda receptor complex is trapped in an atd antagonistbound lbd partialagonist bound closedblocked state conclusion the glu n1–glu n2b structure harbours an overall twofold symmetry a layered dimerofdimers arrangement of subunits and a positioning of nr1 and nr2b subunits in the a–c and b–d positions defined by the fulllength glu a2 receptor 28  supplementary video 1  the rich interdigitations and covalent linkage of the r2 lobes of the atds to the lbds provide molecular routes for transmission of allosteric signals to the glycine and glutamatebinding lbd layer which is organized as a ring of heterodimeric units above the transmembrane ion channel  fig 6  despite closure of the lbd clamshells around partial agonists and an intact ‘nondesensitized’ d1–d1 interface of the lbd heterodimers the ion channel gate is in a closedblocked state providing the first insights into the structural basis for allosteric inactivation of a nmda receptor and suggesting that plasticity of the lbd layer may provide a mechanism for modulation of receptor gating departing from the fourfold symmetry of the glu a2 transmembrane domain the pore loops of the nmda receptor are approximately twofold symmetric the allosteric antagonistbound glu n1–glu n2b structure provides a molecular blueprint for the development of new therapeutic agents and a structural framework for biophysical mechanisms of allosteric modulation gating and ion channel function as well as a springboard for future studies directed towards determining structures of resting open and desensitized states and defining locations
