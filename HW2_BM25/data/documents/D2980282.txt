to flourish plant it in the sunniest spot in your garden give it plenty of space so it has enough air circulation and as with all roses and plants for that matter always try to avoid the foliage when you water watering the leaves encourages fungal diseases which love humidity i know that this happens when it rains but were talking about extra watering of the leaves in between showers always water around the roots remember that roses love a good watering but not too often watering their foliage only encourages black spot and powdery mildew which thrive in moist conditions for good disease resistance  the best chance you can give them  prevention is better than cure an important note about rose disease if you do have a rose with a disease such as black spot or powdery mildew always always take off the diseased leaves or blooms wrap them up and put them in the bin this step is crucial anything left over will continue to thrive and spread and youll be back where you started in se
