if we ask ourselves the question “ who am i ” an evolutionist must answer that they are a mutation a happenstance a mistake a random descendant from primordial slime who’s great great granddaddy was an ape can you really believe someone who claims that this is there heritage however a biblebelieving person should answer that they are a specially created child of the almighty god created in god’s image for god’s special purpose just imagine the impact these two different viewpoints would have on a person’s life the bottom line apemen never existed all archeological and fossil finds claiming to link man to apes are e ither 100 a pe or 100 man there is n o evidence to the contrary there is no evidence to support that humankind evolved from apes the apemen names we’ve all heard about have been shown scientifically to be either pure man or pure ape i f i said to an evolutionist “the only people who may have descended from an ape are people stupid enough to believe in evolution” – would they get upset with me you bet because deep down we all know we didn’t descend from an ape our inner “truth detectors” tell us that we are something special here’s just a few of the attempts to try to show that mankind evolved from apes these have been featured in science books over the last decades but they are not based on science but on man’s attempt to prove a faulty theory the theory of evolution nebraska man – artwork of “nebraska man” shows mr and mrs nebraska man s maller than us today with s tooped shoulders a m uscular build and with h air all over the body their features are illustrated as h alf apehalf man they are often shown carrying a club their drawings museum displays and life story was obtained from the finding of one tooth the tooth has now been determined to be a pig’s tooth nebraska man was a pig piltdown man – piltdown man was d eclared the missing link even before he was studied then some 30 yrs later he was found to be an outright fraud a human skull was sanded and an ape jaw bone was fitted to it both were treated with acid to make them look old and then they were “rediscovered” piltdown man was a hoax“stone age” neandertal man – the first “neandertal man” was f ound in a cave in neander valley germany in 1856 h e h ad a curved spine now 300  have been found and most of the backs are straight the o riginalspecimen had arthritis and a v itamin d deficiency n eandertal man is n ow classified as homo sapiens that’s us not as a “missing link ” also in archeological digs we have now found aerodynamic spears jewelry and sophisticated ornaments used by neandertal man they had a religion and buried their dead with flowers we have found stone axe blades made of carborundum the second hardest mineral on earth the blades had been polished by diamonds the hardest mineral on earth if we gave neandertal man a haircut and clothes we couldnt tell them apart from ourselves unlike the cavemen guys we see on the tv commercials theyd look exactly like us astralopithecus lucy – this is the m ost recent and the most complete ancient “human” skeleton ever found however the skeleton is missing most of the skull shoulders hands feet and knees which are the key identifiers that separate man compared from ape the pelvic bone is another good indicator but lucy has an ape pelvic bone after further study lucy has now been shown to be a true ape an extinct type oforangutan however our young people today are erroneously being taught that lucy is proof of man’s evolution from an ape australian aborigines – for years australian aborigines were thought to be living missing links that show our ape ancestry thousands of aborigines were killed for scientific study before scientists realized they were human it was their more blockish features and primitive culture that made evolutionists believe they may be the missing link it was also belief in a grossly misguided theory the theory of evolution to date not one fossil link showing that man descended from apes have been found they won’t be found because each of us were created by the same almighty god regardless of our color or other features we were all created in the image of an almighty god why is this important because we need to understand that the bible is the holy word of god its perfect and true throughout its entire content this is important because it tells us about gods special promise to each of us and how we can spend eternity with god in heaven
