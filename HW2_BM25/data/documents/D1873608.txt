investing in rhodium the worlds most expensive metal the worlds most exotic precious metal written by luke burgess posted may 21 2010 at 314pmtweet editors note update be sure to read wealth dailys most uptodate and exclusive resource page on precious metals investing available to only to you its one of the most exotic metals in the world100 times rarer than gold 150 times more expensive than silver in fact its the most expensive of all precious metals yet no matter its rarity or cost this metal is absolutely vital to the rapidly recovering automobile industry the metal im talking about is rhodium the world rhodium market rhodium — along with platinum palladium ruthenium iridium and osmium — is part of a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals pgms or platinum group elements pges platinum group metals have similar physical and chemical properties but rhodium is the rarest some of rhodiums principal applications are as a finish for jewelry mirrors optical instruments in electrical connections and in aircraft turbine engines but the predominant use of rhodium is in catalytic converters for automobiles for which — especially in diesel engines — the metal has no substitute as much as 8090 of annual rhodium supplies go into the production of automotive catalytic converters which convert harmful gases from auto exhaust into less harmful substances rhodium is exceedingly rare and there are no pure rhodium mines in existence rhodium is produced entirely as a byproduct of platinum andor nickel mining this means global rhodium supplies can not respond to changes in demand so if the supply of rhodium is short prices will rise drastically — and fall just as fast if demand eases off there are less than ten significant rhodium producing mines in the world most of which are located in south africa which supplies over 80 of the worlds demand for rhodium but recent power shortages in south africa have forced mining companies to decrease — and sometimes even completely halt — rhodium production with no clear resolution to the crisis in the foreseeable future this has caused sharp deficits in the supplydemand dynamics of the rhodium market in recent years annual rhodium production is already extremely limited only about 25 tons of rhodium are mined each year compare that to the 2350 tonnes of gold mined in 2009 or the 220 tons of platinum mined each year rhodium prices with such a limited supply rhodium doesnt come cheap it is the most expensive of all precious metals currently trading at 2725 an ounce to give you a better idea of its cost thats over twice as expensive as gold and 154 times more than silver the spot prices of rhodium are set by johnson matthey twice daily for the american market you can see the latest prices and price histories here rhodium prices have been quite volatile in recent years in 2003 rhodium averaged 530 an ounce but rapidly increasing demand and supply deficits over the next five years skyrocketed rhodium prices to over 10000 an ounce as its principal application is in automotive catalytic converters the sharp decline of the global automobile industry sent rhodium prices tumbling after reaching a high of 10010 per ounce rhodium prices collapsed more than 90 to a low of 760 per ounce in just a few months but now that the global automobile industry is recovering rhodium prices are back on the rise in the past 6 months alone rhodium prices have risen 270 take a look investing in rhodium buying rhodium for investment is difficult because rhodium is a nonexchange traded commodity and cannot be bought using futures etfs spread betting or other derivatives however investors can now buy the physical metal and to my knowledge there is one mint that offers investment grade 999 fine rhodium the cohen mint produced the first grade 999 rhodium bullion coins and bars in april 2009 rhodium is extremely hard has an extremely high melting point and is very difficult to work with thus traditional methods of minting bullion will not work with rhodium the cohen mint claims it has developed a special process that allows it to be the only mint in the world to produce rhodium bullion the main downside to investing in this rhodium bullion however is that the premium for bars and coins are outrageously high at last look the premium for a one troy ounce rhodium bar from the cohen mint was near 20 compare that to gold coins where premiums average about 5 if paying a high premium turns you off you can also invest in rhodium through one of the several platinum group metal producers where the precious metal is part of the mix large platinum group metal producers that have exposure to rhodium include north american palladium amex palanglo american nyse aauknorilsk nickel otcbb nilsyanglo platinum jnb amsimpala platinum jnb implonmin plc lon lmi jnb lolmiaquarius platinum lon aqpthe outlook for rhodium prices remains robust as the global automotive industry recovers and continued supply shortages from south africa may continue to drive prices higher as long as the demand for rhodium remains strong thus rhodium merits limited allocation within a properly diversified precious metals portfolio good investingluke burgess editor wealth daily investment director hard money millionaire the best free investment youll ever make sign up to receive the
