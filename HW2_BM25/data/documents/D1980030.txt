where is borneo20121017by lash world tour mt kinabalu – sabah – borneo where is borneo here’s a question for you do you know where borneo is is it some farflung south pacific island is it set deep in the heart of african jungles part of exotic asia perhaps hidden in rugged south america further do you know if borneo is its own independent nation or part of a larger country don’t feel bad if you don’t know the answers… borneo is a bit of a mystery to most westerners i do believe i remember when i didn’t know much about it myself most of the confusion and mystery about borneo i suspect is due to its quite unusual and frankly confusing status let’s clear that up shall we view larger map to start with borneo is the third largest island in the world a tropical jungleclad island set in the south china sea in se asia for scale borneo is roughly the size of france or texas the island doesn’t entirely belonging to any one nation but is divided between three countries indonesia malaysia and brunei and that i believe is the main cause for confusion among westerners it’s just hard to categorize a place that doesn’t belong to a single nation borneo straddles the equator nestled between philippines to the north indonesia to the east and south and malaysia and singapore to the west borneo’s southern two thirds is occupied by the indonesian state of kalimantan a wild denselyjungled and undeveloped region borneo’s northern third is inhabited by the two malaysian states of sabah and sarawak the tiny islamic nation of brunei is wedged between sabah and sarawak hugging borneo’s north coast here’s a bit more about each nation and territory occupying borneo sultan omar ali saifuddien mosque – brunei brunei brunei is nowhere close to being the smallest nation in the world with a whopping 76 countries even smaller mostly island nations but it’s still pretty tiny close in size to puerto rico on the other hand brunei is big on wealth ranked as the fifth wealthiest nation in the world by forbes just imagine that the fifth wealthiest country in the world and most people don’t know anything about it brunei’s great source of wealth not surprisingly is its vast petroleum and gas fields brunei is classified as a developed country truth be told though most of the country consists of undeveloped rain forest still accessed only by boat up dense jungleclad rivers brunei’s only developed region is based around the capital brunei city bandar seri begawangoing up river…being so tiny brunei doesn’t have all that much for visitors to see or do various jungle tours are available to explore the country’s unspoiled interior scuba diving is also available mostly at oil rigs besides that visitors can spend a few days checking out brunei city’s major attractions including a royal museum the stately mosque and a ‘water village’ built over the river that’s what i did when i visited brunei is very easy to visit from the two neighboring malaysian states of sabah and sarawak you can get there by boat bus or airplane check out my trip to brunei to learn more about visiting cruising into brunei country kalimantan – borneo kalimantan the large indonesian state of kalimantan occupies the southern two thirds of borneo island kalimantan consists mostly of dense undeveloped rugged jungle most towns are located along the coast leaving the vast interior largely untouched though many riverside villages thrive along remote rivers kalimantan’s main industry is logging some tourists do visit kalimantan when traveling through indonesia it’s generally accessed from other indonesian islands like java and bali various jungle tours are available for such adventurous travelers truth be told kalimantan is one region i’ve never visited i don’t know anything about it firsthand while i have traveled fairly extensively through sabah  sarawak and made a quick trip to brunei kalimantan has so far eluded me rather than spout off about a place i don’t know personally i’ll just leave it at this for now niah cave – sarawak malaysian borneo sabah and sarawak these two malaysian states are referred to collectively as eastern malaysia while malaysia’s main region is called penninsular malaysia both sabak and sarawak are great destinations for outdoor adventure enthusiasts and nature lovers between the two states there are over 30 gorgeous national parks several

tribes carved wooden shields intricate paintings natural fiber clothes bamboo tattoos totem poles woven fabrics beaded headbands unique musical instruments and traditional dances are all made at sarawak’s remote upriver tribal villages on a sour note sabah and sarawak have both come under heavy international scrutiny for rampant rain forest destruction unsustainable logging and the endangerment of rare animals like orangutans and elephants due to deforestation sabah has been particularly ruthless in its rain forest destruction driving across sabah nowadays one can literally drive for 23 days through vast palm plantations where jungles and their inhabitants used to dwelltraditional boats on rajang river in sarawak – borneo despite these serious problems in malaysian borneo visitors can still participate in a huge array of adventurous activities around both states and perhaps tourist dollars pouring into the national parks orangutan sanctuaries and other projects will help slow down the destruction and help preserve what is still left of this magnificent habitat sabah and sarawak are the principle places to visit for travelers considering holidays in borneo a quick visit through tiny brunei is also fun and easy to include when visiting either malaysian state i traveled for one month through each of sabah and sarawak a few years ago here’s the impressive
