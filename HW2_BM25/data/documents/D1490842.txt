recognizing eagle scouts for achievements at the national level in their career or hobbyrelated field all nominees must be an eagle scout for at least 25 years additionally each nominee should have a lifetime record of volunteer service what is the process for submitting a nomination nominations must be submitted by the council nesa committee only individuals may not submit a nomination directly to the national office the nomination form should be accompanied by documentation detailing the nominee’s national achievements in his field and a record of his community service this can be mailed or emailed to nesa but it must be submitted by the council or nesa committee representative only how is the desa approved the desa committee is made up of seven volunteer desa recipients from around the country nominations are submitted electronically to the members and they have two weeks to return their vote to nesa a nesa staffer will collect the votes and notify the council of their decision the vote must be a majority decision and does not need to be unanimous how can i ensure the nomination will be approved the desa is a national award requiring national distinction in the nominee’s field nominations that do not present proof of national distinction are denied in some cases the council may choose to grant the noesa instead due to the variety of professionals who are nominated there are a variety of ways the nominee might receive national recognition in his field for example doctors might hold positions on national medical boards receive national awards from their peers pioneer medical techniques that become an industry standard or make a discovery that leads to advances in medicine nesa created the nesa outstanding eagle scout award in 2011 to recognize eagle scouts for accomplishments at the local state and regional level therefore desa nominations should provide recognition beyond the state and regional level or the desa committee will deny and recommend granting the noesa instead how long does it take to approve a desa nomination nesa recommends waiting at least a month before inquiring desa nominations are submitted to the committee about once a month and the voters are given two weeks to respond what does nesa provide as part of the approval councils may purchase recognition items through nesa including a wall plaque presentation kit and device these items must be ordered through nesa as these are restricted items and supply needs verification that each award has been approved by the national office when and how should a desa be presented the award may be presented by the recipient’s council the recipient’s colleagues or both the recipient should be consulted and given the chance to invite the people he wishes to share the occasion with the timing should also be set by the recipient as these men are not aware of their nomination and they may not desire a public presentation or they may desire to put it off for an extended period due to previous obligations how can i get a list of desa recipients from my council nesa posts an updated list of desa recipients at httpwwwnesaorgxlsmasterdesalistxls this is a sortable excel file that will allow recipients to be sorted by name council board of review date and approval year additional information is considered confidential and must be requested by the council only the list is updated once a year as nesa does not know whether these men have been notified of their selection we do not want to publicize that information before the council has had a chance to make the announcement nesa outstanding eagle scout award noesawhat are the requirements for earning the noesa the noesa is approved by the local council and submitted to national for final approval the nominee must be an eagle scout the council must have a nesa committee on file at the national office and the council must have the quota available to grant the award there is no age limit to earn the noesa the noesa may not be granted posthumously is there an age limit to earning the noesa no unlike the distinguished eagle scout award which requires that the nominee be an eagle scout for 25 years the noesa has no age limit this allows councils to recognize eagle scouts at the peak of their notoriety rather than waiting years to recognize accomplishments how many noesas can our council award in a year each council may award at least two noesas starting in 2014 all councils that awarded 0 – 99 eagle ranks in the previous year may award two noesas and add an additional selection for every 100 eagles beyond 99 the council would receive three nominations for awarding 100 – 199 eagle ranks in the previous year four nominations for awarding 200 – 299 eagle ranks in the previous year five nominations for awarding 300 – 399 eagles in the previous year and so on how long does it take to receive the presentation items nesa suggests allowing about four weeks to process these nominations this is one of many awards we process and our three staffers may fall weeks behind during membership drives scholarship season and other national projects what does nesa provide as part of the approval nesa provides an 8” x 10” certificate and a lapel pindevice there is no noesa knot the pin may be used as a lapel pin or device depending on the recipient’s attire and the occasion scouting eventworkrelatedetc how can i get a list of noesa recipients from my council nesa posts a sortable list of noesa recipients at httpwwwnesaorgxlsmasternoesalistxls this list is updated annually due to the fact that nesa does not know when these recipients will be notified and we do not want to spoil the council’s plans for a surprise presentation adams eagle scout service project of the year awardwhat is the adams eagle project of the year award in 2009 the nesa committee created a new award to recognize eagle scout service projects at the local regional and national level the award was named in honor of nesa president glenn adams each council selects a council representative and forwards the submission to the national office regional committees will review the submissions from their region then the national committee will select the national winner from the four regional finalists how do i submit an application for the adams award all submissions must be made to the local council scouts should not submit these directly to the national office as the honor of selecting a council representative goes to the local council please contact your council and ask to speak to the nesa committee staff adviser for local council submission guidelines how does my council select a winner each council sets their own criteria some councils select winners based on the amount of work that went into a project while others are looking for the project that stirs the emotions this is the council’s responsibility and the national office will not overrule their decision how does my council submit our winner to the national office each council must submit an electronic copy of the winning packet to adamsawardscoutingorg these submissions are sent to the regional committees electronically therefore we require that the submissions be scanned and submitted electronically because nesa does not have the resources to scan hundreds of submissions some containing hundreds of pages and photos each when are the recipients notified nesa notifies the council in midmay we do not contact the scouts directly as most councils prefer to make an official announcement locally my council does not have a nesa committee andor does not plan to utilize the award locally is there a way that i can submit it to national without their approval unfortunately no nesa cannot force councils to grant nesa awards in 2013 only 104 out of 285 councils around the country submitted a council winner to the national office if a council decides not to submit a local winner then no one from that council will be recognized can we get the council winner’s device before the national and regional winners are selected in may nesa asks that all councils wait to receive the recognition items in midmay when the national committee has made its decision nesa cannot mail out awards before they have been selected councils are free to recognize the scout locally with a specially made gift or certificate
