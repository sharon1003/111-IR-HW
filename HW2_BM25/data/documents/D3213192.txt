operative management of anorectal fistulas author bradley j champagne md facs fascrs section editor martin weiser md deputy editor wenliang chen md ph dintroductionan anorectal fistula is an inflammatory tract or connection between the epithelialized surface of the anal canal and most frequently the perianal skin or perineum it often evolves from a spontaneously draining anorectal abscess perianal fistulous disease has significant implications for patient quality of life as sequelae range from minor pain and social hygienic embarrassment to frank sepsis the management of the anorectal fistula also called fistulainano remains one of the most challenging and controversial topics in colorectal surgery surgery is the mainstay of therapy with the ultimate goal of draining local infection eradicating the fistulous tract and avoiding recurrence while preserving native sphincter function  12  the surgical approach depends on several factors such as the etiology location type and duration of the fistula as well as previously performed procedures and preoperative sphincter function this topic will discuss surgical management of anorectal fistulas the causes clinical manifestations diagnosis and classification of anal fistulas can be found elsewhere see anorectal fistula clinical manifestations diagnosis and management principles and perianal complications of crohn disease  fistula anatomymost internal openings of the fistula are located around the anal glands surrounding the dentate line  34 since over 90 percent result from a cryptoglandular abscess originating from the crypts of morgagni which are located between the two layers of the anal sphincter  figure 1  fistulas that occur between the anal orifice and the dentate line are referred to as anal in origin while fistulas that originate above the dentate line are rectal in origin less commonly fistulas occur between the anal canal or rectum and the vagina or bladder see urogenital tract fistulas in women  the course of an anorectal fistula follows one of four paths intersphincteric 45 percent transsphincteric 30 percent suprasphincteric 20 percent or extrasphincteric 5 percent before exiting at the perianal skin  figure 2 and figure 3  5  anatomy of the anal regiona thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the anal canal ischiorectal fossa perirectal tissues and the sphincteric muscles is imperative before proceeding with any operative procedure to treat an anorectal fistula  figure 4 and figure 5  the following is the anatomical description of the anal region  68  to
