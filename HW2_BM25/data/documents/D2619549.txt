long time8 july 2004  by dmacmartin – see all my reviews it is a simplistic movie with a kid like charm but maybe thats its strength with sooo many movies today exhibiting violence murder rape incest hatred etc when it has to do with families and kids and the studios appearing to forget about movies with a real warmth about them unless it is politically correct warmth ie  too many movies today rewrite history like the disney animated movies of today to make sure the harmed parties are put in a good light and others are put in a bad light it is always nice to see a movie that doesnt put on any airs to be genuine don knotts is a comedic genius and there are none like him in hollywood today it is sad to say that it appears hollywood has forgotten what really entertains people they seem to be focused upon what is sensational and appeals to the lowest form of human attention meaning death blood and violence and forgetting about the warmth and love of the past for this reason this movie is a fantasy that will live forever22 of 28 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report this review this title  see all 36 user reviews »getting started  contributor
