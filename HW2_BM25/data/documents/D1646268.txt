notation  editthe fnumber n or f is given bywhere is the focal length and is the diameter of the entrance pupil  effective aperture  it is customary to write fnumbers preceded by f  which forms a mathematical expression of the entrance pupil diameter in terms of f and n 1 for example if a lenss focal length is 10 mm and its entrance pupil diameter is 5 mm the fnumber is 2 expressed by writing  f 2 and the aperture diameter is equal to where is the focal length ignoring differences in light transmission efficiency a lens with a greater fnumber projects darker images the brightness of the projected image  illuminance relative to the brightness of the scene in the lenss field of view  luminance decreases with the square of the fnumber doubling the fnumber decreases the relative brightness by a factor of four to maintain the same photographic exposure when doubling the fnumber the exposure time would need to be four times as long most lenses have an adjustable diaphragm which changes the size of the aperture stop and thus the entrance pupil size the entrance pupil diameter is not necessarily equal to the aperture stop diameter because of the magnifying effect of lens elements in front of the aperture a 100 mm focal length f 4 lens has an entrance pupil diameter of 25 mm a 200 mm focal length f 4 lens has an entrance pupil diameter of 50 mm the 200 mm lenss entrance pupil has four times the area of the 100 mm lenss entrance pupil and thus collects four times as much light from each object in the lenss field of view but compared to the 100 mm lens the 200 mm lens projects an image of each object twice as high and twice as wide covering four times the area and so both lenses produce the same illuminance at the focal plane when imaging a scene of a given luminance a tstop is an fnumber adjusted to account for light transmission efficiency stops fstop conventions and exposure  edita canon 7 mounted with a 50 mm lens capable of f 095a 35 mm lens set to f 11 as indicated by the white dot above the fstop scale on the aperture ring this lens has an aperture range of f 20 to f 22 the word stop is sometimes confusing due to its multiple meanings a stop can be a physical object an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays the aperture stop is the aperture setting that limits the brightness of the image by restricting the input pupil size while a field stop is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped in photography stops are also a unit used to quantify ratios of light or exposure with each added stop meaning a factor of two and each subtracted stop meaning a factor of onehalf the onestop unit is also known as the ev  exposure value unit on a camera the aperture setting is traditionally adjusted in discrete steps known as fstops each  stop  is marked with its corresponding fnumber and represents a halving of the light intensity from the previous stop this corresponds to a decrease of the pupil and aperture diameters by a factor of or about 07071 and hence a halving of the area of the pupil most modern lenses use a standard fstop scale which is an approximately geometric sequence of numbers that corresponds to the sequence of the powers of the square root of 2 f 1 f 14 f 2 f 28 f 4 f 56 f 8 f 11 f 16 f 22 f 32 f 45 f 64 f 90 f 128 etc each element in the sequence is one stop lower than the element to its left and one stop higher than the element to its right the values of the ratios are rounded off to these particular conventional numbers to make them easier to remember and write down the sequence above is obtained by approximating the following exact geometric sequence in the same way as one fstop corresponds to a factor of two in light intensity shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time therefore to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture the shutter would be opened for half as long ie twice the speed the film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light since it has the property of reciprocity this is less true for extremely long or short exposures where we have reciprocity failure aperture shutter speed and film sensitivity are linked for constant scene brightness doubling the aperture area one stop halving the shutter speed doubling the time open or using a film twice as sensitive has the same effect on the exposed image for all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied with no effect on exposure it is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two photographers sometimes express other exposure ratios in terms of stops ignoring the fnumber markings the fstops make a logarithmic scale of exposure intensity given this interpretation one can then think of taking a halfstep along this scale to make an exposure difference of half a stop fractional stops  editcomputer simulation showing the effects of changing a cameras aperture in halfstops at left and from zero to infinity at rightmost old cameras had a continuously variable aperture scale with each full stop marked clickstopped aperture came into common use in the 1960s the aperture scale usually had a click stop at every whole and half stop on modern cameras especially when aperture is set on the camera body fnumber is often divided more finely than steps of one stop steps of onethird stop 13 ev are the most common since this matches the iso system of film speeds halfstop steps are used on some cameras usually the full stops are marked and the intermediate positions are clicked as an example the aperture that is onethird stop smaller than f 28 is f 32 twothirds smaller is f 35 and one whole stop smaller is f 4 the next few fstops in this sequence aref 45 f 5 f 56 f 63 f 71 f 8 etc to calculate the steps in a full stop 1 ev one could use2 0×05 2 1×05 2 2×05 2 3×05 2 4×05 etc the steps in a half stop 12 ev series would be2 02×05 2 12×05 2 22×05 2 32×05 2 42×05 etc the steps in a third stop 13 ev series would be2 03×05 2 13×05 2 23×05 2 33×05 2 43×05 etc as in the earlier din and asa filmspeed standards the iso speed is defined only in onethird stop increments and shutter speeds of digital cameras are commonly on the same scale in reciprocal seconds a portion of the iso range is the sequence 1613° 2014° 2515° 3216° 4017° 5018° 6419° 8020° 10021° 12522°while shutter speeds in reciprocal seconds have a few

fnumber equivalent for effective exposure based on the area covered by the holes in the diffusion discs or sieve aperture found in rodenstock imagon lenses tstop  edita tstop for transmission stops by convention written with capital letter t is an fnumber adjusted to account for light transmission efficiency  transmittance  a lens with a tstop of n projects an image of the same brightness as an ideal lens with 100 transmittance and an fnumber of n a particular lens tstop t is given by dividing the fnumber by the square root of the transmittance of that lens for example an f 20 lens with transmittance of 75 has a tstop of 23 since real lenses have transmittances of less than 100 a lenss tstop number is always greater than its fnumber 7with 8 loss per airglass surface on lenses without coating multicoating of lenses is the key in lens design to decrease transmittance losses of lenses some reviews of lenses do measure the tstop or transmission rate in their benchmarks 8 9 tstops are sometimes used instead of fnumbers to more accurately determine exposure particularly when using external light meters 10 lens transmittances of 60–95 are typical 11 tstops are often used in cinematography where many images are seen in rapid succession and even small changes in exposure will be noticeable cinema camera lenses are typically calibrated in tstops instead of fnumbers 10 in still photography without the need for rigorous consistency of all lenses and cameras used slight differences in exposure are less important however tstops are still used in some kinds of specialpurpose lenses such as smooth trans focus lenses by minolta and sony sunny 16 rule  editan example of the use of fnumbers in photography is the sunny 16 rule an approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day by using an aperture of f 16 and the shutter speed closest to the reciprocal of the iso speed of the film for example using iso 200 film an aperture of f 16 and a shutter speed of 1200 second the fnumber may then be adjusted downwards for situations with lower light selecting a lower fnumber is opening up the lens selecting a higher fnumber is closing or stopping down the lens effects on image sharpness  editcomparison of f 32 topleft corner and f 5 bottomright cornershallow focus with a wide open lens depth of field increases with fnumber as illustrated in the image here this means that photographs taken with a low fnumber large aperture will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus with the rest of the image nearer and farther elements out of focus this is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur the aesthetic quality of which is known as  bokeh  can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewers focus on the main subject in the foreground the depth of field of an image produced at a given fnumber is dependent on other parameters as well including the focal length the subject distance and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view subject distance and entrance pupil diameter as in von rohrs method  as a result smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same fnumber for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length wider angle lens to produce the same angle of view and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths therefore reduced–depthoffield effects will require smaller fnumbers when using smallformat cameras than when using largerformat cameras image sharpness is related to fnumber through two different optical effects aberration due to imperfect lens design and diffraction which is due to the wave nature of light 12 the blur optimal fstop varies with the lens design for modern standard lenses having 6 or 7 elements the sharpest image is often obtained around f 56– f 8 while for older standard lenses having only 4 elements  tessar formula stopping to f 11 will give the sharpest image  citation needed the larger number of elements in modern lenses allow the designer to compensate for aberrations allowing the lens to give better pictures at lower fnumbers even if aberration is minimized by using the best lenses diffraction creates some spreading of the rays causing defocus to offset that use the largest lens opening diameter possible not the f number itself light falloff is also sensitive to fstop many wideangle lenses will show a significant light falloff  vignetting at the edges for large apertures photojournalists have a saying  f 8 and be there meaning that being on the scene is more important than worrying about technical details practically f 8 allows adequate depth of field and sufficient lens speed for a decent base exposure in most daylight situations 13human eye  editcomputing the fnumber of the human eye involves computing the physical aperture and focal length of the eye the pupil can be as large as 6–7 mm wide open which translates into the maximal physical aperture the fnumber of the human eye varies from about f 83 in a very brightly lit place to about f 21 in the dark 14 note that computing the focal length requires that the lightrefracting properties of the liquids in the eye are taken into account treating the eye as an ordinary airfilled camera and lens results in a different focal length thus yielding an incorrect fnumber toxic substances and poisons like atropine can significantly reduce the range of aperture pharmaceutical products such as eye drops may also cause similar sideeffects tropicamide and phenylephrine are used in medicine as mydriatics to dilate pupils for retinal and lens examination these medications take effect in about 30–45 minutes after instillation and last for about 8 hours atropine is also used in such a way but its effects can last up to 2 weeks along with the mydriatic effect it produces cycloplegia a condition in which the crystalline lens of the eye cannot accommodate to focus near objects this effect goes away after 8 hours other medications offer the contrary effect pilocarpine is a miotic induces miosis it can make a pupil as small as 1 mm in diameter depending on the person and their ocular characteristics such drops are used in certain glaucoma patients to prevent acute glaucoma attacks focal ratio in telescopes  editdiagram of the focal ratio of a simple optical system where is the focal length and is the diameter of the objective in astronomy the fnumber is commonly referred to as the focal ratio or fratio notated as it is still defined as the focal length of an objective divided by its diameter or by the diameter of an aperture stop in the system deven though the principles of focal ratio are always the same the application to which the principle is put can differ in photography the focal ratio varies the focalplane illuminance or optical power per unit area in the image and is used to control variables such as depth of field when using an optical telescope in astronomy there is no depth of field issue and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power not divided by area is a function of absolute aperture area only independent of focal length the focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece film plate or ccd for example the soar 4meter telescope has a small field of view f16 which is useful for stellar studies the lsst 84 m telescope which will cover the entire sky every three days has a very large field of view its short 103 m focal length f12 is made possible by an error correction system which includes secondary and tertiary mirrors a three element refractive system and active mounting and optics 15working fnumber  editthe fnumber accurately describes the lightgathering ability of a lens only for objects an infinite distance away 16 this limitation is typically ignored in photography where objects are usually not extremely close to the camera relative to the distance between the lens and the film in optical design an alternative is often needed for systems where the object is not far from the lens in these cases the working fnumber is used a practical example of this is that when focusing closer the lens effective aperture becomes smaller from eg f22 to f45 thus affecting the exposure the working fnumber n w is given bywhere n is the uncorrected fnumber na i is the imagespace numerical aperture of the lens is the absolute value of lenss magnification for an object a particular distance away and p is the pupil magnification 16 since the pupil magnification is seldom known it is often assumed to be 1 which is the correct value for all symmetric lenses in photography the working fnumber is described as the fnumber corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor this is of particular importance in macro photography history  editthe system of fnumbers for specifying relative apertures evolved in the late nineteenth century in competition with several other systems of aperture notation origins of relative aperture  editin 1867 sutton and dawson defined apertal ratio as essentially the reciprocal of the modern fnumber in the following quote an apertal ratio of 124 is calculated as the ratio of 6 inches 150 mm to 1⁄ 4 inch 64 mm corresponding to an f24 fstop in every lens there is corresponding to a given apertal ratio that is the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length a certain distance of a near object from it between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus for instance in a single view lens of 6 inch focus with a 14 in stop apertal ratio onetwentyfourth all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it a fixed star for instance are in equally good focus twenty feet is therefore called the focal range of the lens when this stop is used the focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object in the same lens the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased the terms apertal ratio and focal range have not come into general use but it is very desirable that they should in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses 17in 1874 john henry dallmeyer called the ratio the intensity ratio of a lens the rapidity of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus to ascertain this divide the equivalent focus by the diameter of the actual working aperture of the lens in question and note down the quotient as the denominator with 1 or unity for the numerator thus to find the ratio of a lens of 2 inches diameter and 6 inches focus divide the focus by the aperture or 6 divided by 2 equals 3 ie 13 is the intensity ratio 18although he did not yet have access to ernst abbe s theory of stops and pupils 19 which was made widely available by siegfried czapski in 1893 20 dallmeyer knew that his working aperture was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop it must be observed however that in order to find the real intensity ratio the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained this is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses or for double combination lenses used with the full opening these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule but when double or triplecombination lenses are used with stops inserted between the combinations it is somewhat more troublesome for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination to ascertain this focus for a distant object remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer and now remove to a darkened room apply a candle close to the hole and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination the diameter of this circle carefully measured is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed 18this point is further emphasized by czapski in 1893 20 according to an english review of his book in 1894 the necessity of clearly distinguishing between effective aperture and diameter of physical stop is strongly insisted upon 21j h dallmeyers son thomas rudolphus dallmeyer inventor of the telephoto lens followed the intensity ratio terminology in 1899 22aperture numbering systems  edita 1922 kodak with aperture marked in u s stops an fnumber conversion chart has been added by the user at the same time there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture rather than with the square of the fnumber or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio but these systems all involved some arbitrary constant as opposed to the simple ratio of focal length and diameter for example the uniform system u s of apertures was adopted as a standard by the photographic society of great britain in the 1880s bothamley in 1891 said the stops of all the best makers are now arranged according to this system 23 u s 16 is the same aperture as f 16 but apertures that are larger or smaller by a full stop use doubling or halving of the u s number for example f 11 is u s 8 and f 8 is u s 4 the exposure time required is directly proportional to the u s number eastman kodak used u s stops on many of their cameras at least in the 1920s by 1895 hodges contradicts bothamley saying that the fnumber system has taken over this is called the fx system and the diaphragms of all modern lenses of good construction are so marked 24here is the situation as seen in 1899 piper in 1901 25 discusses five different systems of aperture marking the old and new zeiss systems based on actual intensity proportional to reciprocal square of the fnumber and the u s c i and dallmeyer systems based on exposure proportional to square of the fnumber he calls the fnumber the ratio number aperture ratio number and ratio aperture he calls expressions like f 8 the fractional diameter of the aperture even though it is literally equal to the absolute diameter which he distinguishes as a different term he also sometimes uses expressions like an aperture of f 8 without the division indicated by the slash beck and andrews in 1902 talk about the royal photographic society standard of f 4 f 56 f 8 f 113 etc 26 the r p s had changed their name and moved off of the u s system some time between 1895 and 1902 typographical standardization  editby 1920 the term fnumber appeared in books both as f number and fnumber in modern publications the forms fnumber and f number are more common though the earlier forms as well as fnumber are still found in a few books not uncommonly the initial lowercase f in fnumber or fnumber is set in a hooked italic form f or f 27notations for fnumbers were also quite variable in the early part of the twentieth century they were sometimes written with a capital f 28 sometimes with a dot period instead of a slash 29 and sometimes set as a vertical fraction 30the 1961 asa standard ph2121961 american standard
