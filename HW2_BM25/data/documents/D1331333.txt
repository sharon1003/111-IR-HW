their basic rights and freedoms these women begin to complain aboue the slavery of sex the gendered argument for denying women their basic rights and freedoms however was complicated by the fact that

expanded in american society with the american revolution and the expansion of basic rights and freedoms in the early 1800s white male americans came to understand freedom in a greatly expanded way in

wihout slavery blacks would disappear just like the indians some southern slaveholders argued that god created blacks to be enslaved by whites they were created irrational creatures that couldnt surive on their own along with the development of race and racial inferiority to justify this emerging new white male society of rights and freedoms came social darwinism we can begin to see these

denial of basic rights and freedoms however some american women would challenge the gendered arguments but not the racial arguments for denial of basic rights and freedoms in the 1830s the emerging discussion about the american family womens status and womens rights came about because of the increasing concern to justify womens inferior status and rights an a free american society in addition debates about wage slavery and the personal right to control ones own labor intensified with the rise of market capitalism and the employment of young women in the new factories was a husband or father justified in demanding his wifes or daughters wages when she worked in these factories if a man could control a womans work and wages what was the difference between black slavery and sex slavery between 1830 and 1860 5 million europeans immigrated to america as a result there were growing debates about whether the irish or catholics or other european groups could become part of this new white male community of freedom wealthy mexican property holders in 1850s california declared themselves spanish in order to justify their participation in this empire of liberty if they were mexicans or indians or nonwhite their basic rights in american society would be denied this helps explains the history of some mexican people defining themselves as spanish in order to distinguish themselves from an inferior indian or mexican race the battle over slavery led abolitionists and other americans to challenge the increasing use of racial and gender arguments to deny americans their basic rights and freedoms this also led many to question whether america was as senator stephen douglas aruged a white mans republic senator stephen douglas on slavery lincoln rejected stephen douglas argument that america was a white mans republic lincoln argued the rights enumerated in the declaration of independence applied to all men in all lands everywhere the civil war was fought over whether america was a white mans republic a slave nation or a free society even lincoln recognized the increasing american contradiction that led to the civil war he argued that america cant remain half slave and half free by abolishing slavery during the civil war lincoln created as he argued in the gettysburg address a new birth of freedom the declaration of independence we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness — that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed — that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do — and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor theodore white the american idea jefferson himself could not have imagined the reach of his call across the world in time to come when he wrote we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happinesssome of the first european americans had come to the new continent to worship god in their own way others to seek their fortunes but over a centuryandahalf the new world changed those europeans above all the englishmen who had come to north america neither king nor court nor church could stretch over the ocean to the wild continent to survive the first emigrants had to learn how to govern themselves but the freedom of the wilderness whetted their appetites for more freedoms by the time jefferson drafted his call men were in the field fighting for those newlearned freedoms killing and being killed by english soldiers the besttrained troops in the world supplied by the worlds greatest navy only something worth dying for could unite american volunteers and keep them in the fielda stated cause a flag a nation they could call their own but what is most important is the story of the idea that made them into a nation the idea that had an explosive power undreamed of in 1776 all other nations had come into being among people whose families had lived for time out of mind on the same land where they were born englishmen are english frenchmen are french chinese are chinese while their governments come and go their national states can be torn apart and remade without losing their nationhood but americans are a nation born of an idea not the place but the idea created the united states government abigail and john adams an exchange of letters abigail adams to john adamsi long to hear that you have declared an independency and by the way in the new code of laws which i suppose it will be necessary for you to make i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands remember all men would be tyrants if they could if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation martin luther king the american dream sermonit wouldnt take us long to discover the substance of that dream it is found in those majestic words of the declaration of independence words lifted to cosmic proportions we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by god creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this is a dream its a great dream the first saying we notice in this dream is an amazing universalism it doesnt say some men it says all men it doesnt say all white men it says all men which includes black men it does not say all gentiles it says all men which includes jews it doesnt say all protestants it says all men which includes catholics  yes sir it doesnt even say all theists and believers it says all men which includes humanists and agnostics then that dream goes on to say another thing that ultimately distinguishes our nation and our form of government from any totalitarian system in the world it says that each of us has certain basic rights that are neither derived from or conferred by the state in order to discover where they came from it is necessary to move back behind the dim mist of eternity they are godgiven gifts from his hands never before in the history of the world has a sociopolitical document expressed in such profound eloquent and unequivocal language the dignity and the worth of human personality the american dream reminds us and we should think about it anew on this independence day that every man is an heir of the legacy of dignity and worth  martin luther king letter from a birmingham jail moreover i am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states i cannot sit idly by in atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in birmingham injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly never again can we afford to live with the narrow provincial outside agitator idea anyone who lives inside the united states can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds more and more i feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will we will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with god and without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation we must use time creatively in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity king the american dream commencement address 1961all this is simply to say that all life is interrelated we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly as long as there is poverty in this world no man can be totally rich even if he has a billion dollars as long as diseases are rampant and millions of people cannot expect to live more than twenty or thirty years no man can be totally healthy even if he just got a clean bill of health from the finest clinic in america strangely enough i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be you can never be what you ought to be until i am what i ought to be this is the way the world is made i didnt make it that way but this is the interrelated structure of reality john donne caught it a few centuries ago and could cry out no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main  any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee  if we are to realize the american dream we must cultivate this world perspective  martin luther king chief josephs story 1879i know that my race must change we cannot hold our own with the white men as we are we only ask an even chance to live as other men live we ask to be recognized as men we ask that the same law shall work alike on all men let me be a free manfree to travel free to stop free to work free to trade where i choose free to choose my own teachers freed to follow the religion of my fathers free to think and talk and act for myself joseph concludes his speech by promising that if white americans treat the indian as they treat each other then we shall have no more wars we shall all be alike  young chief joseph ralph ellison an american dilemma a reviewin our society it is not unusual for a negro to experience a sensation that he does not exist in the real world at all he seems rather to exist in the nightmarish fantasy of the white american mind as a phantom that the white mind seeks unceasingly by means both crude and subtle to lay to rest myrdal proves this no idle negro fancy he locates the negro problem in the heart of the white american  the conflict between his moral valuations on various levels of consciousness and generality indeed the main virtue of an american dilemma lies in its demonstration of how the mechanism of prejudice operates to disguise the moral conflict in the minds of whites produced by the clash on the social level between the american creed and antinegro practices there is however a danger in this very virtue for the solution of the problem of the american negro and democracy lies only partially in the white mans free will its full solution will lie in the creation of a democracy in which the negro will be free to define himself for what he is and within the large framework of that democracy for what he desires to be let this not be misunderstood for one is apt in welcoming an american dilemmas democratic contribution to forget that all great democratic documentsand there is a certain greatness herecontain a strong charge of antidemocratic elements perhaps the wisest attitude for democrats is not to deplore the ambiguous element of democratic writings but to seek to understand them for it is by making use of the positive contributions of such documents and rejecting their negative elements that democracy can be kept dynamicmuch of negro culture might be negative but there is also much of great value and richness which because it has been secreted by living and has made their lives more meaningful negroes will not willingly disregard what is needed in our country is not an exchange of pathologies but a change of the basis of society this is a job which both negroes and whites must perform together in negro culture there is much of value for america as a whole what is needed are negroes to take it and create of it the uncreated consciousness of their race in doing so they will do far more they will help create a more human american certainly it would be unfair to expect dr myrdal to see what negro scholars and most american social scientists have failed to see after all like most of its predecessors an american dilemma has a special social role and while we do not quarrel with it on these grounds necessarily let us see it clearly for what it is its positive contribution is certainly greater at this time than those negative elementshence its uncritical reception the time element is important for this period of democratic resurgence created by the war an american dilemma justifies the desire of many groups to see a more democratic approach to the negro the military phase of the war will not however last forever it is then that this study might be used for less democratic purposes fortunately its facts are to an extent neutral this is a cue for liberal intellectuals to get busy to see that an american dilemma does not become an instrument of an american tragedypresident ford bicentennial speechthe american revolution was unique and remains unique in that it was fought in the name of the law as well as liberty at the start the declaration of independence proclaimed the divine source of individual rights and the purpose of human government as americans understood it that purpose is to secure the rights of the individuals against even government itself but the declaration did not tell us how to accomplish this purpose or what kind of government to set up the constitution was created to make the promise of the declaration come true the declaration was not a protest against government but against the excesses of government it prescribed the proper role of government to secure the rights of individuals and to effect their safety and their happiness in modern society no individual can do this all alone so government is not necessarily evil but a necessary good  it is good to know that in our own lifetime we have taken part in the growth of freedom and in the expansion of equality which began here so long ago this union of corrected wrongs and expanded rights has brought the blessings of liberty to the 215 million americans but the struggle for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is never truly won each generation of americans indeed of all humanity must strive to achieve these aspirations anew liberty is a living flame to be fed not dead ashes to be revered even in a bicentennial year it is fitting that we ask ourselves hard questions even on a glorious day like today are the institutions under which we live working the way they should are the foundations laid in 1776 and 1789 still strong enough and sound enough to resist the tremors of our times are our godgiven rights secure our hardwon liberties protected it is right that americans are always improving it is not only right it is necessary from need comes action as it did here in independence hall those fierce political rivals  john adams and thomas jefferson  in their later years carried out a warm correspondence both died on the fourth of july of 1826 having lived to see the handiwork of their finest hour endure a full 50 years they had seen the declarations clear call for human liberty and equality arouse the hopes of all mankind jefferson wrote to adams that even should the cloud of barbarism and despotism again obscure the science and libraries of europe this country remains to preserve and restore life light and liberty to them over a century later in 1936 jeffersons dire prophesy seemed about to come true president franklin d roosevelt speaking for a mighty nation reinforced by millions and millions of immigrants who had joined the american adventure was able to warn the new despotisms we too born to freedom and believing in freedom are willing to fight to maintain freedom we and all others who believe as deeply as we do would rather die on our feet than live on our knees the world knows where we stand the world is ever conscious of what americans are doing for better or for worse because the united states today remains the most successful realization of humanitys universal hope the world may or may not follow but we lead because our whole history says we must liberty is for all men and women as a matter of equal and unalienable right the establishment of justice and peace abroad will in large measure depend upon the peace and justice we create here in our own country where we still show the way foner the idea of american freedom in the 17th and 18th centuries no idea is more fundamental to americans sense of themselves as individuals and as a nation than freedom xiiifreedom has always been a terrain of conflict subject to multiple and competing interpretations its meaning constantly created amd recreated xvvarious types of freedom1 political freedom the right to participate in public affairs2 moral freedom or the christian ideal of freedom the capacity to act according to an ethical standard  a christian value system3 personal freedom the ability to make crucial individual choices free from outside coercion4 economic freedom economic automony the right to control private property the right to participate in the free market gunnar myrdal the american dilemma in the american dilemma 1944 gunnar myrdal called the american creed  a belief in the essential dignity of all human beings and their inalienable right to democracy liberty and equal opportunity myrdal saw a vicious cycle in which whites oppressed blacks and then pointed to blacks poor performance as reason for the oppression the way out of this cycle he argued was to either cure whites of prejudice or improve the circumstances of blacks which would then disprove whites preconceived notions myrdal called this process the “principle of cumulation in blackwhite relations the american dilemma  junfu zhang gives this description of myrdals work according to myrdal the american dilemma of his time referred to the coexistence of the american liberal ideals and the miserable situation of blacks on the one hand enshrined in the american creed is the belief that people are created equal and have human rights on the other hand blacks as one tenth of the population were treated as an inferior race and were denied numerous civil and political rights myrdals encyclopedic study covers every aspect of blackwhite relations in the united states up to his time he frankly concluded that the negro problem is a white mans problem that is whites as a collective were responsible for the disadvantageous situation in which blacks were trapped samuel du bois cook on freedomhistorically and morally speaking freedom is the fruit of struggles tragic failures tears sacrifices and sorrowfoner the birth of american freedom during the american revolution the puritans came to america with a spiritual definition of freedom christian liberty meant submission not only to the will of god but to secular authority as well to a wellunderstood set of interconnected responsibilities and duties a submission not less complete for being voluntary and thus religious liberty meant obedience to god civil liberty meant obedience to law so long as the laws were created by elected representatives and did not operate in an arbitrary fashion note this is a lockean definition of liberty british freedom celebrated the rule of law the right to live under legislation to which ones community had consented restraints on the arbitrary exercise of political authority and rights like trial by jury enshrined in the common law republicanism and liberalism this tension between freedom as the power to participate in public affairs and freedom as a collection of individual rights requiring protection against governmental interference republican liberty was a civic and social quality which could only be exercised by citizens of a free state liberty was the right to pariticipate in public affairs liberalism or lockean liberty meant protecting the private life and personal concerns from interference by the state by the american revolution freedom depended on owning property participating in civil politics freedom from government interference in an individuals life and basic rights which government could not take away this idea of freedom is spelled out by jefferson in the declaration of independence
