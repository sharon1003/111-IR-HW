levers  pulleys investigation  1 levers word banklever a simple machine that people use to gain a mechanical advantage such as making work easierlever arm a stick or beam free to pivot at a pointfulcrum the point where the lever arm pivotsload the mass lifted or the resistance overcome by levereffort the force needed to move a load or overcome a resistancenewtons effort is measured newtonstwocoordinate graphs show relationships between two variablesadvantage – a benefit obtained by using a lever or other simple machinestudy questions what are the four parts of a lever system in what ways can a lever provide an advantage what is the relationship between the load and effort that gives a lever user the greatest advantage when the load is at a constant position on the lever arm how can you make it easier to lift the load what is the difference between the weight of the load and the amount of effort needed to lift it what is the relationship between the location of the load on the lever system and the effort it takes to move it investigation 2 more leverage word bank class1 levers – have the fulcrum in the middle and the load and effort at the ends class2 levers have the load in the middle and the fulcrum and effort at the ends class3 levers have the effort in the middle and the fulcrum and load at the ends diagram is a drawing that describes the relationship of all the parts of a system reallife levers class1class2class3study questions how many different ways can levers be set up how can we record information about lever design where are levers found in everyday use what happens to the effort required to lift a load as the load moves closer and closer to the fulcrum in a class1 lever a class2 lever and a class3 lever investigation 3 pulleys word bankpulley a wheel with a grooved rim in which a rope can run to change the direction of the pull force that lifts a loadfixed pulley a wheel that is attached to something above the loadmovable pulley a wheel that is attached to the loadmechanical advantage reduces the effort force needed to lift a load or overcome a resistance it results from using a simple machinedirectional advantage a change in direction that results for passing a rope through a pulleysimple machines is any of the six basic devices that provide mechanical or other advantage such as pulleys and levers study questions can a pulley be used to lift a load do singlepulley systems provide an advantage is there any advantage to using two pulleys at the same time what is a simple machine investigation 4 pulleys at work types of pulleys one pulley systems single fixed single moveable two pulley systems singlefixed singlefixed singlemoveable down singlemoveable up study questions what is the relationship between the number of ropes supporting the load in a pulley system and the effort required to lift the load what do you need to know in order to predict how much effort will me needed to lift a load with a pulley system how does the expression “you never get something for nothing” apply to pulley systems we studied the advantage of levers what would be the disadvantagehttpwwwfosswebcomback to science
