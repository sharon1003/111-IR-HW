the physical structure of dnathere is no real difference between chemical and physical structure but here we mean structure maintained by forces weaker than covalent bonds dna molecules in cells consists of two strands of dna with the phosphate backbones running in opposite directions the two strands are held together by the complementary hydrogen bonds of the g c and a t base pairs however the stability of double stranded dna depends even more on forces that cause the planar bases to stack along the axis of the structure bases are too far apart the optimal separation between bases is 34 angstroms however the distance between bases along the phosphodiester backbone is about twice that distance if dna were a straight ladder the bases would thus be too far apart to form a stable stack twist the strands into a helix and the bases come together and form a stack the solution to base separation is to twist the double stranded structure into a helix the distance between nucleotides along the now inclined phosphodiester backbone stays the same but the bases are now separated along the axis of the helix by the optimal 34 angstroms at this separation they are in contact eg there is not even space enough for water molecules to get between them in the helix there are about 105 base pairs in a complete turn or an average twist of 34 degrees per base we can study the forces that hold this molecule together by causing it to fall apart it is easy to follow unwinding and strand separation by measuring absorption in the uv it is even easier to destroy denature the helical structure just increase the temperature until it melts
