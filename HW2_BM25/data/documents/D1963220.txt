it’s music to my ears that’s not music it’s noise turn down that noisewhat is music how do we know what’s musical and what’s not why is music music to some ears and noise to others everyone thinks they know music when they hear it but few can say exactly what it is and why if you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a command like “turn down that noise” you know how slippery ideas about music can be few have succeeded in truly defining music imposing a single definition on all of the world’s music is difficult because people’s opinions differ about what music is and what is musical many scholars of “world music” study behaviors and sounds that are not considered to be “music” by the people who make it—the chanting of the koran for instance it’s our job to figure out a way of studying music that makes sense to the people who make it rather than trying to come up with a definition of music we look for a concept of music that works for the culture we study here are a few that are likely to work for any music music can best be understood as “humanly organized sound” or “the purposeful organization of sound” 1music is a form of communication music has much in common with language and the two are almost inseparable as ingredients in popular song opera and other musical forms the relationship between music and language has been an important part of the human musical experience since prehistoric times music is difficult to describe in nonmusical means ie words as elvis costello has observed “writing about music is like dancing about architecture”people’s concepts of music do not always match the way they perform and experience music for example societies may claim that music is highly valued but deny artists a livelihood persecute them politically or call them a danger to public morals asking questions and comparing answers about the activities and social status of musicians is key to the informed study of music many music lovers insist that music is best appreciated if we do not define it analyze it or expect it to communicate anything at all so what does music have to tell us why study music music offers a record of history and human experience that words and images cannot this record is especially important in nonliterate societies or in cultures where colonization war and social rupture have interrupted the transmission of written history second music has a unique ability to convey memory both song texts and tunes can remind us of people places and events accessing an ancient “hard drive” of historical memory in my own study of elderly jewish immigrants singing particular songs in the yiddish language helped them retrieve important recollections from their past it made it easier and less painful to recall their experiences in the holocaust and as refugees in new york city and israel certain songs situated them and me their listener at a specific place in time conquering the inadequacies of historical facts and events to describe a particular situation we must always respect the fact that for many people music is just music and it acts on them in ways that are personal and individual yet ethnomusicologists have found that music is often “implicated” or repurposed for different ideas and agendas beyond its original conception for example richard wagner’s music was used by nazis to express notions of aryan supremacy in germany music has been used to strengthen the power of governments sell cars foment revolution and convert souls to a particular religion music does not just act as a mirror of the culture that created it it “performs” that culture 1 john blacking how musical is man seattle university of washington press 1973 p 3 kay shelemay soundscapes exploring music in a changing world new york london w w norton and company 2001
