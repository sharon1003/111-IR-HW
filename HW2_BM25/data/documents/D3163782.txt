lean six sigma for the services industry may 20 2008 bain brief by peter guarraia gib carey alistair corbett and klaus neuhaus how to get the most from lean six sigma lean six sigma was originally devised to eliminate waste and improve manufacturing quality to no more than 34 defects per million opportunities but now the method—made popular at companies like general electric co xerox corp and johnson  johnson—is increasingly finding a home in the services industry related insightsbetting on zerobased budgetings trifecta industry expertiseutilities  alternative energy oil  gas financial services retail services telecommunications how we can helpperformance improvement lean six sigma we have seen banks use lean six sigma to support their growth strategy financial services companies to put mergers back on track energy companies to lower costs telecommunications companies to improve customer service and retailers to increase efficiency while boosting customer service in the store but lean six sigmas growing popularity in the services industry masks a downside many organizations have trained and deployed legions of lean six sigma experts—known as black belts—only to see little value result from their work in a recent bain  company management survey of 184 companies 80 percent say their lean six sigma efforts are failing to drive the anticipated value and 74 percent say they are not gaining the expected competitive edge because they havent achieved their savings targets drilling deeper we discovered that mobilizing large and costly squads of black belts in some cases actually slows performance improvement efforts managers are unsure how best to deploy the lean six sigma experts and too often black belts treat all problems big and small with the same approach resulting in lesseffective solutions moreover they fail to prioritize the improvements that will make the biggest difference this last issue is particularly vexing to companies as they search for ways to reduce costs or boost revenues while lean six sigma can be excellent at remedying obvious maladies like callcenter bottlenecks it is less adept at uncovering the hidden sources of pain and identifying and sizing the largest opportunities for cost savings waste reduction or revenue generation its unnecessary and wasteful to run every process through lean six sigma knowing where to focus before unleashing the black belts can make all the difference companies that are yielding the biggest gains from lean six sigma are deploying an upfront diagnostic xray to help them identify the most critical opportunities performed by a small advance team of black belts the diagnostic xray consists of three steps enterprise value stream mapping in which the xray team scans the enterprise and maps its primary processes to identify the biggest opportunities to reduce cost by reducing wasted time and materials benchmarking in which the performance of processes is measured against internal and external benchmarks to gauge shortcomings and establish improvement targets prioritizing in which the xray team determines which process improvements will yield the greatest results when the lean six sigma teams are deployed only after the xray has identified the most pressing issues do companies begin the traditional fivestep lean six sigma dmaic process—define measure analyze improve and control—on the targeted areas an insurance companys biggest source of pain this methodology paid off for a major uk insurance company that found itself at a crossroads plans to grow its market share by 150 percent were threatened by market changes that put new pressure on profits the firm knew its internal processes were inefficient but prior efforts to streamline them had failed so the insurer decided to take a diagnostic xray of its business to determine where to focus its efforts by first examining its processes within a single business unit the xray team was able to compare similar processes used by other business units to create benchmarks and set performance targets and priorities for reducing waste the result was a dramatic reduction in annual processing time and revenue savings1 enterprise value stream mapping the first move taken by the xray team is to develop a map of the operations processes and the costs associated with them the goal is to understand what activities a company performs the source of its biggest expenses and where inefficiencies or performance gaps exist for instance during the mapping stage the insurance companys team started by creating a businessprocess fact base which involved looking at processes from end to end—everything from account setup to claims handling—and gathering data on 189 activities an analysis showed that there were seven major steps in the value chain each step then was broken out to look at time spent and staffing levels this breakdown helped the company zero in on major inefficiencies the company found that it was spending the same amount of time and money on every claim—be it for a highly valued customer like a global corporation or a single individual with the value stream maps in hand the team could see where improved performance would deliver the greatest and fastest cost savings2 benchmarking determining how much performance might be improved is the purpose of the second step of the xray the aim of this phase is to establish valid benchmarks both internal and external for each process to identify appropriate performanceimprovement targets benchmarking was key to the dramatic reduction in processing time and cost savings achieved by the insurance company using the results of value stream mapping the xray team at the insurance company then established internal benchmarks by examining how various business units carried out similar processes they found costly differences for example in one unit the claimshandling process represented 11 percent of total costs while at another business unit it was only 6 percent the xray team found that the placement process—gathering customer information placing insurance issuing certificates handing over processing to the back office and chasing client payments—took twice as long in one business unit as it did in another armed with this knowledge the company could establish valid performance targets for its lessefficient processes and develop standardized processing times benchmarking also helped the team track its costs by activity—an exercise that allowed the company to better understand client risk the company was able to see where it made money exposing the most to leastprofitable business units the cost curve starkly showed how the company could tailor service to better align costs to what clients value breaking customers into three segments based on overall profitability3 prioritizing in this final phase of the xray the team decides which problems to pursue in which order for the insurance company this meant plotting the value of solutions against how difficult theyd be to implement at the top of the list three opportunities for boosting revenues and cost savings while also more effectively meeting customer needs with its priorities firmly established the black belts embarked on the lean six sigma process first the company set out to reprice some policies—charging more to clients that were expensive to serve and raising prices for smaller clients that demanded tailored service within the first year repricing alone earned the insurer an additional 10 percent of profits second the black belts worked on a series of organizational changes like standardizing the processing times across business units—boosting profits by a further 10 percent third over the next 30 months the insurer invested in technology upgrades that included sophisticated costmodeling tools over time the investment paid off by allowing business units to calculate such details as how many hours employees need to spend on gold standard clients versus other customer segments the cost analysis changed staffing assumptions like how large a sales team it needed ultimately it investments helped deliver a final 30 percent profit increase putting the xray to work valuable surprises and great results the uk insurance companys experience demonstrates how a technique originally designed to improve efficiency and quality on the factory floor is finding a home in the services industry as lean six sigma spreads to new industries it is being deployed to help companies meet a range of new objectives when paired with the diagnostic xray the lean concept becomes an even more powerful tool showing companies how they can do everything from spending less on equipment to redesigning stores for efficiency to performing a better job of stocking and replenishing inventory the following five case studies illustrate the breadth of the diagnostic xrays potential a bank supports its growth strategy a major australian commercial bank wanted to take advantage of a market shift that was pushing more business in its direction but it wouldnt be able to handle larger more complex loan applications unless it overhauled credit processes at every level of the organization—from loan processing to credit policies to the sales force and credit approval teams the bank needed new capabilities that would increase the speed accuracy and efficiency of credit processes and decision making the protracted loan approval process was driving away new investments from valued customers who needed—and expected—quick action value stream mapping of the banks credit processes revealed major trouble spots in the banks systems including a lack of uniformity in loan approvals too often credit officers made judgmentbased instead of rulebased loan decisions also all loans—large or small—had to move through the same initial layers of approval with 20 percent sent through a more rigorous screening even when the bank was familiar with a clients risk history finally the process was riddled with inefficiencies and downtime and many applications required reworking due to errors during a series of workshops loan managers who dealt directly with clients expressed their frustration with credit approval officers who often failed to update them about a loans status as a result of poor communication and delays loan managers found it harder to win new business the bank used benchmarking to determine how long where and why loans were stuck in the approval process as well as the reasons behind rejections by comparing systems at different branches the team could see which ones were working and what differences resulted in improvements for example one branch had expedited its loan approvals by placing a more experienced credit approval officer on the floor to work with loan managers this partnering helped customers get a better sense of both timing and approval odds with mapping and benchmarking results in hand the bank prioritized a list of highvalue opportunities for lean six sigma top priorities developing a fast track for lowerrisk loans standardizing processes and improving risk assessment and borrowing a lesson from the branch that was able to speed up loan approvals credit approval officers would work with loan managers on a customized application process that included such steps as asking a customer up front for specific information the diagnostic xray helped the bank focus its black belts on opportunities that promised the best results with the improvements in place new business is fueling growth rates at 25 times the market almost 50 percent of loan applications now go through the new fasttrack approval process which has translated into a 30 percent quicker approval time for customers approval times now take 36 days less ranging from 714 days down from 1020 days with more experienced credit officers working in the field the number of loans requiring more timeintensive reviews has dropped from 20 percent to 5 percent and there are fewer errors—streamlining and standardizing processes has cut by 25 percent the number of applications that need reworking a mobile phone provider improves customer service—and also cuts costs a leading european mobile phone company in a highly competitive marketplace knew it had to beef up customer service to prevent competitors from winning away its customers at the root of the problem was the companys customer service center operators were swamped with calls they had a poor track record for resolving customer problems and the callcenter was operating with a limited budget the company needed a twopronged solution a new callcenter strategy that would transform the center into a revenue generator and the ability to zero in on the most critical initiatives to improve customer service the diagnostic xray laid the groundwork for the lean six sigma work that would develop both solutions it exposed key callcenter inefficiencies which in many cases were driving customer defections the xray showed that the biggest cost saver would be to redesign systems so operators could resolve problems on the first call allowing the company to reduce staffing and to turn the call center into a revenue generator the xray process used customer and competitor surveys to create benchmarks for identifying three distinct customer groups based on their customer value that ultimately led to creating service plans for each customer segment by knowing where to focus its efforts the mobile phone operators new callcenter strategy has improved customer service and started generating revenue the company is on track to save 25 percent of its operating costs in less than three years saving a merger figuring out who does what best a major financial institution used the diagnostic xray and lean six sigma to resolve cultural differences that threatened the success of a recent merger when a merchant bank acquired the market leader in its segment management couldnt reach a consensus on how to run the merged business the former competitors used vastly different business practices and processes the resulting culture clash was driving top talent out the door by employing the diagnostic xray management was able to build a consensus around merged operating practices and quickly prioritize highvalue areas for improvement the key to resolving the culture clash was developing a best of both worlds approach in the valuestream mapping phase they looked at loans both institutions had reviewed the comparison allowed bank officials to see how differences in their processes affected loan approvals and client relationships the mapping uncovered a key difference in how the two banks handled morecomplex higherrisk deals while the larger merchant bank did a better job assessing the risk of bigger deals approvals took as much as two times longer even on easier deals the approval process was slow by comparison the acquired bank was smoother and faster at loan approvals and was better at customer service—but its deals typically were smaller to get a sense of the industry standard the diagnostic team benchmarked the banks against competitors approval processes for deals over 50 million they discovered that the acquiring bank had many unnecessary steps especially for easier deals customer interviews revealed that while large loan approvals were handled appropriately the bank needed to take a tip from its acquired partner and improve customer relations by better managing the expectations of its highlyvalued private equity clients once areas for improvement were identified the bank prioritized them by asking what are the two or three highimpact easytoimplement ways to improve the loan approval process and retain talent since pay raises werent in consideration the bank looked at changes that would streamline the process without dramatically changing the way employees were accustomed to working the answer—a loan approval system with a path that allows for two choices a simpler route with fewer hurdles for lowrisk deals a more rigorous standardized process for morecomplex deals the solution incorporated the acquired banks ease and predictability with the acquiring banks sophistication for handling larger deals to let the marketplace know that the merged bank could handle both higherrisk private equity loans as well as smaller ones with the same speed and dependability it sent out a newsletter showcasing recent loans and the time it took to get them done by using the diagnostic xray the two banks built a strong business case for merging their two cultures the concrete data and specifics helped them acknowledge relative strengths and agree on which processes required improvements black belts then went to work using lean six sigmas dmaic methodology drilling down on specific improvement initiatives and developing metrics to ensure continuous results this best of both worlds approach has allowed the merged entity to increase its average deal size by 35 percent and by streamlining processes management is able to quickly move applications through the approval process a retailer uncovers small fixes for substantial gains a us bigbox retail market leader needed to stave off competition from general merchandise discounters to keep its strong growth on track but the cost of its solution—making stores more customer friendly—was skyrocketing faster than it was delivering results the retailer needed a customerfocused strategy that it could afford over the long haul the diagnostic xray in advance of lean six sigma played a crucial supporting role uncovering ways to cut costs that would be invisible to customers the diagnostic xray team used value stream mapping for up to 100 operations to determine how many hours were spent each week on routine tasks everything from opening and closing stores pricing taking inventory restocking shelves and filling orders placed through the retailers website tasks with high numbers relative to the activitys importance went to the top of the target list for improvements armed with the list of potential targets the diagnostic team headed to stores where they observed processes—looking for those that seemed ripe for streamlining the team surveyed employees and conducted internal benchmarking by comparing systems store to store no process was too small for review—like the existing process of requiring employees to fill out a special form each time a customer requested price matching employees explained that the timeconsuming form never was looked at again also on the target list the inefficient system for filling online orders while the retailer was encouraging customers to place orders on its website for pickup at a nearby store the system for getting orders into customers hands was unreliable and time consuming the team found out why unless an employee was stationed at a computer the store had no way of knowing when an order arrived there were further inefficiencies when it came to filling the order items werent placed near the pickup area in any particular order causing delays as employees searched for the right product the xray team examined another process it had redflagged the system used to keep a steady stream of highprofit items on store shelves it was more important to have a 100 highmargin core item in stock than a 5 accessory by watching employees and checking merchandise holes on shelves the team realized that workers werent following a weekly plan for restocking inventory when asked why employees said the plan was so detailed it felt impossible to get through the entire inventory in a week back at corporate headquarters the team prioritized tasks for retooling by estimating the value of each opportunity measured against the cost of implementation whats impressive is that instead of a few big home runs the retailer found 50 million in annual cost reductions from small process changes top priorities included redesigning the restocking calendar so employees could easily see which products to check at what times each day throughout a month projected annual savings was 10 million eliminating those timeconsuming customer forms for 3 million annually in savings 23 million from labor and 800000 from paper fixing the online order pickup process by adding new ways to ensure that the store was aware when an order was received and changing how and where items were stored for easy retrieval the retailer could save another 12 million standardizing the daily setup of cash register drawers the company found it could save another 700000 annually simply by knowing how much change is needed when the retailer finally unleashed its black belts the diagnostic allowed it to focus immediately on creating results that matter an energy leader discovers a savings windfall—and fends off competitors a leading uk energy company saddled with 1 billion in operating expenses needed to improve its cost performance to protect its market leadership to curb customer defections and better compete the company sought to transform its business processes which were riddled with inefficiencies the company decided to increase its odds of success by taking a diagnostic xray before unleashing its lean six sigma black belts by performing a detailed mapping of costs related to all aspects of customer service—from pursuing new customers setting up accounts measuring energy use and collecting payments—the diagnostic team developed a detailed analysis of costsaving opportunities the biggest one was a surprise during the mapping phase the company determined how often its representatives read a meter then in the benchmarking phase the company found that nearly 50 percent of its meterreading expenses were avoidable most of the opportunity came from simply reducing the number of times it reads a meter as it prioritized other costsaving opportunities the company found additional ways to score several quick wins by more effectively targeting new customers and reducing callcenter costs it could trim customer acquisition expenses—automating routine calls alone would save over 5 million annually it could trim support costs by 20 percent to 30 percent with a redesign of billing payment and debtcollection processes in the end the detailed xray of core processes showed the company how it could reduce 30 percent of its total costs while at the same time more effectively competing for new customers and improving customer service once the black belts set to work on these initiatives the energy leader was on track to achieve stronger cost performance—and its longterm competitive strategy such is the power of the diagnostic xray peter guarraia is a partner in bain  companys los angeles office gib carey is a partner in chicago alistair corbett is a partner in toronto and klaus
