covariatesi the california workers compensation system instituted as part of hiram johnsons reforms in 1911 the division of workers compensation dwc is in charge of providing california workers and employers with a nofault means of resolving claims resulting from onthejob injuries in exchange for the certainty of payments for medical indemnity and rehabilitation costs workers waive some of their rights to sue employers employers on the other hand are provided with a means to spread risk by having their possible exposure to injury loss capped a dispute resolution in basic form a worker enters the workers compensation system when heshe is injured both the worker and the employer are obligated to report injuries the worker then may be evaluated by one or more specialists to determine legal issues related to the injury specialist exams may either be performed at the request of the worker the employer by both an agreed medical evaluation or on rare occasions an independent medical evaluation is requested by the workers compensation appeals board wcab an agreement may then be reached on the medicallegal issues or if the finding is disputed a variety of judicial and arbitration processes are used to arrive at a settlement cases are ultimately settled one of 6 possible ways1 voluntary payments the insurer makes voluntary payments and issues are not in dispute2 compromise and release the employer and worker agree on all disputed issues the insurer makes payments and the worker in exchange releases the insurer from all future obligation3 stipulated award similar to compromise and release except that the worker does not release the insurer from all obligation usually the stipulation is for future medical benefits4 finding and award a judge awards the worker a particular payment from the insurer5 dismissal a judge dismisses a case and no award is made this is largely done in cases where the worker fails to meet a court appearance6 take nothing a judge rules a claim without merits and does not award a settlement to the worker of these possible resolution methods the best in terms of dwc costs and time is voluntary payment the next two methods compromise  release and stipulated award are a second best solution while the last three finding and award dismissal and take nothing involve high legal and preparation costs regardless of outcome b medicallegal reports medicallegal reports are conducted to determine the following issues workers eligibility for benefits ability to return to work permanent and stationary status of the employees medical condition existence and extent of permanent disability employees preclusion or likely preclusion from engaging in his or her usual occupation extent and scope of medical treatment existence of new and further disability these exams are conducted at the request of the worker the employer and on some occasions at the request of a dwcwcab refereejudge under current law these evaluations are carried out by the injured workers treating physician s or a qualified medical evaluator qme as approved by the industrial medical council imc qmes can be acting as an agreed medical evaluator ameindependent medical evaluator ime agreed upon by both parties or appointed by a judge a qme chosen by either the employer or the worker in a dispute where the worker is represented by an attorney or a qme chosen from a panel when the worker is not represented prior to the 1993 reforms the evaluator chosen by parties in a disputed case was not required to be a qme if the worker was represented c total cost calculations a total cost of medicallegal exams the cost of medicallegal exams on permanent partial disability ppd claims has shown a steep decline since peaking for the 1991 accident year for the insured community the total cost of medicallegal exams performed on ppd claims by 40 months after the beginning of the accident year 1 has declined from a high of 394 million for the 1991 accident year to an estimated 64 million for the 1994 accident year this is a decline of 84 percent in the cost of medicallegal reports and represents a saving of 330 million this decline in costs reflects changes in all the components of the cost structure consider medicallegal exam costs on ppd claims as comprised of the following components total cost  number of ppd claims  average costexam  number of examsclaim then as chart 2 displays thirtyseven percent of the decline in medical legal costs can be attributed simply to a decline in the number of permanent partial disability claims twentysix percent is due to a decline in the average cost per exam and the other thirtyseven percent savings results from a decline in the average number of exams per claim as the calculation of total system costs makes use of data derived from each section of this report a detailed description of how each element in the above equation was calculated will be given in each relevant section b number of ppd claims the number of ppd claims for the 1989 through 1992 accident years shown in table 2 is based on workers compensation insurance rating bureau wcirb second level individual case reports 2 projections of ppd claim levels for the 1993 and 1994 accident years at a similar level of maturity 30 months following the beginning of the policy year were made by uc data for comparison the frequency of claims is broken out by major and minor disabilities the decline in ppd claims is driven by a decline in the number of covered workers and the number of reported injuries as we will discuss below a substantial portion of the decline in ppd claim frequency may also be the result of a steep drop in the number of claims with a psychiatric component the number of major and minor ppd claims in the system for years 1989 through 1992 was obtained from second level individual case reports 30 months after the beginning of the policy year the survey data was weighted to reflect the distribution of cases in the second level individual case reports the total number and total cost of exams for the system was derived using data from the wcirb on the total number of ppd claims for these accident years to make projections on the frequency of major and minor ppd claims for claims in the 1993 accident year we first obtained 1993 data from the first level individual case reports 18 months after the beginning of the policy year second we calculated the historic growth rate in ppd claim frequencies major and minor from first level to second level individual case reports this growth rate was then applied to 1993 first level data to obtain projections comparable to 19891992 second level data projections for 1994 were made by using division of labor statistics and research data on the frequency of disabling injuries for 1993 and 1994 the ratio of 1993 to 1994 reported disabling injuries was applied to the estimate of 1994 ppd claims to estimate the number of 1994 ppd claims since the frequency of ppd claims has been falling more rapidly than the frequency of disabling injuries this may slightly overestimate the number of ppd claims for 1994 c average cost per exam the average cost per exam has declined from a high of 987 for 1990 accident year claims to the current estimate of 606 for 1994 claims this is driven by two important changes first the medicallegal fee schedule underwent several revisions that substantially reduced the charges rebuttably presumed reasonable these maximums are controlled by the date of exams rather than the date of injury most 1993 and all 1994 exams are concentrated in the period following aug 3 1993 when the fee schedule was at its lowest level only a fraction of 1991 and 1992 accident year claims have exams in the lowest period the 1994 accident year estimate of 606exam is the best estimate of the future cost of exams under the current medicallegal fee schedule second the average cost of exams is also determined by the mix of specialties of the reporting doctors some provider specialties have higher than average costs the larger the proportion of exams in costly specialties the higher the average cost psychiatric exams are substantially more expensive than exams by other specialties the dramatic decline in the number of psychiatric exams is responsible for 17 percent of the decline in the average cost of all exams to illustrate if the proportion of exams that were psychiatric had remained steady at the 1991 accident year level the average cost of medicallegal exams would have been 56 greater for the 1993 accident year for survey years 1991 and 1992 average cost per exam was obtainable from the survey as all claims have been observed for 40 months from the beginning of the accident year for 1993 claims we determined the average cost per exam at 28 months based on our analysis of prior years controlling for the fee schedule in effect the average cost of exams was not found to fluctuate over the life of the case between 28 and 40 months accordingly we projected average costs per exam in 1993 to remain constant between 28 and 40 months this could overestimate the costexam slightly because a small fraction of exams in the 1993 accident year occurred prior to august 1993in periods when more costly fee schedules were in effect accordingly average cost per exam for 1993 injuries is likely to decline slightly between 28 and 40 months1994 accident year exams all occur in the period after the least costly fee schedule went into effect accordingly we assumed the average cost per exam would remain constant at the current level d number of exams per claim chart 3 illustrates the decline in the number of exams per claim in the years from 1989 through 1994 this 52 percent decline is in part a result of changes made that were meant to reduce the dueling docs syndrome other changes such as presumed accuracy of treating physician reports the number of exams allowed per specialty in litigated cases and as noted below the decline in psychiatric exams due to the higher threshold required for cause the number of exams per claim at 40 months from the beginning of the accident year for the 19891992 accident years were obtained from the survey data from the survey are available for the average number of examsclaim for the 1993 accident year valued at 28 months from the beginning of the accident year using data from the previous panels of the survey historic growth rates were calculated between 28 and 40 months in the average number of exams per claim the 1993 data were grown by this rate 3for 1994 claims a ratio of 1993 to 1994 average number of examsclaim was estimated for comparable claims claims incepting from january through july and valued at 16 months from the beginning of the accident year this ratio was applied to the estimate of the 1993 exams per claim projection for 40 months to obtain an estimate of exams per claim at 40 months for the 1994 accident year claims ii summary of legislative and regulatory changes the 1989 and 1993 workers compensation reforms were intended to decrease system costs and the amount of time needed to settle cases many of these reforms were meant to directly or indirectly affect the medicallegal process a recent legislation affecting the cost of medicallegal evaluations legislation has changed the amount rebuttably presumed reasonable for medicallegal reports prior to 4393 these were determined by specialty orthopedic neurological internalcardiology psychiatric and all other after that time the specialty was no longer a determinant but the reports were separated into the following four categories supplemental ml101 includes examination of patient within one year of initial evaluation basic ml102 all evaluations other than supplemental complex or extraordinary complex ml103 includes three or more of followinga 2 or more hours physician face to face with patientb 2 or more hours of record review by the physicianc 2 or more hours of medical research by physiciand addressing the issue of medical causatione addressing the issue of apportionment extraordinary ml104 used in place of ml101103 where significantly more time is needed than the code allows a premium above the fee schedule amount was allowed where an interpreter was necessary or the evaluator was acting as an agreed medical evaluator ame these changes would be expected to impact the cost of medicallegal reports the minor adjustments to the fee schedule made prior to 8393 are likely to affect only the portion of tests whose cost was at or near the rebuttable maximum tests with costs much above or below the fee schedule targets would likely be unaffected by these small changes the very large change to the maximums introduced for exams conducted on or after 8393 should affect a much wider range of exams and would be expected to reduce costs more dramatically than previous reductions again tests whose costs were considerably below the new maximum would presumably not be affected 4the average cost of medicallegal reports can also be affected by the mix of reports a decrease in the relative frequency of reports by a more expensive specialty could reduce the average cost of reports even while all specialties individually were more expensive for example if the frequency of psychiatric reports the most expensive reports declined enough that alone could reduce average cost of all reports even if all specialties including psychiatric had increased in cost alternatively if reports requested by employers were less expensive on the average than those requested by workers as we will discuss below a decrease in the frequency of reports requested by employers relative to workers would appear to drive the cost of the average report higher this argues for an effort to disaggregate the analysis of medicallegal reports by studying them by both specialty and source of request b recent legislation affecting the frequency of medicallegal reports1989 legislation the margolin bill created the qualified medical evaluator qme and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms 5  in addition the statute limited each party to a single medicallegal report on any issue by each appropriate specialty or subspecialty chapter 892 also prohibits admission into evidence of any medical opinion other than a report from the treating physician that was obtained before the service of the assessment by the agreed or qualified medical evaluator1993 legislation ab 110 peace 1993 stat chap 121 effective july 16 1993 made numerous changes to the process of selecting medical evaluators which could be expected to reduce the number of reports chapter 121 allows the treating physician who is primarily responsible for the care of the injured worker to serve as the workers qualified medical evaluator legislation in 1989 had restricted the use of the treating physician by requiring separate report s by qualified medical evaluators chapter 121 also provided that where an additional comprehensive exam is obtained the findings of the treating physician are presumed to be correct except with a preponderance of evidence unless both parties elect qmes this encourages one or both parties to avoid seeking additional evaluations other legislation restricted medicallegal examinations during the first sixty days except at the request of the employer and limited the employers financial responsibility to a single comprehensive evaluation covering all issues c recent legislation affecting the frequency of psychiatric evaluations several legislative changes were expected to reduce the frequency of psychiatric evaluations by restricting the range of psychiatric injuries considered compensable the changes modified evidentiary rules imposing a preponderance of evidence requirement a series of changes increased over time the degree to which the cause of the injury or illness had to be related to employment assuming that the proportion of psychiatric injuriesillnesses remained steady relative to other injuries in the compensation system these restrictions should eliminate a number of these injuries from compensability because the psychiatric component fails to meet the threshold conditions for compensability however it could be argued that higher standards of proof lead to the need for more evaluations to establish whether the threshold conditions have been exceeded1989 legislation the margolinbill greene workers compensation reform act of 1989 made changes in the treatment of psychiatric injuries effective for injuries that occur on or after january 1 1990 chapter 892 narrowed the scope of compensability for psychiatric conditions by imposing a requirement that the employee demonstrate industrial causation by a preponderance of the evidence under prior law substantially in the record as a whole was the sole evidentiary standard for all workers compensation issues 6 chapter 892 further required that at least ten percent of the causation of a psychiatric condition be attributable to actual employment factors before the employee was eligible for benefits1991 legislation ab 971 peace effective july 1991 made additional changes by applying a further restriction denying recovery for those psychiatric injuries resulting from regular and routine employment unless the employee has worked for that employer for at least six months 71993 legislation sb 223 lockyer effective for injuries occurring on or after july 16 1993 changed the causation standard on psychological injuries to require that actual events of employment must be predominant as to all causes combined however if the psychiatric injury results from a violent act or from direct exposure to a violent act the employee is required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were a substantial cause of the injury cal lab code 32083 b 3 amended by chapter 1242 defines substantial cause as at least 3540 chapter 1242 also provided that psychiatric injuries are not compensable if substantially caused by a lawful nondiscriminatory goodfaith personnel action further restrictions were also placed on recovery for psychiatric injuries following notice of termination of employment or layoff the injury must have occurred prior to the time of notice of termination and one or more of the following conditions must exist 8 1 sudden and extraordinary events of employment caused the injury 2 the employer had notice of the injury prior to notice of termination or layoff 3 employment records contain evidence of previous treatment of the psychiatric injury 4 a finding of sexual harassment or 5 evidence that injury occurred after notice of termination or layoff but prior to the effective date of the termination or layoff 9d recent legislation affecting the outcomes of the medicallegal decision process for workers legislative changes can be expected to change outcome measures of the decisionmaking process by affecting the disability measurement process the determination of permanent disability under the statutes and regulations guiding the california system is at best imprecise this has led to numerous calls to change the way in which we determine permanent disability in our state different doctors can give very different evaluations to the same patient doctors having conservative and liberal interpretations of the level of disability are to some extent known to informed parties informed parties are individuals or entities that participate in the system on a frequent basis for example employers insurers or attorneys workers would not be expected to know the biases of doctors since they participate once or at most infrequently two wellinformed parties could be expected on average to reach unbiased decisions given equal levels of knowledge in choosing their experts workers acting alone might not be expected to reach a similarly unbiased outcome rather their ppd awards would be expected to be biased downward if information about the evaluating doctors interpretation is unknown to the worker and the selection is made by an informed party1989 legislation chapter 892 required that a notice be included with an injured workers final payment of temporary disability stating the employers position with respect to the employees eligibility for permanent disability compensation alternate procedures for resolving medical disputes were established dependent upon whether the employee was represented by an attorney if an employee was not represented by an attorney chapter 892 prohibited the employer from obtaining an agreement on the selection of a medical evaluator instead the statute required that in the event of a medical dispute with an unrepresented employee the employer must request that the medical director assign a panel of three qualified medical evaluators from which the employee can make a selection this eliminated the prior common practice where the injured worker was given a medical evaluation by a doctor suggested or assigned by the employers representative e recent legislation affecting the time to resolution1989 legislation the 1989 reform introduced new mechanisms for resolving disputes ab 276 provided for a mandatory settlement conference conducted by a referee not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after the filing for adjudication if the settlement conference does not resolve the dispute the regular hearing will be held within seventyfive days of the filing of the application if an injured employee is represented by an attorney ab 276 requires arbitration in disputes over insurance coverage and rights of contribution beginning 1191 arbitration will be required in cases of permanent disability when there is a low percentage of disability and the case cannot be heard within 110 to 150 days of the filing of the application for adjudication 10the introduction of arbitration and mandatory settlement conferences msc were meant to reduce the need for hearings and decisions and to speed the resolution of cases summary impact of legislative changes table 4 summarizes the possible impacts of the legislative changes introduced since 1989 here the dimensions across which the impacts are considered are1 frequency of medicallegal reports2 cost of medicallegal reports3 outcomes for workers4 time to resolution the following sections will examine the different impacts listed by column above that reform legislation had upon the california workers compensation system iii data and methodology a survey data for our analysis comes from the wcirb permanent disability survey the survey summarizes accident claim activity including the type and cost of specialty exams and whether the case was settled and if so what method of settlement was employed the survey also has data on estimated permanent disability rating but does not include data on the geographical place of injury any data about the worker or the type of work because accident claims are collected as part of an insurance policy claims cannot be sampled directly instead the wcirb collects all policies incepting on or after july of the year prior to the accident year through july of the accident year using second level individual case reports which value claims at 30 months after the beginning of the policy year the wcirb identifies accidents with dates of injury in the targeted accident year defined as permanent disability claims individual claims are stratified by injury severity claims with estimates of permanent disability equal to or greater than 25 percent are considered major disabilities while claims with ratings under 25 percent are considered minor disabilities a stratified random sample of 3500 claims is then drawn with 1500 claims coming from the major category and 2000 claims coming from the minor category 11the sampling scheme is intentionally designed to oversample major disability cases in reality approximately one fifth of all cases are major when evaluated at thirty months after policy inception the oversampling of these cases is necessary to allow enough data to be gathered so that separate inferences can be drawn about this relatively small population a negative consequence of this oversampling however is that the data necessary to reweight the survey sample population back to the relative distribution of majorminor injuries in the full population of injured workers has to be inferred for the 1993 and 1994 accident years weights were available for the 1989 through 1992 accident years weights for the 1993 and 1994 accident years were calculated based on estimates of the distribution of major and minor injuries at 30 months after the beginning of the policy year 12these sampled accident claims are reexamined at 52 and again at 64 months following the start of the target year to determine whether claims have been resolved or otherwise changed at the present time complete 64 month data in the survey exists only for target years 1989 and 1990 the 1991 target year data has been sampled through the 52 month 2nd panel period and the 1992 data exists through the 40 month period 1st panel the data available for the 1993 and 1994 accident years comes from special panels these were drawn at 28 and 16 months respectively from the beginning of the accident year both of these special panels consist only of 350 claims 13 as a result variances for all estimates made for these years will be much wider than for the earlier target years b methodology in addition because of the different maturity times by target year our analysis is forced to limit comparisons between years by different degrees of case maturity for example 1992 claims can be compared at 40 months to 1991 and earlier claims however 1992 claims can be compared to 1993 cases only at 28 months the final word on the effects of reforms upon the workers compensation system through target year 1994 will therefore have to wait for the third report which will be collected in april 1999 and available in early 2000 the weights for individual claims for the major and minor strata were not available from the wcirb the rating bureau creates the weights by evaluating the claims at 30 months after policy inception months based on the unit statistical report second level reports we are required to use the pd level reported on the permanent disability survey these data are from claims when they are several months more mature than thirty months these two data sources are likely to be very close but not exactly the same for future efforts we will try to obtain the actual weights used by the wcirb in most situations the analysis is done using data available on cases 28 and 40 months after the beginning of the accident year this allows us to compare data across accident years at similar points in the average maturity of claims it should be noted that claims occurring on jan 1 will have 12 months more activity than claims for accidents occurring on dec 31 of the same accident year consequently in some situations we use the actual maturity of the claims in months since date of injury this is done for example with the analysis of time to resolution and the incidence of psychiatric exams iv effects on costs of medicallegal reports a fees presumed reasonable the 1993 reforms made substantial changes to the structure of the medicallegal fee schedule and the level of reimbursement to the physician because insurers are required to pay for a medicallegal examination performed within parameters set by statute regardless of who requested the exam fee schedule levels are intended to 1 prevent the insurer from being over billed without 2 creating excessive legal disputes within the system over reimbursement as such we would expect that a lowering of the fee schedule levels would lower examination costs all other things being equal table 5 presents the medicallegal fees rebuttably presumed reasonable for each type of exam between 11186 through 4393 since 8393 the fee schedule has been considered prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of fees charged for medical legal expenses 14prior to 4393 fee schedule amounts tended to increase each year or fluctuate in a fairly narrow range between 4393 and 8393 no fee schedule was in place after 8393 the traditional system of fee schedule levels assigned by examining doctor specialty type was replaced with a set of flat fees and the maximums were reduced substantially b premium for ame evaluations in 1993 regulations introduced a premium for exams performed by a qualified medical evaluator acting as an agreed medical evaluator setting the level of this premium presents an issue for analysis under the present fee schedule ame fees are allowed to be 25 percent higher than those for either worker or employer requested examinations it is unclear from the regulations the purpose of the premium this difference may be intended to compensate ames for more complex requirements of an exam and responding to both parties setting this premium may be informed by analyzing prior and current premiums for ames table 8 shows the observed premium for ame first exams versus exams requested by workers and employers in the table 6 we present average costs for the first specialty exam for cases opened between 1189 and 123192 by the source of the request either the worker the employer or an ame the first exam was used in an effort to standardize on a single type of exam as much as possible in this case we are using the first exam as a proxy for a comprehensive medical evaluation 15 for purposes of this analysis we have decided to compare the costs between the period after 8393 and the four periods from 11898293 table 7 has the same data as above for claims with dates of injury in 1993 and 1994 these data are not strictly comparable to the above table first a substantial portion of the claims especially 1994 claims may not have had sufficient time to have had a first medicallegal evaluation second the sample sizes for 1993 and 1994 are small making the sample sizes in cells of the table below small  fewer than 5 claims in sample average first exam costs fall for all three requesters with the exception of exams performed by ames in specialties other than orthopedic and psychiatric this provides evidence that the recent changes in the fee schedule levels were effective in controlling specialty exam costs table 8 oberserved premium of ame exams over other requestsobserved ame premium over worker requested exams observed ame premium over employer requested exams1189 to 8293 orthopedic exams 17 298393 to latest available orthopedic exams28 261189 to 8293 psychiatric exams 34 358393 to latest available psychiatric exams27 331189 to 8293all other exams11 138393 to latest available all other exams15 49three observations are apparent from table 81 the first is that in practice observed premiums for ame exams prior to the adoption of the premium setting regulation had for the most part been above the 25 percent premium however the choice of 25 percent seems fairly consistent with the data2 second in the period after 8393 the premium may have increased slightly for orthopedic exams which are by far the most prevalent type approximately 60 of all specialty exams the all other category premium increased as well this category has greater variability in costs and heterogeneity in exam type so changes are harder to evaluate3 third employers are able to control the cost of medical exams far more effectively than are workers this is not surprising as employer requested exams are more directly under the control of insurance carriers who have greater leverage to negotiate better rates it is a debatable issue whether the premium for ames should be evaluated against exams requested by the employer or the employee v effect of reforms on frequency of specialty exams a decline in the frequency of reports the wcirb annual reports on the reforms have indicated a decline in the number of reports requested per claim the nature and causes of this decline have not been clear here we use claims that have been resolved within 40 months and 28 months after the beginning of the accident year to further analyze this trend the choice to base this comparison on resolved claims was done to avoid the possibility that reforms sped up or slowed down the timing of exams on claims for example suppose the number of exams stayed the same but they occurred earlier in the life of a claim if we valued all claims at similar points in time it would appear that the number of exams was increasing here we avoid that problem by only looking at claims that have been resolved on closed claims we know the number of tests that will ever occur 16we have also split the claims into major and minor injuries for the 1993 claims we do not have second level case report data on major and minor injuries therefore it is necessary to either estimate the distribution of injuries and apply weights to the different types of cases or to treat major and minor injuries separately we employ both approaches in this report when these data are further disaggregated it is clear that the decline in the number of exams is being driven primarily by the improvement on the represented claims chart 4 and chart 5 highlight the data broken out by representedunrepresented and majorminor injuries regardless of whether the injury is major or minor the represented cases in this period have had more exams than the unrepresented however this gap is narrowing while the frequency of exams on unrepresented claims has changed little the change on represented cases has been substantial chart 4 average number of specialty exams at 40 months after beginnig of accident year resolved claimschart 5 average number of specialty exams at 28 months from beginnis of accident yearb impact of claim resolution mechanisms on frequency of medicallegal reports the introduction of mandatory settlement conferences msc was meant to reduce the need for hearings and decisions and to speed the resolution of cases have the new resolution mechanisms accomplished these goals the answer from the wcirb survey data is no have these resolution methods had unintended impacts on the frequency of medicallegal reports the answer is a qualified maybe chart 6 chart 7 and chart 8 look at the resolution of cases at 40 months from the beginning of the accident year there has been no significant change in the rate at which cases close except for the decline between 1989 and 1990 the percent of cases closing within 28 months has shown no change through 1992 this issue is discussed in more detail in section iie time to resolution moreover the demands on the dwcwcab for claim resolution have increased possibly as a result of the new resolution methods instead of reaching voluntary settlements that do not involve active participation by the dwcwcab parties are increasingly using one or more dispute resolution methods for this analysis we have redefined the variables in the following manner voluntary settlements here called true voluntary include all cases where a compromise and release agreement cr a stipulated settlement or voluntary payment is indicated as the method of resolution question 2 and the only dispute mechanisms listed are settled w attorney or none of the above question 8 judicial settlements include all cases where the dispute resolution method was findings and award take nothing or dismissal these cases were considered the most expensive and burdensome for the states resources 17other settlements are those using the several dispute resolution mechanisms but not resulting in a formal decision the survey does not reveal whether a given mechanism was used more than once so the true burden on the wcab resources is obscured we see a decline in the percentage of cases where a voluntary agreement was reached without intervention by the dwcwcab and an increase in the percent of cases where the dwc has been involved this is true for both major and minor injuries each of these subgroups exhibits the same pattern of little or no change in the rate of judicial settlements and a movement of otherwise voluntary settlements into the use of dispute mechanisms as will be discussed in more detail in section iie this has not been associated with a more rapid settlement of cases consequently costs expended by the dwc are not being balanced by quicker resolution for the parties apparently claims that would otherwise have settled voluntarily are now using at least one dispute resolution mechanism this may be simply a form of brinkmanship where parties who would never have proceeded to a formal hearing have an intermediate option that they may feel enhances negotiation or it may simply be that given an option requiring a low threshold of preparation and less finality they choose to move forward a step chart 6 percent of claims resolved within 40 monthschar 7 resolution major pd claims resolved within 40 monthschart 8 resolution minor pd claims resolved within 40 monthsc impact on

resolution mechanisms may be attenuating some of the savings to the system as the following tables and chart 9 show claims in the other category require 1540 more tests to resolve this gap appears to have widened even as claims have apparently moved from the voluntary processes into dispute resolution we cannot conclude that this migration of claims between the two categories leads to additional tests additional study would be required to determine this impact several explanations are possible for example informal dispute mechanisms encourage parties to get additional tests to strengthen their case before a third party the cases migrating from voluntary to other categories are the ones with the most tests subgroups within either category that are not migrating are driving the difference chart 9 medicallegal reports resolved cases at 40 monthsvi psychiatric claims a predicted impact of legislative changes the legislative changes affecting psychiatric claims were expected to reduce the frequency of psychiatric evaluations by restricting the range of possible injuries considered compensable for the psychiatric component the reforms imposed evidentiary rules requiring a preponderance of evidence they also increased in several steps the degree to which the cause of the injury had to be related to employment assuming that the proportion of psychiatric injuries remained constant relative to other injuries in the compensation system these restrictions should eliminate a number of these injuries from compensability or at least the psychiatric component because they fail to meet the threshold conditions for compensability however it could be argued that higher standards of proof lead to the need for more evaluations to establish whether the threshold conditions have been exceeded the period from 19901991 has anecdotally been considered a period when numerous stress claims with little legitimacy were put forward b impact much of the improvement in the average number and the average cost of medicallegal exams per claim is a result of reductions in the number of psychiatric claims as shown in chart 10 from a high for the 1991 accident year to the 1993 accident year the total cost of psychiatric exams dropped by 876 million a savings of approximately 93 percent on the cost of psychiatric related medicallegal exams this represents 28 percent of the overall reduction in all medicallegal costs between the 1991 and 1993 accident years chart 10 total cost psychiatric examsbetween 1991 and 1993 over a third 36 of the reduction in the average number of medicallegal exams per ppd claim is a result of a drop of 87 percent in the average number of psychiatric exams per ppd claim the decline in the total cost of psychiatric exams is due to both a drop in the number of psychiatric claims and a decline in the costexam as shown in chart 11 the number of psychiatric claims ppd claims with at least one psychiatric medicallegal exam has declined by 93 percent between accident year 1991 and 1993 it should be noted that for injuries occurring after 1194 a single physician or single physician for each side evaluates all open issues consequently for 1994 and later injuries the survey may no longer allow us to determine cases with a psychiatric component this will often be obscured when the evaluating physician chosen is from another specialty chart 11 number of ppd claims with at least one psychiatric exampart of this decline in number of psychiatric exams is driven by the overall decline in all types of ppd claims in addition as table 5 indicates the decline is driven by factors specific to psychiatric claims that reduced the portion of ppd claims that have a psychiatric component antifraud efforts crackdowns on mills and similar efforts may be the most important factors in the declining frequency of psychiatric claims limits on posttermination stress claims introduced in 1991 and improvements in the california economy that reduced mass layoffs may have also played a role the number of psychiatric exams per claim peaked in the period from 1990 through the first half of 1991 the decline in psychiatric exams per claim began in mid1991 and accelerated in 1992 legislation requiring that work be the predominant cause of a psychiatric complaint may also play a role in the decline in psychiatric claims in late 1993 and 1994 unlike ppd claims in general the decline in total medicallegal costs on psychiatric claims is not due to a reduction in the average number of psychiatric exams per psychiatric claim although it is early to say with certainty and 1993 and 1994 samples are small indications are that the average number of psychiatric exams on psychiatric claims has not declined sufficiently to show a clear improvement the number of psychiatric exams per psychiatric claim when valued at 16 months after the beginning of the accident year has held steady at an average of approximately 1415 exams on each claim at 28 months 1993 psychiatric claims had more psychiatric exams on average than psychiatric claims in the preceding years it is interesting to note that the rise in the proportion of all claims with psychiatric exams from 198991 was accompanied by only a small rise in the frequency of requests by workers chart 12 shows the distribution of exams by the source of request in each of four periods for this purpose claims were evaluated at 16 months after the accident date note the 1993 sample is smaller and is subject to considerable variation with only small changes in the number of exams requests by employers for psychiatric exams rose more rapidly after 1989 than requests by workers moreover they declined less steeply after the reforms that went into effect in mid1991 this is also true of claims in the 1993 sample consequently as indicated in chart 12 employers are replacing workers as the predominate source of request for these exams chart 12 psychiatric exams by source of requestvii effects on time to case resolution the impact of reforms upon the time to case resolution has not been significant based upon the hazard analysis detailed below controlling for injury severity the number and type of specialty exams and presence of employee legal representation we do not find statistically significant improvements in time to case resolution in the 1990s indeed the only statistical difference attributable to year that we find is that cases following 1989 appear to be resolved more slowly than cases in the 1989 injury year the rest of our analysis seems to follow conventional wisdom well injury severity is associated with longer resolution times as is the presence of an employee legal representativea proxy for dispute over the initial evaluatory findings the presence of one or more orthopedic exams was associated with more rapid time to case resolution as with all regression models the results must be submitted with a set of caveats the data set involved in this analysis did not have many explanatory variables as a result it was not possible to control for individual worker traits the nature of the injury etc nor was it possible to try a variety of different model forms to get a better idea of fit and robustness this analysis as such represents the application of standard and suitable tools upon a very limited dataset before looking at how the reforms have changed the rate of case resolution some general discussion is needed whether or not a case is resolved within a given time period is a function of a number of factors including degree and type of injury amount of dispute between workers employers and the dwc the effect of the 1989 reforms the best measures we have of the degree of injury are the permanent disability rating and the awards for total medical and incurred indemnity a second set of measures exists which give at least a hint at the type of injury these measures consist of reports of specialty medical examinations specialty medical exams are performed by approved medical doctors at the request of either workers insurers or the dwc and are coded as either orthopedic neurological internal psychiatric or all other we have coded a variable for each of these specialty types which counts the number of appointments of each specialty type reported for each case a greater number of specialty exams should be similarly negatively associated with resolution time the amount of dispute between parties in any given case is also partly measured through the number of specialty exams typically when there is dispute over the degree of injury or the level of disability both sides in the case will request their own set of specialty exams this leads to an interesting pattern of a worker requested exam followed by an employer exam followed by a worker exam in addition to the number of specialty exams a second measure exists to identify the level of case dispute in cases where there is greater degree of dispute legal costs are likely to be higher these costs are present in the dataset the amount spent on legal services by employers seems a good indicator of case friction we would expect employer legal costs to be negatively associated with resolution odds we have also included a variable indicating the presence of worker legal representation based on this discussion our basic model is a cox regression of the following form results for this model are presented in the attached technical appendix as well as a discussion of diagnostics and alternate forms that were calculated based on the above model the following curves show the percent of cases not resolved by the number of months since the accident date by the accident year of the case this type of curve is called a survival function 18chart 13 survival functionas the above chart shows 1989 cases all other things being equal have a lower survival rate at any given month than either of the three following target years this implies that 1989 cases were resolved faster all other things being equal the results presented in the appendix also indicate that while there is not a statistically significant difference between the 1991 1992 and 1993 time to resolution coefficients there is a significant difference between 1989 and the following years this suggests that whatever changes did occur in time to case resolution in the dwc system happened between 1989 and 1990 rather than later viii sampling and survey issues a issues the data made available by the wcirb is a sample of 3500 cases opened in each year these cases are sampled so that 1500 are of workers estimated in the unit statistical reports to have major injuries disability equal to or greater than 25 percent and the remaining 2000 are drawn from the population of minor disability cases disability  25 percent these claims are sampled in three panels the first at 40 months the second at 52 months and the third at 64 months after the beginning of the accident year wcirb files present several large difficulties for use in analysis specifically during the analysis of the wcirb data three major problems emerged problem 1 sampling methods problem 2 few attribute variables problem 3 the infamous culling problem the permanent disability claims survey was designed following the 1989 reform legislation the design was well thought out but should be updated to satisfy issues arising from the recent legislative reforms several issues need to be addressed by adding two new sources of requests the fee schedule code 101104 for reports a geographic variable current wcab office b sampling as part of its administrative function the wcirb collects case information through the unit statistical report usr on insurance policy written with each employer in order to get a sample of workers injured in an accident year for example 1989 the wcirb selects policies incepted between 71 of the prior year 7188 and 630 of the accident year 63089 they then sample claims on these policies with dates of injury in the target year 1989 the problem with this sampling scheme is that it is not a random sample of claims and therefore provides a distorted picture of seasonal rates of injury chart 14 simplified example of wcirb samplingfor example suppose for the moment that both injury occurrence and firm policy inception dates are uniformly distributed this would give us a distribution of policies and injuries like that shown in chart 14 the shaded lines indicate policies surveyed and the numbers 1s above each line represent an injury the unshaded lines show policies and injuries that would be excluded as the chart shows even in such a simple example this sampling method causes oversampling of cases incepted in summer months and under sampling of injuries in winter months because of the wcirb sampling design it will appear that rates of injury are at a maximum in the summer and decline in the winter furthermore even if in the real but presently unknown state of the world accident rates actually do vary between seasons it will be difficult to identify the actual pattern of injuries as the plot of accident dates from the survey below shows it appears accident rates rise in the summer and fall in the winter chart 15 accident date distribution pd survey datahow much of this pattern is real and how much of this is due to the sampling method no data is currently available to show the distribution of dates of injury for all injuries reported as permanent disability claims on the second level individual case reports however we have used data from the dwc rehabilitation unit ru online system this system reports the date of injury of all claims in the vocational rehabilitation system approximately 160000 for 198992 for this comparison the pd survey data and the ru data are presented as the percent of claims for each year with dates of injury in each month this figure is included below while the two data sets should not match exactly if the wcirb data were correctly sampled from the same population as the rehabilitation claims the graphs should generally follow one another with deviations that show no consistent pattern the injuries follow a cyclical pattern with regular dips in november and december and not much variation the rest of the year however as predicted in our earlier analysis the deviation of the wcirb sample from the expected distribution follow a consistent and repeating pattern the wcirb sample shows large underrepresentation of injuries in the earliest and latest months of the year with large overrepresentation of injuries occurring in the middle of the year does this matter there are several reasons to think that the nature and severity of injuries varies by month some industries are seasonal eg agriculture these industries can be associated with more or less severe injuries with injuries of a particular type and with greater or lesser degrees of litigation also if policies incept in different industries at different times of year under or over sampling of particular industries is increased the average size of firms underlying the policies also varies by month of policy inception 19 we expect the medicallegal experience of big and small firms to differ finally some important industries are also cyclical in other words follow the business cycle eg construction and are strongly correlated with more serious injuries over or under sampling could capture different proportions of particular claims from year to year we ran several tests to compare the data between months of the year these tests disproved the hypothesis that there was no difference between months this was true for pd level incurred indemnity and time to resolution the impact of this sampling bias is at present unclear however the results from this survey must be viewed with some skepticism until corrections can be made until these corrections are made there are two primary ways in which faulty sampling will impact the results in the case of the hazard modeling the sample bias against winter months yields a distribution of start dates which may not be independent of censoring times if this indeed turns out to be the case analysis becomes a much more complicated matter requiring the use of a timedependent censoring process the second impact this type of sampling could have is to overemphasize seasonal differences in injury characteristics this would have the effect of biasing downward regression estimates for the impact of reforms on the type of resolution method solutions to sampling issues ultimately this problem can be fixed by using weights to adjust for the relative oversampling based on month of injury just as they are used in the existing analysis to correct for the intentional oversampling of severely injured workers the real difficulty lies not in the nature of the fix but rather in the difficulty in obtaining data on the actual temporal distribution of cases c few attribute variables the second major problem with this dataset is that it has not been integrated with other available data for example from individual case reports as a result the number of variables that can be used to help define traits about individual workers as well as the ability to link other external sources of information into the file are extremely limited the broad effect of this problem will be low model explanatory power more specifically however the limitations in the data present a challenge in being able to devise indicators related to the needs of the analysis this is notably the case with measures of injury accurate measures of the degree of injury are essential for the hazard model presented in this paper in this case however degree of injury does not mean exactly what it does in common usage rather than indicating a particular medical condition in terms of the dwcs activities the severity of an injury really means the social cost this cost depends upon a wide number of factors including the nature of the injury the degree to which the injury can be repaired the amount of time the injury will take to heal and the degree to which the worker can be employed in hisher present occupation in a perfect world therefore the determination of injury severity would be based upon a wide array of information about the worker and the exact nature of the case unfortunately the amount of information available with which to measure the severity of injury is limited to three variables each of these variables tells an incomplete story about the nature of the injury the first measure is the estimated percent of permanent disability percent disability reflects a combined estimation by the dwc of the degree to which an injury can be repaired and the degree to which the worker will be employable in the open labor market according to the dwcs guidelines the level of permanent disability is determined by a relatively fixed set of rules raters use the workers age occupation and impairment as determined by a specialist to assign an estimated percent using tables in the california schedule for rating permanent disability in practice however the real practice of determining the degree of impairment also involves a fair amount of negotiation between the department the injured worker and the employer it is also common for estimates of disability to be adjusted following the closure of a case so that the final indemnity and medical schedule is consistent with the disability estimate as a result the wcirb itself does not regard the rating as being very accurate and commonly relies upon only a bivariate statistic to indicate major or minor impairment table 10 lists several threshold levels of injury for back and lower extremities and their associated disability ratings table 10 disability work capacity guidelinesdisability ranking10 disability precluding very heavy lifting loss of 14 of preinjury capacity for lifting15

walking position minimum demand for physical effort60 limited to semisedentary work 12 time standing and 12 time seated with minimum physical effort70 limited to sedentary work predominantly in sitting position despite this pessimistic appraisal given the subjective nature of the adjustment process about the figure determined by the schedule the large sample size and no prior belief that permanent disability is systematically adjusted differently for cases of a particular type the measure contains more information than does the bivariate majorminor classification once employment trends in the state were controlled for the distribution of permanent disability findings do not change by year this indicates that while the measure is not perfect it has at least been applied in a stable way over the period 19891992 the following chart shows the distribution of permanent disability determinations chart 16 distribution of pd ratingsbesides percent of disability the dataset also contains information on two other measures of injury severity total incurred indemnity and total incurred medical costs both of these measures give the amount of money paid to date and placed aside by the insurance companies for future indemnity or medical costs these figures are determined by the injury the percent of disability and negotiations either arbitration legal or voluntary between the dwc the worker and the employers insurer taken together both of these measures have the advantage with respect to percent of disability of accurately reflecting the severity of an injury in terms of the costs involved in returning the worker to the workplace unlike percent of disability however the measures of total incurred costs do not fully reflect the severity of the injury in terms of the workers costs nor do they provide a good picture by themselves of the impact of the injury upon the workers ability to seek future employment solutions to attribute problem given that each of these three measures captures a portion of the information on injury severity rather than choosing one as being the most reliable this analysis relies on a constructed measure using information from all three measures we have constructed a factor score for injury severity this is not as ideal a solution as obtaining more data however this tool has the advantage of combining all available information about the case a second solution to increasing the attributes in the data set is to link the pd survey data to the unit statistical report usr the usr data has numerous additional elements on each claim that could increase the usefulness of this dataset this solution would require an effort by the wcirb to build a more useful dataset for interested evaluators by merging data from both sources this requires some determination of which elements should be combined from each source d culling problem the third and final problem with the wcirb data is socalled infamous culling problem this problem stems directly from the different priorities placed on data use by administrative needs versus analysis functions as the structure of data collection was designed primarily for administrative use an emphasis was placed upon being able to present data in the system rather than on being able to do anything with the data in the first panel of the survey sample cases were selected and data on these cases was collected illegible forms incomplete entries nonresponses or otherwise erroneous data was left blank at each subsequent panel however all erroneous entries were corrected by bringing the appropriate data forward from past panels solution following process of data checking this problem has now been fixed accordingly this analysis is able to present results based on the latest panel data available for each year ix survey redesign we are proposing a slight redesign for the pd survey to deal with several issues indicated above a source of request two new sources of request are proposed for the table in question 3 the legislative reforms created and strengthened the importance of the qme panels for unrepresented workers the value of these changes is not clear since the current survey does not distinguish qmes from other sources of request while a qme from a panel acts somewhat like an ame they are probably included under w for worker also the 1993 reforms increased the importance of the treating physician tp in the medicallegal process in part this was done by increasing the evidentiary force of the tp findings when one side obtains an alternate report by a qme this was meant to reduce both the cost and frequency of reports this policy cannot be evaluated using the current survey again the tp is a hybrid acting somewhat like an ame however a report by the tp could be reported either under employer or worker the additions of two codes for reports by treating physicians and by qmes from a panel would improve the value of the survey greatly these codes could be the medicallegal fee schedule codes for primary treating physician 92 and qme on uncontested claims 95 b fee schedule billing code the addition of a column for the code under which the report was billed would improve our information under prior law specialty and date of service determined the applicable rebuttable maximum in effect under the current law the codes ml101 to ml104 in combination with the date will be necessary to evaluate reports after 8393 against the amounts presumed reasonable c geographic variable a geographic variable has been added at the top of the survey this should be the current 20 zip code of the worker a three digit zip code is sufficient often there are issues raised about northern v southern california or los angeles against the rest of the state most often la and southern california are considered as having high and costly litigation rates and medicallegal report costs rural and urban is another distinction in analysis that is often requested the current survey does not allow any analysis of the these data based on a geographic variable d wcab office indicator several people have proposed the addition of a variable for the wcab office if any where the case resides the contention is that the wcab office can have more to do with the dispute mechanisms used and time to resolution of cases than any other variable we have included a copy of a redesigned survey and new instruction sheet in appendix 2 appendix 1 hazard analysis of time to resolution the impact of reforms upon the time to case resolution is not clear based upon the hazard analysis detailed below controlling for injury severity the number and type of specialty exams and presence of employee legal representation we do not find a statistically significant difference for time to case resolution between pre and post1991 indeed the only statistically difference attributable to year that we find is that cases following 1989 appear to be resolved more slowly than cases in the 1989 injury year the rest of our analysis seems to follow conventional wisdom well injury severity as measured by increased indemnity awards is associated with longer resolution times as is the presence of cost for employer legal representation the presence of one or more orthopedic exams was associated with more rapid time to case resolution the presence of an employee legal representative was associated with faster time to case resolutionpresumably because representatives were able to maneuver their clients through the system more quickly as with all regression models the results must be submitted with a set of caveats the data set involved in this analysis did not have many possible explanatory variables as a result it was not possible to control for individual worker traits the nature of the injury etc nor was it possible to try a variety of different model forms to get a better idea of fit and robustness this analysis as such represents the application of standard and suitable tools upon a very limiting dataset for this analysis we will look at cases with full panels accident years 1989 1990 1991 and 1992 before looking at how the reforms have changed the rate of case resolution some general discussion is needed whether or not a case is resolved within a given time period is a function of a number of factors including degree and type of injury amount of dispute between workers employers and the dwc the effect of the 1989 reforms the best measures we have of the degree of injury is the permanent disability rating and the awards for total medical and

performed by approved medical doctors at the request of either workers insurers or the dwc and are coded as either orthopedic neurological internal psychiatric or all other we have coded a variable

also partly measured through the number of specialty exams typically when there is dispute over the degree of injury or the level of disability both sides in the case will request their own set of

exists to identify the level of case dispute in cases where there is greater degree of dispute employer legal costs are likely to be higher these costs are present in the dataset accordingly the amount spent on legal services by employers seems a good indicator of case friction we have also included a variable indicating the presence of worker legal representation the presence of an attorney does not indicate the a settlement through the judiciarythe attorney may be called in by the worker to assist in arbitration or even a voluntary settlement we would expect employer legal costs to be negatively associated with likelihood of resolution in any time period based on this discussion our basic model is a cox regression of the following form after weighting data to account for the

associated with cases which are resolved slower than the base rate while positive estimates are resolved faster both total incurred medical and total incurred indemnity indicators move in the right directionwith larger awards being associated with more slowly resolved cases although the coefficient on permanent disability rating is positive this is because determinations both at the low and high end of this measure are likely to be made quickly as this measure varies only between 1 and 100 the magnitude of its impact on case time to resolution is smalland indeed composite scores for injury severity constructed using all three measures show longer times to resolution being associated with more severe injuries employer spending on legal representation also is associated with cases that take longer to resolve by contrast employee legal representation is associated with somewhat faster case resolution as all of the coefficient estimates raised to base e are close to one a one percent change in the explanatory variable affects resolution time by one percent for the most part the number of specialized exams also followed the general patternat least for the significant coefficients because weights must be integers for cox regressions the significance levels listed by the computer are incorrect and have not been included 21 instead we have calculated the number of corrected standard units away from zero for each coefficient z score none of the negative coefficients for specialist exams are significant at the 95 level in this first regression we chose not to include variables for year but instead to stratify the sample by year of injury this makes the assumption that the process is a proportional hazard model where only the baseline term s t varies by time the following graph plots the cumulative survival functions plotted at the mean of the covariates obtained by this model 22figure a1 survival function at mean of covariateswhile the coefficients on the exogenous variables followed prior predictions the relationship between baseline survival functions do not rather than seeing an improvement in time to case resolutionholding our exogenous factors

were performed multicolinearity is not an issue with this data as exogenous variables are very weakly related point estimates were robust over a range of different forms one of which will be discussed below and given the limitations of the data little more can be done to deal with misspecification although observations were made at identical times over the lifespan of each panel observation start times were not uniform cases could start anytime within the first year and despite the sampling problems there is no prior reason to believe that censoring times are not independent of event occurrence in order to test this last assumption sensitivity of the coefficient estimates to extreme deviations from censoring independence was performed 23 running the regression twice first with all cases indicated as resolved and then with all cases indicated as being censored at 64 months regardless of resolution yielded very similar estimates accordingly there is no reason to believe the independence assumption is violated similarly logminuslog survival plots did not reveal any obvious faults in the assumption of proportional hazards between years accordingly the use of timedependent covariates does not appear necessary figure a3 lml function at mean of covariatesin order to statistically test the difference in resolution between years the above model was modified rather than

from the prior model given that the sample sizes and standard errors are almost identical for each year coefficient an eyeball anova seems to show that the three coefficients are not significantly different from each other this suggests that whatever changes as did occur in the dwc system happened between 1989 and 1990 1 by 40 months after the beginning of the accident year approximately 97 percent of all medicallegal exams have been conducted 2 data courtesy of larry law workers compensation insurance rating bureau 3 this may overestimate the number of examsclaim especially for the 1994 accident year legislation in effect for injuries on or after 1194 required comprehensive medicallegal evaluations to deal with all open issues limiting this to a single exam rather than a single exam by each appropriate specialty this would tend to reduce the number of exams performed later in claims relative to earlier accident years 4 some experts contend that the new fee schedule will tend to eliminate exams billed below the fee schedule levels increasing costs two reasons are proposed to support this expectation 1 charges at the fee schedule amounts are considered prima facie evidence of reasonableness as opposed to the old standard of rebuttable presumed reasonable making it easier to defend any fee at the fee schedule level 2 some experts have suggested that the statute could be interpreted to require that doctors be paid at the fee schedule level and not below 5 the impact of these alternative resolution methods has been inconsistent while over a third of cases in the sample had had a mandatory settlement conference scheduled arbitration voluntary or mandatory occurred in less than 1 percent of claims 6 see pacific law journal vol 215 756 also le vesque v workmens

circumvented and are unlikely to be a reason for the decline in psychiatric claims 10 see pacific law journal vol 21 april 1990 11 a discussion of the consequences of this sampling scheme is presented in section viii 12 the survey had a response rate that differed across the strata the weighting of the survey data for this analysis takes into account the differential response rates 13 the distribution between major and minor in the original samples for 1993 and 1994 was unavailable from the wcirb at the time of our analysis the distribution drawn from the responses is as follows major minor1993 113 2141994 99 216 14 see lc sec 53076 15 the first exam also accounts for approximately 35 of all reports done 16 one caveat the decline in the frequency of exams on closed cases even when measured at similar points in time from accident could be the result of changes in legislation on the mix of early closing claims for example the reforms could have worked to encourage the early resolution of longterm low exam frequency claims this however seems an unlikely explanation 17 note this same analysis could be run with formal hearing moved from the other category to the judicial category this would capture cases where the wcab was required to hold formal hearings but 1 the issues heard did not resolve the case andor 2 a formal hearing was held but before a decision was reached on case resolution a settlement between parties was reached 18 the chart was drawn based on the survival function following from cases with the mean value for each of the factors in the model and is useful for comparison purposes across years the actual survival curve faced by any particular case will depend upon the exact case characteristics 19 based on wcirb data on california workers compensation experience by policy month 1991 policy year second reports 1992 policy year 1st reports 20 the current zip code has several advantages over the zip code at the time of injury 1 the current zip code is more likely to be available from claims administrators who need to contact the worker and may overwrite the old address in the database if the worker moves 2 the current zip code is useful for identifying the likely wcab offices where the case is being handled 21 the basic problem here is that because noninteger weights cannot be used new weights must be devised by multiplying the old weights by in this case 100 the se is related to sample size by the square root of n and therefore the computer given se must be multiplied by 10 22 the cumulative survival function is the proportion of cases surviving at a particular moment 23 the test comes from allison event history analysis 1984
