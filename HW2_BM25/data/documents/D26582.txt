by aimee on february 27 2010 • 48 comments spotlight ingredient leeks b y far the most underestimated of all winter vegetables is the leek they usually get lost in the respectable yet predictable vichyssoise but this cousin of the onion is capable of so much more from humble beginnings to show stoppers once dubbed “poorman’s asparagus” the leek needs only some slow braising or gentle grilling to bring out its sweet yet complex flavor the leek should not be considered merely an addin because it can stand up very well on its own in a variety of side dishes i once served a simple roasted baby leek gratin as a side dish at thanksgiving and it nearly stole the showthe subtle onion flavor of the leek lends itself well to pairing with fish and seafood and if you aren’t convinced try my leekstuffed salmon fillet recipe at the bottom of the post serve it warm or cold with a sprinkling of chopped fresh dill and you’ve got a dish worthy of a holiday buffet now that prices for imported vegetables are sky high not to mention out of season why not branch out and try a few recipes with leeks during these cold winter months it’s time the leek went from ignored to explored getting started buying look for leeks with bright green leaves and a firm unblemished long white stalk small and large leeks are both sublime the only difference is the cooking time storing like most vegetables it is best to buy leeks only as needed however if you need to store them for a few days keep them in the crisper drawer of the fridge cleaning leeks can be quite sandy so careful washing is important here’s how to properly clean a whole leek start by removing the outer layer of white unless it is very fresh or from your own garden trim the base with a sharp paring knife to remove all the roots make an incision in the middle of the white stalk and cut toward the green tips severing the leek in two but with the bottom still intact wash well under cold running water pulling the leaves apart to rinse well between them drain green tips down in a colander for a few minutes if the recipe calls for chopped leeks it is best to chop them and then wash under cold running water allow to drain well before using recipes roasting or braising brings out the best flavors in leeks and simple grilling is a great option as well here are a few of my favorite recipes featuring the leek baked
