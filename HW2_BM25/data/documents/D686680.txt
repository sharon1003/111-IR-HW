memphis police department for questioning he was being questioned because he was a known friend of damien echols who was a suspect in the murders with additional written permission from his father he was read his miranda rights and given a polygraph exam which he reportedly failed the documentaries imply that jessie was interrogated for 12 hours before confessing that is a lie jessie arrived at that police station at 1000am and confessed at 220pm only 2 12 hours of that time was spent in actual interrogationhttpwm3truthcomjessiemisskelleysconfessionjune31993httpcallahanmysitecomwm3imgjmtimeloghtmlhttpcallahanmysitecomwm3jmirhtml june 7 1993 jessies own family members believed he could have

that he damien and jason committed the murders further he told stidham that he was drunk on evan williams whiskey during the murders and the broken bottle could be found where he threw it on the ground under a bridge in west memphis on his way home from the crime scene stidham told prosecutors he would believe his clients confession if he could find that bottle so stidham wmpd inspector gary gitchell and the prosecutors drove to west memphis to look for it they found a broken evan williams bottle in the exact area that stidham indicated jessie said it would be according to prosecutor john fogleman stidham directed the group to search the i40 underpass nearest to walmart near the current sight of kroger and the men found the broken bottle in that location further corroborating this story is the fact that jessie mentioned in this 2894 confession that vicki hutcheson was the one who bought him evan williams whiskey on the day of the murders when the attorneys called hutcheson she confirmed that she did indeed buy jessie a bottle of evan williams on the day of the

anywayhttpcallahanmysitecomwm3jmfebhtml october 24 1994 a cell mate of jessie’s named michael johnson wrote to prosecutor brent davis begging him to keep jessie behind bars he said jessie told him details of the crime he described jessie as a “cold morbid person” johnson got all the facts correct except one he told davis that the wm3 left a woman’s “nightgown” at the scene no nightgown was found at the scene however fibers consistent with jason baldwin’s mother’s bathrobe were found on one of the victims maybe jessie called the bathrobe a “nightgown” while mentioning it was a piece of evidence linking the wm3 to the crime perhaps johnson just got this fact a bit mixed up in his retelling of jessie’s morbid tale you can read johnson’s letter at the following linkhttpcallahanmysitecomwm3micjohtml recent years for years rumors have circulated around arkansas that jessie continued to confess to his counselors in prison so far none of those counselors have spoken publicly but other associates of jessie have spoken about his more recent confessions many years before the wm3 were released a wm3 supporter who posted on the wm3 discussion boards as true romance befriended jessie misskelley her real name may have been lindsey she wrote and received letters to jessie talked to him on the phone and also visited him in prison she immediately ceased believing in the threes innocence after having a conversation with jessie in prison where she asked him directly if he had been involved in the murders according to her the answer he gave caused her to stop all contact and become a “non” a non believer in wm3 innocence we dont know what jessie told her she has never disclosed that information but it clearly wasnt good below is an excerpt from a post she made on a wm3 discussion board the original post cannot be found and the exact date of the post is unknown… it was possibly around 2006 the post still exists because it was copied to other wm3 discussion groups for clarification when she refers to “the kgb” that is a knickname for wm3org founders kathy bakken grove pashley and burk sauls here is what “true romance” had to say“if i was going to let this case consume my life i felt like i needed to research things more aggressively and ask jessie some point blank questions i never had i felt like it was the only fair thing to do if im risking my peace of mind and throwing myself 110 into this then im going to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the person im putting my good name on the line for is being honest and is innocent after all my research and questions i found out things were much different than i originally thought its also different when you ask someone a point blank question and you dont get the answer you were expecting and dont reply to this and tell me to cite this and provide that because i did that little dance with supporters for long enough and i dont care whether anyone agrees with me the information i found is readily available to anyone who wants to look at it but any supporter still stuck in that conspiracy mentality is only going to twist it i was lied to over and over by supporters the kgb and consistently withheld information on that side once i became a non i was offered a wealth of information never once misled and never once forced to believe the same as anyone else i never got that when i was a supporter so do i believe the three are guilty yes and if any supporter wants to pull this over to the other board or make fun of me or my lifestyle my physical appearance or social class which theyve done in the past feel free i got two things out of this situation that youll never have and that is an education and the truth ” you can read the entire post from true romance about her

the documentaries all fail to mention that damien echols had an extensive mental health record more than 500 pages long at the time of the murders in 1992 he was sent to psychiatric hospitals twice by court order and once by his own parents his parents were concerned about his involvement in what they described as witchcraft and devil worship and wanted him out of their home in september 1992 damiens parents told his mental health physician they were frightened of him and what he can do not only to them but to other children that reside in the home httpcallahanmysitecomimages5001150jpg the mental health documents are public record because damien’s attorneys presented them as evidence in the sentencing phase of his trial it was a lastditch effort by echols’ attorneys to convince the jury he was mentally ill and possibly spare him from the death penalty despite their jawdropping revelations about echols’ mental health at the time of the murders these records are never mentioned in any of the documentaries the documents often called exhibit 500 or e500 reveal that echols described himself as a homicidal suicidal schizophrenic manic depressive sociopath the handwriting on this

redneck cops in west memphis because he was interested in wicca listened to metallica and wore black no was he a suspect because police officers in west memphis knew he was a mentally ill psychopath capable of murder yes fact damien echols had a welldocumented taste for blood you can find detailed documentation about damiens taste for blood in this excellent article by wm3 case researcher fred j walsh damien echols blood sucking a fairly chronological guide to documented accounts of his blood suckingdrinkinglicking 1 charter hospital of little rock june 1992 “trying to suck blood off peers who have scratched themselves” e500 p265 2 craighead county juvenile detention center september 1992 a charter hospital psychological assessment written on september 10 described his return to juvie transferred to crittenden one of the kids at the detention hall cut his wrists damien grabbed his arm and began to the suck the blood smeared it over his body and said he’s a devil worshipping vampire says he’s not a vampire but a witch he is in isolation and suicide watch joyce cureton director of the craighead county juvenile detention center reported on the incident approx three hours after damien arrived he was sitting in rec area with several other residents one of the boys had scraped his arm a little and it was bleeding some without warning damien grabbed the arm that was bleeding and began to suck the blood from it the boys all stated he had been saying he had not taken his medication the night before and he was about to go off on them damien was asked why he did this and he stated i don’t know in a psychological evaluation dated 91592 echols offered his own account of the incident while at the detention center he reportedly grabbed a peer and began “sucking blood from the peer’s neck” according to damien he relates that the peer was aware that he was going to do this staff reports that damien was not remorseful for his behavior damien indicated that he sucked blood in order to get into a gang he denies that it was any type of ritual … damien laughed when he was called “a blood sucking vampire” he relates he does not know why people think this he was placed in isolation in the detention center until he could be admitted to charter hospital the other peers were afraid of him damien denies that he rubbed the blood all over his face … he denied intent to harm himself or others at the time of the exam he did admit to sucking blood out of the peer’s neck he related that the peer had hurt his neck and he subsequently sucked the blood while echols laughed off vampire label he allegedly gave himself he also went out of his way to convince one social worker that he actually believed himself a vampire damien echols  seemed to withhold no information and readily answered questions concerning his religious beliefs and the fact that he believes that he is a vampire and does worship the devil it was the social worker’s opinion that damien was not disclosing information for the purposes of shock that he was simply disclosing what he currently is believing his behaviors could best be described as odd and bizzare damien smiled at inappropriate times he cut his eyes back and forth as if he was responding to external stimulation he seemed to be giggling at something that he was saying or a private joke that was unknown to this social worker pretty fantastical stuff right and yet this professed belief in blooddrinking was further corroborated a few months later 3 counseling sessions and social security application januaryfebruary 1993 on january 25 sherry dockins filed a longer “individual progress note” focus of today’s session is spent talking with damien about his feelings of death he brought with him to session a poem that he had written during the past week the theme of this poem centered around death and power damien explained that he obtains his power by drinking blood of others he typically drinks the blood of a sexual partner or of a ruling partner this is achieved by biting or cutting he states “it makes me feel like a god” damien describes drinking blood as giving him more power and strength he remembers doing this as far back as age 10 he does not remember where he learned to do this 4 tiffany allen witnesses a fight between jason baldwin and another kid 19921993 report from 1093ridge what occurred during

about moon water and magick for what its worth the murders took place during a full moon and magick is a term frequently used by aleister crowley were the murders a true satanic ritual no did damiens interest in the occult coupled with his mental illness play a role probably so was the city of west memphis and later the jury in a state of satanic panic no that is a myth created by the paradise lost documentary makers because it made a good story the trials were moved out of west memphis nearly one hour away to jonesboro echols and baldwin and corning misskelley in order to give the defendants a better shot at seating fair unbiased juries members of those juries were far removed from any alleged satanic panic in west memphis satanic panic only existed in the minds of some documentary makers who were attempting to make a buck by sensationalizing their movie at the expense of justice for three dead little boyshttptwittercomdamienechols fact  there is evidence the wm3 committed the murders the documentaries leave out the considerable physical and circumstantial evidence presented at the trials some recent mainstream media reports go so far as to say no evidence was found nothing could be farther from the truth the murderers slicked off the creek bank and washed away most of the physical evidence in the muddy water despite their efforts a few items remained fibers green fibers microscopically similar to a shirt found in echols home and red fibers microscopically similar with a bath robe found in baldwins home were found on the victims the defense retested the fibers in 2012 and claim they do not match however the people who retested the evidence were paid by the defense the fibers have decayed over the years and are now of poor quality and the

wheeler forensic odontologists homer campbell and peter loomis are experts in both tool mark and bite mark identification campbell and loomis both report that the round slot where the compass had been matched the wound on branchs forehead these are transcriptions of emails wheeler says were sent to him by campbell and loomis i believe the injuries to the left forehead and upper lid of the left eye were produced by the knife recovered or one similar i also sent the photos of the injuries and the knife to another for evaluation and he agrees have fun with this and thank you for sending it to me homer campbellbingo the circular mark sure looks like the butt of the survival knife the measurements fit the diameter of the injury is 30mm and the diameter of the prominent circular area of the butt of the knife is 298mm the 3 lacerations under the eyebrow look like they were made by the serrations on the back side of the knife the measurements also fit here the lacerations measure 112mm between them and the serrated points on the knife vary between 111 and 114 mm of course the photo with the wooden ruler is blurry depicting these serrations but i can still measure them peter loomis also

baldwin the bloody necklace was discovered late in the trial it was not presented to the jury because doing so would have caused a continuance in the trial to give the defense time to examine the new evidence it could have also led to a mistrial and a severance of the echols and baldwin cases prosecutors claimed the sample was used up in the original testing so the blood on the necklace cannot be retestedhttpcallahanmysitecomwm3ebtrialmarch17hearinghtmlhttpmarkansasonlinecommar18fate2handsjurors three knots the victims were tied with three distinct knots this pointed to three killers involved in the murdershttpcallahanmysitecomwm3ebtriallsakeviciushtml blood at the crime scene in the paradise lost documentaries you will hear people say that no blood was found at the crime scene many people have used that to theorize that the murders took place somewhere else and the bodies were later dumped in the ditch an idea sometimes referred to as the man hole theory its a tactic used by the wm3 defense team to attempt to frame alternative suspects such as terry hobbs the fact is luminol testing in may 1993 revealed significant amounts of blood at the crime scene luminol is a chemical that glows when it is exposed to blood but it was not admissible in court in 1994 the blood revealed by the luminol clearly shows that the murders occurred exactly where jessie misskelley said they did as one law enforcement official described it the crime scene lit up like a christmas tree when luminol was appliedhttpwm3truthcomcrimesceneordumpsitehttpcallahanmysitecomwm3img2luminolphotoshtml eyewitnesses eyewitnesses also played a role one of the centerpieces of the case involved the hollingsworth family who knew damien and claimed to see him walking near the crime scene covered in mud on the night of the murders the witnesses claim that he was walking with his girlfriend domini teer domini would later become the teen mother of damiens only child seth who was born shortly after damien’s arrest the witnesses were actually relatives of domini and knew damien and domini well prosecutors made a convincing argument that jason baldwin and domini had a similar build and hairstyle at the time of the murders and could have been easily confused for one another in the dark regardless of who was with damien the hollingsworth family was adamant that they saw damien walking with someone near the crime scene on the night of the murders there is no record that that hollingsworth family has ever recanted this storyhttpwm3truthcomthehollingsworthsightingfact  echols baldwin and misskelley did not have alibis some of the alibis presented in west of memphis are less than truthful none of the three had an alibi that held up in court for the hours in which the murders occurred echols and misskelley attempted to provide alibi witnesses but they were all discredited on the stand during the trials jason baldwins alibi was so flimsy his attorney did not even bother to present it jessie misskelleys failed alibis in the documentary west of memphis jessie misskellys alibi witnesses tell a story that jessie was wrestling in a nearby town on the night of the murders the fact is jessie misskelleys jury heard these witnesses and did not believe their conflicting stories the movie presents a wrestling contract and a picture of jessie in wrestling gear and seems to suggest that these items are from may 5th 1993 yet the movie presents no proof these items are from may 5th 1993httpwm3truthcomfailedalibisformisskelleyecholsandbaldwindamien echols failed alibis in a 2010 interview with cnn damien echols made the following claimat the time the police say the murders took place i was actually on the phone with three different people the problem was my attorneys never called them to the stand damien echols you can watch that interview here it’s at the very beginninghttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvle etbjm2u hit65s there are actually four girls that damien has claimed to talk to on may 5th 1993 why didn’t his attorneys call them to the stand here’s why because not a single one of them could account for his whereabouts from 530pm to 920pm on may 5th 1993 the murders are widely believed to have occurred between 645pm and 800pm in fact some of the “phone girls” statements actually place damien with jason baldwin during that time their statements would not have provided alibis for damien to the contrary they would have provided evidence that he was out of his home between 530pm and 920pm with jason baldwin on the night of may 5th 1993 the “phone girls” would have made much better prosecution witnesses than defense witnesses echols should be thankful they weren’t called as witnesses in 1993 here are summaries of their 1993 police statements  1  holly george damien claimed he talked to holly george on may 5th 1993 holly told police she didn’t talk to damien that evening she said she spoke with him much earlier in the afternoon around 300pm or 400pmhttpwwwcallahanmysitecomwm3hollyg2html  2  heather cliett damien claimed he spoke with heather cliett on the evening of may 5th 1993 cliett said shed been unable to reach echols until 1030pm she

damaging to damien’s case is jennifer bearden bearden told police in a 91093 statement that she called jason’s house between 415pm and 530pm on may 5th 1993 she says jason answered the phone and she talked to jason and damien for about 20 minutes damien told her he and jason were “going somewhere” and to call him back at 800pm when bearden called damien’s house at 800pm his grandmother answered damien’s grandmother told bearden that damien “wasn’t there” in her police statement bearden says she finally reached damien around 920pm this is an exchange with officer bryn ridge and bearden during her 91093 statement ridge about what time was that call you made to jasons bearden between it had to be somewhere in between 415 and 5 something like that 5 530 ridge who answered the phone at jasons bearden jason ridge and did you talk to damien bearden yeah i talked to jason about 5 minutes and the inaudible with damien and he wasnt talking because they were playing video games with his little brother matt ridge okay and after that conversation you had with him bearden he said him and jason were going to go somewhere him and jason were going somewhere and that he um wanted me to call him later at his house around 8 and i said okay ridge okay did he say where he was going to go bearden no ridge okay and when you called back about 8 bearden his grandmother said he wasnt there and i was suppose to call back around 9 and i called back around 920 930 and i talk to him for a little bit but then i had to get off the phone because i wasnt suppose to be on the phone after 930httpcallahanmysitecomwm3imgbeardenhtml during her conversation with damien around 920pm on may 5th 1993 bearden says damien told her he had been “out” with jason he claims they had been driven somewhere by jason’s mother angela gail grinnell ridge okay after that last call and you talked to damien did you ask him where he had been that evening bearden i said where did you and jason go and he said uh his mom just took us some where he didnt really say where because like  ridge whos mom took him somewhere bearden jasons problem is damien was lying jason’s mom could not have driven them anywhere because she told the prosecutor she was at work from 300pm until 1100pm on may 5th 1993 fogleman okay what hours do you work there angela i work from 3 to 11httpwwwcallahanmysitecomwm3gailhtml in west of memphis bearden can be seen reading from a police report saying that “she had been on the phone with damien and jason during the afternoon after school and until about 930pm” this is offered up as proof that damien was on the phone with bearden all night on may 5th until 930pm this poorly written police report distorts the facts of bearden’s full police statement in which bearden clearly states that she spoke with damien before 530pm and after 920pm and that he was “out” with jason in between during the same time the murders were occurring this is yet another example of how west of memphis and the other documentaries distort the facts to make the wm3 appear innocent when the facts clearly point to guilt

told a 2010 interviewer at the time of the crimes he had lived in marion ar and told larry king it was within 10 or 15 miles of west memphis at trial mr echols testified that his residence was at broadway trailer park in west memphis within 2 miles of crime scene  frequency of travel within west memphis testified in 1994 to walking around west memphis frequently in a 2010 interview stated he went to west memphis hardly at all  familiarity with area around victim neighborhoods testified in 1994 to walking through those neighborhoods 23 times a week and in fact had lived across from robin hood hills in mayfair apartments as a child for a time also answered affirmatively on a police questionnaire that he was familiar with robin hood hills but in a 2010 interview mr echols denied that familiarity with the crime scene area and said it was a residential area and thus out of bounds for him as he would only go to west memphis for walmart and such  alibi on the stand agreed with prosecutor that his visit to some family friends was moved around depending on the hours he needed to cover  initial changes to alibi story alibi story changed between police interviews with mr echols on may 9 and may 10 with respect to 1 who had picked him up from laundromat near jasons uncles house 2 who had gotten in the car as passengers 3 when the pickup occurred and 4 where they went afterwards  further changes to alibi story while awaiting trial mr echols told his defense investigator in july 1993 that at 745pm he had fielded a phone call from a 12yearold girl that lasted 6090 minutes the girl meanwhile said she reached him not until around 930pm and that they had spoken only briefly an earlier attempt to reach him at 8 or 9pm had indicated he was out and when she asked him where hed been that evening hed told her with codefendant jason baldwin in august 1993 mr echols revised this story saying that the girl had tried to reach him but her call was denied because he had given instructions to his mother not to take it because he was at home with his girlfriend domini  a claim that is refuted by all accounts of dominis activities that day  friendship with jessie misskelley in his book almost home 2005 mr echols maintained he had known misskelley enough to say a few words when he saw him currently former fbi profiler and wm3 advocate john douglas broadcasts echols contention that he didnt even really know misskelley but if we go back to the time of the investigation the accounts of peers and community members like domini teer jim mc nease jason crosby deanna holcomb and others maintain an actual friendship between echols and misskelley and place the two together at echols house walking around town and at community events in 19911993  origin and extent of his psych history aka exhibit 500 currently mr echols says his documented psych history for 19921993  a large set of documents generated by various mental health professionals during his 3 hospitalizations for suicidal and homicidal impulses detailing among other things the threats to his parents that led to their telling health professionals they did not want him to return to their household because they are frightened of him and what he can do not only to them but to other children that reside in the home  was actually a document written by a single perjured woman and engineered by jasons lawyers to cast suspicion on him neither of these contentions is true further mr echols has told piers morgan that he wasnt a troublemaking kid despite multiple school suspensions for fights and fires and the three hospitalizations and typically portrays his various welldocumented mental issues including diagnosed psychoses as simply depression  shane divilbiss attack school fight in his hospital papers mr echols told mental health professionals that he had attempted to gouge out his classmates eyes with fingernails sharpened to points which is corroborated by shane divilbisss own account in more recent tellings mr echols has changed this story to appearing as though it was an attempt to gouge the eyes when actually he was being pulled off divilbiss and just trying to hang on so it only looked like an attempted eye gouging  mark gardner rape allegations in the mid90s mr echols made allegations about being violated by a prisonmate but recanted them and then reclaimed them over time an investigation by law enforcement indicated no merit to his claim and certain reporters indicated that the claims were recanted and restated as a method of attracting attention to the need for prison reform mr echols story waffled on whether rapes had occurred and which of the two men had crawled into the others cell via a removed cinder block wm3 advocate mara leveritt reported the hole too small for gardner to have crawled through so apparently that version of their story was demonstrably false whatever the real story is mr echols definitely changed his account  softball girls at trial mr echols dismissed their claims to have heard him publicly saying he did it and called them liars from the stand more recently he told dateline that while he doesnt remember saying those things if he had said them it would have been like a joke  no eating utensil in prison claimed no access to eating utensil arkansas dept of corrections reps say that inmates are granted use of an industrial plastic spork that mr echols apparently declined to use echols i had to learn to use a fork again you know i hadnt eaten with a fork in 18 12 years piers morgan why echols they dont give you forks in there piers morgan how do you eat ehols with your hands  prison visits from mom and sister mr echols has stated in recent interviews that his mother and sister visited him in prison only a handful of times and twice respectively pam and michelle have publicly stated otherwise and maintain hes not telling the truth about that given mr echols track record with the truth id tend to believe them  relationship with son according to public statements of his adult childs mother domini she reacted badly to a people magazine interview that had mr echols talking about his efforts as a dad domini maintains he hasnt been putting in any effort hed been out to tempe az for publicity event and hadnt called his son and resents his remarks and that he had not been responsive to attempts to reach out via private means if mr echols had a better track record with the truth his words might be taken more seriously by those who have been listening well fact  echols frequently walked around west memphis and was very familiar with the crime scene prior to the murdershe began to walk the moment he got to town in the morning at night when he was anxious or bored or simply awake through the rain and later the snow in his heavy black leather jacket and sunglasses he wandered all around town quietly but purposefully like a ghost looking for something to haunt httpwwwbostonmagazinecomnewsarticle20130625damienecholssalemlong frequent walking is a habit echols developed in his teen years as a resident of west memphis ar  but you might not know that to hear him tell it today in 2010 echols told an interviewer he didnt go to west memphis a lot at all having lived outside west memphis in marion he dismissed the robin hood hills crime scene area as a wooded residential area that he was unfamiliar with and never would have been in  noting that his occasional trips to west memphis would have been expressly purposeful citing walmart as a destinationhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchfeatureplayerdetailpagevle etbjm2u hit532s these contentions fly in the face of the available documentation including echols own 1994 testimony at the time of arrest per his testimony echols lived at broadway trailer park in west memphis not in neighboring marion and he testified to walking around west memphis a lot with codefendant jason baldwin de we jason and i like to walk around a lot just with no place particular in mind just start out walking and walk around all day q did you walk quite a bit around west memphis then de yes i did when shown a map of the neighborhoods around the robin hood hills crime scene echols told the prosecutor he would have passed through the area 23 times a week in part because those neighborhoods were nearly smack dab between his own residence and those of best friend jason baldwin and girlfriend domini teer further echols has offered in his books vivid memories of having lived as a child for a time at mayfair apartments which overlooked robin hood hills and the sanders family longtime friends of his own lived in west memphis about 125 miles west of the crime scene another reason for damien to be in the residential area frequently that damien walked around west memphis a lot is further evidenced by the accounts of fellow defendant jessie misskelley and stepfather jack echols  damien he dont stay in one place long he always walk around he always go to west memphis he goes to west memphis a lotand he walks around  jessie misskelley dec 1993httpcallahanmysitecomwm3jmofshehtmlthere were other times when damien had so much energy he did not know what to do he got really excited and kind of hyper and he always walked at these times damien walked to some of the parks in the area to some of his friends houses and across town he told me that he sometimes got confused because he was sure where he needed to go but when he got there he felt like he was in the wrong place i though that he meant that he changed his mind about where he wanted to go but he told me that it was not like that damien did not decide where he was supposed to walk to but got a feeling about where he should be but when he got where he was going his feeling changed and he had to go somewhere else he was real frustrated at these times and i did not know how to help him i did not really understand what he meant about not knowing where he wanted to be i sometimes felt that i should have done a better job trying to figure out what he was talking about and maybe then i could have made things a little better for him  jack echols september 2000httpcallahanmysitecomwm3ajecholsdeclarationhtml note jack echols citing parks in the area as his stepsons favorite haunt damien himself listed woods park as the two resources he used in the communityhttpcallahanmysitecomimages5003392jpg taking long walks is no crime and obviously the above documentation is not intended as proof of guilt but is merely meant to show that echols will lie about things which do not flatter his innocence stance regardless of how easily the lies can be checked out and because reporters typically do not know the facts hes never called on it this synopsis courtesy of case researcher fred j walshfact– two of the star witnesses against terry hobbs in west of memphis are convicted felons baxter county arkansas residents cody curtis gott and christian blake sisk are former friends of terry hobbs nephew mike hobbs jr their interviews were late additions to the film they went on camera for west of memphis in january 2012 to talk about what they call the hobbs family secret they claim that mike hobbs jr told them that he heard that his uncle terry hobbs was involved in the murders gott and sisk were on probation for felony burglary of their high school when producer amy berg interviewed them and got them to tell their hobbs family secret tale on camera in may 2013 they were sent to prison on new charges sisk was sentenced to 10 years in prison gott was sentenced to 7 there have only been a few media mentions of the fact that these star witnesses against terry hobbs are young convicted felons from mountain home ar with lengthy arrest records here is an excerpt from a memphis commercial appeal article written by marc perrusquia on october 29 2012details are surfacing on the criminal backgrounds of two witnesses featured in west of memphis a 212 hour film financed by lord of the rings director peter jackson and coproduced by echols and his wife along with documentarian amy berg in the film and in affidavits given by the defense early this year to prosecutor scott ellington two men both in their early 20s say they learned hobbs once confessed to a relative that he killed the three boys  something described as the hobbs family secret baxter county arkansas circuit court records show the men cody curtis gott 20 and christian blake sisk 21 both of mountain home ark pleaded guilty in 2010 to felony burglary and misdemeanor theft in connection with a school breakin both were charged again this fall with felony drug dealing according to the baxter county sheriffs office gott was charged in september with delivery of methamphetamines and cocaine and sisk with delivery of a controlled substance and carrying prohibited weapons court records show sisk also has been convicted of terroristic threatening defense spokesman lonnie soury said friday the men despite their records passed polygraphs and are credible too many things point to the hobbs family soury said  put these people under oath thats all were asking terry hobbs 54 denies any involvement in the murders hes said in a series of public statements he believes the west memphis three are guilty and that efforts to blame him are motivated by profit there are numerous problems with the hobbs family secret tale that gott and sisk are telling 1 mike hobbs and his son have denied ever saying that terry hobbs killed michael chris and stevie 2 the gottsisk statements are hearsay while they might work in a movie the statements are likely inadmissible in a court of law terry hobbs brothers son says he heard someone say that his uncle did it would not cut it in a real courtroom 3 gott and sisk may have a grudge against mike hobbs jr according to mike hobbs sr gott and sisk made up the hobbs family secret in order to retaliate against mike jr according to mike hobbs sr his son provided information to authorities on the mountain home high school breakin that led to the arrest and felony conviction of gott and sisk 4 the wm3 defense team claims gott and sisk passed polygraph tests however the defense team chose the testers and paid any fees that may have been charged related to that testing the results have not been analyzed by anyone other than the defense team for accuracy plus polygraph tests are seldom admissible in court 5 gott and sisk may have had a financial motivation according to the defense timeline of events the hobbs family secret tip came in to the wm3 defense team phone tip line on december 11th 2011 on december 16th gott sisk and a 3rd unnamed informant were flown to washington d c to meet with wm3 attorney steve braga and wm3 pr agent lonnie soury there they signed affidavits and were polygraphed it is unclear whether there was an award connected with the wm3 phone tip line in december 2011 however by february 2012 an anonymous donor had contributed a 100000 reward to that tip line at the very least convicted felons gott and sisk got an allexpensepaid trip to d c out of the dealhttpwwwfox16comnewsstorywm3legalteammakesclaimsagainstvictims4hsf gkijakvb0s5m hig1gcspx6 as noted above because gott and sisk are convicted felons with extensive criminal records they would not

michael moore and stevie branch stewart and guy claimed to have information that the murders happened after the boys stumbled upon hobbs and the other men as they did drugs in the woods this information was presented to a judge by attorney ken swindle attorney for terry hobbs’ exwife read more about this aptlynamed attorney here httparkansasnewscomsectionsnewsarkansascourtupholds5yearoldstudente28099ssuspensionswearinghtml  swindle failed to mention to the judge and the media that stewart and guy were convicted rapists that were serving 40 years guy and 70 years stewart on rape and other charges in 1996 bennie guy pled guilty to raping an 11yearold girl in an arkansas motel room he had also been convicted of sexual assault in texas in 1996 and was serving that 40 year term concurrently with the one in arkansas on top of all that he escaped from jail in 1997 and was serving 6 years for that he was denied parole in 2008 despite this he was miraculously released on parole on june 11 2013 he had severed just 17 years of the 40 he should have served for raping a little 11yearold girl why was guy released from prison just months after his assistance with the wm3 case coincidence you be the judge despite his criminal history parole came over objections from crittenden officials by gary meece west memphis evening times 62513 while a convicted rapist’s release worksheet noted that he had eight supporters backing his release earlier this month the two public officials who made official comments were adamantly against his release by the state parole board west memphis 3 tipster bennie david guy was paroled out by the arkansas parole board after serving 17 years of a 40year sentence despite objections from crittenden county officials in his note to institutional release services which was seeking recommendations concerning guy’s potential parole tommy trammel chief deputy for the

for or against the potential parole of an inmate guy now is languishing in a east texas jail guy a former resident of earle went from the state prison system’s ouachita river correctional unit directly to the gregg county jail besides his arkansas charges guy was sentenced to 40 years in texas in july 1996 on a charge of sexual assault by a habitual offender and was serving that term concurrently while in arkansas concerning guy’s status in texas “i am unable to give you any information about the above referenced case i can confirm that he was booked into the gregg county jail on

legal grounds to u s district court for the eastern district of texas was denied in 2009 in april ken swindle an attorney representing the mother of one of the victims presented new allegations in the 20yearold murders of three west memphis 8yearolds by relying on sworn statements from guy and another convicted crittenden county rapist both were then serving time in the cummins unit of the arkansas prison system billy wayne stewart and guy alleged that terry hobbs david jacoby l g hollingsworth and buddy lucas killed christopher byers michael moore and stevie branch on may 5 1993 after the boys stumbled upon them getting high in the woods near the service road in west memphis neither statement mentioned stewart’s or guy’s circumstances or extensive criminal histories whatever the dispensation of his case in texas guy is under supervised probation according to the arkansas legal system until july 24 2035 guy’s case came under scrutiny prior to his involvement in the west memphis 3 case as he had sought parole after learning that dna collected after the rape was not a conclusive match to his dna the arkansas supreme court ruled that the lack of dna evidence did not exonerate him in the case he had gotten support from the activist group the innocence project but had failed in various appeals to the courts terry hobbs stepfather to stevie branch has denied the allegations made by guy and stewart as has jacoby a friend who helped hobbs search for the boys on may 5 1993 hollingsworth died in a traffic accident in 2001 the sworn statements by guy and stewart were based on alleged admissions from buddy lucas because of his friendship with jessie misskelley jr lucas was interrogated extensively in the 1993 investigation but never has been a suspect in the case misskelley damien echols and jason baldwin teens living in local trailer parks at the time of the killings were convicted of the murders in 1994 and were released from prison in 2011 in a special plea deal in which they were released on suspended sentences in exchange for guilty pleas the case has been the subject of four movie documentaries and the socalled west memphis 3 have received extensive support from music and film personalities baldwin who lives in seattle has become an activist working with the innocence project and has cofounded his own group proclaim justice inc a nonprofit organization currently based in lakeway texas near austin its web site states it is “a 501 c 3 nonprofit corporation dedicated to winning freedom for inmates who are factually innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted” the organization continues to attempt to stir up public support for the wm3 guy who was 53 when his allegations came to light this spring was serving a sentence of 40 years issued on aug 5 1996 for rape  habitual offender from crittenden county he had pleaded guilty to the rape of an 11yearold girl in a motel room on may 27 1995 he had been on probation at the time of the offense he also had been sentenced to six years in 1997 for escape second degree and had a prior conviction for robbery for which he was given a twoyear sentence in 1994 stewart 49 continues to serve a total time of 70 years on a rape sentence handed down in 2011 he has a string of other felony convictions dating back to 1983 last week the evening times reported that two other men making allegations against terry hobbs are now in prison tipsters christian blake sisk and cody curtis gott appeared in last year’s “west of memphis” which was produced by damien echols prosecuting attorney scott ellington has said he believes echols misskelley and baldwin are guilty and he has seen no evidence to convince him otherwise fact  misskelley and echols failed their polygraph tests echols and misskelley both consented to polygraph tests baldwin did not the original polygraph examiner west memphis police detective bill durham believed echols and misskelley showed signs of deception when answering questions about their involvement in the murders these results were later disputed by other examiners who were paid by the defense misskelleys polygraph resultshttpcallahanmysitecomimages2jmpolygraphjpg echols polygraph resultshttpcallahanmysitecomwm3depolyhtml fact  the softball girls have not recanted jodee medford was one of the socalled softball girls who told jurors she heard damien echols boasting to other kids at the softball field about killing the children a frequent supporter lie is the false claim that jodee medford has recanted no public records exist stating that jodee has recanted some people may have misunderstood an affidavit by jodees mother but nowhere in the affidavit does the mother say her daughter has recanted her story on the witness stand during his trial echols denied bragging to medford and others that he killed the children but in a more recent interview with cbs 48 hours echols admitted that he may have bragged at the softball park about killing the boys he said it would have been like a joke you can see him say it on this video at time mark 1250httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvsgwa4komcu athis means echols perjured himself at trial when he denied on the witness stand that he bragged about the murders at the softball park the cbs reporter erin moriarty a longtime champion of the innocence of the wm3 did not bother to ask echols about his perjuryhttpcallahanmysitecomwm3dmedforddeclarationhtml fact– four out of the six surviving parents of the victims believe the wm3 are guilty supporters of the west memphis three and lazy journalists often say “even the parents of the victims think the west memphis three are innocent” the fact is todd and dana moore parents of michael moore terry hobbs stepfather of stevie branch and steve branch father of stevie branch all still firmly believe the wm3 are guilty as charged melissa byers mother of chris byers died believing they were guilty the parents who claim the wm3 are innocent are mark byers stepfather of chris byers and pam hobbs mother of stevie branch it is worth noting that these are the two parents who have made the most tv print and film appearances click on this link for newspaper columns by todd moore and terry hobbs though these columns were likely written with some help from attorneys they capture the true feelings that both men have repeatedly expressed over the yearshttpwm3truthcom201208columnsbytoddmooreandterryhobbsfact  the wm3 were not forced to accept the alford plea after years of steadfastly upholding the verdicts of two arkansas juries the arkansas supreme court finally relented to pressure from wm3 celebrity supporters and the wm3s allstar defense team in december 2010 the arkansas supreme court granted an evidentiary hearing scheduled for december 2011 the purpose of the hearing was to allow judge david laser to hear any new evidence the defense had gathered over the years that might justify a new trial judge laser was a new judge who replaced the original trial judge  judge david burnett but instead of presenting that evidence to judge laser at the december hearing the defense went to a new prosecutor scott ellington in the summer of 2011 and suggested a deal their clients would plead guilty using a legal maneuver called an alford plea in exchange for time served the new prosecutor inexplicably accepted the deal no one forced the wm3 to plead guilty it was their own idea instead of presenting their new evidence and gaining complete exoneration the slick wm3 defense team convinced a newbie prosecutor he could get rid of a difficult case if the wm3 could plead guilty and be released from prison now that same defense team and a slew of celebrity wm3 supporters are hounding arkansas officials for full exoneration without full exoneration the wm3 will forever remain convicted child killers and convicted felons this is the transcript of the inchambers hearing prior to the public alford plea hearing on 81911 in it there are repeated mentions by the state that the alford plea was the brainchild of the defense example end of page 31 beginning of page 32 this leaves no doubt that the wm3’s own attorneys came up with the idea for their clients to plead guilty httpcallahanmysitecompdf81911hearingpdf even mara leveritt champion of the innocence of the wm3 concedes that the alford pleas were the defense’s idea she talks about it in this article httpwwwarktimescomarkansasthebigaskcontentoid1888389 innocent people with solid evidence of innocence do not plead guilty period misskelley alford pleahttpwm3orgtypepadcomfilesmisskelleyalfordpdf echolsbaldwin alford pleawwwwm3orgtypepadcomfilesalfordpleadjpdf fact  the wm3 have not been exonerated contrary to recent media reports the wm3 have not been exonerated found not guilty or been proven innocent they remain convicted and confessed murderers who were rightfully convicted by two juries the primary way they could be exonerated is if an alternate suspect is tried and convicted through the judicial process previous efforts to frame alternate suspects such as mark byers stepfather of chris byers have failed now the wm3 and their supporters are relentlessly attempting to do the same thing to terry hobbs stepfather of stevie branch by some estimates the free the wm3 movement has spent as much as 20 million to find new evidence that someone else committed the murders when given the opportunity to present that evidence at a december 2011 evidentiary hearing the wm3 instead chose to plead guilty now they are presenting their evidence in the court of public opinion through numerous books movies and media interviews wm3 supporters have even offered a 200000 reward to compel people to remember things that might point to the innocence of the wm3 despite tremendous pressure from the wm3 attorneys celebrity supporters and the wm3 pr team so far nothing has been presented to prosecutors in arkansas that is compelling enough to reopen the case and charge an alternate suspect with the murders until that happens the wm3 will remain guilty as charged fact  even if the hair does match terry hobbs that doesnt make him guilty or the wm3 innocent after years of efforts to frame stepfather mark byers with the murders failed the wm3 defense team and makers of the documentaries paradise lost 3 and west of memphis have turned to a new red herring suspect stepfather terry hobbs many recent media reports claim that hobbs dna was found on a victim that sounds pretty compelling but its not exactly true when most people hear the word dna they assume that means something like blood or semen this dna is actually a hair fragment found on a shoestring used to hog tie michael moore the defense often says the hair was tied into the shoestring but there are currently no publicly available photographs or documents to prove that claim experts paid by the wm3 defense team claim that they determined through lab tests that terry hobbs is a possible source of that hair problem is 15 of the rest of the population is also a possible source of that hair that means that more than 45 million americans are also possible sources of that hair in addition michael moore frequently visited the hobbs home the hair could have easily landed on moores shoestring through secondary transfer as he played there the hair is meaningless and will never lead to the conviction of terry hobbs paid defense experts also report that a second hair found on a tree stump near the crime scene weeks after the murders could have come from hobbs friend david jacoby but it also could have come from 7 of the rest of the population a whopping 21 million americans are also possible owners of the hair found on the tree stump the “jacoby hair” is completely meaningless as evidence in court the wm3s own hired expert called the hairs weak evidence during a 2007 press conference how the hairs have suddenly become strong evidence in west of memphis is beyond explanationthe two hairs that i know about – the one that could have in fact come from mr hobbs and the one that could have in fact come from david jacoby – constitute what i call weak evidence because there are other people it could have come from and there isn’t any way to really prove our selection of possible sources for that hair i don’t think – my personal opinion – i don’t think that that hair evidence would be enough to convict mr hobbs or mr jacoby or anyone that would be in a similar situation because it’s simply not strong enough the percentages i gave of people who could be the source of those hairs are 15 of the population in the respect to one hair and 7 in respect to the other hair that’s not particularly strong evidence and especially in the context of what most people are accustomed to with dna testing  thomas fedor forensic serologisthttpcallahanmysitecomwm3pressconferencehtml fact – the wm3 defense team changes their injury theory to fit each new red herring suspect the west memphis three defense team once categorized some of the victims’ injuries as “bite marks” if you are new to this case you may not be aware the defense theory evolved from a human causing the purported bite marks to a veritable zoo of animals inflicting the victims’ injuries the wm3 originally tried to portray stepfather mark byers as “the real killer” a defense expert testified at a postconviction hearing he suspected there was at least one human bite mark on victim stevie branch defense experts also speculated human bites were on the other two victimshttpcallahanmysitecomwm3rule37october27html when byers had his teeth extracted because he needed dentures many wm3 supporters concluded it only could mean one thing byers had murdered the children the documentary paradise lost 2 revelations is built around the premise byers may have murdered the boys many wm3 supporters felt the stepfather’s teeth being removed was proof positive of guilt despite years of trying the wm3 defense was never able to pin the crime on byers he had a good alibi nothing to connect him to the crime oh… and he’s the innocent stepparent of a victim things changed when terry hobbs stepfather of victim stevie branch was determined by the defense to be a possible source of a hair found on a shoestring used to tie up victim michael moore problem is that hair is also a possible match for 15 of the rest of the population that means that more than 45 million americans are also possible sources of that hair in addition michael moore frequently visited the hobbs home the hair could have easily landed on moores shoestring through secondary transfer as he played there despite these facts the defense suddenly adopted an animal predation theory to explain the boys’ injuries the purpose was to try to discredit the misskelley confessions to foster hobbs as a “suspect” and to bring into question the state’s forensics evidence the transition to a new alternate suspect and new injury theory was seamless the defense would soon maintain that the castration of chris byers with a knife was in fact the work of alligator snapping turtles this theory would appear in west of memphis a documentary produced by peter jackson and damien echols other wounds and injuries on the murdered boys were attributed to a wide range of animals and all claims of human bite marks ceased for more detailed information on this subject click herehttpmidsouthjusticeorgsmfindexphptopic1460fact  mr bonjangles didnt do it around the time the boys were reported missing on the night of may 5th 1993 a bleeding muddy african american man stumbled into the womens bathroom of the bojangles chicken restaurant about a mile from the crime scene wm3 supporters often complain about one piece of evidence that was lost blood scrapings from that bathroom at bojangles while it is a shame the samples were lost the man in bojangles could not have committed the murders according to the restaurant manager marty king mr bojangles had a blue cast type brace on his arm that had white velcro on it a disoriented one armed man could not have subdued and hogtied three boys could he have been a witness yes was he the murderer nohttpcallahanmysitecomwm3martykinghtmlhttpcallahanmysitecomwm3bojangleshtml fact  celebrities are not crime experts they make mistakes and most dont know any more about this case than you do johnny depp peter jackson natalie maines eddie vedder henry rollins dave navarro marilyn manson the list of wm3 celebrity supporters goes on and on the argument goes that all these celebrities wouldnt put their careers on the line to support child killers when you watch interviews with these celebrities nearly all say they became involved in the case after watching the paradise lost documentaries chances are thats how you learned about this case as well problem is if youve really read all the information on this website you now know that the paradise lost series contains lots of things that make the wm3 appear innocent while leaving out virtually all the facts that point to guilt many of these celebrities joined the free the wm3 crusade with only half of the facts none will ever destroy their careers by admitting that the wm3 might be guilty their reputations now rely on the wm3 being innocent and they are sparing no expense to continue to attempt to prove it fact  the wm3 were not wrongfully convicted dont let all the shameless profitseeking movies documentaries and books fool you the wm3 were found guilty by two juries based on solid physical and circumstantial evidence they remain guilty yet free men because they got a lucky break from a prosecutor who was new to the case they have not proven that they were wrongfully convicted or falsely convicted as they often claim once they entered guilty pleas through the alford agreement the burden fell on them to prove their innocence theyve been out of jail since august 2011 and so far they have failed to do so fact – the state of arkansas should not have released the west memphis three without a second jury trial here are some facts about the illfated alford plea one of damien echols attorneys approached his old law school buddy arkansas attorney general dustin mc daniel about the idea of an alford plea in the summer of 2011 an alford plea allows a person to plead guilty while claiming innocence mc daniel sent echols attorneys to prosecutor scott ellingtonhttpwwwarktimescomarkansasthebigaskcontentoid1888389story page1httpwwwtjsleduthejeffersoniannews201109westmemphisthreeandtheiralfordpleaellington had been on the job less than one year when he made the call to release the wm3 in a panel discussion about the case just days after the release of the wm3 ellington publicly admitted he did not read the entire west memphis police case file before letting the wm3 out of prisonhttpwwwclintonschoolspeakerscomlectureviewwestmemphisthreepastpresentandfutureellington was most likely misled by slick wm3 attorneys into believing real evidence of innocence existed when it didn’t ellington likely thought this case would go away if he let the wm3 out of prison in exchange for guilty pleas as part of the alford plea the wm3 had to agree not to sue the state of arkansas for wrongful conviction some have speculated that the state of arkansas freed the wm3 for fear the wm3 might sue for millions if they were exonerated in a second jury trail the fact is even today the wm3 could still probably sue if they could prove someone else committed the crime arkansas is one of about 23 states that does not have a statute that gives exonerated convicts a set amount for wrongful conviction if they could prove in a court of law that someone else committed the crime and if that person was convicted and if the wm3 were exonerated by that conviction there doesnt seem to be anything to prevent them for suing for wrongful conviction at some point in the futurehttpwwwinnocenceprojectorgcontentcompensatingthewronglyconvictedphpthe wm3 defense team is believed to have sent prosecutor ellington all of the evidence that they would have presented at the 2011 evidentiary hearing plus they have sent him additional “evidence” gathered by movie makers during the making of damien echols’ movie west of memphis  if this evidence hasnt been sufficient for ellington to reopen the case and prosecute terry hobbs why does anyone think the new evidence would have been enough to win them a new trial the evidence was insufficient to win a new trial the defense knew it and thats why they approached ellington with the alford plea the state of arkansas denied justice for both the west memphis three and the three eightyearold victims by allowing a new prosecutor and a bunch of defense attorneys to decide the outcome of this case if the wm3 are indeed innocent they now have to live as convicted murderers and felons the rest of their lives more likely the state of arkansas released three child killers to walk among us in a failed effort to get rid of a complicated expensive politically unpopular and time consuming case fact  damiens

kids stories it will be like im the west memphis boogey man little kids will be looking under their beds before they go to bed damien might be under there  damien echols fact – very few journalists research this case beyond watching the documentaries before interviewing the wm3 if you are a reporter who is too lazy to do your own research here is a list of questions to ask damien echols prestigious journalism awards await those brave enough to ask these questions  1  why did you echols tell larry king you lived in marion “1015 miles from crime scene” when at the time of the crimes by your own testimony you lived at broadway trailer park in west memphis less than 2 miles from the crime scene  2  why have you echols told interviewers you went to west memphis hardly at all when you in fact lived there at the time of the murders and testified to walking around west memphis with jason baldwin frequently”  3  why have you echols told interviewers you were unfamiliar with crime scene neighborhood where victims lived you testified in 1994 to walking through that neighborhood 2 to 3 times a week” in your first book you vividly recount living in mayfair apartments across from crime scene  4  why have you echols dismissed reports of your mental illness as the work of 3rd  4thhand rumors when 1sthand documentation from mental health professionals peers and law enforcement officers clearly demonstrate your mental illness in 19921993  5  when you echols personally reported to the social security administration in 1992 that you were plagued with the following issues  homicidal suicidal manic depression schizophrenia drug abuse alcohol abuse  sociopathic  how much of that selfassessment was legitimate if some of those assessments were not legitimate why did you report them in an application for disability benefits  6  awaiting trial why did you echols write that your body was changing via koolaid packs transforming you into the christ”  7  if you echols were a white wiccan at the time of your arrest why did you write imagery of yourself as satans artillery captain storming heaven why did your talk about overseeing armageddon with reminders to yourself about choosing disciples before halloween”  8  how do you echols reconcile your contention that you were on the phone with four different girls when the crimes occurred 630pm900pm with the fact that 1993 statements offered by those girls do not cover your alibi for the hours from 500pm920pm  9  why did jennifer bearden report in 1993 that your grandma told her you echols were out when she called at 800pm on may 5th why did bearden tell police that you told her you were “out” somewhere with jason baldwin that night when she did finally reach you by phone around 930pm on may 5th why did heather cliett suggest to police you were with jason that night and why did she report that holly george told her you were “out”that night walking around since these alibis with your “phone girls” have failed where exactly were you between 630pm and 900pm on may 5th 1993  10  when you echols spoke with the wmpd on may 10th 1993 why did your account of may 5th differ sharply from the story your girlfriend domini told you said she was dropped off at home before 3pm her own account put her home at 7pm  11  why at the trial did you echols smirk at the testimony of the “softball girls” and call them liars from the stand did you admit to perjury when you told reporter erin moriarty that you might have told the girls at the softball park you killed the boys but you were just “joking”  12  what is the truth of the mark gardner rape allegations that you echols have submitted and withdrawn at points if the rape allegations were false why did you make them if they were true exactly how did gardner “force” you to crawl through a removed cinder block so he could rape you  13  was joe bartoushs account of you echols killing a dog partially corroborated by heather cliett blaine hodge and your large collection of animal skulls true if it was not true why would jason baldwins own cousin joe bartoush offer this damaging information to police especially with you and jason in peril of going to prison for triple murder  14  when you echols said that like manson  bundy you would be remembered by the world was this what you had in mind  15  do you echols feel your parents were truthful when they told your doctors in september 1992 that they did not want you living in their home any more for fear your would harm them  the children in the house if not why would they offer that statement  16  why in recent interviews do you echols categorize exhibit 500 as a document written by one woman and submitted by jasons lawyers to attack you exhibit 500 is actually a collection of documents written by mental health professionals documenting your three stays in mental hospitals for suicidalhomicidal impulses in 1992 it was compiled by your own defense team and submitted in the sentencing phase in an attempt to secure leniency for you why are you attacking baldwin and his attorneys for a document your doctors wrote and you submitted to your jury 17 for many years you echols accused stepfather mark byers of the murders more recently you have pointed the finger at stepfather terry hobbs you’ve even implied that mr bojangles could be involved if you didn’t commit these murders who did 18 how much money have you echols made off your books your documentary your artwork your speaking engagements your tattoo work and other murderrelated business ventures since your release in august 2011 how much in donations would you estimate you have received over the years from wm3org peter jackson johnny depp and other benefactorsmost of these questions were written by longtime case researcher fred j
