while it’s covered in greater detail within our cancun travel guide  it’s a question that comes up on a regular basis at our social media outlets as well as in emails how much does it cost to live in cancun the answer always surprises people because many of them just don’t realize how cheap you can get by when living in mexico much less have access to the exact same amenities and creature comforts you have while living in a socalled “developed” country where the costs are four and five times or beyond but don’t take my word for it read on to find out just exactly how cheap it is to live in cancun and how cris and i manage to keep ourselves living the good life without spending out of our noses all costs are as of 2016 cost to rent in cancun it all starts with our rental rates note that i am talking about fully furnished accommodations in this particular post anything that you rent without furniture will be significantly less but for those of us on the nomad circuit we don’t want unfurnished we need something that is fully kitted out and ready for us to show up with our laptops and our clothing as a general rule you can rent a studio apartment for between 500 and 600 usd per month it depends on the dollar to peso value and the time of the year two bedroom places range in the 600 to 800 per month range while anything three to four bedrooms will run you between 800 and 1000 per month these costs include your utilities as well as your creature comforts such as air conditioning cable television and highspeed internet the current place we are renting as of this writing costs us around 650 per month depending on the exchange rate it’s a threebedroom twobathroom apartment in centro fully furnished we pay another 150 a month for cable gas water and electric if you want to live in the hotel zone with access to the beach expect to spend 2000 a month or more for anything over two bedrooms studios up to the two bedroom option will cost you between 1000 and 2000 per month not worth it when you can live in centro and be at the beach in a mere 20 minutes via bus and save yourself thousands of dollars per month in our opinion if you want to rent unfurnished places you can knock between 30 to 50 percent off the listed prices here don’t forget if you need help finding accommodations in the riviera maya cristina runs cancun apartment rentals where she uses her native language skills and bootsontheground local knowledge to get you the best rates for your stay we also have two rooms available for rent in cancun via our airbnb for those of you in the market for something quick and easy view room one here view room two here cost of groceries in cancun this is another area where you can save thousands of dollars compared to the united states i covered this in a post a few years back titled how to save more than 5000 a year on groceries living abroad the same rules apply even in 2016 while the average grocery bill per u s american is 6500 per year according to the department of labor as reported by tlc  in mexico you can eat like a king on mere 1000 per year per person in comparison that’s 5500 savings per year and yet we are eating the exact same foods that the average person in the u s is eating and has access to…it’s just that we are purchasing things in a country where we aren’t charged an arm and a leg for food just check out the following video where i show the tickets for my grocery bill on tomatoes mangos papayas and onions…when you utilize local prices and market days you can get all of your produce for pennies one kilo of tomatoes for around 25 cents usd a kilo of onions for 30 cents a kilo of potatoes for 30 cents you can go to the local market and pick up fresh fish direct from the ocean for pennies per kilo i picked up four pounds of chicken hearts and livers at market 23 fresh from the kills that very morning for a mere five dollars on average we spend about 125 per month for the two of us to eat whole foods and healthy living my friends we don’t eat out very often so we save thousands on our grocery bill per year note groceries are cheapest on discount days as discussed in our guidebook cost of produce in mexico your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  646healthcare in mexico if you are a resident like myself you have access to the universal system for between 300 and 600 per year through the instituto mexicano del seguro social or imss for short those minimal costs give you access to free hospital care free dentistry free surgeries free unlimited prescription medication and beyond it’s their universal healthcare policy note that “free” doesn’t necessarily mean free you do have to pay an annual fee the equivalent of what locals pay in taxes but it’s pennies and for most people can be considered small enough to be negligible but let’s assume that you are a nomad and you don’t have residency but instead are here on a tourist visa even then the costs are ridiculously cheap to visit a clinician such as a private doctor that would cost you 80 to 100 in the u s to visit without health insurance back in the days before obamacare no idea what costs are now in terms of taxes you can walk into any doctor’s office such as those associated with farmacia similares and pay a mere 45 pesos to have a doctor take care of you that’s about three usd as of 2016 three dollars to see a doctor beyond that the average costs are 70 to 80 percent lower than what they are in the united states if you are paying out of pocket on everything and the standards are considered just as high if not higher as in the u s i’ve personally been into hospital galenia here in cancun and it was like walking into a palace spotlessly clean incredibly efficient and none of the runarounds you get back in the states when dave from nomadic retiree was here as part of our spring destination freedom retreat in 2013 he was in the dentist every week for several weeks getting root canals and other work done he wrote about the experience in a blog post at his site but the basic gist is that he only paid 1500 out of pocket what would have cost him between 6500 and 8000 on the low end in the united states the bottom line as a single individual before cristina started living with me my total cost of living in cancun was about 600 to 650 per month that’s food rent transportation entertainment and the occasional meal out as of this writing it is myself cristina and devlin living in the same house and i’m covering the costs for all three of us even so we are usually in the 800 to 850 per month range with food and rentutilities factored in and if we are going out and doing a lot of beach activities or taking toursrenting a caretc to explore the riviera maya outside of cancun we might hit 1000 per month in costs there’s also a million other ways that you can save as well for example all of the movie theaters offer a 2 x 1 day and tickets are already cheap the vip cinema leather recliners beer food menu waiters costs around 8 dollars while the normal theater costs between 3 and 4 dollars depending on which cinema you visit almost every restaurant has a 2 x 1 night or a discount night where prices are 30 to 50 percent off it’s just the mexican way they live for discounts and are an extremely frugal people at the end of the day cancun is an affordable place you can choose to set up shop as a digital nomad it’s not the most affordable in mexico but there are a lot of bonuses to living here such as access to an international airport and some of the most developed sections of the country on top of that it’s also a fairly englishfriendly place to be for those of you who don’t speak spanish it’s so lax in fact that all of the officials working at immigration also speak english and i’ve seen more than one person taking care of their visa paperwork without speaking a word of spanish all in all there’s a lot of reasons why it’s a great place and really none that i can think of as to why you wouldn’t want to be here mainland cancun is a quiet tranquil paradise completely bohemian with low costs and access to all the modern creature comforts you need to run an online business really no downsides as far as i’m concerned view larger map for more mexicospecific
