cpijoin date dec 2012location upstate new york posts 21re sub panel height thank you for your confirmation i just did not know if it was different because it was a subpanel thanks again 5 111113 258 pmpaul w abernathy certified master inspector ®join date sep 2005location mc kinney txposts 9715re sub panel height charles i will speak for mr whitt because we are good friends just remember that regardless of being a main distribution panel or remote distribution panel the principals still apply those principals are that the height limit is on over current devices in article 240 and where applicable switches per article 404 just remember that judging the component itself will help in determining which code requirement applies in your case the remote panel has switches and overcurrent devices that the height limit applies too and not just the panel itself hope this helps paul w abernathy cmecp website  httpwwwmastertheneccom twitter  httpstwittercommaster the nec facebook

62 changing professions what do you think my friend i missed you as well as luck would have it i was called to florida to be with a large collection of ceos from the electrical industry these individuals have always inspired me as leaders of such large companies that i simply had to be apart of the event exciting times my friend you will do an amazing job and you know not that you would ever need it that i am here for you anytime247 my friend many times teaching the nec is different than getting out in the field and touching it as many inspectors who are great teachers sometimes need assistance with dealing with pushy electricians and customers and you know i have experience in that area of the profession an inspector walks the line of not getting in trouble with the building official by being too tough on contractors or not allowing intent versus the print if you know what i mean so if you ever feel the need to bend my ear yell at someone just to vent just call me and yell at meand not your jurisdiction see i know how to handle friendship you can yell at me cuss me and complain to me but i will always be your friend and understand where you are coming from i do miss seeing you and i hope you know my prayers are always with you and your family you will be a leader in your department and as for the plumbing and mechanical certifications i have those and dont worry they are not tough classifications to obtainyou are a smart dude so you will have no trouble at all again congrats you will be amazing paul w abernathy cmecp website  httpwwwmastertheneccom
