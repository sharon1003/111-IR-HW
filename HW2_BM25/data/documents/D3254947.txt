david milstead special to the globe and mail published september 19 2014updated march 25 2017a scan of major gold producers earnings suggests the cost of mining gold has risen dramatically over the past few years part of that is a true increase owing to inflation and the expense of digging out toughtoreach grades but most of it is due to a change in the cost metric that gold miners emphasize in their reports to the investing community for years miners liked to talk about cash costs the minelevel expenses of pulling an ounce of gold from the ground for the most part cash costs ran from 500 u s to 800 per ounce depending on a miners properties there was a problem however even as the price of gold skyrocketed to nearly 1900 per ounce miners werent reporting wild windfall profits on their bottom lines thats because cash costs left out a host of expenses from the costs of running the company to annual spending on equipment the new allinclusive measures attempt to solve that the most frequently used metric allin sustaining costs puts the cost of extracting an ounce of gold at more than 1000 industrywide – and explains why miners are having a rough go at profitability when gold sells for a couple hundred dollars more than that the old cash cost led to a lot of misunderstanding about the ability of cash flow that would be there for equity holders says jorge beristain an analyst for deutsche bank people arent really in the weeds on metrics and how theyre calculated so when a company tells you our cash cost is 600 and the price of gold is 1200 you do quick math and say hey they must be earning 600 an ounce of cash flow as the gold price went up investors started to realize there was far less cash flow than theyd guesstimated using that cash cost as a simple metric so there was increasing pressure on the industry to explain to all stakeholders where the cash was really going the evolution could be seen over time at the denver gold forum one of the premier investment conferences for gold equities in 2012 when few companies emphasized the metric nick holland the ceo of gold fields ltd strongly endorsed the measure we sit here and talk about how wonderful our cash costs are but at the end of the day thats only half the equation he said the real equation is look at the allin costs we stand up and talk about cash costs and how much money were making at the ebitda level but the real picture is we dont really make that much money there was also a matter of selfinterest mr holland said governments wondered why the royalties and taxes miners paid werent higher if they were so profitable in june 2013 the world gold council an industry group produced a detailed standard for what miners should include in allin sustaining costs or aisc and in this years gold forum held this week this measure was found in nearly every presentation from the major gold companies many still used cash costs at the individual mine level but barrick gold reported allin sustaining costs at each of its properties aisc is the key metric we use when we talk about our operations because it is a more accurate reflection of the true costs of mining barrick spokesman andy lloyd said i love the allin sustaining costs metric chuck jeannes the president and ceo of goldcorp said at the forum i think it provides transparency that we need to show what it really costs to operate a mine but we have to be aware we dont buy trucks or develop new tunnels every quarter so those costs can be kind of chunkymr jeanness disclaimer raises a good point investors still need an understanding of what it includes – and what it doesnt rather than use depreciation an incomestatement item that reflects the historical cost of a miners assets for the period it pulls capital expenditures from the cashflow statement it allows a miners management to determine what part of the periods capital spending is devoted to sustaining its existing operations versus what is instead spent on growth because the companies have discretion on what they are going to spend in any particular year and also what they are going to call growth capital versus sustaining capital that measurement is very easy to manipulate says adam graf of cowen  co theres also that more innocuous problem that mr jeannes identified mr graf gives an example of a miner that needs to build a new facility in order to maintain operations at one of its sites lets just say your cash costs for gold on that particular asset happen to be 900 an ounce well if the miner had that big expenditure this quarter because theyre building a new tailings facility the allin sustaining costs for that particular quarter could be 1800 per ounce so then the natural sort of kneejerk conclusion would be oh your allin sustaining cost is 1800 an ounce and so with gold selling at 1200 an ounce you should be shutting down this asset but the high costs may exist only for a single year mr graf said and the company could be rewarded with more production at a reduced future cost mr beristain of deutsche bank says that as gold prices have decreased miners have responded by cutting sustaining capex research and development and exploration costs lets pay attention to how the industry is achieving these cost cuts because it matters if theyre coming on the sustaining sidemr beristain also suggests investors remember that the allinclusive sustaining cost as well as the even more expansive allinclusive costs dont actually include other expenses a mining company encounters such as corporate income taxes and debt servicing a particular problem in todays highly leveraged mining world thats where aisc falls short he says you would look at todays gold world and say oh 1250 gold 1000 aisc theyre clearing 250
