sunnyvale california usanext section abstracta total of 316 toxigenic clostridium difficile clinical isolates of known pcr ribotypes from patients in north america were screened for resistance to clindamycin metronidazole moxifloxacin and rifampin clindamycin resistance was observed among 16 different ribotypes with ribotypes 017 053 and 078 showing the highest proportions of resistance all isolates were susceptible to metronidazole moxifloxacin resistance was present in 90 of pcrribotype 027 and 053 isolates but was less common among other ribotypes only 79 of the c difficile isolates were resistant to rifampin multidrug resistance clindamycin moxifloxacin and rifampin was present in 275 of pcrribotype 027 strains but was rare in other ribotypes these results suggest that antimicrobial resistance in north american isolates of c difficile varies by strain type and parallels rates of resistance reported from europe and the far east previous section next section introductionclostridium difficile is a major health careassociated pathogen that is responsible for a wide spectrum of disease ranging from mild diarrhea to lifethreatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon  19  the severity and outcome of c difficile infection cdi is influenced by a multiplicity of factors including patient demographics such as age and immune status length of hospitalization and most of all receipt of antimicrobial therapy  23 25  antimicrobial therapy often given for treatment of other infectious diseases can render the patient susceptible to cdi if the patient is exposed to a toxigenic strain of the organism when cdi was first reported in the 1970s prior use of clindamycin was established as a significant risk factor however by 1980 cephalosporins replaced clindamycin as the major risk factor  4  in the next 20 years expanded and extendedspectrum cephalosporins became associated with a high risk of cdi  6  more recently fluoroquinolones have been linked to cdi and to severe epidemics particularly those caused by pcrribotype 027  27  between 5 and 30 of patients receiving antimicrobial agents may develop health careassociated diarrhea with c difficile causing up to 30 of those cases  22  antimicrobial stewardship programs can assist in curtailing these selective pressures  17 18  the emergence of c difficile strains that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents can complicate prevention programs and potentially in the case of metronidazole treatment  13  thus knowing the prevalence of antimicrobialresistant strains in an institution can be helpful for optimizing antimicrobial stewardship programs these data were presented in part at the 111th general meeting of the american society for microbiology 21 to 24 may 2011 new orleans la previous section next section materials and methodsbacterial isolates a total of 316 toxigenic clinical isolates of c difficile were received from 7 hospitals in the united states including hospitals located in california illinois indiana north carolina and washington and canada quebec during 2008 and 2009 these isolates have been described elsewhere  32  organisms were isolated using brothenrichment toxigenic culture and typed by pcrribotyping pcrr pulsedfield gel electrophoresis pfge and restriction endonuclease analysis of wholecell dna rea the isolates were preserved at −80°c in 15 glycerol brucella broth and were subcultured twice on prereduced anaerobically sterilized pras brucella blood agar anaerobe systems morgan hill ca prior to antimicrobial susceptibility testing antimicrobial susceptibility testing isolates were tested for susceptibility to clindamycin metronidazole moxifloxacin and rifampin using etest strips bio mérieux marcylétoile france as described in the etest technical guide the mic results were rounded up to the next doubling dilution and interpreted using clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi breakpoints for susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria  8  individual colonies from 24 to 48h brucella blood agar plates were suspended in brucella broth to the turbidity of 10 mc farland standard and the inoculum was applied to 150mm brucella blood agar plates anaerobe systems morgan hill ca plates were incubated anaerobically at 35°c in a bactron anaerobic chamber sheldon manufacturing inc cornelius or mics were read and recorded at 24 h and clindamycin results were confirmed after 48 h of incubation to ensure detection of inducible resistance as per the etest package insert bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285 bacteroides thetaiotaomicron atcc 29741 and eubacterium lentum atcc 43055 were used for quality control  9  all control results were within acceptable ranges previous section next section resultsthe mic 50 and mic 90 results for clindamycin metronidazole moxifloxacin and rifampin when tested against 316 c difficile strains are presented in table 1 clindamycin resistance was present in 415 of isolates while moxifloxacin resistance was present in 380 of isolates only 79 of isolates were resistant to rifampin all isolates were susceptible to metronidazole there were no inner colonies suggestive of heteroresistance within the zones of inhibition around the metronidazole etest strips table 2 shows the mic data for the seven most common pcr ribotypes observed among the study isolates moxifloxacin resistance was present in 90 of pcrribotype 027 and 053 isolates but was less common among other ribotypes  fig 1  clindamycin resistance was observed among several ribotypes with ribotypes 017 053 and 078 showing the highest proportions of resistance 100 917 and 714 respectively rifampin resistance mic ≥ 32 μgml was observed in 275 of ribotype 027 isolates and sporadically among ribotypes 017 and 012 isolates  fig 1  overall 275 of ribotype 027 isolates were resistant to clindamycin moxifloxacin and rifampin this multidrug resistance pattern was also observed among several isolates of ribotype 017 view this table in this window in a new window table 1mic range mic 50 and mic 90 for antimicrobial agents tested against

pcr ribotypes 003 and 075 for which no resistance was observed a comparison of the proportions of resistance observed in this study and those reported in 15 other studies of c difficile resistance is shown in table 3 moxifloxacin resistance ranged from 2 to 87 a report of 82 resistance was from a single site where 69 of isolates were pulsedfield gel electrophoresis types nap1 or nap2  7  clindamycin resistance ranged from 15 to 97 the latter in a study of 1613 isolates from scotland rifampin resistance was reported infrequently and only a single metronidazoleresistant isolate was reported in these other studies view this table in this window in a new window table 3published reports of antimicrobial resistance rates in c difficile a previous section next section discussionmultidrug resistance ie resistance to clindamycin moxifloxacin and rifampin was present in 22 of 80 275 c difficile pcrribotype 027 isolates from the united states and canada but was unusual among other ribotypes  fig 1  all rifampinresistant strains were also resistant to clindamycin and moxifloxacin this is in contrast to the report of curry et al  12  in which 815 of ribotype 027 isolates from a hospital in pittsburgh were resistant to rifampin the range of antibiograms observed in our study indicates that not all ribotype 027 isolates which were obtained from seven laboratories across the united states and canada are clonal this is consistent with the data presented by killgore et al  20  which indicated that subtypes could be defined within ribotype 027 isolates by other typing techniques unfortunately rifampin resistance is rarely reported in other resistance surveys of c difficile isolates limiting comparisons to other data sets  table 3  although clindamycin and moxifloxacin resistance were both relatively common among our isolates 415 and 380 of isolates respectively clindamycin resistance was observed in all but two of the 16 ribotypes in our study where there were at least 4 isolates of that ribotype tested while moxifloxacin resistance was limited to 10 strain types yet only in ribotype 053 isolates did the two resistances appear tightly linked ie both were present in 1112 isolates the ribotype 053 strains came from four different laboratories located in california indiana illinois and north carolina and thus did not appear to be associated with a clonal outbreak of cdi overall though no resistance pattern was consistent enough to be a useful strain marker a review of antimicrobial resistance among c difficile isolates by huang et al in 2009  15 did not contain data specifically on ribotype 053 strains but did confirm high rates of clindamycin resistance in a variety of ribotypes including ribotype 017 isolates from europe there were no data on ribotypes 012 or 046 reported among other surveys of c difficile resistance not covered by huang et al ie those cited in table 3  only 7 of 15 reports showed higher rates of moxifloxacin resistance than was observed in our study but 11 of 15 showed higher rates of clindamycin resistance pcr ribotype 001 was the most common ribotype reported in these surveys followed by ribotypes 014 027 and 106 modest levels of resistance were seen among our isolates of these ribotypes as well resistance to the antimicrobial agents most commonly used to treat c difficile infections ie vancomycin and metronidazole  5 10  is reported rarely in the literature  15  however both metronidazole heteroresistance  26 and reduced susceptibility to metronidazole have been reported  2  we did not observe either of these phenomena in our study but this may have been due to the limited number of medical centers that contributed isolates to this study in summary while resistance to clindamycin and moxifloxacin is widespread in c difficile isolates from north america multidrug resistance ie resistance to clindamycin moxifloxacin and rifampin was limited primarily to ribotype 027 isolates although these antimicrobial agents are not used for therapy with the possible exception of rifaximin which is in an antimicrobial agent class related to rifampin they may still play a key role in enabling patients taking these antimicrobial agents to become colonized and infected with c difficile if exposed to these resistant strains  11  previous section next section acknowledgmentswe
