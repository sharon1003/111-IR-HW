cardiovascular emergencies mohamed elshazly mdsteven nissen mdpublished september 2014contents cardiovascular emergencies are lifethreatening disorders that must be recognized immediately to avoid delay in treatment and to minimize morbidity and mortality patients may present with severe hypertension chest pain dysrhythmia or cardiopulmonary arrest in this chapter we review the clinicians approach to these disorders and their treatments and provide links to other informative resources cardiopulmonary arrest etiology cardiopulmonary arrest is a sudden and unexpected loss of perfusing pulsatile blood flow attributable to cessation of cardiac mechanical activity it occurs as a result of a multitude of cardiovascular metabolic infectious neurologic inflammatory and traumatic diseases these diseases can be generally classified into 5 hs and 5 ts hypovolemia hypoxemia hydrogen ion acidosis hypo or hyperkalemia hypothermia tension pneumothorax tamponade toxins and thrombosis–both pulmonary and cardiac the endpoint of these disorders is commonly pulseless ventricular tachycardia vt or ventricular fibrillation vf pulseless electrical activity or asystole prevalence the incidence of outofhospital and inhospital cardiac arrests assessed by emergency medical services ems in the united states in 2013 was estimated to be 424000 and 209000 respectively among emstreated outofhospital cardiac arrests 23 had an initial rhythm of vf or vt or were shockable by an automated external defibrillator the value of early bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr and immediate defibrillation has been proven in many communitybased studies 14 in addition the increased use of automated external defibrillators by ems businesses and airports for patients with vt or vf has improved survival 58 without defibrillation mortality from vt vf or both increases by approximately 10 per minute 912diagnosis and therapy the american heart association and european society of cardiology have published revised resuscitation guidelines in 2010 71314 which included some key changes from the 2005 guidelines the new guidelines still include the major steps below activate ems or the designated code team immediately perform basic life support cpr evaluate heart rhythm and perform early defibrillation if indicated deliver advanced cardiac life support such as intubation establishment of intravenous iv access and transfer to a medical center or intensive care unit the new changes are as follows changing the airway a – breathing b – circulation c sequence to cab this change was made to emphasize the importance of rapid initiation of chest compressions because in the old guidelines significant time is potentially wasted performing airway evaluation airway evaluation and initiation of mouthtomouth breathing may be a complex timeconsuming process for the layperson and may delay chest compressions the phrase look listen and feel has also been removed from the algorithm to prevent time delays more emphasis on the quality of cpr performed including the rate and depth of compressions allowing complete chest recoil and minimizing interruptions in compressions less emphasis on pulse checks highlighting the importance of professional healthcare rescue teams performing multiple tasks during cpr such as establishing an airway or delivering advanced cardiac life support drugs pulseless vt or vfstart chest compressions as early as cardiopulmonary arrest is identified place airway device as soon as possible and confirm oxygenation and ventilation establish iv access identify rhythm and administer drugs appropriate for rhythm and condition search for and treat identified reversible causes 5 hs and 5 ts with focus on basic cpr and early defibrillation on arrival to an unwitnessed cardiac arrest or downtime longer than 4 minutes five cycles 2 min of cpr each cycle is 30 compressions at a rate of 100 compressions per minute are to be initiated before evaluation of rhythm if the cardiac arrest is witnessed or downtime is shorter than 4 minutes one shock may be administered immediately if the patient is in vf or pulseless vt followed by five cycles of cpr if the patient is in vf or pulseless vt shock the patient once using 200 j on biphasic on equivalent monophasic 360 j resume cpr immediately after attempted defibrillation beginning with chest compressions rescuers should not interrupt chest compression to check circulation eg evaluate rhythm or pulse until five cycles or 2 minutes of cpr have been completed if there is persistent or recurrent vt or vf despite several shocks and cycles of cpr perform a secondary abc survey with a focus on more advanced assessments and pharmacologic therapy pharmacologic therapy should include epinephrine 1 mg iv push repeated every 35 min or vasopressin a single dose of 40 u iv one time only consider using antiarrhythmics for persistent or recurrent pulseless vt or vf these include amiodarone lidocaine magnesium and procainamide resume cpr and attempts to defibrillate if spontaneous circulation returns start immediate postcardiac arrest care this includes optimization of oxygenation and ventilation with emphasis on avoiding hyperventilation treating hypotension by starting vasopressor infusion or inserting intraaortic balloon pump assessing neurologic status and starting induced hypothermia if indicated and assessing need for coronary reperfusion if high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome pulseless electrical activity or asystole assess the patient and begin chest compressions immediately administer epinephrine 1 mg iv push repeated every 35 min consider transcutaneous pacing if asystole conduct a secondary abc survey and consider reversible causes 5 hs and 5 ts resume immediate postcardiac arrest care if there is a return of spontaneous circulation as above bradycardia heart rate typically 50 beats per minute identify and treat underlying cause if patient is stable 5 hs and 5 ts check for serious signs of low cardiac output due to bradycardia such as hypotension altered mental status or acute heart failure if serious signs or symptoms are present begin the following intervention sequence atropine 05 mg up to a total of 3 mg ivtranscutaneous pacing if available dopamine 5 to 20 µgkgmin epinephrine 2 to 10 µmin isoproterenol 2 to 10 µmin consider glucagon for betablocker toxicity calcium infusion for calcium channel blocker toxicity if no serious signs or symptoms are present evaluate for a type ii seconddegree atrioventricular block or thirddegree atrioventricular block if neither of these types of heart block is present observe if one of these types of heart block is present prepare for transvenous pacing resume immediate postcardiac arrest care if there is a return of spontaneous circulation as above back to top hypertensive emergency definition a hypertensive emergency is an acute severe elevation in blood pressure accompanied by endorgan compromise it is usually associated with a systolic blood pressure sbp equal to or higher than 180 mm hg andor a diastolic blood pressure dbp equal to or higher than 120 mm hg 1516endorgan compromise includes acute renal failure due to nephrosclerosis ocular involvement with retinal exudates hemorrhages or papilledema hypertensive encephalopathy acute stroke or intracranial hemorrhage acute myocardial infarction aortic dissection and eclampsia hypertensive encephalopathy signals the presence of cerebral edema and loss of vascular integrity if left untreated hypertensive encephalopathy may progress to seizure and coma 1718 aortic dissection is associated with severe elevations in systemic blood pressure and wall stress requiring immediate lowering of the blood pressure and emergent surgery for type a dissection to reduce morbidity and mortality eclampsia the second most common cause of maternal death occurs from the second trimester to the peripartum period it is characterized by the presence of seizures coma or both in the setting of preeclampsia delivery remains its only cure 19etiology hypertensive emergencies result from an exacerbation of previously uncomplicated hypertension or have a secondary cause including renal vascular pregnancyrelated pharmacologic endocrine neurologic and autoimmune etiologies  box 1  box 1 causes of hypertensive emergencies essential hypertensionrenal causes renal artery stenosis glomerulonephritis vascular causes vasculitis hemolyticuremic syndrome thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura pregnancyrelated causes preeclampsia eclampsia pharmacologic causes sympathomimetics clonidine withdrawal beta blocker withdrawal cocaine amphetamines endocrine causes cushings syndrome conns syndrome pheochromocytoma reninsecreting adenomas thyrotoxicosis neurologic causes central nervous system trauma intracranial mass autoimmune cause scleroderma renal crisis prevalence the prevalence of hypertension rises substantially with increasing age in the united states and is greater among blacks than among whites in every age group 2021 based on the third national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii the prevalence of hypertension in those older than 70 years was found to be approximately 55 to 60 of the u s population 2223 a british study has revealed that less than 1 of patients with primary hypertension progress to hypertensive crisis 24 this study also showed that despite increasingly widespread therapy the number of patients presenting with hypertensive crises did not decline between 1970 and 1993 pathophysiology any syndrome that produces an acute rise in blood pressure may lead to a hypertensive crisis cerebral vasomotor autoregulation is a key facet of a patients symptomatic presentation patients without chronic hypertension generally develop hypertensive crises at a lower blood pressure than those with chronic hypertension although the process is not completely understood an initial rise in vascular resistance mediated by vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin ii acetylcholine or norepinephrine is responsible for the acute increase in blood pressure this cascade exceeds the vasodilatory response of the endothelium mediated primarily by nitric oxide mechanical destruction of the endothelium by shear stress leads to further vasoconstriction platelet aggregation inflammation and subsequent blood pressure elevation the rate at which this occurs determines the rate of increase in systemic vascular resistance as well as the acuity of a patients presentation understanding autoregulation is key to the safe management of hypertensive crises in patients with chronic hypertension the vascular bed autoregulates at higher blood pressure ranges compared with those with newly diagnosed hypertension therefore blood pressure should not be aggressively lowered in those with chronic hypertension in whom a sbp of 130 mm hg for example may cause endorgan hypoperfusion clinical evaluation the symptoms and signs of a hypertensive emergency vary widely symptoms of endorgan involvement include headache blurred vision confusion chest pain shortness of breath back pain eg aortic dissection seizures and altered consciousness 1516 physical examination should assess endorgan involvement including detailed fundoscopic neurologic and cardiovascular examinations with emphasis on the presence of congestive heart failure and bilateral upper extremity blood pressure measurements laboratory evaluation should include measurement of the complete blood count with differential and smear evaluations measurements of electrolyte blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and electrocardiography chest radiography and urinalysis treatment no large randomized clinical trials have assessed therapy in hypertensive emergency therapeutic intervention is largely a result of expert opinion all patients with endorgan involvement should be admitted for intensive monitoring and have an arterial blood pressure line placed 16pharmacologic therapy iv vasodilator therapy to achieve a decrease in mean arterial pressure map of 20 to 25 or a decrease in dbp to 100 to 110 mm hg within the first 24 hours is recommended decreasing the map and dbp further should be done more slowly over a period of days because of the risk of decreasing perfusion of end organs 16 several drugs have proved beneficial in achieving this goal table 1 table 1 intravenous vasodilator therapy for hypertensive crisis drug dosage halflife sodium nitroprusside 2510 µgkgmin 12 min nitroglycerin 5200 µgmin 35 min nicardipine 515 mgh 14 hr labetalol 20 to 80mg bolus 2 mgmin drip 26 hr enalaprilat 125 to 5mg bolus 46 hruse specifically for angiotensinconverting enzymemediated hypertensive crises such as scleroderma renal crisis it is contraindicated in pregnancy at our institution we focus on reducing shear forces and combine a betablocker with sodium nitroprusside snp in cases of marked catecholamine level elevation large doses of iv betablockers may be required to achieve blood pressure reduction an exception to this rule is the treatment of cocaineinduced hypertension for which betablockers can induce unopposed alphamediated vasoconstriction so directacting vasodilators and benzodiazepines are instead the mainstays of therapy additional considerations in addition to reducing map and dbp with medications as described above early surgical intervention for type a dissection has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality reduction in shear stress is best achieved with iv beta blockade and snp 2526iv bolus hydralazine therapy is used occasionally in some institutions and departments to treat hypertensive urgency or emergency we recommend against this practice and using extreme caution with its use given the unpredictable pharmacodynamics and unpredictable blood pressurelowering effects of iv hydralazine it can cause large abrupt drops in blood pressure which may lead to stroke and other endorgan damage iv magnesium frequently used as a tocolytic during preterm labor hydralazine a pregnancy category b drug that should be utilized cautiously as described above and labetalol category b have value in the treatment of preeclampsia and prevention of eclampsia 19 angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors category d are generally avoided during pregnancy because their use has been associated with an elevated risk of fetal congenital malformations antihypertensive therapy in the context of ischemic stroke can be controversial in cases when recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is not used 27 for such cases antihypertensive medications are generally not used during the first 24 hours as long as the sbp does not exceed 220 mm hg and the dbp does not exceed 120 mm hg this is because maintenance of a moderatelyhigh cerebral perfusion pressure theoretically could confer neurological benefits on the other hand for patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator blood pressure should be controlled sbp ≤185 mm hg and dbp ≤105 mm hg to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic conversion 27 if not already involved in the patients care the neurologystroke team should be consulted back to top aortic dissection definition figure 1 click to enlarge aortic dissection is a tear of the aortic intima that allows the shear forces of blood flow to dissect the intima from the media and in some cases penetrate the diseased media with resultant rupture and hemorrhage  fig 1  28 sixtyfive percent of dissections originate in the ascending aorta 20 in the descending aorta 10 in the aortic arch and the remainder in the abdominal aorta 2930while some older classification systems of aortic dissection such as stanford and de bakey still exist and are used they seem anachronistic in the current era of advanced imaging we recommend describing aortic dissections anatomically by location of the intimal flap the extent of vascular involvement and the organs supplied by the true andor false lumens this approach more specifically identifies the major vessels and organs involved allowing for superior anticipation of complications and improved decisionmaking the most commonly used old classification system is the stanford system a dissection that involves the ascending aorta is classified as type a and one that does not only affecting the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery is classified as type b  fig 2  dissections are further classified by chronicity as acute 2 weeks or chronic 2 weeks mortality peaks at 80 after 2 weeks and then levels off 29figure 2 click to enlarge etiology any disease that weakens the aortic media predisposes patients to dissection these include aging hypertension marfan syndrome ehlersdanlos syndrome loeysdietz syndrome bicuspid aortic valve associated with medial degeneration coarctation and turners syndrome pregnancy poses a unique risk to women with any of these diseases because of increased blood volume cardiac output and shear forces on the aorta in women younger than 40 years 50 of dissections occur in the peripartum period 31 iatrogenic trauma from catheters or intraaortic balloon pumps may initiate dissection between the aortic intima and media 32 aortic dissection can also be infrequently associated with blunt trauma or accelerationdeceleration injury as can occur in motor vehicle accidents clinical presentation most patients present with acute chest pain that peaks in intensity at onset and is often selfdescribed as tearing or ripping in nature uncommonly patients present with congestive heart failure from accompanying acute aortic valve insufficiency tamponade or both also seen are cerebrovascular accidents due to involvement of the carotid artery or vertebrobasilar system syncope from tamponade or cardiac arrest 3334 on physical examination hypertension is usually present either as the primary cause of dissection or secondary to renal artery involvement acute aortic valve insufficiency with a resultant diastolic murmur may complicate ascending dissections loss of pulse decrease in blood pressure or both often asymmetric are also found in many patients 33 dissection into the spinal arteries although rare may produce secondary paraplegia chest radiographs may reveal an abnormality in approximately 70 to 80 of patients such as a widened mediastinum or loss of the demarcation of the aortic knob pleural effusion or pulmonary edema 33 importantly a normal chest radiograph does not rule out aortic dissection the electrocardiogram ecg may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy st depression t wave inversion or st elevation when the coronary arteries are involved the right coronary ostium is involved in 1 to 2 of aortic dissection cases leading to an inferior myocardial infarction diagnosis it is essential to recognize several key signs in the imaging of aortic dissection because they dramatically affect treatment and outcome involvement of the ascending aorta location of dissection flap intimal tear and the major vessels involved presence of pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade involvement of coronary ostia the sensitivity of computed tomography angiography cta for detecting aortic dissection is approximately 83 to 100 and its specificity ranges from 87 to 100 depending on the study 3536 in the current age of ecggated cta the sensitivity and specificity for detecting dissections approaches 100 and thus it is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice transesophageal echocardiography has a sensitivity of approximately 98 however its lower specificity of 77 to 97 reflects differences in operator experience 3036 magnetic resonance imaging has a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 98 for detection of dissection but its lack of portability limited access and long duration of imaging make this a less favorable option in the care of acute aortic dissection 37 choice of testing should be based on the medical centers expertise hemodynamic stability of the patient and access to the imaging modality 3537treatment surgery surgical therapy is the best option for acute aortic dissection involving the ascending aorta studies have shown that delaying surgical intervention even to carry out left heart catheterization aortography or both results in worse outcomes 3840 mortality increases by 1 per hour while waiting for surgery surgical repair in patients with type b dissection is generally reserved for those with endorgan compromise or those who do not respond to medical therapy medical therapy medical therapy should be initiated in all patients with acute dissection reductions of shear force and blood pressure should be the primary goals betablockers should be given intravenously and titrated to the desired effect in our institution we typically start by using boluses of iv metoprolol to achieve a heart rate of 50 to 60 beatsmin which may require very high doses of 200 to 1000 mg we then add snp if needed because of its rapid onset and ease of titration aiming for a map of 65 to 75 mm hg in the hypotensive patient diagnoses of pericardial tamponade aortic rupture aortic insufficiency myocardial infarction or a combination of these should be suspected and tested for volume replacement and early surgical intervention should be pursued pericardiocentesis should be avoided if tamponade is present because immediate surgical intervention is the therapy of choice if hypotension persists norepinephrine and phenylephrine are the vasopressors of choice because of their limited effects on increasing cardiac contractility endovascular stenting a rapidly growing field remains investigational in this acute setting and is sometimes used in very highrisk surgical patients with type b aortic dissections or aneurysms back to top acute pulmonary edema definition acute pulmonary edema is an emergency that necessitates admission to the hospital it has two major forms cardiogenic and noncardiogenic we focus on cardiogenic pulmonary edema which generally is more reversible than the noncardiogenic form cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from an absolute increase in left atrial pressure with resultant increases in pulmonary capillary and venous pressures in the setting of normal capillary permeability this increased pressure causes extravasation of fluid into the alveoli and overwhelms the ability of the pulmonary lymphatics to drain the fluid thus impairing gas exchange in the lung 4142etiology and pathophysiology left ventricular systolic dysfunction left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and obstruction of the left atrial outflow tract are the primary causes of increased left atrial pressure left ventricular systolic dysfunction is the most common cause of cardiogenic pulmonary edema 41 this dysfunction can be the result of coronary artery disease hypertension valvular heart disease cardiomyopathy toxins endocrinologic or metabolic causes or infections diastolic dysfunction results in impaired left ventricular filling and elevation in left ventricular enddiastolic pressure in addition to myocardial ischemia left ventricular hypertrophy hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and infiltrative or restrictive cardiomyopathy are all causes of diastolic dysfunction left atrial outflow obstruction is often a result of valvulopathy such as mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation but also can be caused by tumors atrial myxoma dysfunctional prosthetic valves thrombus and cor triatriatum it is imperative to distinguish between mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis given their very different treatments diagnosis pulmonary edema is diagnosed by the presence of various signs and symptoms including tachypnea tachycardia crackles reflecting alveolar edema hypoxia secondary to alveolar edema and the s 3 or s 4 heart sounds individually or in combination additionally if hypertension is present it may represent diastolic dysfunction decreased left ventricular compliance decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance the presence of increased jugular venous pressure indicates increased right ventricular filling pressure secondary to right ventricular or left ventricular dysfunction finally the presence of peripheral edema indicates a certain degree of chronicity to the patients condition laboratory data associated with pulmonary edema include hypoxemia on arterial blood sampling and a chest radiograph showing bilateral perihilar edema and cephalization of pulmonary vascular marking cardiomegaly pleural effusion or both may be present twodimensional transthoracic echocardiography is usually helpful in the acute setting to assess biventricular size and function to identify valvular stenosis or regurgitation and to determine the presence or absence of pericardial pathology the ecg may reflect ongoing ischemia injury tachycardia and atrial or ventricular hypertrophy in many cases differentiating cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can be challenging and requires the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter to measure the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure treatment mainstays of immediate therapy include improving oxygen delivery to end organs decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption increasing venous capacitance decreasing preload and afterload with careful attention to map and avoiding hemodynamic compromise all patients should receive supplemental oxygen to maximize hemoglobin oxygen saturation administration of continuous positive airway pressure can increase gas exchange and may perhaps decrease preload via increased intrathoracic pressure 4344 in our experience however repeated attempts to improve oxygenation with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation often prove inadequate in such cases restoration of oxygenation is best achieved via prompt endotracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation pharmacologic therapy the pharmacologic agents most commonly used in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema are nitroglycerin snp and diuretics 45nitroglycerin acts immediately to decrease preload and afterload 46 it should be used for the management of patients with pulmonary edema who are not hypotensive sublingual administration allows rapid delivery which is often required to decrease preload iv administration of nitroglycerin also should be used in the nonhypotensive patient and based on symptoms titrated to a map of approximately 70 to 75 mm hg snp is an effective vasodilator that is often required for the treatment of the hypertensive patient with pulmonary edema 47 due to the rapid and potent effects of snp its use requires continuous invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure the issues of methemoglobinemia cyanide and thiocyanate toxicity rarely become significant but since patients receiving continuous infusions will often develop tachyphylaxis—a progressive resistance to the drugs effects—frequent blood testing is necessary snp should be used with caution in the setting of hepatic dysfunction since the liver is responsible for transformation of the cyanide radical into thiocyanate patients with renal dysfunction will tend to accumulate thiocyanate more rapidly than those with normal kidney function since thiocyanate is excreted in the urine finally through its effects on coronary arteriolar resistance vessels snp can potentially cause coronary steal drawing blood flow away from ischemic myocardium we generally coadminister nitroglycerin along with snp to dilate conductance vessels and lessen this theoretical risk iv diuretics are most helpful for the treatment of volume overload in chronic congestive heart failure their vasodilative and diuretic properties also are useful in the management of pulmonary edema diuretics should be used with caution in the euvolemic patient to avoid compromising cardiac output and oxygen delivery iv morphine can be used in certain select patients to decrease their air hunger anxiety and sympathetic tone which can in turn help reduce their afterload back to top summary cardiovascular emergencies are common in the practice of medicine and quick action is necessary cardiopulmonary arrest has several possible causes all of which require prompt resuscitative efforts the 2010 american heart association guidelines have proposed changes that make chest compressions a priority before assessment of airway and breathing in order to minimize time delays all healthcare professionals need to be aware of these changes hypertensive emergency causes endorgan damage and warrants admission for intensive monitoring including continuous arterial blood pressure measurement and treatment aortic dissection categorized as stanford type a requires emergent surgery whereas type b is generally managed medically unless endorgan damage can be demonstrated acute pulmonary edema should be treated by improving oxygen delivery to end organs decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption and safely
