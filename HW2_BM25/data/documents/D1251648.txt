tingling in feet and legstingling in feet and legs tingling legs tingling in feet and legs is a sign that tissue is starved of either blood or nervous input sitting with your legs crossed places pressure on the femoral artery starving the tissues in the lower legs of oxygen the result tingling legs the cure uncross your legsmore commonly the source of the tingling is an irritated or frankly pinched nerve it could be in the brain or spinal cord but more usually the site of injury is where the nerve emerges from the spine in the buttock or the groin two main nerves supplying the legs sciatic nerve the sciatic nerve belongs the very lowermost part of your lumbar spine coursing via the buttock to the leg and foot femoral nerve the femoral nerve on the other hand emerges from rather higher in the lumbar spine and courses through the groin to the top of the upper leg and inner lower leg sciaticas1 nerve root it helps your chiropractor if you can tell himher precisely where your tingling in feet and legs is for example does the tingling go to the side of your foot however whilst for 75 of people a sciatica from the l5s1 joint will go down the back of the thigh and leg and to the side of the foot less commonly see the yellow and green patterns it may mimic a sciatica from the l4l5 joint and go down the side of the leg thus one can not be certain of which disc is effected by the dermatomal pattern a careful physical examination of the spine is in order sometimes because not uncommonly degenerative change occurs at several levels an mri is necessary to confirm with absolute certainty at which level the offending lesion is to be found that is causing tingling in feet and legs irritated nerves in the lumbar spine by aslipped disk lumbar facet syndrome  lumbar stenosis may causetinglingpain andpossibly weakness in the legs and feet the most common sciatica refers to the outside of the foot and the small toe if there is weakness you will have difficulty standing on one foot and raising your heel from the ground try it hold onto a chair stand on one leg and raise your heel repeatedly you should be able to do it without any sign of fatigue or shaking of the lower leg an s1 sciatica may make this difficult in my opinion everyone should be doing some gentle lumbar exercises because we all sit too much and almost the whole population will experience acute low back pain at some stage of their lives but this is vitally important if you have tingling in the feet and legs tapping on the achilles tendon tests the integrity of the s1 nerve to determine if it could be the cause of tingling legs l5 nerve root the l5 nerve root is most commonly affected by the l4l5 disc joint though the nerve emerges at one level lower the tingling in feet and legs andor pain is more commonly on the side of the lower leg and the great toe though it can affect the side of the thigh too if there is weakness you will be unable to lift your great toe off the ground this means that you may trip as you walk as you foot isnt lifted properly in the swing phase is your leg tingling and do you also have weakness l4 nerve root the l4 nerve root is less commonly the cause of tingling in feet and legs and when it does its a real bugger in my experience it responds less well to manipulation and better to flexiondisctraction it shares slips with both the sciatic and the femoral nerves the knee jerk reflex may be reduced and weakness can affect the major flexor of the knee the quadriceps muscle the result is a profound limp and weakness on stairclimbing as well as a leg tingling femoral neuritisless frequently troublesome than the sciatic nerve the femoral nerve typically causes pain in the groin and front part of the thigh and weakness of the quadriceps muscle so does hip arthritis so careful examination is paramount meralgia paresthetica then there are some
