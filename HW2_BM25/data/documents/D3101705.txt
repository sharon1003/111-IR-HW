a jumbo loan also known as a jumbo mortgage is a form of home financing for whose amount exceeds the conforming loan limits set by the federal housing finance agency fhfa as a result unlike conventional mortgages it is not eligible to be purchased guaranteed or securitized by fannie mae or freddie mac designed to finance luxury properties and homes in highly competitive local real estate markets jumbo mortgages come with unique underwriting requirements and tax implications jumbo mortgages are gaining traction as the housing market continues to recover following the great recession how big is a jumbo mortgage at what price does a mortgage exceed conventionalconforming and cross over into jumbo it varies by state and even county the fhfa sets the conforming loan limit size for different areas on an annual basis though it changes infrequently in fact the 2017 maximum limit for oneunit properties of 424100 for most of the country is the first acrosstheboard baseline increase since 2006 currently a mortgage in excess of 424100 is considered a jumbo loan in the vast majority of the continental u s however the conforming limit is higher in areas with steep home prices in the highest of these “highcost zones” a jumbo is a loan above 636150 here’s a look at how it breaks down there are approximately 3143 counties in the continental united states out of those 2916 have a loan limit of 424100 in 2017 only 108 counties have a loan limit of 636150 including new york city los angeles and san francisco the majority of highcost areas are in california – which is no surprise considering that the golden state is home to some of the most expensive housing markets in the country there are also 115 u s counties with loan limits that are higher than 424100 but lower than 636150 for instance the conforming limit in fairfield county conn is set at 601450 in suffolk county mass home to boston the limit is 598000 loan limits are often even higher outside of the continental u s in fact the limits in hawaii’s five counties range between 636150 and 721050 hawaii along with alaska guam and the virgin islands is allowed to have higher conforming limits for a

a bank account – youre probably going to require a jumbo mortgage and if you’re trying to land one you’ll face much more rigorous credit requirements than homeowners applying for a conventional loan that’s because jumbo loans carry more credit risk for the lender due to their lack of a fannie mae or freddie mac guarantee as mentioned above and of course because more money is involved as with mortgages in general minimum requirements for a jumbo have gotten increasingly stringent since 2008 to get approved you’ll need a stellar credit score – 700 and above —and a superlow debttoincome dti ratio – under 43 at least and preferably closer to 36 although they’re nonconforming mortgages jumbos often still must fall within the guidelines of what the consumer financial protection bureau considers a “ qualified mortgage ” a lending system with standardized terms and rules such as the 43 dti you’ll need to prove you have accessible cash on hand to cover your jumbo mortgage payments which are likely to be very high if you opt for a standard 30year fixedrate mortgage specific income levels and reserves depend on the size of the overall loan but all borrowers need pay stubs dating back 30 days and w2 tax forms stretching back two years if youre selfemployed the income requirements are greater two years of tax returns and at least 60 days of current bank statements the borrower also needs to prove that he or she has the liquid assets to qualify and cash reserves equal to six months of the mortgage payments and all applicants have to show proper documentation on all other loans held and proof of ownership of nonliquid assets like other real estate how much you can ultimately borrow depends of course on your assets your credit score and the value of the property youre interested in buying for further information see too much debt for a mortgage jumbo loan rates on the bright side while jumbo mortgages used to carry higher interest rates than conventional mortgages because of the larger amount of money involved and because it can take longer to sell a higherpriced home if the lender must foreclose  that gap has been closing in recent years today the average annual percentage rate apr for a jumbo mortgage is often par with conventional mortgages — and in some cases actually lower otherwise banks may charge from 025 to 15 more interest on a jumbo loan even though the governmentsponsored enterprises cant handle them jumbo loans are often securitized by other financial institutions since these securities carry more risk they trade at a yield premium to conventional securitized mortgages however of late this spread has been reduced with the interest rate of the loans themselves down payment on jumbo loans on the even brighter side down payment requirements have loosened over the same time period in the past jumbo mortgage lenders often required home buyers to put up 30 of the residences purchase price compared to 20 in conventional mortgages now that figure has fallen as low as 10 to 15 bear in mind though there can be various advantages to making a higher down payment – among them to avoid the cost of private mortgage insurance see private mortgage insurance avoid it for these 6 reasons  you could attribute all these low rates for interest and down payments to the fact that banks are generally very eager to find new customers for their jumbo loan packages jumbo mortgage borrowers are likely to be or are on the road to becoming the sort of high net worth individuals institutions love to sign up for longterm products such clients have an excellent credit history plenty of assets and often the need for additional wealth management and investment services down the road plus its more practical for a bank to administer a single 2 million mortgage than 10 200000 mortgages who should get a jumbo loan these mortgages are considered most appropriate for a segment of highincome earners who make between 250000 and 500000 a year this segment is known as henry an acronym for high earners not rich yet it refers to people who generally make a lot of money but dont have millions in extra cash or other assets accumulated – yet while an individual in the henry segment may not have amassed the wealth to purchase an expensive new home with cash such highincome individuals do usually have better credit scores and more extensively established credit histories than the average home buyer seeking a conventional mortgage loan for a lower amount along with having more wellestablished credit highincome earners also tend to have more solidly established retirement accounts they have often been contributing to such investment accounts for a longer period of time than lowerincome earners they have usually contributed more funds to such accounts so that the account balances represent substantial sums the tax implications of a jumbo loan just because you could qualify for one of these loans doesnt mean you should take it you certainly shouldnt if you are counting on it furnishing you with a substantial tax break for example you’re probably aware that you can deduct from your taxes the mortgage interest you paid for any given year but you probably never had to worry about the cap the irs places on this deduction you can deduct the interest as long as the mortgage itself is 1 million or less if your mortgage is larger you dont get the full deduction for example if you took out a 2 million jumbo mortgage that accrues 60000 in interest a year you can only deduct 30000 – the interest on the first million of your mortgage so you only get a tax break on half the mortgage interest in effect and even though jumbos interest rates are coming more into line with conventional mortgages it still might behoove you to crunch numbers and compare terms to see if taking out two smaller conforming loans instead of one big jumbo might prove better for your finances in the long haul related articles
