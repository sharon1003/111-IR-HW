bloodborne hepatitis hbv hcv and hdvhepatitis b hbv hepatitis c hcv and hepatitis d hdv are all transmitted through exposure to infected blood exposure to hbv and hcv can also occur from sexual contact with infectious seminal and vaginal secretions these forms of viral hepatitis cause signs and symptoms similar to influenza including decreased appetite nausea vomiting fever weakness malaise muscle aches and jaundice the severity of symptoms varies widely ranging from mild to debilitating hepatitis b hbv is the most common form of bloodborne hepatitis and an important healthcare occupational pathogen hbv is 50100 times more infectious than the hiv virus which produces aids  hbv has been detected in blood and blood products seminal fluid vaginal secretions breast milk tears and saliva hbv vaccination standard precautions and appropriate postexposure management are have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of occupational transmission the onset of hbv is usually gradual and the majority of infected persons recover within six months however 5 to 10 of patients with hbv infection develop chronic hepatitis or become carriers chronic hepatitis increases the risk of developing cirrhosis primary hepatocellular carcinoma and fulminant hepatitis which is almost always fatal chronic hepatitis is an inflammatory reaction of the liver that lasts for more than 6 months fulminant hepatic failure is massive liver cell death within 2 months of the development of acute hepatitis death occurs in 80 of patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to gastrointestinal bleeding sepsis brainstem compression from cerebral edema or multisystem failure people with hbv can also become carriers of the virus and can transmit it to others approximately 12 million americans are chronic carriers of hbv persons in high risk groups such as health care and hemodialysis workers homosexually active men iv drug users household and sexual contacts of hbv carriers iv drug users refugees from endemic areas prison inmates and infants born to women who are hbv carriers should receive hbv vaccine which provides active immunity for up to 5 years the occupational safety and health administration requires that health care facilities offer the hbv vaccine to those employees with jobs that require exposure to blood blood products or other potentially infectious materials instant feedback chronic hbv infection increases an individuals risk of developing cirrhosis and primary liver cancer true or falsenew drugs are being used to treat chronic hbv please visit this site and look for the answer to this question please name two drugs that are being used to treat hbv hint one of the drugs is l and the other drug a is used for people who are resistant to the first drug hepatitis c was identified in 1989 prior to that time because it could not be classified as either hepatitis a or b it was referred to as nona nonb hepatitis hcv is usually mild in its early stages and is rarely recognized until it has caused significant liver damage hcv is a significant public health problem both in the u s and worldwide hcv in combination with hbv now accounts for 75 of all cases of liver disease around the world and hcv infection is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the united states hcv is difficult for the immune system to combat unlike most other forms of hepatitis more than 80 of patients infected with hcv develop a chronic infection that leads to serious and potentially fatal liver disease the cycle of disease from infection to potential liver failure can take 20 or more years for more than six months following initial infection the disease is virtually undetectable many cases of hcv are undiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to flulike illness people who have hcv are often identified when they have elevated liver enzymes during a routine blood test or because a positive hcv antibody is found when they donate blood at present there is no vaccine to prevent hcv most patients with hcv contracted the disease through blood transfusions in the 1970s and 1980s improved blood testing since 1993 has reduced the risk to less than 1 however anyone who had a blood transfusion prior to that time is at risk for having been infected other risk factors for contracting hcv include tattooing acupuncture and other body piercing practices using nonsterile means needlestick injuries blood spills exposed non intact skin contaminated medical equipment iv drug use heterosexual or homosexual activity with multiple sex partners day to day contact with an infected household member almost any direct or indirect exposure to infected blood can transmit hcv in about 10 of cases no specific risk factor can be identified it extremely important for the patient with hcv to prevent stressing an already damaged liver it is especially important to avoid any form of alcohol as studies have shown that alcohol significantly increases liver damage in hcv patients patients with hcv may also consult with their physicians and pharmacists to eliminate many overthecounter andor prescription drugs that can increase liver damage patients with hcv often struggle with the social stigma of having hepatitis traditionally hepatitis has been seen as a disease of alcoholics and the poor because of the long course of hcv infection patients may have long life expectancies and with appropriate treatment may recover from the hcv infection instant feedback patients who have hcv should abstain from alcohol true or falsethe hepatitis d hdv virus is sometimes referred to as incomplete or defective because it requires the host be infected with hbv before it to replicate hdv is obliged to use enzymes produced by hbv to reproduce patients who have hbvhdv coinfection frequently have severe disease which may progress to fulminant hepatitis interferon may be beneficial in approximately 50 of patients with hbvhdv hdv is primarily seen in iv drug users people who have received multiple blood transfusions and people from south america africa the middle east and italy where the disease is endemic blood tests are used to diagnose hav hbv hcv and hdv because these tests detect specific antibodies they can determine whether a patient is acutely ill has chronic infection or is recovering from the disease treatment of acute hepatitis is primarily symptomatic and includes interventions to help relieve muscle pain gastrointestinal distress and pruritis malnourished or severely anorexic patients may need vitamin supplements a low fat easily digested diet is useful for patients with diarrhea nausea and vomiting patients recovering from acute hepatitis should avoid strenuous physical exertion and hepatotoxic agents such as acetaminophen and alcohol the chronic form of hbv is treated with corticosteroids interferon and drugs such as acyclovir chronic hcv is treated with interferon or a combination of interferon and rabavirin there are a number of health care practices that individuals can follow to avoid developing hbv hcv and hdv important prevention measures include practicing safe sex cleaning up blood spills promptly with bleach and avoiding sharing razors toothbrushes nail clippers or needles when getting a manicure a tattoo or having any body part pierced it important to ensure that the instruments used are sterile rn ceus homepage  course catalog  discount prices  login  nursing jobs  help
