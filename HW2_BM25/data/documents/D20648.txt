what to stream now october 28 2016 543 pm in a tom hanks mood here’s a viewing guide to all 43 of his movies by will leitch and tim grierson share tweet you might say there’s a unified theory of hanks the actor contains multitudes but is always tom hanks as a result he’s often accused of playing one character the fundamentally decent goodhearted noble but humble allamerican everyman there’s some truth to this of course — hanks wouldn’t work as travis bickle no matter how hard he tried but it’s not fair to paint hanks as playing the same character over and over and it certainly wouldn’t be fair to say that he doesn’t challenge himself or take chances hanks has transformed himself from the partydude of bachelor party to the romantic lead of sleepless in seattle to the war hero of saving private ryan to the six different characters he plays amusingly in cloud atlas the guy might only play a certain number of notes but he always manages to make them sound unique all of his movies can be grouped into seven different categories though and if you’re in the mood for the sort of entertainment only a hanks movie can provide this guide is a good jumpingoff point we’ve arranged his filmography into buckets based on the sort of hanks performance you can expect ranked the movies within each grouping and indicated where you can find them on streaming to see inferno and sully you’ll have to head to a theater we’ve also indicated in parentheses where each title falls in our overall rank of tom hanks movies in case you’re simply looking for the best of the best a note we limited our guide to liveaction movies only meaning hanks’s superb turns in the three toy story films aren’t on the list it goes without saying that there’s never a bad time to watch a toy story movie hanks as wacky bosom buddies guy hanks broke out as a comedic leading man straight from the sitcom world and it’s worth noting that the tom hanks character in the ‘80s was much more elastic and clownish than the one we see today but even during that period you could see him evolving big 1988 rank 6 this was the one that made everybody realize oh hanks isn’t just a comedy guy he could maybe be the biggest movie star in the world as the boy who gets his wish to be big hanks gives a glorious hilarious and sweet performance as a 12yearold in a grownup’s body he’s limber and wild and untethered — it’s one of his best physical comedy performances — but he never lets you forget there’s a scared little kid in there hanks didn’t win best actor for this performance even though the movie was a huge hit which was seen by many at the time as a sign that comedy was never going to be given a break by the academy nevertheless this performance is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu splash 1984 rank 11 a massive hit that essentially launched the film careers of hanks daryl hannah and ron howard splash is funny and sharp particularly when it takes its fishoutofwater premise literally and lets hannah’s mermaid try to interact with mid’80s new york city there are some parts that might be called “problematic” today — and there’s always been an argument that hanks and sidekick john candy should have switched roles — but this as much anything else was what initially sold everyone on hanks even when he’s being a jerk and he’s a jerk a lot in the movie you can’t help but be on his side available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu punchline 1988 rank 22punchline confused audiences and critics when it came out because it was a movie about standup comedy that was not all that funny that was by design though and the film has aged better than you might think hanks plays a struggling standup comedian who comes across a housewife sally field trying out on openmic nights who turns out to be pretty good hanks resents her success but also cares for her — and as the movie hints he has some emotional instability issues of his own hanks isn’t much of a standup comic — you never buy that he’s any good — but he gets at the desperation at the heart of showbiz it’s a better performance and movie than people appreciated at the time available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu bachelor party 1984 rank 26 your mileage is going to vary on a lot of the tom hanks disposable lead of dopey ’80s comedies entries but this one is definitely one of the silliest dumbest and amusingly most eternal there are movies from this time period that hanks can hide from now but this is definitely not one of them after all this is a movie in which a donkey does cocaine don’t see that every day available to rent on amazon dragnet 1987 rank 27 the closest hanks will ever come to playing poochie the skateboarding dog from the simpsons hanks is the young “cool” cop contrasting with dan aykroyd’s joe friday impression and he has as much fun as you can in a silly movie in which aykroyd considers himself the star the major takeaway is a deeply disturbing “rap” video aykroyd and hanks made to promote the film watch at your own peril “i’m here tonight to rap about your rights” yikes available to rent on amazon i tunes turner  hooch 1989 rank 32 the buddy copwithadog movie that despite being a hit famously inspired hanks to start reevaluating his career — making the pivot that would win him multiple oscars — turner  hooch isn’t that terrible well it’s not any worse than tango  cash how about that however proceed with caution if you get sad when a dog dies in a movie you will cry a lot er spoiler alert available with subscription on netflix to rent on amazon i tunes vudu volunteers 1985 rank 33 it’s tough for hanks to play a jerk but he’s definitely a snobby jerk in this nicholas meyer comedy about a rich kid who has to escape angry creditors pursuing a gambling debt by joining the peace corps there’s not much here — it was the end of an aborted hanksandcandy comedy team — but it is where hanks met his wife rita wilson so there’s that available with subscription on hbo to rent on amazon nothing in common 1986 rank 34 hanks plays an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down — this is the exact description of many hanks roles at this time — when his parents jackie gleason and eva marie saint get divorced and he has to take care of both of them this is highconcept and tiresome and gleason in particular hams it up every time he’s onscreen but this was the start of hanks’s pivot toward a more “serious” screen persona he’s not particularly funny in the film he’s trying to play this one straight nothing in common wasn’t the appropriate vehicle for that but the instinct was right available to rent on amazon vudu i tunes the ’burbs 1989 rank 35 a theoretically “dark” comedy about a bored suburban dad who begins to think his neighbors are murderers there’s a lot to be mined here but hanks and his director joe dante — who would go on to till this field far better in other movies — go way too broad way too often the movie dissolves into nonsense by the end in 1989 hanks made this and that dog movie … and then wisely moved in a whole new direction available with subscription on netflix to rent on i tunes the money pit 1986 rank 38 there were times early on when hanks’s whitebread geniality would be forced to do too much of the heavy lifting and this strained comedy with shelley long is a great example the onejoke premise is that the dream house hanks and long have bought is falling apart and the movie keeps trying to find new ways to make that exact point with diminishing results hanks doesn’t look bored with this lane yet but he is starting to seem a little exhausted available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu the man with one red shoe 1985 rank 41 an instantly forgettable “comedy thriller” in which hanks plays a doofus concert pianist thrust clumsily into a murder mystery he’s clearly dialed up a little too high in order to carry a thin empty premise but still check out the supporting cast dabney coleman charles durning jim belushi edward herrmann and a finallydoneplayingleia for another 30 years anyway carrie fisher available with subscription on hbo to rent on amazon vudu i tunes he knows you’re alone 1981 rank 42 hanks’s movie debut was a slasher film that’s an obvious halloween knockoff right down to the mask and music it’s cheapo schlock but it’ll live forever because of hanks’s appearance as a student who’s skeptical that the protagonist is really being stalked his dialogue clearly sets him up to be murdered but the filmmakers liked him so much that they decided to let his character live even in his first movie hanks was charming everybody available to rent on amazon i tunes hanks as romantic lead the hanks your mom loves the hanks that will line the shelves of walmart well past a nuclear holocaust sleepless in seattle 1993 rank 10 if movies like sleepless in seattle were all hanks ever made we wouldn’t hold the actor in such high esteem and yet c’mon it’s so hard to resist him as sam the puppydog widower who will fall for a newspaper reporter meg ryan with a fondness for an affair to remember sprinkled with fairy dust and charm by late director nora ephron sleepless in seattle is the epitome of feelgood wishfulfillment hollywood love stories and hanks gives it a grounding that it very much needs he’s sensitive and appealing — as unthreatening as the nice guy next door with a decency and cuteness that made him crushworthy available to rent on amazon vudu i tunes joe versus the volcano 1990 rank 16 john patrick shanley’s funky offkilter romantic comedy was a little too weird for audiences at the time but it has aged well this story of a man hanks who decides to kill himself by throwing himself into a volcano before being interrupted by a series of increasingly odd events has its own goofy rhythm that hanks steadies and smooths out though maybe a little too much the fact that hanks toplined the movie may have given the impression of its being more conventional that it is causing people to reject it outright it’s worth a revisit available to rent on amazon i tunes you’ve got mail 1998 rank 18 sleepless costars hanks and ryan went back to the romcom well in 1998 with lesser results hanks gets to play the romantic hero with a little bit more of an edge this time — he’s a bigtime bookstoreconglomerate ceo trying to shut down cute meg ryan’s little independent bookstore — but he’s still gooey in the middle and easily palatable to the older white audience that ate this up suffice it to say the aolcentric narrative hasn’t aged well but hey … is that dave chappelle available with subscription on amazon to rent on amazon i tunes vudu larry crowne 2011 rank 28 hanks’s second film as director was a bust a wellintentioned look at workingclass americans who were rocked by the 2008 financial collapse that was patronizing and glib he plays larry a normal joe who gets fired from his walmartlike job and has to reinvent himself falling in love with julia roberts’s college professor in the process larry crowne is the sort of movie that makes you understand why conservatives go off on tirades about outoftouch liberal hollywood stars there isn’t a whiff of reality to this story and hanks is like an alien trying to play an everyman — he’s rarely seemed so uncomfortable and unconvincing available with subscription on netflix to rent on amazon vudu i tunes every time we say goodbye 1986 rank 37 this was hanks’s first attempt at “stretching” in a saccharine love story set during world war ii in which he plays a soldier who loses his true love hanks hadn’t quite figured out how to calibrate comedy vs serious yet so he responds to this “serious” challenge by basically shutting down his charisma altogether he would get much better at finding the balance available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu experimental hanks hanks is a more ambitious actor than he might appear he’s aware you think he’s playing the same character every time out and knows sometimes he has to surprise us forrest gump 1994 rank 3 this best picture winner’s litany of famous lines — “run forrest run” “life is like a box of chocolates” “jenny” — risks reducing the movie to a series of quotables as simple as the man hanks played to earn his second oscar but the beauty of his performance is in how it both satirizes a divisive period in american history while also underlining the sincerity and optimism that’s always been part of our national character sure that’s a corny notion but it took an actor who could transform that sentimentality into something stirring and true and nobody on the planet was better suited for the role than hanks available with subscription on netflix to rent on amazon vudu i tunes cast away 2000 rank 4 the closest hanks has gotten to a robert de niro–like physical transformation cast away found the star playing a fed ex executive who goes through a personal metamorphosis after he’s the lone survivor of a plane crash taking time off from shooting so that he could lose a massive amount of weight for the island sequences hanks exudes the sense of spiritual isolation that first maroons the character but then gives him a new reason to go on living this might be his most intimate and elemental performance his primary scene partner being a volleyball and hanks finds a raw slightly terrifying urgency within his goodguy persona that suggests that even the best of us have a breaking point available to rent on amazon vudu i tunes philadelphia 1993 rank 13 no matter the good intentions of everyone involved in this activist drama — to say nothing of its social importance — there’s no denying that philadelphia isn’t exactly scintillating cinema the same goes for hanks’s performance as a lawyer diagnosed with aids to be sure it’s lovely and full of feeling but he risks making andrew beckett almost too saintly which made some sense in an era when homosexuality was viewed as a scary “other” hanks’s natural likability attacked that bigotry directly and for that the performance remains incredibly meaningful but andrew is more symbol than great character — a significant timecapsule relic slightly diminished by the fortunate evolution of human thinking about sexuality and aids available with subscription on amazon to rent on amazon i tunes vudu road to perdition 2002 rank 21 a hit man with soul michael sullivan must protect his son future everybody wants some star tyler hoechlin after the mob wants to rub them both out road to perdition got a lot of press at the time for the fact that hey look hanks is playing a bad guy of course the character isn’t really bad he’s a gruff but concerned parent who lives by a strict moral code director sam mendes’s period crime film is suffocated by its finely manicured production design and gorgeous conrad hall cinematography which gives the actors very little room to breathe as a result we get an intriguing curveball of a performance from hanks but not a great or even a particularly revealing one available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu a hologram for the king 2016 rank 23 hanks provides some pathos to his role as a washedup american businessman trying to close a deal in saudi arabia but a hologram for the king can’t escape the fact that it’s approximately the 1428721st drama about a depressed middleaged white guy at a spiritual crossroads the star brings his all but the whole enterprise is hamstrung from the start — although hanks gets to show off his romantic leadingman side for the first time in a while opposite a very appealing sarita choudhury available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu hanks as plugin studio lead when you’re the biggest movie star in the world as hanks was for a few years you just get cast as the lead in movies just because you’re the biggest movie star in the world sometimes it’s a fit sometimes less so the green mile 1999 rank 15 the green mile is the sort of bloated awardsbait that doesn’t work at all unless you’ve got somebody like tom hanks piloting the ship even then he can only do so much with the role of paul edgecomb a predictably goodhearted prison guard who befriends michael clarke duncan’s deathrow prisoner with strange powers the syrup is pretty thick in this threehourplus  frank darabont adaptation of a stephen king inspirational drama and thankfully hanks steered away from this kind of mawkishness in subsequent years soon he’d be traveling into weirder and darker terrain available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu the da vinci code 2006 rank 30 hanks and ron howard’s adaptation of dan brown’s blockbuster novel is bythenumbers and uninspired but it’s professionally done in a way that’s mostly inoffensive still these are two ambitious and creative people and it feels like a waste to have them going through the paces of this sort of hackery available with subscription on netflix to rent on amazon i tunes vudu the polar express 2004 rank 31 amazingly this is one of two movies in which hanks plays six characters the technologically groundbreaking but narratively uneven polar express animates chris van allsburg’s children’s book through what was a fancy new innovation at the time motioncapture the deadeyed look of the film’s characters still haunts our dreams but we also object to hanks’s overly cutesy performances as the conductor santa claus and others it’s a fine line when acting in a movie that’s meant to be magical you get the balance wrong and the whole thing ends up feeling aggressively adorable and selfsatisfied available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu inferno 2106 rank 39 the robert langdon movies are generally hanks at his worst — not bad necessarily but his most complacent and going through the motions — and while this one isn’t the worst of the bunch he doesn’t give it much extra oomph as our colleague jackson mc henry noted inferno provides a slight twist on “the young woman following robert langdon through historical landmarks” formula but not in any way that justifies its existence please let hanks be done with these now in theaters now the bonfire of the vanities 1990 rank 40 “i did everything i could to make it work” hanks said in 1992 about this brian de palma debacle “and the fallout from it was that it makes you reflect for a while you question yourself but what can you do you take your shots and you swing away” yes this adaptation of tom wolfe’s zeitgeisty novel was a failure but it’s an interesting failure in lots of ways not least of which is watching hanks trying to play the story’s masteroftheuniverse wall street operative he has the character’s allamerican features but not the toxic spirit which fatally wounds the entire film it’s but one problem with a highprofile bust that at least inspired a pretty good behindthescenes tellall available with subscription on hbo to rent on amazon i tunes vudu angels and demons 2009 rank 43 hanks always looks a little ridiculous in these movies — and they’ve always felt like his one way to assure himself a studio hit outside the toy story movies they’re the only sequels he has ever done — but this one is preposterous and flimsy hanks gives lowkey performances all the time but this is the only time he has looked actively bored available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu hanks family playtime sometimes hanks just wants to hang out with his kids and friends hey guys let’s put on a moviethat thing you do 1996 rank 25 hanks’s directorial debut — which includes his bosom buddies costar peter scolari plus rita wilson colin hanks and elizabeth hanks — is modest and pleasant like you would expect it to be even if it doesn’t add up to much hanks plays the world’s most benevolent music promoter and it’s the sort of movie you dance along to nice little background music while you do something else if they were all like this the world would be a much friendlier place available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu the great buck howard 2008 rank 36 in this mostly dull bauble about a kid colin hanks who works for a possibly fraudulent huckster magician john malkovich hanks shows up briefly as a skeptical dad this is the first and only time hanks plays the father of his reallife son colin and he’s amiable enough to show up and then get out of his kid’s way available to rent on i tunes vudu hanks as american avatar hanks is often clothed as a sort of standin for the american character a suit that’s so impossible to fill out that it’s pretty amazing how well it fits him saving private ryan 1998 rank 1 when we first see captain miller his hands are shaking as he puts his canteen to his lips before beginning the dday assault on normandy he’s scared as would anyone be in that situation the greatness of saving private ryan can be measured in many ways — the harrowing brilliance of its opening battle sequence the stunning desaturated images of war rendered by cinematographer janusz kamiński — but it’s ultimately a very human story which is why steven spielberg cast hollywood’s most reliable and relatable everyman star in the role as the film pounds along and the body count builds we learn that miller was the kind of american hero world war ii probably produced a lot of an ordinary guy back home who turned himself into a leader of men because the fate of the planet hung in the balance hanks is as strippeddown as the landscape hoping that rescuing ryan will be enough to get him home and forget all this terrible killing his death in the final moments haunts you long after the film’s over with hanks paying tribute to a lot of good soldiers who went off to safeguard freedom and never saw america again available with subscription on netflix to rent on amazon i tunes vudu captain phillips 2013 rank 2 hanks’s terrified vulnerable turn as the eponymous captain phillips is another prime example of his ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances  hanks’s phillips is a good captain but also a flawed one and one who is constantly adjusting to events that are entirely out of his control he does his best just to stay alive but when the ordeal is finally over and he is able to take stock he breaks down in the most raw wrenching scene of hanks’s whole career it’s a measured calculated performance that builds to a moment of almost overwhelming power available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu apollo 13 1995 rank 5 there is a chance that if you haven’t seen this best picture nominee in a while all you remember of it is hanks’s jim lovell saying “houston we have a problem” go back and watch apollo 13 and you’ll see hanks eschewing the flash of his thenrecent oscarwinning portrayals for a nononsense turn as a mission commander who is bound and determined to keep his crew bill paxton kevin bacon focused as they and mission control figure out how to get their crippled vessel home this is a performance that’s easy to shortchange but hanks imbues it with endlessly stirring strippeddown authority he makes not losing your shit in the midst of a crisis feel heroic available with subscription on amazon to rent on amazon i tunes vudu bridge of spies 2015 rank 8 hanks’s innate decency plays a part in several films but it’s delivered in a different way in this underrated cold war drama hanks is donovan an insurance lawyer asked to defend a russian spy oscar winner mark rylance in the process learning that he alone wants to be sure the accused gets a fair trial bridge of spies is a movie about negotiation and compromise — about what principles we’re willing to sacrifice and which ones we can’t — and donovan is heroic not because he’s the guy with the halo but because he’s shrewder and more determined than everyone he comes across this is hanks as worldweary veteran movie star and he gives it an effortless swagger available to rent on vudu charlie wilson’s war 2007 rank 9 charlie wilson was a hardpartying womanizing texas congressman who helped arm the mujahideen against the invading russians during the 1980s it’s a toogoodtobetrue reallife tale and hanks who also produced has a ball playing a sonuvabitch who’s been wasting his life until he finds a cause worthy of his talents charlie wilson’s war is deeply flawed — director mike nichols and writer aaron sorkin oversell the movie’s “colorful” world of vulgar cia operatives and sassy texas socialites — but hanks gives the cartoonish story a moral center without sacrificing the tale’s more unbelievable moments and its dark punch line wilson’s seemingly patriotic actions will sow the seeds for middle eastern terrorism against the west available with subscription on hbo to rent on amazon i tunes vudu catch me if you can 2002 rank 12 you could argue that hanks’s character is only the thirdmost interesting in this steven spielberg biopic about professional con man frank abagnale rising star leonardo di caprio has the showier role as abagnale and christopher walken playing his hardluck father got the oscar nomination but hanks does commendable supporting work as a nerdy fbi agent on abagnale’s trail — essentially playing the sort of conventional square whose mediocre life frightens the restless rootless abagnale what’s funniest about catch me if you can is how it represented a permanent shift in hanks’s persona the bratty upstart from dragnet was now old enough and established enough to be the justthefactsma’am lawandorder type still there’s a twinkle in hanks’s eye even as a square he’s so damn likable available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu sully 2016 rank 14 playing sully sullenberger hanks gives a calmly assured performance that’s easy to underrate — he does a whole lot by doing not much of anything in clint eastwood’s spare drama sullenberger has just piloted his crippled us airways flight into the hudson avoiding tragedy but now he must answer to federal investigators who question his strategy sully never questions the man’s heroism but sully himself does and hanks’s portrayal is one in which selfdoubt eats away at the character — which coupled with having just survived a horrifying ordeal leaves him feeling discombobulated and adrift sullenberger comes across as haunted shaken trying to put himself back together and hanks makes that healing feel quietly inspiring in theaters now saving mr banks 2013 rank 24 tom hanks playing walt disney in the story of how mary poppins got turned into a beloved film feels like money in the bank so what happened saving mr banks isn’t bad so much as it’s uninspired and safe — probably an inevitable result considering that the disney studio was behind the biopic and wanted to make sure it stayed onbrand still the disappointment extends to hanks’s portrayal he’s a morethancredible walt amplifying the man’s megawatt showmanship and gregariousness but it doesn’t zig or zag in any interesting directions the movie wants us to think that disney was a superswell genius which pretty much guarantees that nuance curiosity or wit aren’t going to be part of the equation available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu extremely loud and incredibly close 2011 rank 29 there are many many reasons people hate this 911 drama but it’s hard to put the blame on hanks that’s largely because he’s barely in it playing the dead father of the film’s autistic young hero thomas horn who goes on a quest across the city to solve a riddle his dad left for him in flashbacks hanks is more than credible as a man who fears for his sensitive son but the overt preciousness of this oscarnominated enterprise makes it hard to see that sincerity through the aggressive pretension available with subscription on netflix to rent on amazon i tunes vudu hanks striking one weird note hanks has a prankster quality that’s a little underrated sometimes he’ll just decide “i’m doing one gag for a whole movie” and generally he pulls it off a league of their own 1992 rank 7 beefing up for his role as jimmy dugan the alcoholic manager of a womenonly baseball team hanks gets to play the lovable crank the kind of part he didn’t do much after becoming a major movie star a league of their own catches the actor in an interesting inbetween spot in his career — he was rebounding from the failure of bonfire of the vanities but not yet at the stage where he’d win backtoback oscars — and as such it’s kind of a hoot to see him just bark at characters and be downright ornery of course dugan’s got a good heart underneath and it’s the sort of onenote character that could have easily drifted into caricature but hanks elevates him through sheer force of his charisma and sweetness available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu the terminal 2004 rank 17 steven spielberg’s doodle about an optimistic goodhearted eastern european tourist who gets stuck in bureaucratic limbo and thus lives at new york’s jfk airport for nearly a year is maybe a little too cute by half but hanks still makes you root for the guy even when spielberg is drowning in whimsy that said this has to be the most forgettable movie these two ever made together available to rent on amazon i tunes vudu the ladykillers 2004 rank 19 hanks’s one coen brothers film is perhaps their most divisive and disliked one — it’s pretty broad even for the coens and it really just has one joke — but it’s not hanks’s fault his goldthwaite higginson dorr — the character is as subtle as the name — is cartoonish and silly and way way way over the top but hanks is clearly having a blast playing him hanks’s sincerity was never going to be a good fit with the coens but he does his best to get on their wavelength in a goofy gameforanything performance the real problem here is that hanks brings his agame to a period of transition for the coens when they weren’t quite sure what their next step was going to be they figured it out available with subscription on showtime to rent on amazon i tunes vudu cloud atlas 2012 rank 20 pitched to him by the wachowskis and tom tykwer as a combination of mobydick and 2001 a space odyssey cloud atlas is easily the most audacious film hanks has ever made a gonzo scifi epic that spans eras and languages casting him in multiple roles it’s also probably his most divisive its strengths and weaknesses hopelessly linked and at war with one another that’s just as true of hanks’s performances which are a warning that bad wigs and weird makeup do not good characters make hanks has never let loose quite the way he does in cloud atlas and consequently there’s something oddly riveting about the risks he takes but he falls flat on his face a whole lot here — and he should never ever play a cockney again available to rent on amazon i
