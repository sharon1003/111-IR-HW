region canada – us alaska – denmark greenland – russia and norway the svalbard archipelagothe word arctic comes from arktos the greek word for bear logically the word antarctic means the opposite without bear why are there no polar bears in antarctica because the distribution of all animals is a function of luck and history a place can have the perfect conditions but it may not be possible to get there polar bears likely evolved from grizzly bears somewhere off eastern russia or the alaskan panhandle they are totally dependent upon sea ice for their primary habitat for getting their food as the world’s oceans never have been frozen from the north to the south polar bears never have had the possibility to reach the antarctic polar bears are strong swimmers but not strong enough to swim to the antarctic so polar bears and penguins don’t leave together except in books tv shows and zoosbiologists estimate there are 20000 to 25000 polar bears about 60 of those live in canadachurchill in canada is the polar bear capital of the worldpolar bear is classified as a vulnerable species because they are threatened by the melting of ice please help them by adopting some ecofriendly simple gestureshumans are polar bears only predator however unregulated hunting – except by native people – ended in 1973 with an international agreement among the 5 polar bears nationspolar bears are the largest land predator in the world being on top of the food chain in arcticadult male polar bears weigh from 350 to more than 550 kilos 7751200 pounds for 2 to 31 meters long 65 to 12 feet females are considerably smaller normally weighing 150 to 300 kilos 330 to 650 pounds and measuring 15 to 24 meters long 5 to 9 feetthe height of polar bears at their shoulders when they are on all fours is usually between 1 to 15 meters  35 to 5 feet for males and females an adult male may reach over 3 meters 10 feet when standing on its hind legsthe life expectancy of a polar bear in the wild is typically between 15 to 18 years but can go up to age 30the main food source for polar bears are various species of seals all other food are opportunistic feedingspolar bears are excellent swimmers they can swim at speeds of up to 10kmh 6 mph and can swim continuously for 100 km 62 miles some have been observed swimming 300 km 200 miles from landpolar bears’ fur which appears to be white is actually made up of almost colourless almost transparent hairs reflection of the sunlight from the densely packed hairs makes polar bears appear to be white in a sort of optical illusion just like snow ice and sugarpolar bear fur is oily and water repellentpolar bears’ skin visible only on the nose and footpads is black the black color enables the bears to absorb sunlight energy to warm their bodypolar bears have a blue tongueunlike brown and black bears polar bears do not hibernate through the winter but mother polar bears dig a snow den to give birth and raise her cubs the first monthsfemale polar bears reach sexual maturity at about 4 to 5 years old male polar bears reach sexual maturity at about 6 but don’t successfully mate until 8 or 10male polar bears have a baculum penis bonefemales breed about once every 3 years one of the slowest reproductive rates of any mammal therefore the competition for female is intensethe mating season takes place on ice in aprilmay the fertilized ova divide a few times and then float free within the uterus for about 6 months with its development arrested sometime around september the embryo will attach to the uterine wall and resume development this phenomena is called the “delayed implantation” and allow the mother to assess if she has made enough fat reserves prior to starting gestation and the process of birthing nursing and carrying for her offspring and if this is not the case the embryo will not implant but be reabsorbed by her body it also allows the mother to give birth at the time of year that offers the best chance of survival for the cubsthe mother enters the den in october or november and the cubs will be born sometime in december or january 2 months later the family remains in the den until march or early april during her entire time in the den the mother bear don’t eat or drink when she finally emerges with her cubs she leads them to the sea ice so she can break her long fast by hunting seals for at least 20 months cubs drink their mother’s milk and depend on her for survival her success at hunting is therefore critical for their own needs but also for teaching the cubs to find food by themselves– the most frequent litter size is two followed by litters of one litters of three are less common than twins or singles and litters of four are rarenewborn cubs are 30 to 35 centimeters 12 to 14 inches long and weigh little more than half a kilogram about one pound they are blind deaf toothless and covered with short soft fur their smelling and walking abilities are also nonexistent at that stagemother polar bears are extremely protective of their young even risking their own lives in their cubs’ defense when her cubs are about 30 months old a female polar bear is ready to breed again at this time an adult male may begin following her either the mother bear or the male chases away the cubsa grolar or pizzly bear is the rare hybrid offspring of a polar bear and a grizzly and
