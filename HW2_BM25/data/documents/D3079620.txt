college you control your fate and the more you work at your studies and the more you actively participate in your classes the higher the probability for academic success if you dont take college serious and dont study to the level you need dont blame others for your weak academic performance do set reasonable  and achievable  academic goals each semester push yourself to perform at your highest level but dont make those goals so high that fall into a downward spiral do buy a planner andor develop a system for keeping track of all your assignments readings and papers  most of which you can get from the syllabus of each course youre taking and do invest in some time management education if you do not have much experience juggling multiple demands on your time including classes homework friends clubs sports social gatherings group meetings etc dont expect your college professors to be anything like your high school teachers the best students take the time to learn what each professor expects from students  and then devise a plan to live up to those expectations do take time to review your current studying strengths and weaknesses by understanding yourself better youll be able to maximize your strengths while overcoming  or at least minimizing  your weaknesses do develop a regular time to study and read your textbooks but dont make that time late at night or while lying in bed and do finish the readings that are assigned for each class  so you can be better prepared for understanding and questioning the lectures and participating in discussions do develop a good notetaking system  both for reading assignments and for class lectures find a system that works for you such as outlining or develop your own do consider breaking up your studying into smaller chunks throughout the day youll face less burnout have more time flexibility and retain more information by doing so dont get in the habit of skipping classes attending class is a critical component of learning the material  and class notes are often a key part of studying for exams do find a study system that works for you but dont make it cramming the night before there are numerous study techniques such as outlining flash cards study groups etc and you need to find the one  or the combination  that works best for you for each subject do start researching planning writing and editing papers well in advance of the deadline and do seek the assistance of the professor if you are having a hard time getting started with the paper dont hand in a paper straight from the printer that you have not edited and proofread at least once do seek out assistance when you find yourself struggling besides the professor and your classmates most colleges have an academic support center that typically offers assistance in learning how to study time management and notetaking as well as tutoring for a variety of subjects including english math and foreign languages dont study for the sake of studying putting more time into studying will not help you achieve better grades instead you need to study smarter do ask your professors for copies of old tests and papers or projects some professors keep old exams on reserve at the library  or even on their websites having an idea of what to expect is extremely useful in studying for major papers and projects again its useful to see how the professor grades these types of assignments do attend any review sessions the professor offers  especially before the first test  and do study beforehand so you can ask questions you still may have about the material do find a way to balance studying with all the other things that college offers the best students blossom in college  both personally and academically dont compare your academic performance to anyone else each person is unique and comparing yourself to others just sets you up for disappointment  or worse failure do live a healthy lifestyle  getting enough rest eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly in fact some of our best students say the key to their success is diet and exercise dont panic if your grades are not where you hoped or expect them to be but
