b oth men were born in the victorian era badenpowell first in 1857 kipling eight years later both men died within five years of each other bp died last aged 84 in 1941 so all of kiplings life occurred within bps span they were contemporaries who grew up in the national culture sharing many of the imperial beliefs that underpinned the british empire and kipling was born in that empire in india it could well be argued that both men went on to be advocates of empire and both have been individually described as the greatest living englishman kipling and badenpowell both had clergymen for fathers who were also authors the rev professor powell died when bp was only three years old kipling was sent to school in england whilst his parents remained in india so he too grew up without direct contact with his father for most of his school years rudyard kipling aged 6there is no doubt that bp inherited his fathers skill as an artist particularly in the medium of the pen and ink cartoon kiplings father john lockwood kipling was one of the pioneers of art education in india rudyard shared his fathers talent and like bp illustrated his own work notably the just so stories from which the elephant child shown here is taken many others however were illustrated by rudyards father also in the medium of pen and ink kipling experienced some bleakness in his childhood he and his sister were sent from india as were many expatriot children for their schooling in england they were sent off without warning or explanation to live for six years with someone they had not previously met in southsea they were not kindly treated kipling called the house where they lived the house of desolation rudyardrudyard is an unusual christian name i have not come across the name before the time of kipling though it might have become popular after his fame and affection in the public eye grew there is however an english placename rudyard in staffordshire which is the only occurrence of this name in the british isles some sources say that the name comes from ralph rudyard who is reputed to have slain richard iii at bosworth but as that was in 1485 and the placename rudegeard was first recorded in 1002 it is more likely that ralph rudyards ancestors came from the place in staffordshire rudyard is a small village between the potteries towns of stokeontrent and the moorlands town of leek the dam that formed rudyard lake an artificial reservoir two miles long and a quarter of a mile wide was built in 1797 to provide water for the trent and mersey canal and later in 1831 to feed the macclesfield canal a corner of rudyard lake  showing pleasure boats  early 1900s the churnet valley railway line running from manchester to uttoxeter was built in 1849 there were two stations near the lake one at the dam end at rudyard village the other at the feeder end at rushton spencer once the railway was built the lake became very popular with tourists who could easily get out from manchester or the potteries towns for a day in the country there were stalls on the dam tea rooms were built houses boathouses and chalets  many of which are still to be seen  provided accommodation and amusements such as boating and a rollerskating rink sprang up colder winters were more common in those times and many people would come to iceskate on the lake as it would freeze over for weeks at a time in 1906 a golf course with its own clubhouse and tea rooms was made at the north end of the lake rudyard lake was an extremely popular tourist attraction at the turn of the nineteenth century and as such became known as the blackpool of the potteries kiplings father john lockwood kipling was an artist and scholar who had considerable influence on his sons work he was involved in the decoration of the victoria and albert museum in london and came to the potteries to work for the potter pinder bourne in burslem in 1863 he and robert edgar were awarded joint first prize in the competition for the design of the façade and elevation of the wedgwood memorial institute in burslem later he became curator of the lahore museum and is described presiding over this wonder house in the first chapter of rudyard kiplings kim  john lockwood kipling is said to have met alice macdonald for the first time at a picnic party by rudyard lake in 1863 they became engaged and married two years later in london they fell in love with rudyard so much during their courtship that they decided to christen their first child born in bombay india in 1865 joseph rudyard kipling rudyard and its reservoir from the south today rudyard lake is as popular as ever although the railway has gone a miniature railway has been established using the old trackbed and runs from the old rudyard station to rushton spencer at the head of the lake the staffordshire way runs along its west shore and one of the staffordshire moorland walks along its east there is an active sailing club bridle paths facilities and entertainments for visitors tea rooms are still to be found though not under that name and many of the buildings and boathouses that would have been familiar to john kipling and alice macdonald are still there and still in use more remarkable still on top of the steeper eastern slopes bordering the lake to the right and not seen in the photograph above lies barnswood scout camp i wonder how many scouts and their leaders realise how close they have been to a place which by its association has a place in the earliest days of scouting    however he also enjoyed like bp idyllic times he had famous relatives who were able to exert influence on his behalf kiplings mother was alice macdonald two of whose sisters married the highly successful 19thcentury painters sir edward burnejones and sir edward poynter whilst a third married alfred baldwin and became the mother of stanley baldwin kiplings cousin who went on to become prime minister bps childhood was also populated with influential relatives and figures such robert browning william makepeace thackeray john ruskin and the scientist thomas huxley were among the more famous regular visitors to his home badenpowells childhood will be more thoroughly documented in a forthcoming milestones article nature or nurture kipling was a prolific author he wrote 4 novels as well as numerous poems some of which have been collected into 19 different compilations of his work as well as many articles the man in the street would perhaps be unaware that bp as far as mere output is concerned outproduced his literary friend as a visit to the badenpowell bibliography on this website will demonstrate on it 36 books are listed besides numerous scouting pamphlets he also wrote his weekly yarns in the scout magazine and contributed a monthly outlook in headquarters gazette and the scouter over a thirtyyear period education b oth men attended english public schools and because of that alone have much in common these establishments were after all predominately allmale residential and occupied mainly by the children from families rich enough to afford the fees though badenpowell was exceedingly fortunate to be a scholarship boy at charterhouse school kipling as a young man besides this it would seem that there were remarkable similarities between the philosophies of each school and indeed both men were to carry a lifelong affection for their particular headteachers dr haig brown of charterhouse and cormell price of the united services college this affection though was not enough whilst they were actually resident at school to stop them both from wanting to escape and disappearing for hours in the nearby scrubland if that is kiplings character stalky in stalky and co is as is commonly assumed based on the authors own childhood experiences there is no doubt that juvenile homosexuality was present in the allmale public schools of the day and this fact is often quoted in association with the two men after their deaths both were accused of being repressed homosexuals the charge has probably more to do with the emerging liberalism of biographies which from the 1970s onward often include psychoanalytical research into their subjects sexuality  no doubt in an attempt to boost sales typical of these is badenpowell by tim jeal a review of which appears on the bibliography page on this site other biographers of both badenpowell and kipling have conversely uncovered real and supposed heterosexual love affairs prior to their marriages their marriages at least so far have escaped this sort of attack it being quite apparent that both men worshiped their wives india t he two men first met in lahore india sometime between october 1882 and november 1884 the date is imprecise because badenpowell in his obituary on kipling in the scouter of march 1936 only tells us the place of their meeting and not the date so their meeting must have been at some time during the period that badenpowell was in the region of lahore they met through their respective families bp wrote his father and my brother were colleagues in establishing the museum in lahore of indian arts and crafts kipling was a promising cub reporter and badenpowell a junior army officer both were considered to be thrusting personalities bp at that time had also had books and articles published to gain necessary additional income army officers at the time were expected to have private incomes most of them had bought their commissions it can be imagined that they would become friends kipling used two very indian motifs the head of the elephant and the fylfot or swastika an indian good luck sign to embellish his work he saw to it that they were included somewhere on his book covers or flyleaves to bring good luck to his readers bp also adopted the fylfot symbol and incorporated it in the designs of the thanks badge and scouting awards from 1911 until around 1936 when the nazis  the german national socialist party  adopted a version of it as their symbol the milestones article on the fleurdelis and the swastika gives a full account of the scouting use of the symbol and the kipling version the mafeking connection part idr jim  leander starr jameson from an illustration for vanity fair 1896k ipling wrote one of the most popular poems in the english language if for dr leander jameson kipling admired jameson and had invited him to batemans in 1909 one year prior to the writing of if jameson see internet sources below was infamous for the jameson raid which is generally acknowledged as being one of the contributory factors which led to the boer war on december 29th 1895 jameson with support from his close friend cecil rhodes and unofficially the british government planned an incursion into the transvaal boer sovereign territory from mafeking with a group of 600 volunteers from the british south africa police the raid was to support civil unrest mainly stirred up by british settlers the uitlanders in the hope that the boer regime might be overthrown resulting in an allbritish south africa and of course british ownership of the gold and diamond fields it was a bungled job and jameson and his men were soon caught he was only returned to british jurisdiction on the promise of his imprisonment ifif you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs

fifteen months imprisonment serving ten months in london after which he returned to south africa and was back in mafeking just prior to the siege in 1899 badenpowell insisted that jameson leave on the last train out with the officers wives he or more likely british high command feared that jamesons presence would further incite the boers  who regarded the jameson raid as the ultimate provocation  when the siege as they fully expected it to be was broken the boers even without jamesons presence threatened that on entering mafeking they would not leave one stone upon another jamesons portrait was and is still to be found in kiplings study at batemans above the central section the bookcase next to that of josephine kiplings first daughter who died aged seven jamesons full name was leander starr jameson kipling had married an american caroline starr balestier whilst i have no proof whatsoever the coincidence of this very unusual name used by both families as a middle name leads me to think that kipling not only admired jameson but was related to him through his wifes family this certainly would explain the juxtaposition of the two portraits i t would be hard to imagine a more farflung corner of empire than mafeking in 1899 the town backed onto the kalahari desert and only eight miles away was the hostile border of the boer territory of transvaal the siege of gallant little mafeking was to last for 217 days with the british public receiving news on an almost daily basis this news was generally manufactured propaganda but when available came from one of the several war correspondents amongst the besieged kipling had been offered the job as war correspondent by the daily mail at the outbreak of war but at first declined though eventually he did accept and left for south africa with his family nursemaid and governess arriving on christmas day 1900 he was invited by his old friend and fellow member of the athenaeum club cecil rhodes to build a house the woolsack on his estate at groote schuur as a war correspondent kipling did see some action in the field though he was not in africa at the time of the siege of mafeking his influence though was to be felt within that besieged town major alexander godley was bps secondincommand in the later part of the siege and prior to the outbreak of hostilities his wife was with him in mafeking bp ordered the women out at the same time as dr jameson and lady godley went to live in bulawayo she and godley exchanged messages hidden on native runners throughout the siege the popular story was that these messages were written on thin paper and concealed on the person of the runners in the soles of their shoes for instance however the actual envelopes still in existence one in the royal collection are perfectly normal uncreased and unmarked one of the messages contained kiplings latest work the absent minded beggar which was a poetic patriotic appeal to the british public to provide for the wives and sweethearts of the gentlemen in khaki who had been ordered south to table bay after going the rounds the poem was eventually published in the mafeking mail published daily shells permitting and we are told this helped to raise morale the poem was later set to music by sir arthur sullivan there are further twists to this story godley had been at school with kipling indeed they were fellowpupils in the same dormitory at school in his book life of an irish soldier to which bp wrote the foreword godley does not remember his schoolmate with much affection but with masterly understatement wrote of kipling that we realized that he would probably achieve a certain measure of success in the literary world as we realize now bp also knew kipling well from his time in india it is easy to imagine that with godleys stories of his school days bps recollections and the arrival of the absent minded beggar in town the talk around the officers mess must have made kiplings ears burn it is fascinating to imagine the conversation that might have taken place between godley and bp when they shared their reminiscences about kipling my researches may have made me the first person in modern times able to do this as prior to this article no other single document records the links between the three men after kipling died in 1936 his nephew oliver baldwin the homosexual son of kiplings cousin prime minister stanley baldwin made a speech attacking his famous uncle which was not surprisingly widely reported oliver had been an idolised favourite of the kiplings especially after the death of their own son john but kipling had ostracised him on finding out about his beastliness homosexuality already disliking his politics oliver at the time of this outburst was a labour member of parliament many people wrote to the papers in kiplings defence including his old school friend sir alexander godley b adenpowell and kipling met at least twice in south africa mrs kiplings diary reports that in march and april 1901 bp visited the kiplings house the woolsack and they would have met again as seems most likely if they were both guests of cecil rhodes at groote schuur it is certain that kipling and bp did meet again in south africa in 1906 bp sketched kipling shown at the head of this article and kipling wrote a verse about a bp seascape that kipling had read as a view of the veldt because he held it upside down he went on to scribble a comic verse about it this is the ocean bright and blue that the armadale castle plowtered through but if you turn it the other way its the lonely veldt on a cloudy day that is if you hold it upside down its the gathering storm on the desert brown and very seldom since art begun could you get two pictures by drawing one and this doggerel was written by the poet most commentators thought should have been poet laureate t he connection between the two men would no doubt have been strengthened as bp met kiplings daughter elsie on various voyages to and from south africa and according to her diary they would stroll around the deck together kipling was also a frequent traveller on this route and both he and bp had sailed on the armadale castle i hope that my ongoing study of bps diaries might also reveal that bp and kipling were too at some time shipmates certainly bp seemed to have the knack of finding important connections on his frequent voyages to postings in january 1897 at the end of the matabele campaign he sailed home on the newly launched dunvegan castle its glittering passenger list included lady grey lord charles bentinck who was later to be one of bps officers in mafeking cecil rhodes and his brother frank cecil rhodes became one of the richest men in the world and certainly the most influential person as far as africa was concerned bp had shared adventures with him during the campaign and like kipling he was later to be a guest at rhodes house groote schuur in cape town viscountess milner who lived at groote schuur whilst her former husband lord edward cecil was in mafeking claimed in her book my picture gallery 18861901 that the house like the ships plying between south africa and britain was a focal point for the great and the good of the day badenpowell wrote in his obituary of kipling that it was in south africa that he got to know him best in the interval between their last meeting in india and their next in south africa both men would become worldfamous winston churchill for example wrote about both men in glowing terms they both received honorary doctorates and were given the highest honours kipling received the nobel prize for literature in 1907 bp was nominated for the nobel prize for peace in 1939 for his work in 1938 and the preceding thirty years in promoting the fraternity of the nations    through the boy scout movement  but unfortunately and for obvious reasons the peace prize was not awarded in 1939 fame is never easy and both men detested some of the attention that it brought bp was to call it damanable notoriety and could only be persuaded to accept his peerage on behalf of the scout movement kipling refused a knighthood and made every attempt to keep the public at bay allowing his wife and daughter to become his gatekeepers there was a young person of batemans who was guarded in most of her statements when asked wheres your pa she said  out in his car whereas he was really in batemans early days in scouting i n 1908 bp wrote in scouting for boys a summary of kim and a description of kims game which kipling freely allowed the central importance of this book to scouting was immense kiplings devising of kims game as a training for spies had been published around the same time as bps aids to scouting this of course had as its central premise the importance to the army scout of learning from observation bp was to later publish his own my adventures as a spy in 1915 in 1909 bp wanted a scouting anthem so he wrote to his old friend requestingif the spirit will move you to give them the scouts a sentiment in rhyme i can promise you that it would be a very great thing for many thousands of good young hearts badenpowell also asked if kipling would lend him his son john for his forthcoming camp the lads were to spend one week camping at bucklers hard near beaulieu and one week on the training ship mercury bp wrote in his letter i hope to make sailors of them this year    this photograph of john kipling and his sister elsie and is one of only two i have seen of john as a child we would welcome should it exist one of him in scout uniform john eleven at the time was placed in a special patrol of bps guests along with his nephew donald who had also attended the brownsea island and humshaugh camps donald was the same age as john but most of the other boys were significantly older so it is possible that the two became friends when kipling collected his son at the end of the camp he saw an entertainment held indoors because of the rain provided by the participants for the guests badenpowell got his anthem all patrols look out and the depth of scouting knowledge portrayed in this song showed that kipling had taken a keen interest in his sons experiences and had probably read scouting for boys the song was published in the scout on september 18th 1909 but this was not to be kiplings most literary or popular contribution to the scouting game the log books used by participants in wood badge training courses at gilwell had a verse from the feet of the young men printed on the cover the special akela certificate awarded to those completing the akelas wood badge at gilwell between 1922 and 1925 also carried the same verse who hath smelt woodsmoke at twilight who hath heard the birchlog burning who is quick to read the noises of the night let him follow with the others for the young mens feet are turning to the camps of proved desire and known delighthugh brogan is a lecturer in american history at the university of sussex he has written several books including a biography of arthur ransom and wrote mowglis sons as an academic treatise for which he was presented with ralph lewis award for books having some sussex connection by his university he does not claim any scouting credentials but is the only kipling scholar to have attempted any research about kiplings scouting connections he maintains that the provenance of the lines above was lost to scouting circles until as late as 1978 when the then association archivist graham coombe was apparently able to establish the facts i have however a prewar gilwell log book that clearly acknowledges kipling as the author alongside the verse printed on the cover scouts soon began to populate kiplings literary work and a whole troop appeared in kiplings the horse marines published 1911 naturally bp and kipling exchanged christmas cards it would appear that kipling also received a privatelycirculated pamphlet cadet training and education in which bp complained vigorously about the governments notion of enlisting all boys in the cadet corps see the scouts defence corps and the red feather  kiplings noncommittal reply is still in existence in a letter dated december 23rd 1915 in the university of sussex archives of kipling papers kipling airs his own views that the education system was overpolitical that 5 of the population the ultimate dirt have to be coerced to work that discipline must stem from fear etc etc he does not comment on bps view other than his parting shot of keep up the good work though these views are hardly noncommittal he was noncommittal about badenpowells points smoking drinking and the sense of smell b adenpowells stockintrade throughout his scouting years was his repeated warnings to scouts of the dangers  or rocks as he described them in rovering to success  that they would encounter in life of all the dangers most important for bp despite what his reviewers have to say about continence seems to be that of smoking closely followed by drinking bp contrary to what some of his biographers believed was known to partake in both but keeping all things in moderation of the two it was perhaps the dangers of smoking that exercised bp most and during the period between 190007 he was the patron of at least two antismoking organisations as far kipling is concerned the dangers of drink came first in his priorities and he was apparently deeply affected when he observed young women drugged by drink being led away for sailors for their own purposes badenpowell maintained that one of the reasons why a scout would not want to smoke was that he would lose his vital sense of smell this particular sense it would appear was part of kiplings stock in trade t thurston thompson wrote a biography of kipling in 1915 when he was at the height of his popularity thompson was so taken with what he called kiplings cultured delight in odour that he wrote a whole chapter about it and though he did not use the who hath smelt woodsmoke at twilight text quoted above it is a good example of kiplings constant invoking of the sense of smell domestic life m r and mrs kipling were invited to attend bps wedding reception at the mercers hall london on 17th december 1912 and later the bps settled at ewhurst place robertsbridge only ten miles from the kiplings home batemans in sussex again the similarities of lifestyle of two worldfamous welltravelled very english gentlemen living a gentrified life in their respective sussex villages is striking they were great motoring enthusiasts and both owned naturally rollsroyce motor cars kipling said of his that it was the only car he could afford a reference to its reliability and longevity bps was given to him by the scouts of the world the bps visited batemans and almost certainly the visit would have been reciprocated badenpowell was in fact given two cars by his scouts the first a lanchester was presented on his marriage to olave in 1912 and was bought from funds raised by a penny subscription from scouts across the world the more famous however was the jam roll a 20 hp rollsroyce limousine this was presented with an eccles caravan  the eccles cake  at the 21st birthday celebrations of scouting during the 1929 world jamboree at arrowe park birkenhead england bp had been asked what he wanted he replied that the only thing he could think of was a pair of braces  these were also presented at the same time both men had two daughters and a single son john kipling was born on august 17th 1897 and peter badenpowell of a different generation in 1913 again there is another remarkable similarity as both sons were to disappoint their fathers as far as their prowess at school was concerned and the fathers letters to the boys at their different public schools are almost interchangeablewar looms b oth men spoke out publicly about the menace of a strong germany and predicted the coming conflict at the outbreak of the first world war both bp and kipling saw it as their patriotic duty to support kitcheners efforts to raise an army both men spoke at recruiting rallies though probably not on the same occasion john kipling in the uniform of the irish guards john kipling was apparently not a robust youth like his father he was severely shortsighted and only 5 feet 6 inches tall he would have escaped conscription by virtue of his health but he was very keen to join the colours and was able to do so only because his father bought him a commission in the irish guards on first his meeting with the enemy in france at the battle of loos on september 27th 1915 john kipling was lost officially posted as missing    from that day kipling began to be an old man    john had been made a full lieutenant only days before and may indeed have been unaware of his promotion as it had yet to be gazetted this important fact may have had a bearing on subsequent events as johns body was not located during kiplings lifetime despite the extraordinary searches that he undertook for some time the kiplings lived in the hope that john might yet be discovered in some prisonerofwar camp but even when they accepted his death the absence of a known grave meant that in todays terms they could find no sense of closure badenpowell thought of all his scouts as being part of his family and often expressed himself in these terms obituaries of scout officers appeared in headquarters gazette month after month year after the year throughout the course of the war some of the dead were well known to bp such as roland philipps who had been his house guest the dreadful and constant carnage of his scouts and the death of philipps in particular had a profound effect on the chief scout and though his loss was perhaps not comparable to kiplings it similarly affected his future writings and philosophy before the war badenpowell often used the term peace scouting this stemmed from the concept of the citizen soldier to be a loyal citizen meant to make yourself fit in body and mind for the time you might have to serve king and country in active combat after the war the concept of peace scouting took on a far more active role generations of scouts at successive world jamborees were urged to make friends with the youth of all the nations and to go home and spread a message of peace and understanding in order that the world would never again be subject to the spectacle of scouts killing scouts both kipling and badenpowell had ample opportunity to see at firsthand the effects of the war both men in civilian capacities worked in france at intervals during the war bp in his scouts huts and kipling as a war correspondent then later in his capacity as a member of the imperial war graves commission perhaps kiplings natural grief was touched by pangs of guilt as without his influence and money john would not have gone to france kipling was possibly the most active member of the war graves commission and wrote most of the inscriptions on the many memorials playing a large part in ensuring that the graves of the dead bore the badge of their regiment he paid a british gardener at the menin gate war cemetery to sound the last post in remembrance of john every evening until 1940 and he also wrote a mammoth history the irish guards in the great war entirely without monetary reward which was published in 1923 profits from the book were probably donated to the widows and orphans fund of the irish guards there is correspondence from bp in the collection of john ineson which indicates that bp was also writing a regimental history of the 13th18th hussars but this book was probably never published peter badenpowell was only five when john was killed but the badenpowells father and son were also to experience trauma peter had to be withdrawn from charterhouse school as he lacked academic ability and despite his fathers intervention failed to gain a commission in the british army eventually bp did manage in november 1933 to secure him a noncommissioned posting in the british south africa police in rhodesia where eventually peter who by this time was not communicating with his parents was married in secret in january 1936 peter did not tell his parents of his marriage until his son michael was born in january 1937 the rôlemodel for a million boys was not at ease with his own son the mafeking connection part iid uring the siege of mafeking bps chief staff officer was lord edward cecil or nigs as he was known to his family he had been bps secondincommand and responsible amongst other things for the siegetime operation of the mafeking cadets often supposed to be the forerunner of the boy scouts not only was he the son of the prime minister lord salisbury queen victorias last prime minister but also the cousin of arthur james balfour who succeeded his uncle lord salisbury as prime minister in 1903 lord edward cecil lord edward cecil married miss violet maxse in 1894 violet by all accounts was a wild child very artistic and from a family of unbelievers she was never to gain full acceptance in the aristocratic catholic cecil family at their wedding were gathered guests from the worlds of politics arts and letters including oscar wilde six poets but no mention of kipling though later the cecils and in particular lady violet were to become close friends of the kiplings violets friendship was to endure long after the death of her husband in 1918 and she went on to marry lord milner who was coincidentally also a friend of the kiplings milner had been at oxford with badenpowells brother george and they had both made a career in the civil service and politics milner became the british high commissioner for south africa and prior to the second boer war of 1899 followed the line of the proboer prime minister of the independent cape colony w p shreiner in doing everything possible to try and avoid war this included refusing badenpowells requests for supplies and permission to raise his two regiments within the boundaries of the colony bp wrote of his interview with milner when he first arrived in cape town to request assistance in carrying out the orders of the commander in chief of the british army viscount wolseley as being like a cold douche the cecils only son george was born in 1895 he remained in england when the couple sailed for south africa with badenpowell in 1899 violet was resident in mafeking with lady godley but she too was evacuated with the other ladies and jameson on the last trains before the town was besieged violet also accepted cecil rhodes invitation to live at his house at groote schuur near cape town for the duration of the siege it was during this time that lady violet came into contact with the kiplings and formed a friendship which continued after the war when lord cecils career took him to egypt lady violet stayed in england and took a house at great wigsell near hawkhurst sussex only seven miles northeast from the kiplings house batemans at burwash in east sussex and indeed less that 5 miles northwest of the badenpowells at ewhurst the cecils son george and his younger sister helen were ideal companions for john kipling and his younger sister elsie and there were frequent visits between the two families george cecil was 18 years old in 1913 and had left school to go to the army college at sandhurst kipling thought him a wonderful rôlemodel for john and so he continued to be a frequent visitor to batemans the kiplings entertained george when he joined the 2nd battalion grenadier guards in january 1914 corrie kipling wrote we did not have anybody else to dine so we might hear him talk     and kipling himself he has come on splendidly  sage as ever and altogether delightful in his account of the new life and as keen as mustard in midjuly george organised a cricket match at great wigsell and enlisted the kiplings as members of his eleven less than one month later george was sent to the front as part of the british expeditionary force and straight into the retreat from mons in his first action on august 12th he was listed as wounded and missing this it has to be remembered was one year before the death of john kipling but the circumstances were so similar and made more ironic by the fact that the action concerned was in support of the irish guards which was to be john kiplings regiment what was to follow is even more remarkable t he cecils were one of the most powerful families in the land but as their friends the kiplings wanted to assist them in their natural desire to prove that george might still be alive and perhaps a prisonerofwar kiplings wife carrie was an american citizen from the publishing family of balestier and of no mean influence  the family were considered to be american aristocracy kipling had been collaborating on a novel the naulahka with wolcott balestier kiplings american publisher in london when he met caroline the sister of wolcott balestier rudyard and carrie married in 1892 the year after wolcotts death and they went to live near brattleboro vermont usa where they stayed for four years until there was a great fallingout over some trifling matter between the two brothers in law rudyard and beatty balestier carrie kipling approached the american ambassador and was soon able to report that mr roosevelt is asking the kaiser to give him a list of our wounded america was at this time as it was to do again later adopting a pose of neutrality lady cecil in particular was unceasing in her search even to the extent of travelling to france kipling took it upon himself to track down the men who survived the action his report to lady violet was hopeful though not conclusive but the army were not as convinced pointing out that men involved in the heat of battle make poor witnesses this proved to be the case as kipling was to discover for himself when interviewing witnesses of his own sons engagement with the enemy after two months of ceaseless searching georges death was confirmed later lady violet was to become just as involved in the search for john kipling when he was reported missing as she had been for her own son she did not hesitate to use her political connections and other friendships to help the cause including those with the prince of wales and the crown princess of denmark princess margaret of denmark was particularly useful as she had a german motherinlaw who was related to the kaiser this period of intense mutual dependency naturally strengthened the friendship between carrie kipling and lady violet cecil they corresponded on an almost daily basis and other than carrie kiplings mother lady violet was her closest confidant the friendship that began as a result of the siege of mafeking in 1899 was to last until carrie kiplings death in 1939 i t is interesting to wonder why it was that bp should have invited kiplings son john and sons of his high powered friends but not lord edward cecils son george to his early camps the answer is probably to be found by reading between the lines of the following correspondences badenpowell wrote in his official report of the siege that cecil stuck pluckily to his work although hampered by illness in the first part of the siege private letter to ghq after the siege bp wrote that cecil did his best but was not much use cecil was equally disenchanted on hearing that the bps were to move into his area he confided to violet i dread anything that reminds me of that ghastly time i really dread it the jungle book first edition 1894 illustrated by j lockwood kipling o n july 28th 1916 badenpowell wrote to kipling to ask his permission to use the jungle book in his own revamp of the wolf cub scheme wolf cubs had been created in 1913 under the direction of percy everett bp felt the scheme needed a central story suitable for youngsters on which to hang specially adapted scouting teachings he wrote to kipling at the point when the wolf cubs handbook which uses the jungle book as its main theme was in its proof stage this was not blatant disrespect but a complete understanding between the two men kipling was in total agreement with bps endeavours to spread scouting and would do all he could to help yet this generosity as far as kiplings work was concerned was not characteristic hugh brogan asserts that kipling was notoriously sensitive about being quoted or exploited mowgli and bagheera one of the maurice and edward detmold illustrations from a 1903 edition of the jungle book kipling would have had every reason to be fearful as however much bps literary style may have been loved it was not in the same league as that of kipling the way his subtlydrawn creations were ghost written by bp into mere caricatures of their former selves must have surely caused some qualms however kipling sent bp his proofs back without a single revision this was true friendship linked by the certainty that in bps hands his characters would reach a wider audience gain more popularity and do better for empire than they ever could if left within the covers of kiplings own books kipling was keen to play the scouting game and in a letter to n d power the chief cub commissioner of the day he spells out just how the howl should sound  just as i learnt it and millions of others have before and since akaylar with an accent on the second syllable which can be prolonged indefinitely the initial a on the other hand is almost a grunt  er try this and you will see the beauty of the thing the following year the duke of york was treated to the the largest howl ever assembled up to that time some 4000 cubs in a rally held in hyde park gave the prince the biggest surprise of my life bp wrote to kipling and told him of the success of this rally which also featured scenes from the jungle book almost certainly kipling would have been presented with his own copy of this programmei should have liked you to have been there not only to see the show but to feel the gratification you would have done at having brought so much romance and sunshine into the lives of these boys on october 7th 1922 an even larger grand howl by 19000 wolf cubs as part of a posse of welcome at alexander palace was planned for the prince of wales who was returning from a world tour bp was determined that kipling would not miss out a second time and kipling was present in the grounds of alexander palace waiting with other dignitaries to meet the prince of wales who unfortunately was late however the grand howl took place on time and so kipling was again robbed of seeing at firsthand how his written word was translated into a crescendo of noise by the greatest number of boys under the age of eleven ever assembled in one place kipling however did enjoy the show but must have looked outofplace in his frockcoat and top hat amongst all the bare knees bp wrote again to him after the eventi look upon you as the inspirer of a lot of the spirit in scouting today and was therefore glad that you should see it in practicethis great praise was perhaps half an apology for kipling missing the grand howl and with an invitation to visit gilwell park half a softening up for the request that was to follow bp wanted kipling to write through the times to the people of britain to ask for their help this once the help required was material ie financial in order that the scout association could do great work towards the prevention of crime and the promotion of a sane happy citizenhood but in this last request bp was to be disappointed kipling was quite prepared to pledge his own allegiance to the cause but highprofile campaigning was not his style it might have been in his memory that the only time he broke his own rule was linked to the death of his son land and sea tales for scouts and guides i have yet to discover which came first kiplings intention to publish a book especially for the movement or his appointment as a commissioner of wolf cubs however by the time land and sea tales was published in 1923 its frontispiece proudly carried against kiplings name his rank as commissioner for scouts hugh brogan in his mowglis sons is i feel perhaps a little mischievous in pointing out that in reality kipling had been made a commissioner only for wolf cubs the term boy scouts in its widest sense included all sections of the movement in his obituary on kipling in the february 1936 edition of the the scouter deputy chief scout lord somers tells us that kipling had been a member of the scout council since 1923 it would appear that his rôle of commissioner though surely well deserved was merely honorary i have never encountered a picture of kipling in scout uniform and it is has to be said the imagination is hardput to cope with the very ideathe land and sea tales cover a miscellany of topics ranging from stories about unnamed v cs to further tales from stalky and co if scout and guide readers were looking for stories with characters that were within the movement they would have been disappointed from my perspective there seems to be precious little to do with scouting and guiding and little to capture the enthusiasm of its younger participants the book however was well received by the scouter whose reviewer alfred g barralet in december 1923 declared it was just the sort of yarn we want at the campfire or the powwow at troop headquarters kiplings howl in contrast to the confidentlooking everett kipling looks like a man not at ease with himself his dress even in 1924 must have looked antiquated k ipling was not to be totally deprived on opportunity to witness his grand howl performed in a grand manner he was in attendance at the imperial jamboree held at wembley in 1924 on wednesday august 6th 7000 wolf cubs yelled their heads off for him and the duke of york in a special tribute kipling was able to see his jungle book creations brought to life mowgli the boy was chased by shere khan the tiger but was rescued by baloo the bear and bagheera the panther when suddenly a band of chattering monkeys arrived and seized him this time however kaa the snake came to his rescue and gobbled up all the monkeys kaa was surely the biggest reptile ever seen being composed of 150 yards of wolf cubs bent double in an elasticsided skin having devoured all the monkeys it coiled itself twice round the council rock and went to sleep the photograph shown here is from the 1924 imperial jamboree book the caption names mr rudyard kipling with no mention of his commissioner status he is standing alongside percy everett who was responsible for the original organisation of the wolf cubs in 1913 the last reference i have been able to find of kiplings connection to scouting concerns the visit to batemans on august 5th 1931 when 28 scouts were kiplings guests for the day kipling was always reported as having the pied piper touch and like his friend bp was accused of being a peter pan the boy that never grew up it is to be hoped that this so far unnamed scout group enjoyed their time with their founders friend in death k ipling died five years before bp leaving the founder to write his obituary in the scout of march 1936 our movement has lost a true and valued friend from its earliest days scouting was heartily encouraged by him he had practically been a lifelong friend to me and i shall miss his cheery clever and helpful personality kipling was buried along with the other british literary immortals in westminster abbey badenpowell was buried by his own wishes at nyeri in kenya but lady badenpowell was offered the opportunity had she wished for the founder also to be buried in westminster abbey it was proposed that his gravestone would be in the main aisle a unique mark of respect for a commoner in the event a large commemorative stone was placed in the floor by the internal wall at the main entrance so in death as in life badenpowell and rudyard kipling are forever linked an american postscript i n 1898 kipling living in america at the time met ernest thompson seton of scottish descent seton had emigrated from england to canada and was to start his own youth organisation based on woodcraft lore and become one of the founders of the boy scouts of america kipling was profoundly affected by setons philosophy and when his friend suggested that he was going to write a book a dictionary of woodcraft kipling could see that such a dictionary would probably not attract a publisher the great man of letters persuaded his friend instead to embody his philosophy and teachings in novel but though seton agreed he did not make a start on the work later in 1899 kipling became seriously ill and sent for his publisher frank n doubleday known to kipling as effendi in what seemed to be a deathbed message kipling told doubleday that he must at all costs sign up seton and publish his works doubleday approached seton who agreed to make start on the novel kipling had suggested saying the book would take two years to write two little savages was eventually published by doubleday in 1903 seton went to england in 1904 where he met badenpowell and in 1906 sent him his latest work the birch bark roll of the woodcraft indians from which bp borrowed liberally with the authors consent whilst scouting for boys was under preparation setons influence on scouting is welldocumented in scouting milestones particularly in ernest thompson seton the beginnings of controversy by us scout historian david c scott the reader if all the links are followed should be in a position to judge for themselves just how much the scout movement and badenpowell himself owes to kiplings intervention on setons behalf
