over time inflation has the largest influence on the level of interest rates a modest rate of inflation will almost always lead to low interest rates while concerns about rising inflation normally cause interest rates to increase our nations central bank the federal reserve implements policies designed to keep inflation and interest rates relatively low and stable what is an adjustable rate mortgage top an adjustable rate mortgage or an arm as they are commonly called is a loan type that offers a lower initial interest rate than most fixed rate loans the trade off is that the interest rate can change periodically usually in relation to an index and the monthly payment will go up or down accordingly against the advantage of the lower payment at the beginning of the loan you should weigh the risk that an increase in interest rates would lead to higher monthly payments in the future its a tradeoff you get a lower rate with an arm in exchange for assuming more risk for many people in a variety of situations an arm is the right mortgage choice particularly if your income is likely to increase in the future or if you only plan on being in the home for three to five years heres some detailed information explaining how arms work adjustment period with most arms the interest rate and monthly payment are fixed for an initial time period such as one year three years five years or seven years after the initial fixed period the interest rate can change every year for example one of our most popular adjustable rate mortgages is a fiveyear arm the interest rate will not change for the first five years the initial adjustment period but can change every year after the first five years index our arm interest rate changes are tied to changes in an index rate using an index to determine future rate adjustments provides you with assurance that rate adjustments will be based on actual market conditions at the time of the adjustment the current value of most indices is published weekly in the wall street journal if the index rate moves up so does your mortgage interest rate and you will probably have to make a higher monthly payment on the other hand if the index rate goes down your monthly payment may decrease margin to determine the interest rate on an arm well add a predisclosed amount to the index called the margin if youre still shopping comparing one lenders margin to anothers can be more important than comparing the initial interest rate since it will be used to calculate the interest rate you will pay in the future interestrate caps an interestrate cap places a limit on the amount your interest rate can increase or decrease there are two types of caps 1 periodic or adjustment caps which limit the interest rate increase or decrease from one adjustment period to the next2 overall or lifetime caps which limit the interest rate increase over the life of the loan as you can imagine interest rate caps are very important since no one knows what can happen in the future all of the arms we offer have both adjustment and lifetime caps please see each product description for full details negative amortizationnegative amortization occurs when your monthly payment changes to an amount less than the amount required to pay interest due if a loan has negative amortization you might end up owing more than you originally borrowed none of the arms we offer allow for negative amortization prepayment penalties some lenders may require you to pay special fees or penalties if you pay off the arm early we never charge a penalty for prepayment contact a loan officer selecting a mortgage may be the most important financial decision you will make and you are entitled to all the information you need to make the right decision dont hesitate to contact a loan officer if you have questions about the features of our adjustable rate mortgages should i pay points in exchange for a lower interest rate top points are considered a form of interest each point is equal to one percent of the loan amount you pay them up front at your loan closing in exchange for a lower interest rate over the life of your loan this means more money will be required at closing however you will have lower monthly payments over the term of your loan to determine whether it makes sense for you to pay points you should compare the cost of the points to the monthly payments savings created by the lower interest rate divide the total cost of the points by the savings in each monthly payment this calculation provides the number of payments youll make before you actually begin to save money by paying points if the number of months it will take to recoup the points is longer than you plan on having this mortgage you should consider the loan program option that doesnt require points to be paid if youd prefer not to make this calculation the oldfashioned way we have a points calculatoris comparing aprs the best way to decide which lender has the lowest rates and fees top the federal truth in lending law requires that all financial institutions disclose the apr when they advertise a rate the apr is designed to present the actual cost of obtaining financing by requiring that some but not all closing fees are included in the apr calculation these fees in addition to the interest rate determine the estimated cost of financing over the full term of the loan since most people do not keep the mortgage for the entire loan term it may be misleading to spread the effect of some of these up front costs over the entire loan term also unfortunately the apr doesnt include all the closing fees and lenders are allowed to interpret which fees they include fees for things like appraisals title work and document preparation are not included even though youll probably have to pay them for adjustable rate mortgages the apr can be even more confusing since no one knows exactly what market conditions will be in the future assumptions must be made regarding future rate adjustments you can use the apr as a guideline to shop for loans but you should not depend solely on the apr in choosing the loan program thats best for you look at total fees possible rate adjustments in the future if youre comparing adjustable rate mortgages and consider the length of time that you plan on having the mortgage dont forget that the apr is an effective interest ratenot the actual interest rate your monthly payments will be based on the actual interest rate the amount you borrow and the term of your loan how do i know if its best to lock in my interest rate or to let it float top mortgage interest rate movements are as hard to predict as the stock market and no one can really know for certain whether theyll go up or down if you have a hunch that rates are on an upward trend then youll want to consider locking the rate as soon as you are able before you decide to lock make sure that your loan can close within the lockin period it wont do any good to lock your rate if you cant close during the rate lock period if youre purchasing a home review your contract for the estimated closing date to help you choose the right rate lock period if you are refinancing in most cases your loan could close within 30 days however if you have any secondary financing on the home that wont be paid off allow some extra time since well need to contact that lender to get their permission if you think rates might drop while your loan is being processed take a risk and let your rate float instead of locking after you apply you can lock in by contacting your loan officer by telephone how much money will i save by choosing a 15year loan rather than a 30year loan top a 15year fixed rate mortgage gives you the ability to own your home free and clear in 15 years and while the monthly payments are somewhat higher than a 30year loan the interest rate on the 15year mortgage is usually a little lower and more important  youll pay less than half the total interest cost of the traditional 30year mortgage however if you cant afford the higher monthly payment of a 15year mortgage dont feel alone many borrowers find the higher payment out of reach and choose a 30year mortgage it still makes sense to use a 30year mortgage for most people who should consider a 15year mortgage the 15year fixed rate mortgage is most popular among younger homebuyers with sufficient income to meet the higher monthly payments to pay off the house before their children start college they own more of their home faster with this kind of mortgage and can then begin to consider the cost of higher education for their children without having a mortgage payment to make as well other homebuyers who are more established in their careers have higher incomes and whose desire is to own their homes before they retire may also prefer this mortgage advantages and disadvantages of a 15year mortgage the 15year fixed rate mortgage offers two big advantages for most borrowers you own your home in half the time it would take with a traditional 30year mortgage you save more than half the amount of interest of a 30year mortgage lenders usually offer this mortgage at a slightly lower interest rate than with 30year loans  typically up to 5 lower it is this lower interest rate added to the shorter loan life that creates real savings for 15year fixed rate borrowers the possible disadvantages associated with a 15year fixed rate mortgage are the monthly payments for this type of loan are roughly 10 percent to 15 percent higher per month than the payment for a 30year because youll pay less total interest on the 15year fixed rate mortgage you wont have the maximum mortgage interest tax deduction possible compare them yourself use the how much can i save with a 15 year mortgage calculator in our resource center to help decide which loan term is best for you are there any prepayment penalties charged for these loan programs top none of the loan programs we offer have penalties for prepayment you can pay off your mortgage any time with no additional charges what is your rate lock policy top general statement the interest rate market is subject to movements without advance notice locking in a rate protects you from the time that your lock is confirmed to the day that your lock period expires a completed mortgage application and supporting documents must be received before the rate will be locked lockin agreement a lock is an agreement by the borrower and the lender and specifies the number of days for which a loan’s interest rate will be guaranteed should interest rates rise during that period we are obligated to honor the committed rate should interest rates fall during that period the borrower must honor the lock when can i lock in some cases your online application will provide all the information needed and you will have the option to lock immediately after loan approval otherwise you will be invited back to lock after we have reviewed your documentation and credit package you will be notified when your interest rate is locked fees we do not charge a fee for locking in your interest rate lock period your loan must close and disburse within the number of days your interest rate has been locked lock changes once your interest rate has been locked your loan is committed and may be within the secondary market therefore we could not renegotiate rate lock commitments tell me more about closing fees and how they are determined top a home loan often involves many fees such as the appraisal fee title charges closing fees and state or local taxes these fees vary from state to state and also from lender to lender any lender or broker should be able to give you an estimate of their fees but it is more difficult to tell which lenders have done their homework and are providing a complete and accurate estimate we take quotes very seriously weve completed the research necessary to make sure that our fee quotes are accurate to the city level  and that is no easy task to assist you in evaluating our fees weve grouped them as follows third party fees fees that we consider third party fees include the appraisal fee the credit report fee the settlement or closing fee the survey fee tax service fees title insurance fees flood certification fees and couriermailing fees third party fees are fees that well collect and pass on to the person who actually performed the service for example an appraiser is paid the appraisal fee a credit bureau is paid the credit report fee and a title company or an attorney is paid the title insurance fees typically youll see some minor variances in third party fees from lender to lender since a lender may have negotiated a special charge from a provider they use often or chooses a provider that offers nationwide coverage at a flat rate you may also see that some lenders absorb minor third party fees such as the flood certification fee the tax service fee or couriermailing fees taxes and other unavoidables fees that we consider to be taxes and other unavoidables include statelocal taxes and recording fees these fees will most likely have to be paid regardless of the lender you choose if some lenders dont quote you fees that include taxes and other unavoidable fees dont assume that you wont have to pay it it probably means that the lender who doesnt tell you about the fee hasnt done the research necessary to provide accurate closing costs lender fees fees such as points document preparation fees and loan processing fees are retained by the lender and are used to provide you with the lowest rates possible this is the category of fees that you should compare very closely from lender to lender before making a decision required advances you may be asked to prepay some items at closing that will actually be due in the future these fees are sometimes referred to as prepaid items one of the more common required advances is called per diem interest or interest due at closing all of our mortgages have payment due dates of the 1st of the month if your loan is closed on any day other than the first of the month youll pay interest from the date of closing through the end of the month at closing for example if the loan is closed on june 15 well collect interest from june 15 through june 30 at closing this also means that you wont make your first mortgage payment until august 1 this type of charge should not vary from lender to lender and does not need to be considered when comparing lenders all lenders will charge you interest beginning on the day the loan funds are disbursed it is simply a matter of when it will be collected if an escrow or impound account will be established you will make an initial deposit into the escrow account at closing so that sufficient funds are available to pay the bills when they become due if your loan requires mortgage insurance up to two months of the mortgage insurance will be collected at closing whether or not you must purchase mortgage insurance depends on the size of the down payment you make if your loan is a purchase youll also need to pay for your first years homeowners insurance premium prior to closing we consider this to be a required advance what is title insurance and why do i need it top if youve ever purchased a home before you may already be familiar with the benefits and terms of title insurance but if this is your first home loan or you are refinancing you may be wondering why you need another insurance policy the answer is simple the purchase of a home is most likely one of the most expensive and important purchases you will ever make you and especially your mortgage lender want to make sure the property is indeed yours that no individual or government entity has any right lien claim or encumbrance on your property the function of a title insurance company is to make sure your rights and interests to the property are clear that transfer of title takes place efficiently and correctly and that your interests as a homebuyer are fully protected title insurance companies provide services to buyers sellers real estate developers builders mortgage lenders and others who have an interest in real estate transfer title companies typically issue two types of title policies 1 owners policy this policy covers you the homebuyer2 lenders policy this policy covers the lending institution over the life of the loan both types of policies are issued at the time of closing for a onetime premium if the loan is a purchase if you are refinancing your home you probably already have an owners policy that was issued when you purchased the property so well only require that a lenders policy be issued before issuing a policy the title company performs an indepth search of the public records to determine if anyone other than you has an interest in the property the search may be performed by title company personnel using either public records or more likely the information contained in the companys own title plant after a thorough examination of the records any title problems are usually found and can be cleared up prior to your purchase of the property once a title policy is issued if any claim covered under your policy is ever filed against your property the title company will pay the legal fees involved in the defense of your rights they are also responsible to cover losses arising from a valid claim this protection remains in effect as long as you or your heirs own the property the fact that title companies try to eliminate risks before they develop makes title insurance significantly different from other types of insurance most forms of insurance assume risks by providing financial protection through a pooling of risks for losses arising from an unforeseen future event say a fire accident or theft on the other hand the purpose of title insurance is to eliminate risks and prevent losses caused by defects in title that may have happened in the past this risk elimination has benefits to both the homebuyer and the title company it minimizes the chances that adverse claims might be raised thereby reducing the number of claims that have to be defended or satisfied this keeps costs down for the title company and the premiums low for the homebuyer buying a home is a big step emotionally and financially with title insurance you are assured that any valid claim against your property will be borne by the title company and that the odds of a claim being filed are slim indeed what is mortgage insurance and when is it required top first of all lets make sure that we mean the same thing when we discuss mortgage insurance mortgage insurance should not be confused with mortgage life insurance which is designed to pay off a mortgage in the event of a borrowers death mortgage insurance makes it possible for you to buy a home with less than a 20 down payment by protecting the lender against the additional risk associated with low down payment lending low down payment mortgages are becoming more and more popular and by purchasing mortgage insurance lenders are comfortable with down payments as low as 3  5 of the homes value it also provides you with the ability to buy a more expensive home than might be possible if a 20 down payment were required the mortgage insurance premium is based on loan to value ratio type of loan and amount of coverage required by the lender usually the premium is included in your monthly payment and one to two months of the premium is collected as a required advance at closing it may be possible to cancel private mortgage insurance at some point such as when your loan balance is reduced to a certain amount  below 75 to 80 of the property value recent federal legislation requires automatic termination of mortgage insurance for many borrowers when their loan balance has been amortized down to 78 of the original property value if you have any questions about when your mortgage insurance could be cancelled please contact your loan officer how do i lock my rate top contact your loan officer what is the maximum percentage of my homes value that i can borrow top the maximum percentage of your homes value depends on the purpose of your loan how you use the property and the loan type you choose so the best way
