science  mathematics chemistry whats the difference between a primary and secondary standard i know a primary standard is a solution that can be accurately measured out eg khp that has been dried and weighed so a titration of khp against na oh will result in knowing the molarity of the na oh is the na oh solution a secondary standard thanks for your helpupdate thanks cm follow 2 answers answers best answer no na oh is not a secondary standard a secondary standard is the solution that you dilute from primary standard with a known dilution factor  eg a 2 times dilution of the primary standard from your explanation the na oh in your experiment is the titrant cm · 10 years ago1 0 comment askers rating the common examples of primary standards a potassium hydrogen phthalate  khp used to standardize a base using phenolphthalatein as an indicator bpotassium hydrogen iodate kh io3 it is a strong acid used to standardize bases csodium carbonate na2co3 which used to standardize standardize strong acids to an end point of p h 45 benzoic acids sodium oxalate borax and mercuric oxide are other primary standards secondary standard is a solution whose concentration has been accurately determined by titration of primary standard and which is used to standardize other solutions beverly · 2 years ago0 0 comment perhaps you would like to learn more about one of these portfolio management options how does cloud computing work masters of marketing online looking for a new chandelier
