bill and melinda gates foundation charitable giving guide star irs form 990 local nonprofits national nonprofits nonprofit philanthropy private nonoperating foundations public charities where do you give in nonprofits on june 10 2009 at 545 pm the gates foundation has been in the news a lot over the past few days as it relates to the amount of money the foundation has received unsolicited which raises the question…where do you give do you give to foundation or do you give to 501c3 public charities as opposed to grant making entities according to their listing on guide star the bill and melinda gates foundation is a 501c3 private nonoperating foundation not a public charity organizations that are determined to be private foundations need to be mindful of the amount of money they take in from donations as exceeding a certain percentage of their income via donations can affect their tax determination additionally donors need to be mindful that the tax benefits of giving to a 501c3 public charity do not hold true in terms of how much of the donation may be written off when giving to organiztions such as foundation political advocacy organizations etc and do you give at the local level to a domestic violence sheter or humane society or do you give at the national level to an organization such as the american red cross or greenpeace why do some people give at the local level while others give at the national and is there more value to one over the other does having a “name brand” so to speak mean a lot to prospective donors i personally while i support the national and international nonprofits have always felt it more advantageous to give at the local level i am more inclined to write a check to the local domestic violence sheter as opposed to the national coalition against domestic violence i am more inclined to participate in and do fundraising for a team in the local relay for life rather than simply cut a check to the american cancer society although i suppose in the latter case the money all goes to the same place eventually i have worked in the nonprofit sector at both the local level and the national level and for myself personally have found great value in giving at the local level and giving back to the community in which i live and work this may also be a good time to point out that i was worked as a development officer for local nonprofits so doing grant writing and fundraising for the smaller locallybased organizations perhaps furthered these feelings in me many of your smaller locally run nonprofits are not eligible for some the larger million dollar grant awards that the larger national organizations are which is why there can be such great value to individual donors giving at the local levels of course the local charities aren’t targeting as large of a population the way the national or even statewide nonprofits are and many statewide and national nonprofits do provide funding to the local organizations while also providing educational resources which is also important and demonstrates the need for the larger organizations to have continued funding as well but generally speaking it’s the larger organizations who provide funding resources education training and participate in lobbying and political advocacy while it’s the local nonprofits who provide direct services to those in need how a person chooses to spend their charitable dollars is ultimately a personal decision that only the donor can make and there is great value to giving period regardless of the size of the organization but it may be wise for donors to sit down and really think about the impact that they want their charitable donation to have before making their decision a great many small local nonprofits are suffering all over the country to the economy and the local humane society could probably use some extra money house the dogs and cats that are being dropped off as people are having to move out of their homes that they can no longer afford just as much as the national aspca donors may also want to consider checking out websites like guide star and charity navigator before making their donation decisions to ensure 1 the exact ruling of the organizations tax exempt status 2 ensure that the organization by reviewing the irs form 990’s spends their money in a way in which the donor is comfortable and 3 that the overall mission of the organization is inline with what the donor is looking to support charity begins at home as they say and while it’s important and necessary for the overall wellbeing of our citizens on a national and global level for the larger organizations to get what they need in order to do their good works it’s important to check our own back yards as well so to whom do you give do you give at the national or local levels what factors into your giving decisions advertisements
