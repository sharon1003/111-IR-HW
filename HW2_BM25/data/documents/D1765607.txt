connection include the relationship between line and phase voltage and current for each type any help would be greatly appreciated regards tom8th december 2010 1814 2prototypv10advanced member level

greater because it have three or four wires instead of just two8th december 2010 181430th august 2011 2052 3koppan newbie level 5join date aug 2011location triprayarkeralaindia posts 10helped 0

over single phase originally posted by koppan three phase has higher voltage    this isnt always the case beside hes semester is finished and the question is likely solved long time ago1 members found

1312points 25337level 38re advantages of three phase systems over single phase the big advantage with 3 phase mains is that any electric motor connected to it is more efficient has smother running and uses less parts so is more reliable there is also a slight advantage in using 3 phase transformers over single phase ones there is a great advantage in ac to dc power supplies as smaller capacitors can be used for other applications such as heating and lighting it has no advantage frank last edited by chuckey 31st august 2011 at 0800  reason added rectification sentence1 members found this post

phase the 3 phase system has an advantage for the single phase system for sure the 3 phase system has more power than the single phase system such that p3vicos theta no signature links allowed5th

are inherently selfstarting because of the rotating filed produced by the 3 phase current  if the load is balanced there is no neutral current flow in the case of a y wye star connection  in a delta connection you can lose open one phase and you still have three phase power available although thecurrent flow from the source will be greater5th september 2011 2304 8prototypv10advanced member level

phase secondary winding is missing is called the open delta connection the following article explains it better than i can  e t e 3 phase transformer info  this connection is useful in situations where the load is expected to grow over time you can start initially with an open delta and as the load requirements increase you can add the third transformer without disturbing the system6th

guess the open delta configuration is a typical us special i noticed that in the us its still common to mount three single phase transformers on a power pole instead of a more economic threephase transformer in this case you can think about omitting one for reduced load unfortunately you get asymmetric current capabilities of each phase6th september 2011 1710 11prototypv10advanced member level

however you could just add by using two single phase transformers to make the statement true an open delta configuration must contain two identical single phase transformers post new thread please
