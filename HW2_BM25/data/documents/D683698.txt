decoding labels spectrum organic olive oil mayonnaiseby kristen michaelis 52 comments affiliate disclosure share tweet pin share stumble mayonnaise labels are scary have you looked at them lately most read like chemistry textbooks with goodies like modified corn starch and maltodextrin and calcium disodium edta most are made with geneticallymodified soybean and canola oils most contain corn syrup so let’s imagine that you’re a conscientious shopper and you want a better mayonnaise you may have bought this week’s product spectrum organic olive oil mayonnaise spectrum is a reputable brand organic certification means the oil is not made from geneticallymodified crops and olive oil  heart healthy what’s not to love here’s what the manufacturer claims“smooth creamy mayonnaise seamlessly blended with the nutty savory richness of extra virgin arbequina olive oil from spain live it up with a spoonful on grilled artichokes or the fresh catch of the day this exciting new product takes full advantage of spectrum’s many years of experience of bringing to market the finest olive oils the world has to offer gluten free no hydrogenated fat or preservatives used”spectrum organic olive

should know about labels ingredients are listed from most to least it’s the law so ingredients at the top of the list make up the majority of the product ingredients at the bottom tend to be spices preservatives colors etc because they are used in the smallest quantities check out what’s at the top of this — ahem — “olive oil” mayonnaise organic expeller pressed soy andor canola oil before we dive into why those are two nasty oils even in their “organic” form let me just say that this is true of every major label olive oil mayo that i’ve ever seen whether it’s kraft olive oil mayonnaise or hellman’s the front brands them as an olive oil mayonnaise but the back shows that really they’re just soybean oil next to olive oil the cooking oil marketed as the most “hearthealthy” out there is canola oil but what is it canola oil is a newly created oil invented in the 1970s as a low euricacid version of the otherwise notreallyedible rapeseed oil in 1998 through the marvels of geneticengineering the now ubiquitous variety of rapeseed which makes up roughly 87 of all rapeseed grown in the u s and canada was created so it’s safe to say that all nonorganic varieties of canola oil come from these geneticallymodified plants but what about organic canola oil this comes from a naturally selected low euric acid rapeseed plants but despite being gmofree the oil itself is still unhealthy that’s partly because canola oil is between 2835 polyunsaturated fats in traditional food cultures polyunsaturated fat intake made up less than 4 of the total fat intake we ought to do likewise and according to mary enig ph d author of know your fats  the complete primer for understanding the nutrition of fats oils and cholesterol  “although the canadian government lists the trans fat content of canola at a minimal 02 percent research at the university of florida at gainesville found trans fat levels as high as 46 percent in commercial liquid canola oil”  source  how did those trans fats get in there because of how this oil has to be made you see prior to the industrial revolution making seedbased cooking oils was far too labor intensive and in many cases downright impossible all the ancient cooking oils like coconut oil palm oil olive oil etc are easily pressed out of the plant without needing extremely highpressure or hightemperature extraction after the industrial revolution we had the technology necessary to create modern seedbased cooking oils so we did but the process of making and refining these oils translates into one thing rancid polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas pufas don’t hold up well to heat or pressure the same is true for both organic canola and organic soy oil soybean oil is roughly 58 polyunsaturated fatty acids — nearly twice that of canola so in the process of being extracted from the seed these oils oxidize and many of them plasticize turn into trans fats the end result is stinky and unappetizing so the oil is further “cleaned” using bleach or alternative chemicals to deodorize it gross and we call this heart healthy the semimagical term expeller pressed simply means that the oil wasn’t extracted with a heated chemical solvent like hexane rather the soybeans and rapeseeds were heated then put under extreme pressure to release the oil every other ingredient on this label gets a green light from me i could be nitpicky and say that organic whole eggs don’t mean that the eggs are pasture raised or that organic honey isn’t necessarily raw but honestly what do you expect in a massproduced food you can’t let the ideal be the enemy of the good spectrum organic olive oil mayonnaise the verdictso what should you use instead of course your first option should be to make your own homemade mayonnaise that way you can ensure that the eggs come from pastured hens the oils are as raw and unrefined as you desire etc you can even mildly ferment the mayonnaise to inject your condiment with a healthy dose of probiotic cultures and living enzymes  check out my recipe for homemade mayonnaise  alternatively if you absolutely must buy mayonnaise because you never like the taste of homemade there is only one out there that i can recommend to my knowledge it’s the only soy and canola free mayonnaise available on the market it’s also the only mayonnaise made entirely with healthy traditional oils and it tastes positively divine i tried this oil at this year’s wise traditions conference and was so blown away that i bought an entire case of itit’s the wilderness family naturals organic mayonnaise  where to find wilderness family naturals mayonnaisewant your labels decoded in this series on decoding labels i’m highlighting deceptive labeling practices hidden ingredients and more if
