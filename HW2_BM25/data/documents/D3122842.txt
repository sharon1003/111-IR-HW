advanced allulose rare sugar so our chocolate tastes natural but contains only ultralow zeronet addedsugar calories without the consequences of oldfashioned sucrose the case against addedsugars after years of research nutritional science has finally exposed addedsugar primarily in processed foods and sodas as the biggest nutritional culprit in the explosion of chronic diseases we now know extra addedsugars are making us sickin fact a mountain of research and a growing scientific consensus about addedsugar prompted the fda to issue new labelling rules for 2018 over the objections of sugar industry lobbyists the new regulations require all food and beverage companies to list the amount of “addedsugars” on their nutrition facts panel the overwhelming evidence and fda’s actions confirm what we already instinctively knew addedsugars can lead to excessive calories weight gain obesity and a host of many other associated chronic diseases addedsugars spike blood glucose levels raise insulin levels contribute to insulin resistance metabolic syndrome and can lead to hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes and hypoglycemia sugar crashes addedsugars have also been linked to several other conditions such as heart disease high triglycerides cardiovascular disease and some cancers the bottom line addedsugars should be limited to much smaller amounts in the american diet for decades the sugar industry has worked to obscure the nutritional health consequences of too much addedsugar they successfully deflected concern away from addedsugar to dietary fat and have blamed the increase in american waistlines to consumer’s inability to control overconsumption of calories the result has been a 30 rise in consumption of sugar and an epidemic of nutritionalrelated chronic diseases like obesity type 2 diabetes heart disease and cancer the effects have impacted both adults and children during 2016 all that changed as a result of the fda’s new labeling regulations and growing public health activism sugar has become the newest nutritional villain it’s even been described as “the new tobacco” to assist consumers in making better nutrition choices fda’s new labeling rules are set for implementation in summer 2018 this will require all food and beverage manufacturers to identify the addedsugars in their products for example based on the new fda definitions one 20ounce coke would show it contains 130 of rdi recommended daily intake for “added sugars” distinguishing between sugar types to benefit from these labelling changes it’s important to understand how sugars get into foods there are two basic types sugar that is a component part of a raw or whole food’s natural nutritional structure for example fruits vegetables and dairy foods naturally contain sugar these are part of the total sugars calculation but they are standard baseline and normal and of less concern addedsugars are the sugars and syrups added to foods during processing they are over and above the baseline level they are added to generally enhance sweetness texture or taste addedsugars add empty calories without adding nutrients these are the primary sugar villains the latest changes seek to limit or avoid allu low™ replaces 100 of its addedsugars with advanced allulose rare sugar creating a zeronet addedsugars effect to its chocolate how to read the label allulose is a natural form of sugar so fda currently classifies it as an addedsugar for labeling purposes the nutrition facts panel counts it toward total sugar and carbohydrate grams in our chocolate even though allulose is not metabolized into glucose in the body doesn’t have a blood sugar glycemic effect and does not contribute calories to the diet we believe the fda classification is incorrect and a petition is currently before the fda to reclassify allulose as a non addedsugar we also believe in time fda will adopt the proposed changes as it has done in prior similar circumstances meantime read the label savor the fulltaste of fine chocolate while avoiding the negative health effects of addedsugars that’s because allu low™ fine chocolate is sweetened with advanced allulose rare sugar with its important and documented health benefits¹allu low dark chocolate – package back panel allulose is supported by a growing body of clinical  scientific evidence zeronet glycemic response in one clinical study by

were given either glucose a simple sugar or allulose predosage baseline blood sugar and insulin levels were measured then checked at several intervals after dosing as shown in the graph below regular sugar spiked blood glucose and serum insulin but allulose did not in fact not only did allulose show no spike it directionally lowered blood sugar in diabetic subjects and appeared to have no
