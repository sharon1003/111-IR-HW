510 for the install if everything goes smoothly is that a goodaverage price thanks04092013 0752 am  2ufotestpilot jeeper join date nov 2012location portland oregon posts 2279you could install it in 8 hours or less with minimal tools and a basic ability to follow simple directions so is it worth it to you that is the question shop rates can run 60120 hr usually for some it is easier to kill the light inside of themselves than it is to fight the darkness all around them04092013 0753 am  3patrick hjeeper join date nov 2011location northern nmposts 3136here for example i charge 85hr flat rate for labor so 510 would be 6 hours if the shop that gave you the quote hasnt ever installed a lift on a tj that may not be too far off personally if someone came to my shop with the same id probably quote 4 hours on jobs like this i generally like to inspect the vehicle before i give a quote in case there might be underlying issues that i can spot ahead of time rust isnt much of an issue here but that could be a game changer as far as actual time it takes to install04092013 0756 am  4thgr8alex jeeper join date dec 2012posts 1658i just installed zone 3 inch lift by myself without having done too much by myself before ran into a small issue but took my time on it all and took total 14 hrs saved 500 bucks if not more by doing it myself and you can tell people you did it 1998 jeep wrangler

steering wheel and alignment yourself after install04092013 0923 am  9pstov98tjjeeper join date dec 2012location long beach mississippi posts 2098id do it yourself get a good set of craftsman tools and a good set of torx bits and a good jack and jack stands it will be the best things you ever bought yourself the first major mod i ever did to my jeep was the dpg ultimate kit details in my signature all this was done at my buddys familys lawn mower repair shop gotta love small towns right  by me and him granted we had his uncle to ask questions too but we only needed him for one or two things and i couldve looked them up it was just easier asking him all in all it took us 8 hours but we are two college kids just having a good time listening to music taking our time so in short doing it yourself will save you money and youll learn alot about your jeep and if something goes wrong with the suspension later youll have a better understanding of what it might be so you dont have to take it to a shop every time you hearfeel something odd which could save you more money down the road 1998 tj 25 ome springs ome n66  n67 sport nitro shocks 33x125 goodyear mtrs metalcloak aluminum

my local 4x4 shop quoted me 899 for a 4 rough country lift  installation i installed my own lift and i am not mechanically inclined either so it took me under 2 days to get the lift on and running i thought i knew about suspensions until i actually worked on my own i did pay 50 to a well known alignment shop to align my jeep and check my work and align my jeep i cant wait to install adjustable cas and install better springs in the future by myself04152015 1025 am  15sieg snewb join date mar 2015posts 7doesnt sound too outrageous i got mine installed for 300 from the guy i bought the kit from he does a lot of them so he is probably quicker at it and the work did not include the steering stabilizer others quoted 400 up to 900 so i think the price you were given is not far off it all comes down to how much it is worth to you not having to mess with putting the lift in for me 300 but was worth not screwing with it on the odd chance something went wrong
