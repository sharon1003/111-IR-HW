your money financial advice for people who aren’t rich your money by ron lieber april 11 2014for a couple of years now a number of entrepreneurs have been racing to solve the same problem the financial services industry’s persistent inability to provide personalized advice and appropriate investments at a reasonable price to customers who are not rich it was easy at first for established players to dismiss companies like betterment wealthfront and learn vest as roboadvisers niche services or certain failures that line of thinking wrote their offerings off as training wheels for knownothing young adults until they graduated to a grownup grayhaired financial adviser — even though these startups gathered piles of fancy venture capital money but recent developments suggest that those new players may be something more than the starter homes of the personal finance world betterment which builds and manages investment portfolios of index and exchangetraded funds realized that 20 percent of its assets were from customers over the age of 50 they were asking for advice on withdrawing their retirement money and the company is now introducing a service to assist them then there’s the index fund giant vanguard whose investment products are often at the heart of the portfolios that these new services are building for their own customers it is now piloting an offering of its own that nearly matches the new players on price while offering unlimited financial planning along with investment management that’s something that most of the new “we’ll run your money for you” companies don’t offer your money a column on anything and everything that hits you in the wallet a 350 million fund helps many public servants meet the ones left out apr 6a student loan fix for a

accounts there to join but the company plans to drop the minimum to 50000 at some point soon an existing vanguard service that resembles the new one costs 07 percent annually on the first 1 million and requires at least 500000 on balance this new program which has no wait list for now but may add one if too many people sign up may not work though vanguard has spent more than two years planning and testing it but by extending both investment advice and planning to many more customers and asking them to pay less than half of what some of its other customers already pay vanguard is all but admitting that the startups were right in identifying an enormous advice gap in the financial services industry robert neubecker with this week’s column we’re introducing a chart on our site that lists these companies and explains their pricing and services for now we’ve limited it to services that will help you pick the right index funds or similar investments and rebalance them over time while charging you less than 050 percent of your money each year some of the companies charge monthly fees or no fees at all like wise banyan  we will update this chart as companies come and go and offerings change the fact that so many startups have jumped into this space speaks to a problem with a basic business model that has plagued the financial advice industry for decades helping people sort through their investments budgets employee benefits taxes estate planning and insurance takes time no two clients are exactly alike if advisers earn their compensation through commissions from investment or insurance companies then they’re likely to favor those funds and policies this often isn’t in the best interest of the customers most of whom ought to be in lowcost index funds and the better index funds and similar investments tend to come from companies that don’t pay commissions customers can pay advisers directly and many do pay them 1 percent each year of the money under management but a large number of the best advisers won’t get out of bed for less than 5000 or 10000 annually drawn from a 500000 or 1000000 portfolio given the amount of time and resources it takes to do right by a client some others charge by the hour and still agree to work in a client’s best interest but plenty of customers dislike being on the clock some people need no professional help at all they don’t mind spending time managing their finances they invest in the right things don’t bail out when the markets go bonkers and don’t have messy financial situations resulting from inheritances or disabled children or small business tax complications but companies like betterment and wealthfront realized that many other people wanted a bit of handholding when it came to investments so they built easytouse sites that sought customers’ goals and risk tolerance and then put the money in a portfolio of index or exchangetraded funds to address the question about what these random entrepreneurs know about investing both companies cite decades of research about the right way to construct their collections of investments and rebalance customer holdings when markets rise and fall security is a slightly different question an event like the ponzi scheme perpetrated by bernard l madoff is exceedingly rare but never entirely impossible though thieving financial planners do steal money stored with wellknown thirdparty companies too some faith is necessary with any financial services startup at the same time the power of legacy brand names can allow many financial service companies to collect much more in fees than they deserve betterment charges from 015 to 035 percent of the money under management annually while wealthfront runs the first 10000 without charge and then takes 025 percent annually after that learn vest takes a different approach charging a flat setup fee plus continuing monthly fees for advice about your financial life though it doesn’t make

since they go into index or similar funds trading fees commissions and related charges are included unless otherwise noted some companies are able to absorb them companies that have a range of fees charge less as you give them more money to manage vanguard casts no aspersions on either approach and it may well start a service someday that does exactly what betterment and wealthfront do though its origins are in helping people who want to make their own investment decisions it’s now reacting to the growing number of calls from people who don’t know whether they’ve saved enough and aren’t sure how to start spending what they have saved“they are increasingly saying ‘how can you help me in more of an ongoing advisory capacity’ ” said karin risi a vanguard principal in advice services and asset management “this is a big investment and a big aspirational move to say ‘yes we want to help many more clients’ ” vanguard plans to move existing customers who are already paying 07 percent annually for their advice into the new less expensive service before too long betterment’s new feature feeds a similar need for additional advice jon stein the company’s 34yearold founder and chief executive built a product that he wanted to use but then he started hearing from customers decades older who needed help taking money out as opposed to putting money away to assist them the company created a feature that calculates and can automatically distribute a safe monthly withdrawal you tell it how long you expect to live and your risk tolerance though the tool’s default assumptions are that you will last until 90 that you want a 99 percent chance of not outliving your money and that inflation will run at a 3 percent annual clip then it provides a suggested monthly check that comes from a single betterment account for now the tool can’t optimize withdrawals based on the tax advantages of pulling money from say a regular individual retirement account versus a roth i r a but the company will add that in the future while many traditional financial planners are crossing their fingers and hoping no allout price war breaks out there is already some pricing innovation around the edges new this month is a service called the xy planning network michael kitces a cofounder had long observed an intense frustration among his younger financial planning peers who couldn’t afford to serve average people in their 20s and 30s without pushing bad investments and inappropriate insurance on them the network will pair consumers up with planners who are willing to work on a monthly retainer and make money only from the fees they charge their customers the network is considering teaming up with betterment to handle investments so its planners can focus on all of the other aspects of their customers’ financial lives that potential pairing suggests the possibility that all of these services are in fact complementary and not competitive but you wouldn’t know it by viewing a hysterical video making the rounds in the industry set to spooky music it warns consumers about roboadvisers and reminds them that “you are a person not a number you’re an individual not an algorithm”write a comment still betterment and wealthfront can have their algorithms help run portfolios and human advisers at learn vest and xy planning network and the more traditional financial planning and wealth management firms can hold the hands of beginners and help people as their financial lives get more complex vanguard will try to do it all without charging very much for the privilege and other brandname companies will no doubt jump in with their own efforts not all of these players will survive but their sheer number will probably bring prices down even further or force established advisers to do more to justify their existing fees as long as nobody runs off with the money consumers stand to gain over the long term from all of the people now clamoring to do the best job of helping them out correction april 15 2014the your money column on saturday about online sites that offer inexpensive investment services misstated one of the assumptions in a calculator provided by one such site betterment the calculator’s default setting assumes that users want a 99 percent chance of not outliving their money not a 99 percent chance of outliving their money a chart accompanying the article also misstated in some editions the investment minimum for another site wealthfront the minimum is 5000 not 0 a version of this article appears in print on april 12 2014 on
