silkwood the taut mike nichols drama silkwood 1983 was based on the real life case of a plutonium processing plant metallurgy worker karen silkwood meryl streep who discovered corporate powers were covering up radiation leaks at oklahomas kerrmc gee plant karens whistle blower efforts as a union activist to reveal kerr mc gees possible radiation poisoning of its employees ended tragically karen had been a union activist with the oil chemical and atomic workers union who was a vocal advocate for plant safety reportedly on her way to meet with new york times reporter david burnham karen died in a suspicious onecar accident in november 1974 some believed the accident was actually an intentional murder for karens outspoken critique of kerrmc gee plant safety others blamed karens abuse of alcohol and drugs found in small quantities in her blood nichols film is a wonderfully realistic attempt not to sugarcoat or make karen silkwood into a martyr but to show the reality of her life as a powerless but very human and determined working class woman as streep observed in a 1983 american film interview she wasnt joan of arc at all she was unsavory in some ways and yet she did some very good things in nichols interpretation of karens life karen lives in an unconventional fashion with her boyfriend drew kurt russell and lesbian friend dolly cher in the desolate expanse of rural cimarron oklahoma in addition to her effort to expose negligence at the nuclear plant karen is also engaged in a protracted battle with her former common law husband for time with their three children with a growing sense of determination and purpose silkwood shows karens metamorphosis from an irresponsible directionless woman into someone awakened to the world around her and anxious to fight for a cause silkwood was in the end a triumph of powerful performances from streep cher and russell and a realistic take on the american working class mike spoke of the film as being about people being asleep in their lives and waking up how did i get here and thats exactly how i felt streep told american film i think the movie is about human nature more than about any issue said streep in answer to an american film question about whether making silkwood allowed streep to know karen silkwood the actress responded i get very creepy feelings if i think about it my heart breaks for her she was only twentyeight or twentynine when she died and it was a real waste im really glad i got the chance to try to step into her shoes for a while following her death an autopsy revealed that karen silkwood had plutonium contamination in several organs her family filed a civil suit against kerrmc gee following karens death for inadequate health and safety at the plant which led to her plutonium exposure after years of legal fights the suit was finally settled out of court for 13 million a refugee from nazi germany nichols first discovered movies as a child at his neighborhood cinema where he would flee to avoid his parents constant bickering his film debut in 1966 whos afraid of virginia woolf was one of the box office hits of 1966 and began a career notable for some important highs and some devastating lows as well nichols won his only best director oscar速 one year later for the cultural and generational touchstone the graduate 1967 his next film catch22 1970 was less popular with critics and audiences though carnal knowledge 1971 starring jack nicholson and art garfunkel was widely praised by critics nichols says it is his favorite film two unsuccessful films followed the day of the dolphin 1973 and the fortune 1975 nichols was only able to regain his reputation and prove his talents once again with the release of the enormously successful silkwood in an article in entertainment weekly nichols called it the beginning of me exploring a more fluid less conscious approach to movies the new york times critic vincent canby said silkwood may be the most serious work mr nichols has yet done in films and that would include whos afraid of virginia woolf the graduate and catch22  he considered his next film heartburn 1986 one of his underrated films though mandy patinkin was originally cast to play the carl bernstein role in the film he was eventually replaced at nichols urging with his muchadmired actor jack nicholson nichols was thrilled to discover it was a very agreeable casting change there turned out to be a great deal of chemistry between nicholson and costar meryl streep playing bernsteins wife nora ephron nichols would wait ten more years for a comic blockbuster to measure up to the success of the graduate with 1996s the birdcage starring robin williams and nathan lane as gay boyfriends in a remake of jean poirets french play la cage aux folles which had been made into a 1978 film by edouard molinaro jane fonda who starred in another nuclear power plant thriller the china syndrome 1979 for a time owned the rights to the silkwood story fondas costar in 9 to 5 lily tomlin also auditioned for the role of dolly but the role proved to be tailor made for both cher and for streep but because streep had won a best actress academy award the year before for sophies choice 1982 she was considered an unlikely choice to win again for silkwood despite a remarkable critically praised performance streep lost to shirley mac laine in terms of endearment in fact streep only had 2 12 weeks off between shooting sophies choice and silkwood that incredibly demanding schedule might be attributed to streeps acknowledged reluctance to turn down jobs for fear that the offers would stop coming cher also received great acclaim and a best supporting actress oscar速 nomination for her role as a lesbian in silkwood she lost to linda hunt in the year of living dangerously but cher went on to garner praise for her role in the 1987 romantic comedy moonstruck for which she won a best actress oscar速 silkwood was nominated for a total of 5 oscar速s
