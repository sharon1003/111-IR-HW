following the outbreak of the american civil war when the united states demanded more secure identification from canadians wishing to cross the border they took the form of a letter of request from the governor general of canada these documents remained in use until in 1915 canadian passports were first issued in the british format a ten section single sheet folder 8the modern form of the canadian passport came about in 1921 at that time canadians were british subjects and canada shared a common nationality with the united kingdom thus canadian passports were issued to those british subjects resident in or connected to canada this arrangement ended in 1947 when the canadian citizenship act was granted royal assent and the designation of canadian citizenship was created beginning in july the following year canadian passports were issued to canadian citizens only 9between 1947 and 1970 canadian citizens could only apply for passports by mail to ottawa requirements were simple and applicants claiming birth in canada did not have to provide proof of birth the lax security has led to numerous cases of misuse of the passport so the canadian government tightened the application requirements from 1970 that year the first three passport canada offices were opened in montreal toronto and vancouver 3in 1985 the first version of machinereadable passports mrp was issued in accordance with international civil aviation organization standards an amended version came into circulation in 1991 with additional security features and more stringent processing requirements by

identification page of the booklet holographic images barcoded serial number and a second hidden photo of the bearer that could only be viewed under ultraviolet light canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006 3 in march 2010 the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anticounterfeit elements such as the new colours of optically variable ink and addition of laser perforated number the cover watermark personalization technique and holographic laminate are same with the 2002 version the 2010 version was also the last revision of mrp prior to the release of epassports 10in the 2008 federal budget jim flaherty minister of finance announced that biometric passports epassports would be introduced by 2011 11 a pilot project

freedoms all canadian citizens have the right to enter canada there is a requirement for a canadian citizen to use a canadian passport when entering canada by air since november 10 2016 under the new visa regulations all visafree passport holders except for u s citizens and nationals are required to apply for an electronic travel authorization e ta before boarding a flight to canada as the e ta is used for the sole purpose of immigration screening for noncanadian visitors entering canada on a temporary basis all canadian citizens are automatically barred from applying the e ta hence the passport requirement is in place because a canadian citizen who travels on a visafree noncanadian passport will be prevented from boarding the commercial flight to canada unless he or she can present a valid canadian passport during checkin 13 the only exceptions to this rule are for a canadian citizen travelling on a u s passport as americans do not need an e ta to enter canada or when a canadian

for the future investigation of statements made on the application form 15rules regarding the eligibility of guarantors were last updated on august 12 2013 for passport applicants in canada only a canadian passport holder can be a guarantor for canadian citizens living abroad who do not have a canadian guarantor a noncanadian guarantor so world in a licensed profession may be used for

immigration applications 34under the proposed system modeled after new zealand passport holders would no longer need to return their old passports to cic for cancellation but can instead apply for a new passport online while keeping the old documents before they receive the new ones instead of returning the old passports applicants would be asked to cut the corners of these documents through an honour system 35the new process was expected to be available in november 2015 however the plan was cancelled in october when the use of gcms for passport applications was temporarily suspended due to numerous security glitches in the system 36 ircc permanently suspended the use of gcms for passport applications in february 2016 following an internal audit gcms will not be used for passport applications until all risks which include passport program business requirements are identified and secured 37 38notable cases of misuse  editsince its introduction the canadian passport has been a favorable target of counterfeiters criminals and agents of foreign governments the reasons for such high number of misuses include the relative lax issuance process before 1970 3 the lack of anticounterfeit features in early nonmrp versions and canadian passports high number of visafree countries in 2015 a fake or altered canadian passport can cost as much as us 3000 on the black market

konon molody used a fraudulently obtained passport of deceased canadian arnold lonsdale using this identity he engaged in espionage activities in the united kingdom 40in 1962 three american fugitives who were convicted with narcoticsrelated charges obtained canadian passports to escape to spain at the same year australian government also found a soviet spy ring that was using canadian passports 40in 1968 james earl ray the man who assassinated martin luther king jr used a canadian passport which was obtained with a forged baptismal certificate in the name of ramon george sneyd to temporarily

his passport in which has incorrectly spelled his fake last name as sneya to the canadian embassy in portugal for a replacement under his correct alias the arrest of ray triggered an investigation launched by the royal commission on security in 1969 which recommended much more stringent application requirements and the establishment of passport canada offices 3in 1973 mossad agents killed a waiter in lillehammer norway in the mistaken belief that he was a senior operative for black september the use of false canadian passports by the killers prompted a diplomatic crisis in relations between canada and israel resulting in a commitment by israel not to misuse canadian passports in the future it also resulted in a redesign of the canadian passport to improve its security features 41in 1997 israeli secret service personnel again botched an assassination bid while using canadian passports the attempt against khaled mashal in jordan resulted in the arrest of the wouldbe killers

canadian government six american diplomats were smuggled out of iran using authentic canadian passports containing forged iranian visas in 1980 denial of passport to abdurahman khadr  editin july 2004 abdurahman khadr was denied a canadian passport by governor general adrienne clarkson on the explicit advice of her foreign affairs minister bill graham who stated the decision was in the interest of the national security of canada and the protection of canadian troops in afghanistan the government invoked royal prerogative in order to deny khadrs passport as national security was not at that time listed in the canadian passport order as a ground for refusal shortly thereafter on september 22 2004 section 101 was added to the order which allowed the minister to revoke or refuse a passport due to national security concerns 46 khadr sought judicial review of the ministers decision to refuse his passport and 47 on june 8 of the following year the federal court ruled that the government did not have the power to refuse to issue khadrs passport in the absence of specific authority set out in the canadian passport order but stated in obiter dicta that if the order were to be amended khadr would likely not be able to challenge the revocation 48in 2006 the minister of foreign affairs then peter mac kay again denied khadrs application this time invoking section 101 of the amended canadian passport order 49 section 101 was later challenged in federal court by fateh kamel whose passport had also been refused for national security reasons on march 13 2008 the federal court declared section 101 of the canadian passport order to be unconstitutional and therefore invalid 50 51 though the court suspended its declaration of invalidity for six months in order to allow the government time to amend the order the federal government launched an appeal at the federal court of appeal and a ruling handed down on january 29 2009 overturned the lower court decision the court unanimously agreed the denial of passport service on national grounds is in compliance with the charter of rights and freedoms citing the limitation clause  section 1 as its main decision point 52 53 kamel launched an appeal in 2009 to the supreme court of canada but the court declined to hear his case and thus ended the legality challenge to the canadian passport order 54in 2010 kamel attempted to reapply for a canadian passport but was once again refused by the minister on grounds of national security he sought judicial review but was dismissed by the federal court and subsequently by the federal court of appeal in 2013 55 kamel did not appeal the decision of the federal court of appeal to the supreme court of canada proof of canadian citizenship  edita canadian passport serves as the

andcertificates of retention issued between january 1 1947 and february 14 1977although the provincial or territorial birth certificate is accepted by ircc as valid proof of citizenship section 3 2 of the citizenship act declared that a child born in canada to either parent who was a diplomatic or consular officer or other representative of a foreign country or an employee in the service of such person is not a canadian citizen if neither parent was a canadian citizen or canadian permanent resident at time of the childs birth such persons may be issued canadian passports as their provincial or territorial issued birth certificate are considered as proof of citizenship under the act however they are legally not canadian citizens even if they hold a valid canadian passport the ambiguity on

by the indian high commission at the time of his birth was twice issued a canadian passport under the assumption that he was a canadian citizen by virtue of being born in canada 57 his canadian passport however was cancelled after his criminal convictions in 2010 brought the investigation by citizenship and immigration canada which concluded in 2011 that he was not a canadian citizen but a permanent resident his appeals to the federal courts and subsequently to the supreme court of canada to recognize him as a canadian citizen were denied 58 the indian government claims that he had lost his indian citizenship by obtaining a canadian passport as rule 3 of schedule iii of the citizenship rules 1956 of india states that the fact that a citizen of india has obtained on any date a
