how to regrow your hairlineedges due to the amount of emails i have received on this issue i decided to tackle this subject as soon as possible so here goes  our hair line is perhaps one of the most delicate parts of our hair because the hair around the hairline is usually more fragile as it is may be slightly thinner than the other parts of our hair and more prone to breakage due to manipulationstyling my hairline the primary cause of hair loss around our hairline is because our edges are made to undergo unnecessary stress in various situations such as1 when we do longer term protective styles like braids corn rows weaves and so on and they are done too tight2 when we manipulate our own hair daily into tight buns tight ponytails tight corn rows tight plaits and such3 when lace front wigs or weaves are glued to our very edges i will advise that everyone use other forms of protective styling that do not involve using glue on the hair a telltale sign that your hair style is too tight is when you notice little bumps or even tiny scabs in more serious cases around your fore head therefore the major cause of hair loss around our hair line is traction alopecia which is hair loss caused by pulling the hair too tight other causes of hair loss around our hair line can be attributed to age stress our genes incorrect application of relaxers illness and so on there are several ways to prevent thinning of our hairline which include1 avoiding hair styles that cause unnecessary stress to our edges it is important that weaves and braids are not done too tightly even though we all want the sleek pulled back effect when it comes to our hair buns and ponytails we should make sure they are not too tight and we should endeavour to switch up the position of the bunpony tail ever so often2 not using hard bristle brushes that are meant for brushing out weaves on your hair3 reducing heat usage from blow dryers flat irons on your hair and especially around your edges4 applying relaxers the correct way making sure you are not applying it on previously relaxed hair overlapping and being more careful with the hair around your edges during relaxer application5 caring for our hair and making sure we follow up on all necessary treatments such as deep conditioning hot oil treatments preshampoo treatments and so on6 being healthy making sure you exercise and have proper nutrition in the event where you are however already experiencing hair loss around your edges the following can help to reverse this1 natural oilsgrowth aids applied on edges use a natural oil on your edges such as wura’s secret hair growth oil jojoba oil or castor oil either of these natural oils will provide your hair with much needed nourishment rejuvenation and stimulate the hair follicles to grow faster it is best to use these oils every other day for very severe cases and about once or twice a week for milder cases due to my genes i do not have a very full hair line i however avoid using my wura’s secret hair growth oil on my edges and on the rest of my scalp every other day because i already have longer and thicker hair from applying it to my scalp weekly however i am going to challenge myself to apply this oil all over my scalp including my hair line every other day after my next relaxer so that i can achieve maximum hair growth watch this space2 scalp massages it is important to properly massage these natural oils into the scalp try to dedicate about five  fifteen minutes to massaging your scalp concentrating specifically on your edges this massaging action will stimulate blood flow to your scalp therefore resulting in faster hair growth3 add natural oils to your deep conditioner for a boost to your deep conditioning treatment add natural oils such as wura’s secret hair growth oil jojoba oil or castor oil to your deep conditioners about 1 tablespoon should do and apply on your hair as normal concentrating your efforts on the hair around your edges these oils will result in an increased benefit to your deep conditioner and the heat from deep conditioning will stimulate the hair follicles through deeper penetration during the treatment4 moisturise and seal moisturise your hair with an effective moisturiser and seal with an oil concentrating your efforts on your edges because often times our hair line is neglected when moisturising see my post on how i moisturise and seal my hair here5 use silksatin scarfbonnet it is important to protect the hair after applying the oils and moisturisers the extra heat from covering your hair simulates the products to work more effectively and protects your hair whilst sleeping however the scarf should never be worn too tightly i am always interested in what my readers would like
