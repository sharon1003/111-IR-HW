causes2 symptoms and signs3 treatment and management4 complications5 see also6 references7 external links71 images causes  editiridodialyses are usually caused by blunt trauma to the eye 2 but may also be caused by penetrating eye injuries 3 an iridodialysis may be an iatrogenic complication of any intraocular surgery 4 5 6 and at one time they were created intentionally as part of intracapsular cataract extraction 7 iridodialyses have been reported to have occurred from boxing 8 airbag deployments 9 highpressure water jets 10 elastic bungee cords 11 12 bottle caps opened under pressure 13 water balloons 14 fireworks 15 16 and various types of balls 17symptoms and signs  editthose with small iridodialyses may be asymptomatic and require no treatment but those with larger dialyses may have corectopia or polycoria and experience monocular diplopia glare or photophobia 18 19 20 iridodialyses often accompany angle recession 21 and may cause glaucoma 3 or hyphema 22 hypotony may also occur 23treatment and management  editiridodialysis causing an associated hyphema has to be carefully managed and recurrent bleeds should be prevented by strict avoidance of all sporting activities management typically involves observation and bed rest red blood cells may decrease the outflow of aqueous humor therefore the eye pressure should be kept low by giving oral acetazolamide a diuretic given to reduce intraoccular pressure accidental trauma during sleep should be prevented by patching with an eye shield during night time avoid giving aspirin heparinwarfarin and observe daily for resolution or progression a large hyphema may require careful anterior chamber washout rebleeds may require additional intervention and therapy later surgical repair may be considered for larger avulsions causing significant double vision cosmesis or glare symptoms 19 surgical repair is usually done by 100 prolene suture taking the base of iris avulsion and suturing it to the scleral spur and ciliary body junction complications  editthose with traumatic iridodialyses particularly by blunt trauma are at high risk for angle recession which may cause glaucoma 18 this is typically seen about 100 days or three months after the injury and is thereby called 100day glaucoma medical or surgical treatment to control the iop may be required if glaucoma is present 3 soft opaque contact lenses may be used to improve cosmesis and reduce the perception of double vision 3 18see also  editeye injury references  edit cline d hofstetter hw griffin jr dictionary of visual
