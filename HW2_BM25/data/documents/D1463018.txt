each have a mass of 089 kg and a radius of 11 cm they are given the same angular impulse ie the same torque of 013 nm acting for 78s explain which sphere is rotating faster and why answer to example 3 the moment of inertia of a solid sphere is 25mr 2  that of a spherical shell is 23mr 2 a the angular acceleration of an object is given by newtons second law in rotational form α  τi where τ is torque applied and i is moment of inertia then the angular speed the rate of rotation after time t is given by ω  αt  τti 1thus the less the moment of inertia the more the final rate of rotation since the moment of inertia of the solid sphere is less than of a spherical shell we conclude that when the same torque is acting for the same amount of time the solid sphere will rotate faster b calculations
