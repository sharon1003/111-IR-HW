awkward s themes 12series creator lauren iungerich spent time with actual high school students to elaborate the teen dialogue of the show 13 14 she also met them to talk about their lives and to make sure the show reflects the reality 12citing her writing influences iungerich said she likes friday night lights what jason katims did in five seasons was utterly beautiful the story and who the people truly were came first thats what i sort of took away from it to be so bold as to graduate people and wrap up story lines or allow them to come back in organic ways and to fall in love with the new characters i want to take a lesson from that moving forward im going to take a note from the brave things that he did in that show 12reception  editcritical response  editawkward mostly received positive reviews for its first season 15 at metacritic which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the tv series received an average score of 74 based on 13 reviews which indicates generally favorable reviews 15 the wall street journal  s dorothy rabinowitz explained awkward is a series about a highschool girl thats neither maudlin nor alarming nor conceived with intent to preach or to shock its further distinguished by its focus on entirely recognizable teenage pains as endured by an entirely recognizable teenager jenna ashley rickards its other distinction strong echoes of an older kind of storytelling the sort whose characters grow and acquire depth this is a lot to expect these days from tv writing of any kind much less a series about teenagers—its relief enough when its not about vampires 16 hank stuever of the washington post found that series funny which was a pleasant surprise from mtv the maker of so many lame teen comedies that ive lost count 17 the new york times called awkward as a wry show about longing—for love certainly but also for consistency that great intangible in the evermorphing world of high school life 18 john kubicek of buddy tv website wrote just like easy a mean girls or other strong femalecentric teen comedies awkward has a quick wit and a very distinct vision of the world its the perfect blend of comedy and painful teenage awkwardness and in the end the title says it all he concluded the result is one of the most enjoyable and earnest teen comedies tv has produced 19 writing for the san francisco chronicle david wiegand described the show as a very smart mix of realism and satirical exaggeration and praised the writing for being sharp 20 curt wagner of red eye stated awkward is whipsmart and hilarious while lauding the sharpness of the writing 21with the right amount of exaggerated realism creator lauren iungerich turns all the yearning pain and well awkwardness of high school into a frothy funny satire that should make anyone feel better about their own fumbling ways curt wagner of red eye 21the new york post writer linda stasi gave the show a three stars rating out of four commenting aside from the gratuitous sexual stuff awkward is a really good funny fun show however stasi mentioned this just isnt the kind of thing youd want to watch with your kids—nor want your kids to watch 22 according to the philadelphia daily news  awkward like glee deals gently and semicomically with issues of sexuality and bullying but never really draws blood 23 hit fix s daniel fienberg gave the show a b rating commenting not only are high school horrors pretty universal even if the specifics change but i can find a way to fit awkward into a tradition of hyperliteral high school comedies like pretty in pink or heathers or mean girls or juno its not as good as any of those but its not as bad as jawbreaker which is in the same tradition 24 variety  s brian lowry was less enthusiastic about the show while the premise is refreshingly gimmickfree compared with rj berger or teen wolf the situations arent compelling enough to make this much more than a latterday doogie howser m d with a gender switch 25the character of jenna hamilton has received positive feedback entertainment weekly wrote jenna navigates the sharky waters of high school friends mean cheerleaders and cute boys with a snarky voiceover that makes her—and awkward —easy to fall in love with 25 the huffington post deemed jennas voiceovers witty as  they make this highschool dark comedy stand out from a crowd of stereotypical high school primetime soaps 26 david hinckley of the daily news gave the show a four stars rating out of five and wrote  awkward is very good he explained for all the times weve seen the high school outcast who feels alternately ignored and humiliated by her peer group she has rarely been played better than ashley rickards plays jenna hamilton and went on if the dramas are exaggerated jenna makes the trauma feel legitimate and her narration gives everything a knowing undertone of humor and selfawareness that keeps the most uncomfortable moments from being painful 27 stasi compared ashley rickards to juno actress ellen page rickards is a great teen actress of the ellen page variety—the kind of kid whose pretty face and adorable bearing is swamped by her ability to look awkward and offbeat 22 the washington post wrote of rickards following the welltrod path of molly ringwalds sixteen candles and claire danes s my socalled life she effortlessly manages to elevate the unfresh premise of mtvs new tuesday night comedy series awkward to something that is tawdry yet honest 17other characters performances were also well received by critics kubicek appreciated that the shows villain sadie saxton is not the typical perfect skinny girl but an overweight cheerleader who is popular only thanks to her parents 19critics top ten lists  editfollowing
