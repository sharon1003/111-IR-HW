benefits — and today we explore how it can help strengthen your relationship both emotionally and in the bedroom scroll down for video12ancient yoga scripts advised on postures to tone and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles  these muscles are particularly important for reaching orgasm anecdotal evidence is increasingly being supported by science with recent research suggesting that yoga can improve the sex lives of both men and women enhancing feelings of pleasure and satisfaction as well as emotional closeness to partners in two studies published in the journal of sexual medicine in 2010 more than 100 men and women aged from their mid20s to 60 were enrolled in a 12week yoga camp they were asked to complete questionnaires about their sexual satisfaction before and after the camp the results were unambiguous the scores in all areas of sexual function — arousal satisfaction performance confidence ejaculatory control and orgasm — were significantly improved after yoga practice

first share this article interestingly it was women over the age of 45 who reported the biggest gains when it came to enhanced arousal the yoga poses used in the routines featured in the study were chosen for their potential to improve ‘muscle tone endocrines hormone secreting glands digestion joint movements and mood’ poses identified as sexually stimulating included the bow the wheel the plough the locust the cobra the triangle and the seated forward bend — many of which have been featured earlier in this series some studies have even shown how specific yoga poses can act as aphrodisiacs that produce surges of sex hormones choose your yoga styletoday bikrambikram yoga is a vigorous style done in a room heated to more than 100 degrees — usually 105f405c — which encourages tight muscles to loosen and profuse sweating classes involve doing the same 26 postures in sequence twice including standing poses balancing postures floor exercises and breathing students hold each pose for 3060 seconds its many celebrity fans include gwyneth paltrow george clooney david beckham lady gaga and actress billie piper right many believe it can be helpful for a variety of conditions — from arthritis to depression — and there are plenty of testimonials however these classes are too challenging for many and can be unsafe for older people and anyone with inflammatory or heart conditions one study in the journal human physiology in 2004 established that people who adopted the cobra pose — lying on your front and raising your chest with the support of your arms — experienced a rise in testosterone a hormone associated with sex drive meanwhile in the seventies an indian scientist called katil udupa studied urine samples from a small group of young men before and after six months of yoga training and found their testosterone levels rose significantly this rise in testosterone can help with countering impotency and raising libido of course when some people think about yoga they think of tantric sex and the pop singer sting boasting about being able to make love for hours tantra yoga was an ancient style of meditation but it came to be associated with sex because part of its focus was on how sexual satisfaction could help you achieve spiritual freedom ancient yoga scripts advised on postures to tone and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles — which can improve sensitivity during sex particularly for women these muscles are particularly important for reaching orgasm‘by sitting and contracting and relaxing the front of the pelvic floor — which supports the genitals — the muscles in this area are toned’ says paul fox vice chair of the british wheel of yoga‘in tantra these practices were used to control and heighten sexual response in men and women’ but just as important as the physical connection is the fact that yoga can help connect couples emotionally according to denise knowles sex therapist at relationships charity relate‘like all forms of exercise yoga releases endorphins — feelgood hormones — creating a sense of wellbeing which can enhance relationships’ she says12denise knowles sex therapist at relationships charity relate says any form of exercise can give you more energy and make you less aware of aches and pains both of which can be barriers to a satisfying sex life easy yoga poses you can do at home and on your lunch break loaded progress 000000‘but yoga can be particularly good because it helps you to focus on your body your breath and your sensations and these are all things we would look at in sex therapy — helping people to get in touch with their feelings it relieves stress which is a common cause of problems in relationships and sexual relationships‘we all know that if you’re feeling stressed and as though you’ve got a million things to do your relationship and your sex life are not going to be your top priority‘yoga encourages you to be in the here and now and to let things go focusing on the moment on the things you find pleasurable is very useful in a sexual relationship’like all forms of exercise yoga releases endorphins — feelgood hormones — creating a sense of wellbeing which can enhance relationships denise knowles sex therapist at relationships charity relate there’s also the simple fact that if you do yoga you are toning and energising your body and making it more flexible — all things that are more likely to make you feel more confident‘any type of exercise can improve your body image give you more energy and make you feel less concerned about aches and pains which can be barriers to a satisfying sex life’ says denise‘gentler forms of yoga are particularly good for older people because they are low impact and can be done sitting or lying down‘and of course yoga improves not only strength and flexibility but also circulation — which is important for erections in men and orgasms in women’perhaps it’s best summed up by a female friend of mine who took up yoga recently as she says ‘you feel more comfortable in your own skin better about your body far more sexy and energetic and far far better about having another body beside you i don’t “have a headache” or “need to wash my hair” nearly so often now’before starting any exercise regime you should consult a qualified sports adviser or doctor do not do these exercises if you have a medical condition are on

the lower back and pelvic area yoga poses increase circulation and stamina which can help to strengthen the pelvic floor and boost your sex life your instant guide to talking like a yoga gurubaffled by yoga jargon here are some common sanskrit words and their english translations that you will probably encounter in yoga classes sanskrit is the classical indian language and yoga poses have sanskrit names that can sound offputting at first though you soon get used to them the sanskrit name of almost every pose ends with ‘asana’ so it’s less complicated than it sounds asana originally meant a sitting position in sanskrit but now refers to any posture ayurveda the ancient science of indian medicine chakra literal translation is ‘wheel’ yoga teachers use this term to mean ‘energy centre’ in yoga there are seven of these chakras running from the crown of the head down to the base of the spine each is said to represent different physical and mental attributes drishti the focus

yoga‘i think of the pelvic floor muscles as a hammock which support the bladder bowel and in women the uterus and vagina’ says physiotherapist sammy margo you can feel them by imagining you’re trying to stop yourself midflow while urinating or closing up your bowel to stop a bowel movement if the pelvic floor becomes weakened it’s less supportive and this can lead to problems including incontinence and even prolapse and less sensitivity during sex the good news is that by taking steps to tone and strengthen the pelvic floor as all these poses are designed to do you can prevent incontinence or if you’re already experiencing it can help get things back under control you should also find sex more enjoyable and your orgasms become stronger hold all these poses for five long

counterbalance this helps ensure your body is correctly aligned and enables you to maximise stretches while some classes ask you to partner up for a small number of poses there are also specific

down with clear photos — great for home practice it helps me and my man keep the spark alivejoanne reid rodrigues 52 is an author nutritionist and cognitive behavioural therapist and founder of slimming together a weight control program which she launched in 1986 she lives in jersey with husband zak 56 who works with her they don’t have children joanne says after 32 years of marriage zak and i are still tactile and affectionate and our sex life is more delicious than ever it’s always been great but when you’re in a longterm relationship it’s easy to get a little too comfortable and to lose that spark between you12joanne reid rodrigues 52 pictured says yoga helps her to release negativity and restores her inner balance and vitalityi strongly believe it’s my 14year love of yoga that’s helped maintain the playfulness and flirtation between us for me yoga doesn’t just yield physical benefits such as a leaner more toned and flexible body that of course helps boost my energy and confidence it also brings enormous emotional benefits which i think are key to maintaining the magic in any marriage if ever i feel stressed anxious or sad yoga helps me to release any negativity and restores my inner balance and vitality when zak and i are in the kitchen cooking a meal or we’re out for a long walk i don’t waste time venting my stresses because yoga helps me get rid of them for the daring onlysome people swear by incorporating yoga moves into their lovemaking tantra yoga which treats sex as a spiritual act particularly encourages this and says the mindfulness inspired by yoga is well suited to promoting intimacy and a deep connection in bed some poses yoga practitioners recommend to enhance love making are today’s lying twist and the reclining bound angle pose plus the cat pose and the happy baby pose featured on other days it’s probably not advisable for absolute beginners though instead we’re happy and playful with each other we started dating when i was 20 we used to pass each other in the street every day as i walked home from my job in a record shop in jersey and he walked to the restaurant where he was training as a pastry chef it sounds cliched but the day he came into the shop where i worked and we chatted for the first time there was an immediate and powerful connection — a coup de foudre we married 11 weeks later and my parents though a little shocked thought zak was wonderful and gave us their blessing at the time i was extremely overweight at 13st — i’m only 5ft 1in — and a dress size 20 and i couldn’t believe that a man as handsome as zak would find me attractive at all he’s always been lean and sporty a brilliant swimmer and marathon runner i soon realised that for the sake of my health and emotional wellbeing i had to quit the junk food addiction that saw me eat up to 15 bars of chocolate a day by breaking the cycle and beginning to eat more healthily the weight fell off me then zak encouraged me to get active accompanying me on long walks and playing badminton with me four years after we married i’d shrunk to a size 10 and have remained it ever since although i went to a yoga class a couple of times when i was 25 it was really just stretching i didn’t truly discover yoga and its philosophy until i lived in los angeles from 2001 to 2005 i was surrounded by a fantastic and diverse selection of yoga classes and i fell in love with hot yoga especially bikram performed in temperatures of up to 405c 105f or higher it’s popular with lots of celebrities for the past 14 years i’ve usually done two classes a week — if i’m too busy for a class i do a yoga dvd at home instead many believe that exercising at such high temperatures forces the body to work harder and i love the fact that when my body is warm my muscles stretch further it feels like a better more fulfilling workout i don’t exclusively do yoga i love to swim and power walk too but as part of that mix i think yoga has improved my posture by strengthening my core — i’m prone to slouching at my computer — and toned my body it has also given me a greater sense of sensuality — which has also bolstered by love life — by making me more conscious of my body more aware of the sense of touch although my body is better at 52 than it was at 22 when i was obese i’m not body obsessed and this isn’t why my wonderful love life is enduring yoga makes me feel optimistic and full of life and when you feel good about yourself you’re more inclined to be intimate with your loved one that’s how it is for me just because zak and i aren’t in our 20s any more doesn’t mean we have to forget about that aspect of our relationship it’s so important to keep the romance alive and by that i don’t just mean sex it’s about the warmth of holding hands or snuggling up on the sofa together of enjoying the powerful feeling of touch — something which yoga has enhanced for me gadgets to make your life easierchosen by miranda menzies yoga
