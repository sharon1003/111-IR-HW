labour in british english manual labor in american english or manual work is physical work done by people most especially in contrast to that done by machines and to that done by working animals it is most literally work done with the hands the word manual comes from the latin word for hand  and by figurative extension it is work done with any of the muscles and bones of the body for most of human prehistory and history manual labour and its close cousin animal labour have been the primary ways that physical work has been accomplished mechanisation and automation which reduce the need for human and animal labour in production have existed for centuries but it was only starting in the 18th and 19th centuries that they began to significantly expand and to change human culture to be implemented they require that sufficient technology exist and that its capital costs be justified by the amount of future wages that they will obviate although nearly any work can potentially have skill and intelligence applied to it many jobs that mostly comprise manual labour—such as fruit and vegetable picking manual materials handling for example shelf stocking manual digging or manual assembly of parts—often may be done successfully if not masterfully by unskilled or semiskilled workers thus there is a partial but significant correlation between manual labour and unskilled or semiskilled workers based on economic and social conflict of interest people may often distort that partial correlation into an exaggeration that equates manual labour with lack of skill with lack of any potential to apply skill to a task or to develop skill in a worker and with low social class throughout human existence the latter has involved a spectrum of variants from slavery with stigmatisation of the slaves as subhuman to caste or castelike systems to subtler forms of inequality economic competition often results in businesses trying to buy labour at the lowest possible cost for example through offshoring or by employing foreign workers or to obviate it entirely through mechanisation and automation contents  hide 1 relationship between low skill and low social class11 recognizing the

semiskilled workers despite the fact that nearly any work can potentially have skill and intelligence applied to it for example the artisanal skill of craft production or the logic of applied science  it has always been the case for humans that many workers begin their working lives lacking any special level of skill or experience in the past two centuries education has become more important and more widely disseminated but even today not everyone can know everything or have experience in a great number of occupations it has also always been the case that there was a large amount of manual labour to be done and that much of it was simple enough to be successfully if not masterfully done by unskilled or semiskilled workers which has meant that there have always been plenty of people with the potential to do it these conditions have assured the correlations strength and persistence peasants harvesting crops by flemish artist pieter brueghel 17th century throughout human prehistory and history wherever social class systems have developed the social status of manual labourers has more often than not been low as most physical tasks were done by peasants serfs slaves indentured servants wage slaves or domestic servants for example legal scholar l ali khan analyses how the greeks hindus english and americans all created sophisticated social structures to outsource manual labour to distinct classes castes ethnicities or races 1the phrase hard labour has even become a legal euphemism for penal labour which is a custodial sentence during which the convict is not only confined but also put to manual work such work may be productive as on a prison farm or in a prison kitchen laundry or library intrinsically senseless with the only purpose being the effect of the punishment on the convict or somewhere in between such as chain gang work treadwheel work or the proverbial breaking rocks—the latter two of which are almost certain to be economically senseless today although they sometimes served economic purpose in the preindustrial past there has always been a tendency among people of the higher gradations of social class to oversimplify the partial correlation between manual labour and lack of skill or need for skill into one of equivalence leading to dubious exaggerations such as the notion that anyone who worked physically could be identified by that very fact as being unintelligent or unskilled or that any task requiring physical work must by that very fact be simplistic and not worthy of analysis or of being done by anyone with intelligence or social rank given the human cognitive tendency toward rationalisation it is natural enough that such grey areas partial correlations have often been warped into absolutes  black and white thinking by people seeking to justify and perpetuate their social advantage throughout human existence but most especially since the age of enlightenment there have been logically complementary efforts by intelligent workers to counteract these flawed oversimplifications for example the american and french revolutions rejected notions of inherited social status  aristocracy nobility monarchy  and the labour movements of the 19th and 20th centuries led to the formation of trade unions who enjoyed substantial collective bargaining power for a time such counteractive efforts have been all the more difficult because not all social status differences and wealth differences are unfair meritocracy is a part of real life just as rationalisation and unfairness are social systems of every ideological persuasion from marxism to syndicalism to the american dream have attempted to achieve a successfully functioning classless society in which honest productive manual labourers can have every bit of social status and power that honest productive managers can have humans have not yet succeeded in instantiating any such utopia but some social systems have been designed that go far enough toward the goal that hope yet remains for further improvement rail track construction kansas usa 1974at its highest extreme the rationalised distortion by economic elites produces cultures of slavery and complete racial subordination such as slavery in ancient greece and rome slavery in the united states which was defeated in 1865 or slavery under nazism which was defeated in 1945 concepts such as the threefifths compromise and the untermensch defined slaves as less than human in the middle of the spectrum such distortion may produce systems of fairly rigid class stratification usually rationalised with fairly strong cultural norms of biologically inherited social inequality such as feudalism traditional forms of aristocracy and monarchy colonialism and caste systems eg apartheid separate but equal  jim crow indian caste  one interesting historical trend that is true of all of the systems above is that they began crumbling in the 20th century and have continued crumbling since todays forms of them are mostly greatly weakened compared to past generations versions at the lowest extreme such distortion produces subtler forms of racism and de facto but not de jure inequality of opportunity the more plausible the deniability the easier the rationalisation and perpetuation for example as inequality of opportunity and racism grow smaller and subtler their appearance may converge toward that of meritocracy to the point that valid instances of each can be found extensively intermingled at such areas of the spectrum it becomes ever harder to justify efforts that use de jure methods to fight de facto imbalances such as affirmative action  because valid instances can be highlighted by all sides on one side the cry is ongoing oppression ignored or denied from above on the other side the cry is reverse discrimination ample valid evidence exists for both cases and the problem of its anecdotal nature leaves no clear policy advantage to either side recognizing the potential for skill although manual labor is often stigmatized as lacking specific skills or intelligence there are a variety of cognitive functions that it can require contextual application manual laborers must know procedures and be able to implement them while also being flexible to work within specific parameters for example servers must not only know all the set procedures for taking orders and carrying food but they must also be able to react and adapt to their changing environments including the number of customers specific requests potential allergies etc similarly cosmetologists must know the properties and mechanics of cutting hair while also staying up to date on fashion trends and balancing what each customer wants with what the stylist believes is feasible other occupations such as carpentry plumbing and welding involve familiarity with tools and vocabulary as well as the ability to apply those skills to specific tasks typically requiring problem solving and critical thinking 2situational awareness and interpersonal skills manual laborers must be aware of their surroundings and develop excellent spatial understanding as well as effective communication skills as an example servers have to multitask and effectively manage their time between taking orders obtaining the food from the kitchen dealing with the receipts and participating in small talk with the customers carpenters and plumbers also develop disciplined perception as well as sensory kinesthetic and cognitive abilities that are maximized even with limited physical space cosmetologists must learn to read their clients by listening to what styles they envision while also observing nonverbal cues about their likes and dislikes and this often involves being personable and friendly 3innovation manual labor is surprisingly creative and dynamic involving using what is already known to create something entirely new and unique cosmetologists infuse their own ideas into their hairstyles combining what is known about different hair types and methods of hair cutting with their personal tastes and experiences carpenters similarly emphasize craftsmanship in their work attending to precision to ensure that the end products are aesthetically pleasing as well as structurally sound even welding is aesthetic with individual welders considering their markings to be similar to artists tags 4a willingness to recognise that manual labour can involve skill and intelligence can take a variety of forms depending on how it handles multifaceted questions of dignity and inequality in its healthier forms it recognises the dignity and intelligence of bluecollar workers that is that 5 those workers as a group have just as much potential for dignity and intelligence despite the fact that any individual workers may or may not display such traits and it recognises their civil and civic equality with whitecollar workers yet it simultaneously leaves room in society for meritocracy allowing both upward and downward social mobility as a sustainable meritocracy requires an example of such systems is provided by wellrun instances of professional sports teams because there is a perennial meritocratic turnover of players coaches and staff both within the sport and as input and output through its boundaries whereby all participants have dignity even though all of the required talents may not exist in each individual for example the talents of the physical therapists statisticians elderly coaches and young adult players are not equal but they are complementary from a systems engineering perspective in its more pathological forms it may only admit that there can be a science of manual labour but not acknowledge or allow adequate social mobility both upward and downward between the bluecollar and whitecollar classes on the other hand and equally pathologically it may willfully deny the natural differences between individuals allowing no hope for meritocratic justice which is not only dispiriting to talented and hardworking people but also highly injurious to macroeconomic performance an example of the first pathology is that the earliest forms of applying science to the practical processes of industry and commerce fell victim to an incomplete understanding as exemplified by frederick winslow taylors version of the science of shoveling 6 taylor correctly recognised that the physical athletic talents for shoveling on one hand and the mental talents for analyzing and synthesizing best shoveling techniques and workflows on the other often would not coexist in the same person some people would have only the first others only the second therefore speaking metaphorically players usually should not be their own coaches unfortunately taylor stepped from that valid realisation to envisioning a system of business administration that might easily have failed to filter people into the right roles based on their individual talents or lack thereof taylors versions of scientific management had they succeeded in persisting may well have eventually left some smart people stranded in an underclass crassly equated with draft animals 7 which was fashionable at the time at the same time that it let some incompetent but silver spooned people remain in positions of middle or senior management whether taylor was capable of predicting and preventing that problem is unclear but it is clear that not all of his imitators and admirers were thus capable an example of the second pathology are 20thcentury variants of communism such as leninism and stalinism somewhere between the extremes of health and pathology mentioned above are the realities in most developed economies today where various themes and tendencies are in constant competition and people disagree on which ones predominate and what actions should be taken if any to try to even the balance or reduce the pathologies formal learning and training formal learning scenarios such as vocational classrooms apprenticeships and academic studies supply a theoretical approach to building skillsets learners acquire a systematic and procedural view of tasks based on the specific parameters and needs of a jobs intended outcome the parameters are defined by the purpose of the job and the tools used to achieve it hair styling for example requires learners to gain competence in the methods of shaping cutting washing dying combing and various other active manual skills the proficiency of which will determine the final product in such situations the learner is guided and directed by educators in their technique and form and learn to interpret a tool’s use in meeting the requirements of a task or project based on the expectation of the result informal learning and training informal learning can be summarized as any activity which concerns the pursuit of understanding knowledge or skill that occurs without an imposed curriculum and explicit assessment it typically manifests itself as practical engagement in the pursuit of knowledge there are several ways which informal learning is conducted that range from selfdirected learning observational learning where there is intention to seek specific information outside of formal environments to the coincidental learning that comes out of experiences informal training differs from informal training in that it focuses on the acquisition of a skill understanding or jobspecific knowledge the cognitive skills acquired outside of formal learning environment also help to define the mastery of what are considered  blue collar  jobs the understanding of technique and method taken from formal training is expanded on in developing contextual application situational awareness and innovation based skills informal learning provides workers with opportunities of cognitive development unique to their fields context that knowledge of context derived from past experiences in comparable situations dictates the use of one technique or plan over another plumbing as an example requires knowledge of piping and the mechanics of water systems but also relies on details such as house age the materials from which the specific plumbing system is made how those materials react given different external changes or alterations and a comprehension of hypothetical conditions and the resulting behavior of the problem and other related components when said conditions are brought into effect 8 these skills and understandings are inherent in both learning processes as a whole this type of knowledge is more learnercentered and situational in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce relationship to mechanisation and automation mechanisation and automation strive to reduce the amount of manual labour required for production the motives for this reduction of effort may be to remove drudgery from peoples lives to lower the unit cost of production or as mechanisation evolves into automation to bring greater flexibility easier redesign lower lead time to production mechanisation occurred first in tasks that required either little dexterity or at least a narrow repertoire of dextrous movements such as providing motive force or tractive force  locomotives traction engines marine steam engines early cars trucks and tractors  digging loading and unloading bulk materials  steam shovels early loaders  or weaving uncomplicated cloth early looms  for example henry ford described his efforts to mechanise agricultural tasks such as tillage as relieving drudgery by transferring physical burdens from human and animal bodies to iron and steel machinery 9 automation helps to bring mechanisation to more complicated tasks that require finer dexterity decision making based on visual input and a wider variety of intelligent movements thus even tasks that once could not be successfully mechanised such as shelf stocking or many kinds of fruit and vegetable picking tend to undergo process redesign either formal or informal leading to ever smaller amounts of manual labour relationship to offshoring worker migration penal labour and military service many of the methods by which socioeconomically advantaged people have maintained a supply of cheap labour over the centuries are now either defunct or greatly curtailed as discussed and linked earlier these include peasantry serfdom slavery indentured servitude wage slavery or domestic servitude but motives to get labour cheaply still remain and always will  today although businesses can no longer get away with using for example de jure slavery economic competition ensures that they will always try to buy labour at the lowest possible cost or to obviate it entirely through mechanisation and automation various presentday methods of ensuring lowest cost exist as detailed below the first and most basic method is the domestic labour market within one country or region thereof in which workers compete with each other for jobs within this market further market segmentation is possible businesses try to avoid overtime when practical they often try to avoid employing fulltime employees ftes in favor of parttime employees ptes or contingent workers for example temporary workers freelancers cottage workers contractors who may have subcontractors  or day labourers  all of which usually entail less obligation for employee benefits compensation beyond the wages themselves agencies tasked with enforcing labour law are supposed to be perennially on guard against the avidity with which employers find clever ways to make people function like ftes but carry nominal labels as contractors freelancers or ptes eg dishonest worker classification unpaid overtime other avenues of discount labour are the institutions of apprenticeship and cooperative education including workstudy programs and relatedly the informal tradition of the broke college student who works for peanuts  here the low wages are often credibly justified by the inexperience and incomplete training of the worker but it is also true that such forms of employment always have at least some potential to be milked dry by those with the upper hand for example there has been a long history of 3rd through 7thyear apprentices performing valuable competent work at sub journeyman rates1894 illustration of chain gang performing manual labor the domestic labour market may also extend beyond normal workers to various kinds of employing prisoners eg penal labour work release  even military employment most especially by conscription or other mandatory national service is a means of employing labour at lowest cost compared to costlier alternatives such as allvolunteer militaries  the next step beyond domestic labour markets within countries is the global labour market between countries in which all workers on earth compete with each other albeit via imperfect competition differences between regions and countries in standard of living and relatedly prevailing wage rates provide a perennial incentive for businesses to send manual tasks to remote workers via offshoring or to bring remote workers to the manual tasks via immigration of foreign workers whether illegal  undocumented workers or legal guestworker programs codified with work permits  the nature of the work determines its relative degree of geographical transferability for example manual assembly work in factories can usually be offshored whereas tillage and harvesting are anchored to the location of the crop fields one characteristic of offshoring and worker migration that is especially useful to businesses is that they can provide employers with fuzzyboundaried subpopulations of inexpensive workers without resorting to biologicalinheritancebased rationalisations such as racial slavery feudalism and aristocracy or castebased division of labour  modern businesses in the global economy are quick to point out that they respect the humanity of their offshore or immigrant workers every bit as much as that of their developedeconomynative workers which may not be that much in reality but is equal and is pretended to be substantial penal labour is an intersection of the low skilllow social class idea serfs slaves wage slaves and the classneutral labourcost reduction idea offshoring foreign workers contingent workers like offshoring and guest worker programs penal labour is an opportunity for businesses to get cheap manual labour without denying the humanity of the workers—and in some cases even seeming civically responsible providing second chances to live right and work honestly thus socioeconomic systems regardless of their capitalist socialist or syncretised ideological bases need to remain vigilant that they resist any tendency toward the overimprisonment of workers because it could align with the financial interests of businesses government or both stoking the same human mechanisms of specious rationalisation that justified slavery or wage slavery military enlistment whether conscription other mandatory service or volunteer service shares some similarities with penal labour when viewed from this perspective in that it may synergistically provide 1 discount labour for a government or its contractors at the same time that it also provides 2 opportunities to the workers or soldiers themselves for example more job security betterquality health insurance betterquality retirement savings plans andor more educational opportunities most especially technical training but sometimes also broader university education as well these many benefits cannot accurately be pigeonholed as all good or all bad they are inevitably doubleedged blades and must be dynamically managed and monitored to keep them from leaving the healthy range of the spectrum and moving into pathological ranges for that to succeed there must also exist some decent level of employment opportunity compensation and psychological security in the private sector especially non– defense community businesses paramilitary police and corrections prison guard service are other segments of employment that reflect the traits of military service in this respect see also construction worker elbow grease industrialisation proletariat roughneck shadow work the idler 1993the south african wine
