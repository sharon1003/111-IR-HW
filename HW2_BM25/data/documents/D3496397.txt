the outset of the story 3 the narrator tells us that from an early age he has loved animals he and his wife have many pets including a large beautiful black cat as described by the narrator named pluto this cat is especially fond of the narrator and vice versa their mutual friendship lasts for several years until the narrator becomes an alcoholic one night after coming home completely intoxicated he believes the cat to be avoiding him when he tries to seize it the panicked cat bites the narrator and in a fit of rage he seizes the animal pulls a penknife from his pocket and deliberately gouges out the cats eye from that moment onward the cat flees in terror at his masters approach at first the narrator is remorseful and regrets his cruelty but this feeling soon gave place to irritation and then came as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow the spirit of perverseness he takes the cat out in the garden one morning and ties a noose around its neck hanging it from a tree where it dies that very night his house mysteriously catches fire forcing the narrator his wife and their servant to flee the premises the next day the narrator returns to the ruins of his home to find imprinted on the single wall that survived the fire the apparition of a gigantic cat with a rope around the animals neck at first this image deeply disturbs the narrator but gradually he determines a logical explanation for it that someone outside had cut the cat from the tree and thrown the dead creature into the bedroom to wake him during the fire the narrator begins to miss pluto feeling guilty some time later he finds a similar cat in a tavern it is the same size and color as the original and is even missing an eye the only difference is a large white patch on the animals chest the narrator takes it home but soon begins to loathe even fear the creature after a time the white patch of fur begins to take shape and to the narrator forms the shape of the gallows this terrifies and angers him more and he avoids the cat whenever possible then one day when the narrator and his wife are visiting the cellar in their new home the cat gets under its masters feet and nearly trips him down the stairs enraged the man grabs an axe and tries to kill the cat but is stopped by his wife − whom out of fury he kills instead to conceal her body he removes bricks from a protrusion in the wall places her body there and repairs the hole a few days later when the police show up at the house to investigate the wifes disappearance they find nothing and the narrator goes free the cat which he intended to kill as well has also gone missing this grants him the freedom to sleep even with the burden of murder on the last day of the investigation the narrator accompanies the police into the cellar they still find nothing significant then completely confident in his own safety the narrator comments on the sturdiness of the building and raps upon the wall he had built around his wifes body a loud inhuman wailing sound fills the room the alarmed police tear down the wall and find the wifes corpse and on its rotting head to the utter horror of the narrator is the screeching black cat as he words it i had walled the monster up within the tomb publication history  editthe black cat was first published in the august 19 1843 issue of the saturday evening post at the time the publication was using the temporary title united states saturday post 4 readers immediately responded favorably to the story spawning parodies including thomas dunn english s the ghost of the grey tadpole 5analysis  editlike the narrator in poes  the telltale heart  the narrator of the black cat has questionable sanity near the beginning of the tale the narrator says he would be mad indeed if he should expect a reader to believe the story implying that he has already been accused of madness 6the extent to which the narrator claims to have loved his animals suggests mental instability in the form of having “too much of a good thing” his partiality for animals substitutes “the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man” since the narrator’s wife shares his love of animals he likely thinks of her as another pet seeing as he distrusts and dislikes humans additionally his failure to understand his excessive love of animals foreshadows his inability to explain his motives for his actions 7one of poes darkest tales the black cat includes his strongest denunciation of alcohol the narrators perverse actions are brought on by his alcoholism a disease and fiend which also destroys his personality 8 the use of the black cat evokes various superstitions including the idea voiced by the narrators wife that they are all witches in disguise poe owned a black cat in his  instinct vs reason  a black cat  he stated the writer of this article is the owner of one of the most remarkable black cats in the world  and this is saying much for it will be remembered that black cats are all of them witches 9 in scottish and irish mythology the cat sìth is described as being a black cat with a white spot on its chest not unlike the cat the narrator finds in the tavern the titular cat is named pluto after the roman god of the underworld the doppelgänger – see also  william wilson guilt – see also  the telltale heart although pluto is a neutral character at the beginning of the story he becomes antagonistic in the narrator’s eyes once the narrator becomes an alcoholic the alcohol pushes the narrator into fits of intemperance and violence to the point at which everything angers him – pluto in particular who is always by his side becomes the malevolent witch who haunts him even while avoiding his presence when the narrator cuts pluto’s eye from its socket this can be seen as symbolic of selfinflicted partial blindness to his own vision of moral goodness 7the fire that destroys the narrator’s house symbolizes the narrator’s almost complete moral disintegration 7 the only remainder is the impression of pluto upon the wall which represents his unforgivable and incorrigible sin 7from a rhetoricians standpoint an effective scheme of omission that poe employs is diazeugma or using many verbs for one subject it omits pronouns diazeugma emphasizes actions and makes the narrative swift and brief 10adaptations  editin 1910–11 futurist artist gino
