gut healing efforts should first and foremost consider the importance of our microscopic partners in wellness this is one of many reasons to incorporate essential oils in the healing process these digestive oils are typically safe for the microbial balance when used properly key gut issues affected by essential oils especially with antibacterial oils it’s important to use oils appropriately in order to promote healing and avoid overuse while not every gut health concern is best addressed with essential oils there are some that certainly align well here are four issues that are treated well with essential oils ibs our collective knowledge about irritable bowel syndrome ibs has grown substantially over the years at one point it was simply a catchall term or a lack of a diagnosis now not only is it considered an official diagnosis for a specific condition but estimates assume that more than 70 of those affected will never present it to their doctor lifestyle diet and medication are used for ibs management and essential oils are up and coming as additional tools for coping the most studied oil in this case is peppermint essential oil usually in the form of entericcoated capsules a 2008 review of these studies found the oil to be just as effective as antispasmodic medication in many cases sibo  dysbiosis a state of dysbiosis is the term for a tilted balance in the gut’s microbial life if it escalates far enough a condition like sibo small intestine bacterial overgrowth can ensue when this happens colonic bacteria move into the small intestine – not where they belong this kind of imbalance can be connected with common gut issues like ibs treatments for symptoms that damage beneficial bacteria would only further the problem that’s why it’s so important to always consider the balance of gut health when treating other issues when essential oils are able to relive the symptoms of overgrowth without damaging the good bacteria they become a powerful tool for healing in 2009 a study evaluated multiple essential oils including caraway lavender and bitter orange for their effects on gut dysbiosis while still protecting beneficial bacteria in the body as researchers continue to dive deep with essential oils to determine ideal combinations and doses we can enjoy their gentle yet effective nature gerd not strictly the gut but still part of digestive tract wellness gerd is a substantial problem as evidenced by the thousands of dollars spent on antacids each year with the esophagus and stomach being first stops along the digestive tract gerd is one of the first indications of digestive upset the more severe form of acid reflux − gerd − can be an indication of either an excess or deficiency of stomach acid among other causes gerd is heavily affected by food choices lifestyle habits and bacterial exposure or colonization protective essential oils can help manage detrimental microbes and heal or preserve the lining of the stomach culinary preparations that include essential oils are excellent choices in this case introducing the oil to the stomach alongside the diet ginger essential oils for example was indicated for antioxidant boosting and protective effects when paired with turmeric essential oil the increased antioxidant levels helped to protect the wall of the stomach which is important for damage prevention when gerd is an issue nausea usually a symptom more than a standalone issue nausea can be as mild as an annoying complication to as strong as a debilitating condition thinking back to the last time you were nauseous how much did scent affect how you felt inhaled essential oils take advantage of this direct line between scent and nausea with multiple oils found to be effective for relief lemon essential oil for example tested well for individuals with morning sickness combinations of peppermint and ginger are usually effective as well using essential oils to heal your gut more than ever we have an endless stream of information right at our fingertips giving us access to information that can help us understand our bodies and ways to manage health with that information comes a caution that disease states are still serious conditions that should be approached with care and usually with the guidance of a physician the notation that natural products are “not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease” may make us bristle but it’s a reminder to take disease seriously approach essential oils with the care and respect that both they and your body deserve and seek guidance from qualified practitioners that being said these essential oils have a growing record of efficacy and general safety and form an excellent base for efforts in healing the gut with essential oils cumin –
