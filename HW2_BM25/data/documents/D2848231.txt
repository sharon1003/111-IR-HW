space available for breeding reduces territorial competition homeostasis allows them to avoid climate extremes aves 9700 species outnumber any other vertebrate group except fishes feathers distinguish them from any other vertebrate have wings hind limbs for walking swimming or perching have keratinized beaks and lay eggs flight greatly restricts morphological diversity repsiratory system has to serve as a thermoregulative device must have finely tuned nervous system and acute senses ancestral bird teeth long bony tail clawed fingers abdominal ribs feathers archaeopteryx lithographic  birds and reptiles skulls abut against the first neck vertebra by a single occipital condyle middle ear bone stapes lower jaw consisting of 56 bones mammals have 2 the dentary uric acid similar yolk eggs with the early embryo developing on the surface by shallow cleavage divisions dromeosaurs  a group of therapies that includes the velociraptor had feathers a furcula and lunate wrist honest that later permit flight could not fly bc they had symmetrical feathers probably used for thermoregulation and camouflage or courtships more derived dromeosaurs like the microraptor used their feathers for jumping and gliding off trees fossils from spain and argentina document the development of the keeled sternum and alula loss of teeth and fusion of bones characteristic of modern birds neornithes living birds divided into 2 groups 1 paleognathe ancient jaw the large flightless ostrichlike birds and kiwis often called ratite birds which have a flat sternum and poorly developed pectoral muscles 2 neognathe all other birds nearly all of which are frightful flightlessness almost always has evolved on islands lacking large terrestrial predators flightless birds on large continents are large to outrun predatorsfeathers contour feathers most typical of birds veined feathers that cover and streamline the birds body consists of a hollow quill or calamus emerging from a skin follicle and a shaft or rachis which bears numerous barbs that form a flat expansive webbed surface called the vane barbs appear to be miniature feathers with numerous parallel filaments called barbules there may be 600 barbules on each side of a barb with more than 1 million per feather you can zip and unzip the barbules types of feathers contour flight feathers contour feathers that extend beyond the body filoplume feahter hairlike degenerate feathers each is a weak sharft with a tuft of short barbs at the tip no known function hairs of a plucked fowl down feathers soft tufts wo a permanent rachis hidden behind contour feathers  soft bc their barbules lack hooks especially on breast and abdomen of water birds and on young conserve heat powderdown feathers highly modified feathers herons bitterns hawks and parrots tips disintegrate as they grow releasing a talclike powder that helps to waterproof the feathers and give them a metallic luster charcteristics of class aves 1 body usually spindleshaped with 4 divisions head neck trunk and tail neck elongate and sshaped 2 forelimbs modified as limbs hindlims adapted for perching walking or swimming foot with 4 toes 23 in some 3 epidermal covering of feathers and leg scales think integument of epidermis and derails no sweat glands oil or preen gland at base of tail pinna of ear rudimentary 4 fully ossified skeleton with air cavities skull bones fused with one occipital condyle skill diapsid with ant orbital fenestra each jaw covered with a keratinized sheath forming a beak no teeth ribs ribs with strengthening uncinate processes tail short caudal vertebrae reduced to pygostyle sternum usually well developed with keel single bone in middle ear 5 nervous system well developed with 12 pairs of cranial nerves and brain with large cerebellum and optical lobes 6 circulatory system of 4 chambered heart with 2 atria and 2 ventricles separate pulmonary and systematic circuits right aortic arch persisting nucleated red blood cells 7 endothermic 8 respiration by slightly expasible lungs parabronchi with thin air sacs among the visceral organs skeleton syrinx voice box near junction of trachea and bronchi 9 excretory system of metanephric kidneyl ureters open into cloaca no bladder semisolid urine uric acid main nitrogenous waste 10 sexes separate testes paired with the vas deferens opening into the cloaca females with functional left ovary and oviduct only copulatory organ penis in ducks geese palegnathids and a few others 11 fertilization internal amniotic eggs with much yolk and hard calcareous shells incubation external young active at hatching precocial or helpless and naked altricial sex determination by chromosomes females heterogameticorigin and development feather is homologous to a reptiles scales feather bud rolls into a hollow cylinder and partly sinks into the follicle from which it is growing hollow cylinder has 2 layers of epidermis a protective sheath and an inner layer that becomes the rachis and barbs as a feather enlarges and nears the end of its growth the soft rachis and barbs are transformed into hard structures by deposition of keratin the protective sheath splits apart allowing the end of a feather to protrude and barbs to unfold molting when fully grown a feather is dead except in penguins which molt all at once feathers are lost gradually flight and tail feathers are lost in exact pairs one from each side to maintain balance replacements emerge before feathers are shed water birds lose all their primary feathers at once and are grounded during the molt many prepare for molting by moving to isolated bodies of water nearly all birds molt once a year usually in late summer after a nesting season feather color pigmentary red orange and yellow feathers pigments are called lip chromes deposited in feather barbules black brown red brown and gray colors are formed from melanin blue feathers depend on light scattering of shorter wavelengths usually underlain by melanin look same from any angle green color are a combination of yellow pigment and blue feather structure iridescint color is a structural color is based on interference that causes light waves to reinforce weaken or cancel each other change with angle of view skeleton light sturdy pnuematized bones skeleton weighs less than the feathers bird skulls are so specialized its hard to see the diapsid condition skull light and fused into one piece yet the skeleton is no lighter than a mammals of the same size the difference is that the heavies part of the skeleton is in the legs lowers the center of gravity  aerodynamic stability most birds have kinetic skills with a flexible attachment between upper jaw and skull most vertebrae except the clavicles are fused together fused caudal vertebrae  pygostyle fused trunk  synsacrum provides rigidity ribs braced against each other with uncinate processes keel provides attachment for powerful flight muscles fused clavicles  furcula stores energy as it flexes during wing beats bones of forelimbs are reduced in  and are often fused together has arm forearm wrist and fingersmuscular skeleton massive locomotor muscles largest  pectorals depresses wings in flight its antagonist is the supracoracoideus raises the wing positioned under the pectorals ropeand pulley arrangement both attached to keel positioning the main muscle mass low in the body improves aerodynamic stability feet are nearly devoid of muscles places main muscles mass near center of gravity feet are highly resistant to freezing when perched  toe locking mechanism is activated same mechanism used in catching prey birds have lost the long ancestral tail have substituted a pincushionlike muscle into which the tail feathers are rooted as many as 1000 most complex muscular system  neck food feeding and digestion frist birds were carnivorous feeding on insects there is a bird to hunt almost every insect nearly 15 feed on nectar some are omnivores euryphagous wideeating will eat whatever is seasonally abundant others are specialists stenophagous narrow eating survival may be jeopardized if food source is lost beaks strongly adapted to habits birds actually eat a lot small birds actually eat more than large ones cuz of metabolic rate hummingbirds eats 100 of its body weight if the food source contains water they have to eat even more process food rapidly and thoroughly bc they have no teeth they require grinding in gizzard crop stores gizzard after hatching young are often fed regurgitated food from crop stomach consists of 2 compartments proventriculus secretes gastric juice and a muscular gizzard birds swallow pebbles to aid in grinding process owls often eject pellets of indegistble material through mouth ceca at end of digestive tract serve as fermentation chambers in herbivorous birds  in young birds the dorsal wall of the cloace bears the bursa of fabricius which process lymphocytes that are important to immune response circulatory system evolved independently but similar to mammals complete separation of respiratory and systematic circulations but the right aortic arch instead of left leads to the dorsal aorta heartbeat is extremely fast blood pressure is similar to mammals blood contains nucleated biconvex erythrocytes phagocytes mobile ameboid cells of the blood efficient in repairing wounds respiratory system finest beaches of the bronchi rather than ending in saclike alveoli as in mammals are developed as tubelike parabronchi through which air flows continuously 9 interconnecting air sacs connect to the lungs in that much of the inspired air bypasses the lungs posterior air sacs serve as reservoirs for fresh air on expiration  oxygenated air is passed through lungs and stored in the anterior sacs helps to cool the bird also air sacs provide bouyancy excretory system metanephric kidneys glomerular filtration urine passes from ureters to cloaca no urinary bladder bird kidneys less efficient than mammals in removing solutes sodium potassium and chloride cant concentrate solutes to compensate for this disability use salt glands to excrete salts located above eye of sea birds perpetual runny nose size of gland depends on how much salt they have nervous and sensory system cerebral hemisphers cerebellum and optic loves cerebral cortex is poorly developed enlarged dorsoventricular ridge eating singing flying and complex reproductive behavior smell and taste are poor in some but good in others like carnivores water birds and flightless birds ear  external eardrum middle collumella and inner cochlea much shorter than mammals do not hear high frequency sounds well hear pitch and frequencies better than us eye larger less spherical and immobile pecten provides nutrients and oxygen to eye sclerotic ring strengthens and focuses the eye position of eye birds habits many carnivorous birds have 2 fovea good color vision can see uv wavelenths flight 2 hypothesis 1 birds flew by jumping from tree to ground favored but dromeosaurs were to big or 2 flapping their wings from ground 3 used wings for climbing bird wing as lift device must generate lift force medial wing feathers must provide propulsion forward distal part of wing wing streamlined in cross section with a slightly concave lower surface cambered and with small tightfitting feathers where leading edge meets air positive pressure above wing provides some lift but negative pressure above wing  23 of total lift air farther and faster over the convex wings lift to drag ratio of an airfoil is determined by the angle of attack tilt and the airspeed at high speeds sufficient lift is generated so that the wing is held at a low angle of attach creating less drag as speed decreases  lift increases  angle of attack increased angle of attach too high  turbulence stalling stalling can be delayed by placing a wing slot along the leading edge directs a layer of rapidly moving air across upper wing surface 2 kinds of wing slots 1 alula group of feathers on the thumb 2gaps between the primary feathers flapping flight two forces required vertical lifting secondary feathers to support birds weight and horizontal thrusting primary feathers to move bird forward greatest power applied on downstroke basic forms of bird wings elliptical wings low aspect ration both alula and gaps between primary feathers change course fast high aspect ration wings swallows hummingbirds or swifts long migrations tip vortex dragcreating turbulence at wing tips at faster speeds fast birds slender tips no wing slots and sweepback dynamic soaring wings no wing slots long narrow wings albatross high lift wings wing slots allula broad wing vultures hawks owls carry heave loads intermediate aspect ration land soarers migration routes most birds breed in northern hemisphere where most land mass in concentrated migrate south for northern winter and north to nest during northern summer exceptions are seabirds some take a long time some short aquatic birds smaller species migrate at night and feed by day many birds follow landmarks some have wide migration lanes artic terns have long distance migrations stimulus for migration closely related to season lengthening of days in winter and early spring stimulate development of gonads and accumulate of fat release of pituitary gonadotropic hormone sets in motion behavioral changes courtship care for youngdirection finding in migraton sight hghly accurate sense of time earths magnetic field celestial cues sunazimuth orientation no innate sense of direction social behavior and reproduction togetherness greater ease in finding mate less opportunity for individual straying breeding seasons  higher interactions reproductive system in breeding season testes enlarge greatly 300x most species lack a penis press cloacal surfaces together in females only the left ovary and oviduct develop eggs discharged from ovary enter the infundibulum while passing down the oviduct albumin egg white is added to the egg father down shell is added eggs can occasionally be fertile for as long as 30 days mating systems monogamy individual has only one mate 90 polygamy more than 1 mate during breeding season some choose partners for life males often help female with care for young often unfaithful with each other male has many female mates lek collective display mating ground polyandry many males with one female male incubates the eggs nesting and care for young birds try to conceal nests precocial young water birds covered with down and can run or swim as soon as plumage is dry altricial young naked unable to see or walk at birth remain in nest for week or more need constant care grow faster bird populations and their conservation popultations vary in size from year to years food supplies lead poisoning of water fowl  side effect of hunting loss of songbirds
