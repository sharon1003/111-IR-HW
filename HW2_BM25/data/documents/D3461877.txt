vertical blue lines show barriers toilets safe water hygiene and handwashing the fecal–oral route or oral–fecal route or fecal oral route describes a particular route of transmission of a disease pathogens in fecal particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person main causes of fecal–oral disease transmission include lack of adequate sanitation leading to open defecation  and poor hygiene practices if soil or water bodies are polluted with fecal material humans can be infected with waterborne diseases or soiltransmitted diseases fecal contamination of food is another form of fecaloral transmission washing hands properly after changing a baby’s diaper or going to the bathroom can prevent diseases from spreading the common fecaloral routes are fingers flies fields fluids and food analingus the sexual practice of licking or inserting the tongue into the anus of a partner is another route diseases caused by fecaloral transmission include diarrhea typhoid cholera polio

background  editvillagers during a clts triggering exercise go to the place where meals are prepared to observe how flies are attracted to human feces and carry diseases by landing on the food village near lake malawi malawischool children during a clts triggering event in west bengal india looking at a glass of water and fresh human feces where the flies pass from the water to the feces and back this demonstrates how water can get polluted with pathogens fdiagram  editthe foundations for the fdiagram being used today were laid down in a publication by who in 1958 1 this publication explained transmission routes and barriers to the transmission of diseases from the focal point of human feces modifications have been made over the course of history to derive modernlooking fdiagrams these diagrams are used in many sanitation publications 2 they are set up in a way that fecal–oral transmission pathways are shown to take place via water hands arthropods and soil to make it easier to remember words starting with the letter f are used for each of these pathways namely fluids fingers flies food fields fomites objects and household surfaces rather than only concentrating on human feces animal feces should also be included in the fdiagram 2the sanitation and hygiene barriers when placed correctly prevent the transmission of infection through hands water and food the fdiagram can be used to show how proper sanitation in particular toilets hygiene handwashing can act as an effective barrier to stop transmission of diseases via fecal–oral pathways examples  edittransmission  editthe process of transmission may be simple or involve multiple steps some examples of routes of fecal–oral transmission includewater that has come in contact with feces for example due to groundwater pollution from pit latrines and is then not treated properly before drinkingby shaking someones hand that has been contaminated by stool changing a childs diapers working in the garden or dealing with livestock or house petsfood that has been prepared in the presence of fecal matterdisease vectors like houseflies spreading contamination from inadequate fecal disposal such as open defecationpoor or absent hand washing after using the toilet or handling feces such as changing diaperspoor or absent cleaning of anything that has been in contact with fecessexual practices that may involve oral contact with feces such as anilingus coprophilia or  ass to mouth eating feces in children or in a mental disorder called coprophagiaeating soil  geophagiaprevention  editmodified fdiagram including interventions that can block human exposure to animal feces 2one approach to changing peoples behaviors and stopping open defecation is the communityled total sanitation approach in this process live demonstrations of flies moving from food to fresh human feces and back are used this can trigger villagers into action 3diseases  editthe list below shows the main diseases that can
