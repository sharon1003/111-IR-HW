relevance rating newest oldest best answer you maybe a little tall to be a fighter pilot keep in mind that a fighter doesnt have much room in the cockpit and most fighter pilots ive met were under 6 tall you could try becoming a cargo or tanker pilot flown with lots of pilots about your height also in a fighter youre by yourself up there and it gets pretty quiet  lonely cant get up to stretch your legs on the 8 hour flight across the ocean now on a cargo or tanker you can all that and more plus you get to try out your leadership skills as the aircraft commander on a mission how bad is your eyesight as long as its correctable to 2020 theyll let you fly with glasses or contacts again this is for transport  tanker pilots maybe not so for fighters since they suck on the hose more often and could dry out the contacts and you cant wear glasses with your helmet i say finish up college  get your degree if you havent already or try getting a slot at the usaf to get your pilot slot also an added bonus of being aircrew in the usaf is that we get to stay in some pretty good hotels ive flown marines before and had to leave them to sleep on the jet overnight since they werent allowed to checkin to a hotel source s an f16 pilot  a c5 pilot are flying along one day the f16 jockey calls over to the c5 guys and says watch this he then proceeds to hotdog all over the sky for a few minutes the c5 pilot says thats pretty cool now watch what i can do so the f16 flys along next to the c5 for awhile and the c5 flys straight and level after awhile the f16 calls back over and asks so what did you do  the c5 pilot chimes back oh i got up to use the bathroom had a cup of coffee while i was cooking my dinner  watched a part of movie with the crew in the back the other version has the c5 pilot

longer i know they dont have jets in the army but they have a program called highschool to fly school you could check with the other branches and see if they offer the same type of school as far as the height requirements i have no idea i do know in the army helicopter pilots are getting a lot a lot of flight time in iraq so if your looking to use what you learn something else to consider how often will you get to fly an f 15 or whatnot in the air force or the navy compared to other types of aircraft in different services just some things to ask yourself and hope i helped a55h0l3 · 1

here 1 need a bachelors degree 2 be accepted into and complete an officer training program only officers are fighter pilots this can be academy rotc otsaocs 3 be accepted into and absolutely excel at pilot training some folks are under the assumption that one enlists to be a fighter pilot or that the physical is somehow different neither are true tho for the raf the physical is a little different for you to get that fighter you first have to get to pilot training your application meets a board that makes a subjective eval of your ability to adapt to aviation and complete pilot training they will look at your test scores your physical and your civilian flight experiencerotc records etc physical usaf is 2070 correctable 2020 usn is 2040 correctable 2020 both no depth perception colorblindness astigmatism issues no cardio diabetes hiv issues no asthma since age 12 no periods of unconsciousness 57 min since age 14 no hilo blood pressure lo bp is waiverable no hearing issues no chronic sinusitishay feverseasonals ok no emotionalmental issues youve seen a doctor for since age 12 surgical correction the usaf will accept lasik and prk with a waiver you must travel down to brooks afb tx and be evaluated if the flight surgeon doesnt like what the get lasik for 500 center did to your eyesyour done usn does not accept lasik and regardless you cant have uncorrected myopia 60 diopters in english this means that if you had prk corrected your acuity to 2010 you could still be disquald by the usn because of your myopia also you cant even apply until at least 1yr after the surgery for the usaf its at least 6 months ok once at pilot training you absolutely have to score as many perfect academic and flying evaluations as possible typically only 12 fighters come down for a class of 30 studs sometimes zero fighters come down or very rarely 34 this is determined by the needs of the services your fate is also determined by your class ranking preferences and what your instructors think of you in other words if you are crushing academics but get airsick fly mechanically have poor sa it wont matter what you want youre probably going to heavieshelos you can help yourself both at the selection board and in the initial phases of pilot training by having a civilian pilots license failing that a student license glider license or even loggable time helps joining civil air patrol looks very positive on an academy rotc scholarship and pilot training application its also a good way to get some free flying thats it in summary if you have other questions please pm me edit 2 of my navy bros are an nfo and hornet pilot and both are nrotc graduates dont believe the bs about commissioning sourceit doesnt matter afa flying is concerned roxanne · 2 years ago0 0
