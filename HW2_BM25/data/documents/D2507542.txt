categories  nutrition magnesium is the most important major mineral that is needed by your body in order to function correctly and efficiently your body needs many nutrients however if it is deficient in magnesium there are over 350 biochemical reactions that either will not occur at all or will occur very inefficiently also magnesium is necessary for the correct assimilation of potassium and the correct and efficient functioning of enzymes the most important of which transport store and utilize energy many aspects of cell metabolism are regulated by magnesium such as dna and rna synthesis cell growth and cell reproduction magnesium also orchestrates the electric current that sparks through the miles of nerves in our body as you can imagine without magnesium your body is going to be performing at very much less than full capacity a deficiency in magnesium can go from slight to very severe and your body will be signaling to you that it is in trouble what depletes magnesium aluminum in food and drink containers baking powder and antiperspirants blocks many normal magnesium functions unfortunately a staple of our society’s diet is white flour and 85 of its magnesium has been removed our high consumption of fats and proteins inhibits magnesium absorption environmental pollutants in air soil and water emotional stresses and many prescription drugs all aggravate magnesium depletion80 or more of the unites states population is deficient in magnesium including many who take supplements regularly these people may still think that regular magnesium supplements will fix magnesium deficiency unfortunately this is not the case the stress of our modern lifestyle whether chemical environmental or mental depletes magnesium reserves far more rapidly than was previously realized the following is a list of things which cause magnesium depletion mental stress physical stress coffee sugar high sodium diet alcohol cola type sodas tobacco high perspiration medical drugs of all types low thyroid chronic pain diuretics a high carbohydrate diet and a high calcium diet the more dominant they are in your life the more magnesium your body will need calcium yes excess calcium can become a real problem excess magnesium on the other hand is impossible excess calcium combined with low magnesium will create osteoporosis and fragile bones magnesium to calcium ratio the ratio between magnesium and calcium is very important when dealing with the cause and prevention of a number of disorders including cardiovascular health heart disease and high blood pressure the absorption and metabolism of magnesium depends upon calcium intake and vice versa therefore the balance between these two minerals is especially important in view of the overwhelming benefits of magnesium the traditional ratio of approximately 2 parts calcium to 1 part magnesium needs to be revised the ideal ratio for most people’s needs is equal amounts of calcium and magnesium if calcium consumption is high then magnesium intake also needs to be high since calcium and magnesium depend on each other to be assimilated into your body they should never be taken alone milk has a ratio of about 8 calcium to 1 magnesium causing a problem with milk drinkers the high calcium intake can cause a magnesium deficiency which creates ill health magnesium regulates the entrance and utilization of calcium in the cells without magnesium calcium remains in the body unused this will result in calcium deposits in the joints which aggravates arthritis gallstones kidney stones and in extreme cases calcification of the brain and other body organs this in turn results in memory loss as well as the loss of ability to reason and eventually the termination of life all of these conditions have frequently been known to disappear after taking extra magnesium again magnesium and calcium must be in the correct proportions otherwise the calcium becomes a pollutant in the body the rule is “never take calcium without magnesium” calcium depends on magnesium for it to assimilate but magnesium does not require calcium in order to function in fact in many cases magnesium taken on its own without any calcium will help you feel more energetic stronger and give you a multitude of other benefits as a result of the magnesium being present to do its job excess calcium can cause magnesium deficiency america has the highest rate of milk consumption america has the highest consumption rate of calcium supplements yet america has the highest occurrence of osteoporosis in the western world taking more calcium will not fix a calcium deficiency which is quite evident from statistics yet more magnesium will handle the calcium deficiency as well as the magnesium deficiency a magnesium deficiency can result in symptoms of internal stress even when the person takes supplements if they take more calcium than magnesium extra magnesium can often mean the difference between a stressed body and a completely relaxed one listen to your body signals these signals are in the form of body symptoms a slight deficiency and you will notice slight depression and lack of well being the body is telling you “help i’m in trouble” you start getting headaches pain in the lower back and stiff tight muscles particularly in the back the body is telling you “i’m in worse trouble help me now”however you ignore these messages you have not learned to read and decipher them you seek professional advice and…well you know what they advise magnesium supplementation is necessary the recommended daily requirement of magnesium is impossible to obtain from food sources because our soils have been seriously depleted of this mineral by herbicides pesticides and chemical fertilizers even at the risk of long term health your body will draw magnesium out of storage in the bones to maintain levels required for health many debilitating and life threatening diseases are associated with magnesium deficiencies such as heart problems strokes cancer diabetes osteoporosis high blood pressure migraine headaches asthma premenstrual syndrome attention deficit disorder anorexia and bulimia fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome depression hypoglycemia and kidney disease magnesium is a key essential nutrient it is necessary for every major process in your body such as digestion protein synthesis cellular energy production and glucose metabolism magnesium is also needed for bone strength muscle strength and heartbeat as well as the functioning of your nervous system without these taking place efficiently your body is in trouble nourish yourself with natural magnesium oil and gel supplements to prevent disease oral magnesium supplements are often ineffective and laxative at therapeutic levels requiring about a year to raise levels significantly intravenous magnesium is the most rapid but most people do not like needles and it may be difficult to find a physician to
