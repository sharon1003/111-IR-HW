content abstract the trigeminal nerve or cranial nerve v contains sensory from the gasserian ganglion and motor fibers this nerve has three major branches or divisions the ophthalmic v1 maxillary v2 and mandibular v3 which supply the eye deep and superficial structures of the face and the cranium the motor component is located in the mandibular division and it supplies mainly the muscles of mastication lesions of the trigeminal nerve can occur at many different levels resulting in a variety of syndromes whose main manifestation is paresthesias of the area of the face or mucosa involved keywords cavernous sinus syndrome corneal reflex cranial nerve v gasserian ganglion jaw jerk reflex mandibular division v3 maxillary division v2 muscles of masticationophthalmic division v1 postherpetic neuralgia trigeminal neuralgia trigeminal nerve cranial nerve vthe trigeminal nerve or cranial nerve v is a mixed nerve that has three major branches the ophthalmic division v1 maxillary division v2 and mandibular division v3 the name ‘trigeminal’ was given to this nerve because of these three main divisions it has both a sensory and motor component the sensory component provides innervation to the deep and superficial structures of the face nasal sinuses inside of the nose and mouth the eye the supratentorial dura mater of the anterior fossa falx and superior sagittal sinus and the cranium via the three major branches the sensation to the occiput is given by c2 and the dura mater in the posterior fossa is innervated by the cn x and c1–c3 spinal nerve roots the mandibular division is the only one to contain motor fibers responsible for controlling the muscles of mastication and other smaller muscles motor component the trigeminal motor nucleus is located in the midpons the upper motor nucleus control to the trigeminal motor nucleus comes from bilateral corticobulbar fibers that travel through the corona radiata internal capsule cerebral peduncle and decussate in the pons the motor root exits the pons from the anterolateral aspect and enters meckels cave leaving the skull through the foramen ovale after exiting the skull it joins the mandibular division v3 of the trigeminal nerve and forms the mandibular nerve this nerve innervates the muscles of mastication including the masseter temporalis and medial and lateral pterygoids other muscles supplied by the motor branch are the tensor tympani mylohyoid tensor veli palatine and anterior belly of the digastric muscles sensory component from the gasserian or semilunar ganglion the fibers of the sensory root enter the pons and terminate in three major nuclear complexes in the brainstems the principal sensory nucleus nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve and mesencephalic nucleus in the pons most of the sensory fibers descend all the way down to the medulla and third and fourth cervical levels forming the spinal nucleus from the spinal nucleus fibers ascend and go to the ventroposteromedial and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus the thalamocortical connections fan out into the posterior limb of the internal capsule and reach the primary sensory cortex in the parietal lobes the fibers from the spinal trigeminal nucleus provide sensation of temperature pain and soft touch of the face and mucous membranes the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve located in the lateral pons is responsible for propioceptive and tactile sensations the mesencephalic nucleus located in the lateral edge of the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain receives propioceptive information from the muscles of mastication and the other smaller muscles supplied by the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve sensory and motor roots exit the brainstem from the ventrolateral pons it then enters meckels cave located posterior and inferolateral to the cavernous sinus and here the trigeminal gasserian or semillunar ganglion is formed and gives off the three major branches ophthalmic division v1this branch coming from the trigeminal ganglion enters the cavernous sinus it is located in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and is closely associated with the iii iv and vi cranial nerves and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure this division gives away four branches before leaving the cavernous sinus the tentorial branch gives innervation to the dura of the cavernous sinus anterior fossa petrous ridge sphenoid wing meckels cave posterior falx cerebri dural venous sinuses and tentorium cerebelli the frontal branch gives off two other branches the supratrochlear nerve supplies the medial upper lid forehead conjunctive and side of nose and the supraorbital nerve supplies the frontal sinus forehead scalp medial upper lid and conjunctiva the lacrimal branch has postganglionic parasympathetic fibers for the lacrimation reflex and innervates the conjunctiva and lacrimal gland the nasociliary branch provides innervation to the iris ciliary body cornea conjunctiva of upper eyelid lacrimal sac caruncle root of nose mucosa of nasal septum lateral nasal wall middle and inferior turbinates and tip of the nose also sympathetic innervation is given to the dilator of the pupil and postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the constrictor of the pupil and ciliary muscle maxillary division v2this branch enters through the inferolateral portion of the cavernous sinus and exits the skull through the foramen rotundum through its course it gives off many branches including the middle meningeal nerve that innervates the dura of the middle cranial fossa the palatine nerve and posterior middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves that innervate the upper teeth maxillary sinus roof of the mouth soft palate and tonsils it enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure and reaches the face to supply the skin of the lower eyelid side of the nose and upper lip mandibular division v3this mixed branch exits the skull through the foramen ovale and enters the infratemporal fossa eventually dividing into its terminal branches the motor branches innervate the muscles of mastication and other small muscles including masseter temporalis medial and lateral pterygoid and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle a lingual nerve provides innervation to the lower gums papillae and anterior twothirds of the tongue dental branches innervate the teeth of the mandible and lower gum and a mental branch innervates the skin of the chin and lower lip clinical evaluation of the trigeminal nerve sensory evaluation the sensory modalities of pain light touch heat and cold are tested on the mucous membranes and face in each of the three trigeminal divisions individually lesions of any of the divisions will result in sensory loss in the area of the face innervated by that particular division with minimal overlapping to the continuous cutaneous area of another division sensory loss affecting the entire one side of the face indicates an ipsilateral gasserian ganglion lesion whereas lesions affecting the spinal tract or the nucleus of the trigeminal nerve individually cause dissociation of sensation on the ipsilateral side of the face lesions in the pons or cervical spinal cord would cause a sensory loss in an onion skin distribution pattern it is important to remember that the innervation to the cutaneous area over the angle of the mandible is supplied by c2c3 roots and so hemifacial loss of sensation that includes this area may be due to an intramedullary lesion or of functional origin motor evaluation the muscles of mastication supplied by the trigeminal nerve the masseter can be easily tested by having the patient clench the jaw and evaluating the volume and firmness of these muscles the other muscle of mastication supplied by the trigeminal nerve the pterygoids is examined by having the patient move the jaw from side to side against resistance and protrude the jaw contraction of each muscle causes deviation of the jaw to the opposite side so that weakness of the pterygoid muscle would cause deviation of the open jaw to the ipsilateral side nuclear or infranuclear lesion of the motor division only would cause weakness of the ipsilateral temporalis and masseter muscles resulting in inability to contract the jaw on that same side and deviation of the jaw to the contralateral side when the mouth is open of the other muscles innervated by the motor division of the trigeminal nerve a lesion causing paralysis of the tensor tympani may result in difficulty in hearing high notes trigeminal reflexes two major reflexes produced via the trigeminal nerve are the jaw reflex masseter reflex and the corneal reflex the jaw reflex is a monosynaptic muscle stretch reflex that is elicited by a brisk tap with a reflex hammer on the front of the chin with the mouth slightly opened and the jaw relaxed the examiners thumb may be placed on the lower chin and tapped or a tongue blade may be placed on the lower teeth and tapped this causes the masseter and temporalis muscles to contract resulting in sudden closure of the mouth the afferent pathway of the reflex is via the 1a motor fibers in the mandibular division and the efferent pathway constitutes fibers traveling from the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve via the same mandibular division an increased jaw jerk reflex is seen in supranuclear lesions and when exaggerated may result in sustained jaw clonus this reflex can also be increased by anxiety and in patients with diffuse physiological hyperreflexia the corneal reflex has its afferent arc in the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve and the efferent arc is in both facial nerves to the orbicularis oculi muscles a lesion of the trigeminal nerve causes loss of both ipsilateral and contralateral responses the corneal reflex can be obtained by corneal touch cutaneous stimulation supraorbital nerve stimulation or light flash another reflex that partially involves the trigeminal nerve is the glabellar reflex or orbicularis oculi reflex which is elicited by percussion over the supraorbital ridge causing bilateral contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscles lesions affecting the ophthalmic division the cutaneous supply of the ophthalmic division v1 and its branches supply the skin of the nose upper eyelid forehead and scalp upper half of the cornea conjunctiva and iris mucous membrane of the frontal phenoidal and ethmoidal sinuses upper nasal cavity and septum and the lacrimal glands dura mater of the anterior fossa falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli involvement of the ophthalmic division by orbital disease is very rare and when it occurs it is usually due to malignant or benign tumors primary lacrimal carcinoma lymphoma peripheral nerve sheath tumor meningioma or metastasis or inflammatory or traumatic processes these very distal lesions result in sensory disturbances confined to the cutaneous areas supplied by this division only the ophthalmic division v1 enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure in close relation with the abducens trochlear and oculomotor nerves and can be affected in the superior orbital fissure syndrome this syndrome can be caused by local lesions in the superior orbital fissure including trauma tumors infections or aneurysm and results in complete ophthalmoplegia and paresthesias or sensory loss in the ophthalmic cutaneous distribution denervation of the sympathetic fibers may occur resulting in oculosympathetic paresis and in some patients exophthalmus may occur the syndrome of the orbital apex has similar findings except that there is also involvement of the optic nerve another syndrome that also involves the v1 division of the trigeminal nerve is the cavernous sinus syndrome lesions affecting the maxillary division the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve v2 can be injured along its pathway causing sensory disturbances of the skin of the lower eyelid lateral nose upper lip and cheek mucous membrane of the maxillary antrum and lower part of the nose the upper teeth and gums anterior palate and the lower part of the cornea most of the lesions affecting the maxillary division are located along the floor of the orbit like carcinomas mucoceles or less commonly schwannomas or meningiomas this division can be injured in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus foramen rotundum the pterygopalatine fossa floor of the orbit infraorbital foramen or the face when the nerve is affected at the level of the cavernous sinus it is usually accompanied by lesions of other cranial nerves as seen in the cavernous sinus syndrome maxillary fractures can cause damage of the nerve at the infraorbital level manifesting as sensory disturbances in the skin supplied by this division the numb cheek syndrome can result with damage of the maxillary division at the infraorbital foramen causing numbness of the ipsilateral cheek and upper lip sometimes extending to the adjacent gingiva and upper anterior teeth rarely the anterior superior alveolar branch of the maxillary division can be injured in musicians who play brass instruments causing numbness and pain of the upper lip lesions affecting the mandibular division the most common presentation of an isolated mandibular division v3 lesion is in the numb chin syndrome involvement is primarily in the distribution of the inferior alveolar nerve and the terminal cutaneous branch the mental nerve patients with this rare syndrome present with unilateral pain or numbness in the lower lip chin and mucous membrane of the inside of the lip this syndrome is seen in patients with systemic cancer and its presence should prompt a careful search for malignancy or a recurrence in patients known to have cancer less than 1 of tumors metastasize to the maxillofacial region affecting mostly the mandible the most common cancer associated with the numb chin syndrome is metastatic breast cancer 64 and lymphomas 14 in children acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer associated with this syndrome other cancers that are less frequently involved are lung kidney testes or ovarian cancer other causes of numb chin syndrome or mental nerve neuropathy can be odontogenic–dental abscess dental trauma or anesthesia sickle cell disease due to infarction of the inferior alveolar nerve or mental nerve sarcoidosis human immunodeficiency virus disease multiple sclerosis and diabetes mellitus the motor branch of the mandibular division can be involved in more proximal lesions lesions affecting the motor division lesions isolated to the motor root of the trigeminal nerve result in weakness and wasting of the muscles of mastication deviation of the jaw to the opposite side and flaccidity of the myeloid and anterior belly of the digastric muscles abnormal or excessive activity of the masticatory muscles can rarely be seen in lesions of the motor roots this is seen in cases of hemimasticatory spasm characterized by paroxysmal involuntary and unilateral contractions of the masseter and temporalis muscles this usually occurs in association with progressive facial hemiatrophy and hypertrophy of the involved muscles spasms are very painful parry–romberg syndrome is a rare condition characterized by slow and progressive atrophy of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face that can be associated with ipsilateral severe facial pain these two syndromes are more common in young population and can be symptomatically treated with oral carbamazepine or local botulinum toxin injections in parry–romberg syndrome reconstructive or microvascular surgery may be needed to repair atrophic tissue lesions affecting the gasserian ganglion lesions of this ganglion in meckels cave may cause anesthesia in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve as well as paralysis of the ipsilateral masseter and pterygoid muscles severe and paroxysmal pain is the most common feature and may involve all three or only selected divisions of the trigeminal nerve mainly the maxillary and mandibular the gasserian ganglion at this level may be injured by local lesions such as tumors sarcoidosis tuberculosis herpes zoster trauma or abscess unilateral or bilateral trigeminal sensory neuropathy may be seen in cases of sjögrens syndrome churg–strauss syndrome rheumatoid arthritis systemic sclerosis mixed connective tissue disorders systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis lesions affecting the middle and posterior fossa raeders paratrigeminal syndrome or paratrigeminal oculosympathetic syndrome consists of unilateral oculosympathetic paresis with miosis and ptosis differing from the typical horners syndrome by the absence of facial anhidrosis and constant unilateral burning facial pain with hyperesthesia andor dysesthesias in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve most commonly the v1 division this syndrome is seen in cases of trauma syphilis infections and sinusitis and middle cranial fossa mass lesions especially in the region between the trigeminal ganglion and the internal carotid artery facial numbness may be the initial manifestation of tumors in the middle and posterior fossa such as acoustic neuromas in the cerebellopontine angle which affect mainly the v1 and v2 territories meningiomas that arise from the cavernous sinus meckels cave or the inferior aspect of the tentorium can also cause facial numbness other lesions include cerebellopontine angle epidermoids intracavernous carotid aneurysm ependymomas lipomas amyloidosis herpes zoster sarcoidosis syphilis tuberculosis arachnoiditis trauma and abscess leptomeningeal spread of metastasis to trigeminal roots or focal metastatic involvement of the trigeminal ganglion by melanoma lymphoma or carcinoma has been detected by magnetic resonance imaging gradenigos syndrome is characterized by damage of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and the abducens nerve the patient presents with severe facial pain in the ophthalmic division and unilateral ophthalmoplegia with abducens nerve involvement ipsilateral oculosympathetic paresis without anhidrosis may occur if the lesion extends to involve sympathetic fibers this syndrome occurs in cases of lesions located in the apex of the temporal bone such as metastasis osteitis or leptomeningitis associated with otitis media severe close head trauma with basal skull fracture can also cause unilateral or bilateral trigeminal ganglion or root lesion in diabetic patients a trigeminal sensory neuropathy may occur from ischemia in the cavernous sinus syndrome caused by tumors carotid aneurysm trauma infections or carotid–cavernous fistula there is involvement of the ophthalmic and maxillary division and the abducens trochlear and oculomotor nerves this causes a total unilateral ophthalmoplegia pain paresthesias and sensory loss in the trigeminal nerve divisions involved more commonly the ophthalmic division oculosympathetic paresis without anhidrosis can also occur the ophthalmoplegia can start with the abducens nerve if the lesion originates laterally or the oculomotor nerve if the lesion arises from the sella the superior orbital fissure syndrome is characterized by internal and external ophthalmoplegia involving the abducens trochlear and oculomotor nerves and pain paresthesias and sensory loss in the ophthalmic cutaneous distribution and rarely oculosympathetic palsy without anhidrosis this syndrome can be caused by trauma tumors aneurysm and infections lesions in the brainstem in lesions localized to the brainstem there is usually a combination of cranial nerve palsies along with long tract signs lesions affecting the dorsal midpons may affect the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve causing ipsilateral paresis of the muscles of mastication together with fasciculation and atrophy lesions in this location are usually associated with a contralateral hemiplegia ipsilateral hemianesthesia of the face contralateral hemisensory loss of the limbs and trunk and ipsilateral tremor an internuclear ophthalmoplegia secondary to medial longitudinal fasciculus involvement or ipsilateral horners syndrome secondary to involvement of the descending sympathetic fibers can occur lateral pontine lesions causing isolated facial numbness include infarctions demyelination infiltrative neoplasm and hemorrhages the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is commonly affected in wallenbergs or lateral medullary syndrome in this syndrome caused by a lateral medullary infarct the trigeminal signs include analgesia for pain and temperature of the same side of the face and head with decreased corneal sensation any lesion affecting the lateral medulla or upper cervical cord results in ipsilateral facial analgesia due to the extension to these areas of the nucleus of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve lower medullary or upper cervical spinal nuclear lesions result in sensory disturbance affecting the peripheral lateral forehead cheek and jaw in an onion skin pattern of sensory loss this onion skin distribution reflects the rostral–caudal somatotopic arrangement of the cutaneous distribution trigeminal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia trigeminal neuralgia trigeminal neuralgia also called tic douloureux or fothergills disease is a condition characterized by paroxysmal usually unilateral brief severe shocklike or lancinating recurrent episodes of pain limited to one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve this is one of the most frequent neuralgias seen in the elderly population and the incidence gradually increases with age trigeminal neuralgia most often compromises the mandibular and the maxillary divisions with the ophthalmic division being affected in less than 5 of cases most cases of trigeminal neuralgia result from compression of the trigeminal nerve root by an aberrant loop of an artery or vein in up to 90 of cases these cases are considered to be primary or classic trigeminal neuralgia vascular compression is believed to increase with age and to result in changes in the trigeminal sensory root and root entry zone leading to the typical symptoms other less common etiologies causing secondary trigeminal neuralgia include lesions in the posterior fossa such as meningiomas acoustic neuromas epidermoid cysts aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations demyelination of a trigeminal nerve nuclei causing trigeminal neuralgia can also be seen in multiple sclerosis in 2–4 of the cases or by other structural lesions of the brainstem the pain seen in trigeminal neuralgia is provoked by intraoral or extraoral triggers such as washing the face brushing the teeth shaving applying makeup going out in cold wind and vibrations from walking chewing talking smiling or grimacing episodes are brief and usually unilateral rarely occurring bilaterally but not on both sides at the same time initially the attacks can be spaced by weeks but tend to occur more frequently as time passes until the patient becomes incapacitated by very frequent attacks attacks do not wake the patient at night differential diagnoses include pulpitis temporomandibular disorders short unilateral neuralgiform pain with conjunctival tearing and short unilateral neuralgiform pain with autonomic symptoms in primary trigeminal neuralgia there is no sensory impairment and the motor division is not involved diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical features in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve examination of the face may be difficult because stimulation of the skin can trigger an attack some male patients may present with areas of the trigger zone unshaved neuroimaging should be obtained in patients with trigeminal sensory loss bilateral symptoms or patients younger than 40 years old electrophysiological trigeminal reflex testing with blink reflex and the masseter inhibitory reflex may help distinguish classic or primary trigeminal neuralgia from secondary trigeminal neuralgia with abnormal trigeminal reflex being more likely associated with an increased risk of secondary trigeminal neuralgia treatment of choice remains the use of carbamazepine which is highly effective and in newly diagnosed patients is likely to provide complete pain relief within a few days this drug needs to be started at a low dose and increased slowly to minimize side effects recommended starting dose is 100–200 mg twice a day and then gradually increased in increments of 200 mg daily as tolerated until pain relief is achieved maintenance dose is usually 600–1200 mg daily a secondline drug is oxcarbamazepine which is a prodrug of carbamazepine with less side effects and drug interactions this drug is usually better tolerated lamotrigine and baclofen are also secondline drugs that can be considered gabapentin with a regular ropivacaine injection into the trigger sites has been suggested in case studies and considered to be highly effective in some cases some casereports describe the use of intravenous fosphenytoin for acute attacks with variable results other poorly studied drugs with much less effective results have been tizanidine tocainadine and pregabalin surgical treatments are considered when medical management fails either due to lack of pain control or poor tolerability of pharmacotherapy the procedures used at present are microvascular decompression which is nonablative and aims to conserve trigeminal nerve function and ablative procedures such as rhizotomy with radiofrequency thermocoagulation mechanical balloon compression chemical glycerol injection gamma knife radiosurgery peripheral neurectomy and nerve block percutaneous procedures at the level of the gasserian ganglion cause variable degrees of mild sensory loss but up to 4 of patients may report severe anesthesia dolorosa microvascular decompression is the only nondestructive procedure but involves craniotomy complications may occur early in the postoperative period and include cerebrospinal fluid leaks hematomas aseptic meningitis facial weakness and diplopia longterm ipsilateral hearing loss can be seen in up to 10 of patients gamma knife radiosurgery uses targeted gamma knife radiation to the proximal trigeminal root this procedure has achieved complete pain relief in up to 69 of patients at 1 year and up to 52 at 3 years in some studies complications include new or worsened facial sensory loss or paresthesias but the more severe anesthesia dolorosa is rarely seen peripheral neurectomy using incision alcohol injection radiofrequency lesioning or cryotherapy aimed at the branches of the trigeminal nerve has shown negative or inconclusive results postherpetic neuralgia herpes zoster affecting the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve causes unilateral eruption involving the forehead and upper part of the eyelid this can be accompanied by keratitis permanently scarring the cornea during the acute phase pain can be severe and in the elderly this acute phase is followed by distressing and longlasting painful dysesthesias symptoms may become less severe with time but may persist indefinitely inflammatory changes secondary to inflammation can be found in the peripheral and central trigeminal pathways even as caudal as the trigeminal tract in the cervical cord to help reduce the severity of the acute infection and limit the degree of neural damage treatment with antiviral agents such as acyclovir famciclovir and valacyclovir are recommended but these do not prevent the development of postherpetic neuralgia opioids can also be used during the acute period for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline nortriptyline desipramine and maprotiline and drugs like gabapentin pregabalin opioids and topical lidocaine patches are effective and should be considered there is limited evidence to recommend nortriptyline over amitriptyline due its lesser side effects aspirin or capsaicin cream can be used but the benefit is low patients refractory to these treatments may benefit from intrathecal administration of methylprednisolone the use of carbamazepine laser irradiation intralesional triamcinolone cryocautery dorsal root entry zone lesions and stellate ganglion block have not been proven to be effective in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia therapies unlikely to be beneficial based on single trials include lorazepam fluphenazine dextromethorphan memantine acyclovir and acupuncture see also cavernous sinus disorders headache and craniofacial neuralgias trigeminal neuralgia further
