vein in the body usually in the leg blood clots that develop in a vein are also known as venous thrombosis dvt usually occurs in a deep leg vein a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh it can cause pain and swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism this is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs see below dvt and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism vte symptoms of dvtin some cases there may be no symptoms of dvt if symptoms do occur they can includepain swelling and tenderness in one of your legs usually your calfa heavy ache in the affected areawarm skin in the area of the clotred skin particularly at the back of your leg below the knee dvt usually although not always affects one leg the pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee pulmonary embolism if left untreated about 1 in 10 people with a dvt will develop a pulmonary embolism a pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition that causesbreathlessness – which may come on gradually or suddenlychest pain – which may become worse when you breathe insudden collapse both dvt and pulmonary embolism require urgent investigation and treatment seek immediate medical attention if you have pain swelling and tenderness in your leg and you develop breathlessness and chest pain read more about the complications of dvt what causes dvt each year dvt affects around 1 person in every 1000 in the uk anyone can develop dvt but it becomes more common over the age of 40 as well as age there are also a number of other risk factors includinghaving a history of dvt or pulmonary embolismhaving a family history of blood clotsbeing inactive for long periods – such as after an operation or during a long journeyblood vessel damage – a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clothaving certain conditions or treatments that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal – such as cancer including chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment heart and lung disease thrombophilia and hughes syndromebeing pregnant – your blood also clots more easily during pregnancybeing overweight or obese the combined contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy hrt both contain the female hormone oestrogen which causes the blood to clot more easily if youre taking either of these your risk of developing dvt is slightly increased read more about the causes of dvt diagnosing dvtsee your gp as soon as possible if you think you may have dvt – for example if you have pain swelling and a heavy ache in your leg theyll ask you about your symptoms and medical history ddimer test it can be difficult to diagnose dvt from symptoms alone so your gp may advise that you have a specialised blood test called a ddimer test this test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream the larger the number of fragments found the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein however the ddimer test isnt always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation injury or during pregnancy additional tests such as an ultrasound scan will need to be carried out to confirm dvt ultrasound scan an ultrasound scan can be used to detect clots in your veins a special type of ultrasound called a doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel this helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked which could be caused by a blood clot venogram a venogram may be used if the results of a ddimer test and ultrasound scan cant confirm a diagnosis of dvt during a venogram a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot the dye travels up the leg and can be detected by xray which will highlight a gap in the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood treating dvttreatment for dvt usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines which reduce the bloods ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger heparin and warfarin are two types of anticoagulant often used to treat dvt heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting after initial treatment you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming a number of anticoagulants known as directly acting oral anticoagulants doacs may also be used to treat conditions such as dvt these medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban and theyve been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects read more about treating dvt preventing dvtif you need to go into hospital for surgery a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while youre there if youre at risk of developing dvt there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring both before you go into hospital such as temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill and while youre in hospital such as wearing compression stockings when you leave hospital your care team may also make a number of recommendations to help prevent dvt returning or complications developing these may includenot smokingeating a healthy balanced diettaking regular exercisemaintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if youre obese theres no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing dvt see your gp before embarking on longdistance travel if youre at risk of getting dvt or if youve had dvt in the past when taking a longdistance journey six hours or more by plane train or car you should take steps to avoid getting dvt such as drinking plenty of water performing simple leg exercises and taking regular short walking breaks read more about preventing dvt assessing risk surgery and some medical treatments can increase your risk of getting dvt its estimated that around 25000 people who are admitted to hospital die from preventable blood clots each year the department of health has made the prevention of dvt a priority across the nhs all patients admitted to hospital should be assessed for their risk of developing a blood clot and if necessary given preventative treatment this recommendation was made by the national institute for health and care excellence nice in 2010 for more information see the nice guidance about venous thromboembolism reducing the risk for patients in hospital page last reviewed 27042016
