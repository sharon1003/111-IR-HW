how to use aluminum bakeware safelyby sarah updated january 31 2018 affiliate links green living part of being a savvy homemaker is knowing when to fork out the bucks for new kitchen equipment and when not to that being said i noticed a number of years ago that it can be rather costly to replace aluminum bakeware with enameled or stainless steel pans and for what yes aluminum is a toxic metal and you definitely don’t want it in your food for fear of long term health implications like alzheimer’s disease but that is no reason to toss out your perfectly good aluminum cookie sheets cake pans and muffin tinsyou see aluminum as it relates to bakeware is only released if you scratch it this i remember quite vividly from college chemistry class therefore when removing cookies and the like from your aluminum bakeware just take care not to use metal utensils that can easily scratch the aluminum and release this metal into your food wooden spatulas would be the best choice for handling the food when working with aluminum there also is no risk from aluminum vapors when baking with aluminum bakeware the heat used for at home baking is not nearly high enough to cause inhalation dangers like what workers at aluminum plants experience heating of aluminum must approach its melting point for vapors to be released 1220 f my oven doesn’t even get that hot when on “self cleaning” mode using aluminum bakeware safely if you want to be extra careful use unbleached parchment paper as a cover on top of the bakeware and have your food touch that instead for aluminum muffin tins use unbleached baking cups this same approach would be advised for aluminum foil i see folks putting vegetables and butter in foil and wrapping it tightly to roast them  all of which is perfectly safe the problem arises when they open the foil after cooking and scrape the veggies into a bowl with a metal fork this is a nono make sure you use only wood or plastic utensils when dealing with foilwatch out for store bought pie crusts that come in aluminum pie pans too while there is nothing wrong with baking your pie in a decent quality pie crust from the healthfood store it becomes a problem when you cut that pie with a metal knife which scratches the aluminum pie pan underneath the food i’ve been to many a potluck where i wouldn’t eat a piece of pie in an aluminum pie crust pan that had been cut with a metal knifeone last word of caution – watch out for ice cream machines my cuisinart ice cream machine has an aluminum interior as do many other models again this is fine and safe as long as you don’t use a metal spoon to scrape out the last bits of homemade ice cream that get stuck to the sides a small wooden spatula or spoon works great here and will not scratch that aluminum in the least make sure to ditch aluminum cookware thoughof course cookware is another issue entirely aluminum should be avoided in that case as cooking acidic foods in aluminum can leach the metal into the food stainless steel cookware poses similar leaching issues although for neutral p h or alkaline foods it is fine for acidic cooking ceramic coated cast iron such as le creuset and lodge are a good idea glass cookware is an excellent and very affordable option as well copper cookware is safe too though it is rather pricey for longer cooking and acidic foods such as tomato based sauces or slow simmering of bone broths safe options include certified toxin free clay pots such as vitaclay  glass or ceramic coated cast iron while convenient stainless steel pressure cookers are not ideal for cooking acidic foods either while cookware is a bit tricky as for bakeware i still am using the same aluminum equipment i’ve used for years what’s more i have no plans to replace it with expensive stainless steel or any other material for that matter teflon and silicone a no go for cooking in any form while it’s possible to salvage your aluminum bakeware not cookware and still use it safely make sure you ditch all teflon kitchenware while you’re at it toss any silicone molds that you use for baking or cooking too note also that shiny pasta from the store was shaped in teflon this article explains how to identify healthy pasta shaped in traditional bronze dies instead of toxic teflon here’s a great article on why you should not use teflon cookware or bakeware sarah the healthy home economist sarah the healthy home economist holds a master’s degree from the university of pennsylvania mother to 3 healthy children blogger and bestselling author she writes about the practical application of traditional diet and evidencebased wellness within the modern household her work has been featured by usa today the new york times abc nbc and many others
