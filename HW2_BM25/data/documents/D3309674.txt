tips for using iso settings in photographyby morris scjomin when you as a photographer—amateur or professional analog or digital–practice your craft or hobby you will at one time or another become acquainted with the three letters iso if the camera does not get enough light onto the sensor or film the images will be too dark to correct this you can set a higher value on the iso all photographers are dependent on light and lighting conditions can be very variable at different locations or times of day the iso value is for that reason an important tool that allows the photographer to be able to work effectively in many different lighting conditionsphoto by howard ignatius iso 6400iso value has influence on the shutter speed and aperture for any photo shoot deep in the rain forest to a concert or a moonlight walk where there is little light available it will by using this tool will be possible to get excellent pictures without using a tripod this is one of the reasons why the digital cameras has made it much easier to be a photographer iso indicates the sensitivity of the image sensor with iso international standards organization previously known as asa we mean how quickly a film or digital sensor is capable of recording light an image sensor set to iso 100 requires twice as much light to achieve a normal exposure as when the sensor is set to iso 200 in order to get twice the light the shutter speed must either be doubled eg from 160 to 130 seconds or the aperture must be opened up a whole fstop eg from f56 to f4 that may not sound like a good idea to have to double the shutter speed so that we risk blurring the picture why doesn’t we always set the iso speed as high as possible eg iso 1600 to obtain the fastest possible shutter speeds higher iso values produces more noise the downside of raising the iso number is more noisy images – in the film world this is a bit more romantically known as grain  try the new topaz de noise 6 to reduce noise  high iso entails several drawbacks it is not just noise that increases with increased iso settings there are actually three “problems” that occur increased noise reduced sharpness and reduced contrast ratio high iso  high noise slightly exaggerated to show effect in this examplethe last two problems are usually marginal the decrease in the sharpness of the increased noise that hides the details reduced contrast ratio refers to the ability to see detailsnuances in the shadow areas as well as highlights is noise always negative people often tend to have a hard time telling the difference between images with low and high iso speeds and very large prints therefore it is difficult to choose which you prefer – a little “noise” doesn’t always disturb the picture it may even bring a little feeling into the photo different cameras provide different levels of noise now you may think that you do not recognize this at all – when you test high iso settings on your camera the pictures may seem to be very noisy much more noisy yes the noise is very different between different cameras and it has been an enormous development in recent years if you have a compact camera the risk that your images even at iso 400 looks like iso 3200 in other cameras but if you use a modern digital slr you should be able to get great pictures even on iso 800 and maybe even at higher iso speeds if your camera allows it the problems we have these days when we assess the digital images is that we would look at them maximum zoomed in on the screen however do not forget to relate to the possible noise you see to what size you actually use the image honestly how many images to print larger than a5a4 how high iso should i tolerate in my camera test your camera take a picture of the same motif with different iso settings and print or send images to the photo lab the most challenging is to shoot indoors in a low light setting to try different iso settings in daylight gives surprisingly comparable results it is in low light conditions the major problems occur photo by flickr user barnyz iso 200 f56 5second exposure this is what you gain by increasing the iso settings now i have spent the whole article to explain the potential problems of raising the iso let us finally turn to the issue and look at the opportunities provided by changing the iso value by raising the iso setting you can– speed up the shutter speed it is common to have problems getting fast shutter speeds when taking pictures indoors at night  reduced risk of image blur although you may have opened the aperture to the max you may even have to raise the iso as high you think the quality will allow– reduce the aperture setting instead of changing the shutter speed you can choose to reduce the aperture for example from f4 to f56 if you need a greater depth of field– try a combination of both for example if you raise the iso setting from 100 to 400 you have doubled the iso value in two steps this allows for faster shutter speeds combined with reduced aperture like going from 130 to 160 sec  1 step and f4 to f56  1 step is it possible to lower the iso setting from time to time the most common is that you want to increase the iso value but if there is a lot of light in the scene it can be justified to go the other way here are three examples example 1 you want to shoot a stream and use a slow shutter speed around half a second to get goodlooking motion blur in the water answer here you must set the camera at lowest iso if the minimum aperture is still not enough you must use a gray filter that reduces the light inlet example 2 you want to shoot with wide aperture to get the short depth of field on a sunny day you have chosen the aaperture value setting auto aperture priority to get to choose f28 aperture while the camera determines the shutter speed for you the problem is that your images are overexposed at all times answer a large aperture comparable with a large pupil on a sunny day means fast shutter speeds most cameras cannot capture images faster than 14000 or 18000 seconds which may be too slow for the iso number you selected if you can try to reduce the iso to 100 or 50 if it is not enough the only choice left is to buy a gray filter for the lens which removes some of the sunlight photo by paul saad iso 160 f35 135second exposure example 3 you try to shoot indoors in a low light setting and has set the iso at max you have selected a large aperture and still think that the shutter speed is a bit too slow you now turn on the flash and take the shot however you notice that the picture becomes too bright despite the fact that you reduce the flash power all the images appear to be heavily overexposed answer in extreme situations the lowest effect of the flash can be too strong for the scene along with your choice of a high iso number the only opportunity to use flash in such a situation is to lower the iso until you notice that the image becomes darker and then start to increase flash power again from there you will try to aim for a good balance between the iso and the flash effect about the author morris scjomin dslrlensauctions dot com has been a professional

630 pm sometimes the ability of shooting high iso is the difference in being able to capture an image or not last summer at a festival we had performers on the ground in front of the stage that were not very well lit on top of that they were moving rather quickly which meant i had to get my shutter speed up to the 1200 range to keep blurring at a minimum and even shooting at f28 i sometimes needed to boost my iso to 4000 which seems a bit crazy but it worked you can see these images here – httpcarltonwardzenfoliocomp261802386check this one –

pm very interesting post normally in digital photography you set first aperture and shutter speed and iso is like a magical tool we can use at the end replymmdccbslm tuesday march 25th 2014 at 651 pm i love these articles i am glad i subscribed p s i bought the topazreplyrussell scott wednesday march 9th 2016 at 227 pmgood post but it iso represents the trading name for the international organization for standards  the acronym of which would be iosreply yvon simard wednesday march 9th 2016 at 510 pm i will add this to be sure to not over evaluate the iso value that you really needs setup your iso value to automatic then if the light condition do not need to increase the iso value it won’t if you presume that you need 1200 as value but the reality is 800 you will lost quality for nothing reply horqua wednesday march 9th 2016 at 836 pm my theory is the human eye or my eye has an average daylight iso of about 400 and that’s where i set my d3s as the default i’ve been photographing for over thirty years and migrated from iso 400 film to iso 400 digital with comparable results in the triad of shutter aperture and iso i try to keep iso as the constant i do adjust the iso based on the overall light of the scene but i don’t use it as a variable in the same way as aperture  shutter i was taught aperture controls the light on the subject shutter controls light on the background and iso controls the noise or granularity of the scene during the days of film if i remember correctly asa stood for american standards assn then iso came along and it stood for international standards organization which has since morphed into international organization of standards replyrussell saturday march 12th 2016 at 244 pm iso has never stood for the ‘international standards organization’ the organization arose in 1947 and derived its name from the greek word isos meaning equal this was used because of concerns by the organization that using acronyms would be confusing because the international organization for standardization’ would have different acronyms in different languages ios in english oin in french for organisation internationale de normalisation
