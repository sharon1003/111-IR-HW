shutterstock  nekrasov andrey when an opportunity arose to have rhinoplasty laymen’s terms a nose job to correct a nose broken by domestic abuse  i jumped at the chance to regain my former face the outcome was stellar—thank goodness—but the recovery didn’t love it so much i admit i’ve watched a few too many surgical shows on tv where a doctor literally takes a hammer and chisel to a patient’s face in the name of “rhinoplasty” and my insides recoiled in fear so despite what my md and a good majority of the online reviews said i was 100 expecting to wake up feeling like i had run face first into a garbage truck secret 1 i was wrong the recovery didn’t hurt nearly as much as i was expecting it to presurgery my doctor had repeatedly told me that i would not likely need pain killers that a majority of their patients did not but i was too busy replaying “extreme makeover” surgery scenes in my head to really listen to what they were saying the surgery itself goes fast thanks to the wonderful medically induced nap they place you in one minute you’re nervously sitting in the triage area and the next they’re cranking your bed up to a sitting position in the recovery room as expected i didn’t feel too snazzy on the way home from the hospital but after a few hours at home i was shockingly…feeling okay i no longer needed my doctorprescribed vicodin or even a tylenol for that matter my doctors were right rhinoplasty really did not hurt that much however before you sign up to get your nose straightened…secret 2 although recovering from a nose job isn’t painful it is ridiculously uncomfortable have you ever had a cold so bad you thought your head might actually explode because your ears and nose were so plugged up you could barely hearsmell imagine that x 1000 i would have gladly drilled a hole in my forehead just to release the pressure and congestion of the internasal surgical packing which is basically packing designed to stop bleeding and give your nose time to set it’s essentially like having tampons applicator and all in your sinuses i had been warned in the presurgical consult that the internal packing was the most uncomfortable part but again i didn’t listen to them because i was too busy making sure they were writing me a prescription for pain killers i should’ve listened intense congestion is an understatement it brings new meaning to the word “uncomfortable” i wish my doctors would have advised me to stock up on soft foods because even though technically i could chew i was afraid i’d choke to death trying to do it while simultaneously breathing through my mouth i also didn’t realize how much i relied on my sense of smell until that sense was taken from me “ is this milk old is this yogurt supposed to be chunky what if the house is on fire and the smoke alarms fail” you have a lot of time for irrational thoughts while you’re trapped at home recovering it’s hard to eat it’s hard to breath and it’s surprisingly hard to hear because the packing can block your ears oh and since you can’t wear glasses after the surgery you might not be able to see either depending on how bad your vision is basically it sucks secret 3 nobody talks about what happens when you can’t close your mouth since that’s the only way to keep breathing in my prerhinoplasty research i read that many people complained of dry throats and mouths whenever they tried to sleep so i set up multiple humidifiers around my bed in advance hoping the steam would calm the sahara desert that was my throat remember how i said packing was miserable see 2 that paled in comparison to waking up every five minutes for days on end because my raw throat was screaming for water rain a strangers spit any lubrication at all secret 4 when the internal packing comes out 35 days later it’s the most disgusting yet wonderful thing you’ll ever experience as the doctor pulled surgical cotton and plastic out of my sinus cavities through my nose i was practically screaming “yes yes yes” just because i knew the pressure would finally be relieved after that the doctor vacuums the inside of your nose no i’m not kidding secret 5 let’s talk about bruising as i mentioned recovery wasn’t painful but if you looked at my face you’d think it was the doctor prescribed me a highdose steroid to help minimize the bruising and while the drugs made me hungry irritable and nauseous i can’t really say if it helped the bruising any or not i walked around for nearly two weeks looking like i had been involved in a wedding dress sample sale fight as the bruises changed from purple to black to green and finally to yellow before fading away i looked hot—if you’re into the walking dead secret 6 those “complications” they warn you about they’re real i’m not a complete idiot so i obviously heeded the warnings about possible complications and talked with my doctor at length before making what i considered to be a wellinformed decision but despite that i hemorrhaged in the recovery room one minute the nurse is trying to shove a cracker into my mouth and the next minute blood is pouring from my head while the doctor is screaming at the anesthesiologist to put me back under because “she’s bleeding out and we need get her back into surgery now” thankfully i had a fantastic doctor who was able to stop the bleeding but needless to say it was an experience that will stick with me for life and weigh on my mind for any future medical decisions secret 7 i would do it all over again in an instant after eleven days the bruising subsided after a month the internal scabs had healed i know gross why did i not know about this  and ten months later i’m extremely pleased with the results but next time i would definitely buy more humidifiers read this i tolerated abuse because i was raised to think i deserved it read this guy thinks his girlfriend is ugly asks for an open relationship now he’s crying because she’s getting tons of datesread this i love hooking
