of the nice things about technical writing courses is that most of the papers have graphics in them—or at least they should a lot of professional technical writing contains graphics—drawings diagrams photographs illustrations of all sorts tables pie charts bar charts line graphs flow charts and so on once you get the hang of putting graphics like these into your writing you should consider yourself obligated to use graphics whenever the situation naturally would call for them tables tables of course are those rows and columns of numbers and words mostly numbers they permit rapid access to and relatively easy comparison of information if the data is arranged chronologically for example sales figures over a tenyear period the table can show trends —patterns of rising or falling activity of course tables are not necessarily the most vivid or dramatic means of showing such trends or relationships between data—thats why we have charts and graphs discussed in the next section uses for tables the biggest use of tables is for numerical data imagine that you are comparing different models of laser printers in terms of physical characteristics such as height depth length weight and so on perfect for a table however dont get locked into the notion that tables are strictly for numerical data whenever you have situations where you discuss several things about which you provide the same categories of detail youve got a possibility for a table for example imagine that you were comparing several models of a laser printer youd be saying the same category of thing about each printer its cost print speed supply costs warranty terms and so on this is ideal stuff for a table and it would be mostly words rather than numbers and in this case youd probably want to leave the textual discussion where it is and represent the information in table form table format in its simplest form a table is a group of rows and columns of data at the top of each column is a column heading which defines or identifies the contents of that column and often it indicates the unit of measurement on the left edge of the table may be row headings which define or identify the contents of that row things get tricky when rows or columns must be grouped or subdivided in such cases you have to create row or column subheadings this is illustrated here format for tables with grouped or subdivided rows and columns notice that the table title goes above the table traditionally the title of a table is placed on top of the table or is the first row of the table if the contents of the table are obvious and there is no need to crossreference the table from anywhere else in the report you can omit the title as for specific style and formatting guidelines for tables keep these in mind refer to the table in the text just preceding the table explain the general significance of the data in the table dont expect readers to figure it out entirely for themselves dont overwhelm readers with monster 11column 30row tables simplify the table data down to just that amount of data that illustrates your point—without of course distorting that data dont put the word or abbreviation for the unit of measurement in every cell of a column for example in a column of measurements all in millimeters dont put mm after every number put the abbreviation in parentheses in the column or row heading right or decimalalign numbers in the columns if the 123 and 4 were in a column the 4 would be right below the 3 not the 1 normally words in columns are leftjustified although you will occasionally see columns of words all centered column headings are centered over the columns of numerical data forming a tshape leftaligned with columns of text the alignment of column headings to the actual columnar data is variable if you have a column of two or threeletter words youd probably want to center the column heading over that data even those it is words not numbers doing so avoids an oddlooking lshaped column when there is some special point you need to make about one or more of the items in the table use a footnote instead of clogging up the table with the information producing tables normally youll be borrowing information in which a good table occurs if its a simple table without too many rows and columns retype it yourself into your own document but remember to document where you borrowed it from in the figure title however if it is a big table with lots of data youre justified in scanning screencapturing or photocopying it and bringing it into your report that way if you use open office word or word perfect get used to using the tablegenerating tools you dont have to draw the lines and other formatting details occasionally in roughdraft technical reports information is presented in regular runningtext form that could be better presented in table or tabular form be sure and look back over your rough drafts for material that can transformed into tables format for tables watch for opportunities to convert text to table as in this example charts and graphs charts and graphs are actually just another way of presenting the same data that is presented in tables—although a more dramatic and interesting one at the same time however you get less detail or less precision in a chart or graph than you do in the table imagine the difference between a table of sales figures for a tenyear period and a line graph for that same data you get a better sense of the overall trend in the graph but not the precise dollar amount formatting requirements when you create charts and graphs keep these requirements in mind most of these elements are illustrated below axis labels —in bar charts and line graphs dont forget to indicate what the x and y axes represent one axis might indicate millions of dollars the other fiveyear segments from 1960 to the present keys legends —bar charts line graphs and pie charts often use special color shading or line style solid or dashed be sure to indicate what these mean translate them in a key a box in some unused place in the chart or graph example of a graph notice that a figure title is placed beneath the graph figure titles —for most charts and graphs youll want to include a title in many cases a numbered title readers need some way of knowing what they are looking at and dont forget to cite the source of any information you borrowed in order to create the graphic the standard rule for when to number figures or tables is this if you crossreference the figure or table elsewhere in the text crossreferences —whenever you use a chart or graph dont forget to put a crossreference to it from the related text with that crossreference provide some explanation of what is going on in the graphic how to interpret it what its basic trends are and so on example of a chart notice that text above and below the chart calls attention to the chart and briefly indicates its significance documentation —when you borrow information to create a graphic be sure to use the standard format to indicate the source see the section on documenting borrowed information either textual or graphic it does not matter how you import the graphic into your report—it is all borrowed information which some brave and noble soul worked hard to develop and who deserves credit for that effort producing charts and graphs as with illustrations you have these options for creating charts and graphs screencapturing scanning photocopying generating your own with software and drawing your own documenting tables charts and graphs indicating sources as mentioned earlier its perfectly legal to borrow tables—to copy photocopy scan or extract subsets of data from them but youre obligated to cite your sources for tables charts and graphs just as you are for the words you borrow normally this is done in either the table title or in a footnote just below the table check the example in the table shown previously for details on the contents of the source citation see the section documentation general guidelines for tables charts graphs—a review the preceding sections state a number of common guidelines that need to be stated all in one place these are importantwatch out for areas in your text where you discuss lots of numeric data in relation to two or more things—thats ideal for tables or even charts or graphs watch out for areas in your text where you define a series of terms—thats ideal for tables always discuss tables in preceding text dont just throw a table graph or chart out there unexplained orient readers to it explain its basic significance make sure your tables charts and graphs are appropriate to your audience subject matter and purpose—dont zap beginners with massive highly technical constructions they cant understand use a title unless the table chart and graph is very informal remember that the title goes just above the table for charts and graphs below leftalign words and phrases in table columns including the column heading rightalign numeric data in table columns but center the column heading a nice touch to put a bit of right margin on this rightaligned data so that it moves out into the center of the column rather than remaining jammed to the right edge some believe that it is easier for readers to compare vertically rather than horizontally if you believe that format your tables so that your columns contain the information to be compared for example if you were comparing cars youd have columns for mpg price and so on indicate the source of tables charts and graphs you have borrowed either part of or entirety this can be done in the title or in a footnote this is explained in the section on documentation and is illustrated here in this chapter indicate identifying measurement values in column or row headings—not in each cell crossreference all tables charts and graphs from the preceding text in the crossreference give the number if it is a formal table with title indicate the subject matter of the table and provide explanatory information as necessary i would appreciate your thoughts reactions criticism regarding this chapter your response  information
