original question before edit so it is incomplete but in the context of what was originally was asked its still valid updated answer the key issue here is that exec startusrbinpython usrlocalbinapp  varlogapplog 21doesnt have shell running  so your  and 21 redirection wont be understood by systemd thats why shell is necessary around the whole command so that redirection can work as for c flag for shell see the old version of the post below old postthe c flag in both bash and sh mean same thing execute commands as provided within the quotes theres no great mystery your app that youre trying to run might have different meaning for c flag so dont assume all commandline flags are the same for all commands without documentation for the app its hard to tell what an option is supposed to do potential issue here is that python interpreter will assume c as its own commandline argument not to the app probably thats the main reason your command fails the exec startusrbinpython usrlocalbinapp c etcappjson should be able to process your command ive tested it with a small script cat testscriptpy import sys print sysargv 1sysargv 0  python testscriptpy this is a test this testscriptpy better approach a script should be made executable with sudo chmod x usrlocalbinapp and used by itself the way it is written originally with binsh then python then calling actual script is kind of redundant in the example of my test script that would be like so cat testscriptpy usrbinenv python import sys print sysargv 1sysargv 0  chmod x testscriptpy  testscriptpy this is a test this testscriptpy beware that python refers to python 27 on ubuntu if you need to use python3 specifically use usrbinpython3 instead most preferred way is for the app to have usrbinenv python or usrbinenv python3 as first

17 at 537add a commentup vote3down vote its not a matter of permissions there is simply no shell involved in executing the exec start string only a command and the options to be passed to that command but neither redirections nor piping nor concatening with nor substitution or any other shell functionality thus your redirections are passed as options to your app only you know how your app handles this you can change this by calling a shell and giving your command and redirections as command string to the shell this is what the c option does but think about why not use the services and logging as intended by systemd by default stdout and stderr of a systemd unit are sent to syslog you can configure it with the standard output line in your service have a look at man systemdexecshare improve
