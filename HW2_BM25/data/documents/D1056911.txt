monitored before treatment begins every 6 to 12 weeks for the first year and periodically thereafter eg at approximately 6month intervals special attention should be paid to patients who develop elevated serum transaminase levels and in these patients measurements should be repeated promptly and then performed more frequently if the transaminase levels show evidence of progression particularly if they rise to 3 times uln and are persistent or if they are associated with symptoms of nausea fever andor malaise the drug should be discontinued laboratory abnormalities increase in

glucose tests use in specific populationspregnancy pregnancy category c animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with niacin or with niacin extendedrelease tablets it is also not known whether niacin at doses typically used for lipid disorders can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women or whether it can affect reproductive capacity if a woman receiving niacin for primary hyperlipidemia becomes pregnant the drug should be discontinued if a woman being treated with niacin for hypertriglyceridemia conceives the benefits and risks of continued therapy should be assessed on an individual basis nursing mothers niacin is excreted into human milk but the actual infant dose or infant dose as a percent of the maternal dose is not known because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from lipidaltering doses of nicotinic acid a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the

greater hypolipidemic response than men at equivalent doses of niacin extendedrelease tablets overdosage supportive measures should be undertaken in the event of an overdose niacin description niacin extendedrelease tablets usp contain niacin usp which at therapeutic doses is an antihyperlipidemic agent niacin usp nicotinic acid or 3pyridinecarboxylic acid is white crystals or crystalline powder sparingly soluble in water soluble in boiling alcohol freely soluble in boiling water and in solutions of alkali hydroxides and carbonates very slightly soluble in ether with the following structural formula niacin extendedrelease tablets usp are white to offwhite filmcoated tablets for oral administration and are available in three tablet strengths containing 500 mg 750 mg and 1000 mg niacin usp niacin extendedrelease tablets usp also contain the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide hydrogenated castor oil hypromellose lactose monohydrate magnesium stearate polyethylene glycol titanium dioxide usp dissolution test is pending niacin  clinical pharmacology mechanism of action the mechanism by which niacin alters lipid profiles has not been well defined it may involve several actions including partial inhibition of release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue and increased lipoprotein lipase activity which may increase the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma niacin decreases the rate of hepatic synthesis of vldl and ldl and does not appear to affect fecal excretion of fats sterols or bile acids pharmacokinetics absorption due to extensive and saturable firstpass metabolism niacin concentrations in the general circulation are dose dependent and highly variable time to reach the maximum niacin plasma concentrations was about 5 hours following niacin extendedrelease tablets to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal gi upset administration of niacin extendedrelease tablets with a lowfat meal or snack is recommended singledose bioavailability studies have demonstrated that the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablet strengths are dosage form equivalent but the 500 mg and 750 mg tablet strengths are not dosage form equivalent metabolism the pharmacokinetic profile of niacin is complicated due to extensive firstpass metabolism that is doserate specific and at the doses used to treat dyslipidemia saturable in humans one pathway is through a simple conjugation step with glycine to form nicotinuric acid nua nua is then excreted in the urine although there may be a small amount of reversible metabolism back to niacin the other pathway results in the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad it is unclear whether nicotinamide is formed as a precursor to or following the synthesis of nad nicotinamide is further metabolized to at least nmethylnicotinamide mna and nicotinamidenoxide nno mna is further metabolized to two other compounds nmethyl2pyridone5carboxamide 2py and nmethyl4pyridone 5carboxamide 4py the formation of 2py appears to predominate over 4py in humans at the doses used to treat hyperlipidemia these metabolic pathways are saturable which explains the nonlinear relationship between niacin dose and plasma concentrations following multipledose niacin extendedrelease tablets administration nicotinamide does not have hypolipidemic activity the activity of the other metabolites is unknown elimination following single and multiple doses approximately 60 to 76 of the niacin dose administered as niacin extendedrelease tablets was recovered in urine as niacin and metabolites up to 12 was recovered as unchanged niacin after multiple dosing the ratio of metabolites recovered in the urine was dependent on the dose administered pediatric use no pharmacokinetic studies have been performed

hepatic impairment no pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in this population active liver disease unexplained transaminase elevations and significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction are contraindications to the use of niacin extendedrelease tablets see contraindications 4 and warnings and precautions 53 gender steadystate plasma concentrations of niacin and metabolites after administration of niacin extendedrelease tablets are generally higher in women than in men with the magnitude of the difference varying with dose and metabolite this gender differences observed in plasma levels of niacin and its metabolites may be due to genderspecific differences in metabolic rate or volume of distribution recovery of niacin and metabolites in urine however is generally similar for men and women indicating that absorption is similar for both genders see gender 88 drug interactions fluvastatin niacin did not affect fluvastatin pharmacokinetics see drug interactions 71
