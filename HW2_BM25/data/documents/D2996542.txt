open gl the gpu and after effects open gl is a set of standards for highperformance processing of 2d and 3d graphics on the graphics processing unit gpu for a wide variety of applications open gl provides fast rendering for previews fast draft mode after effects can take advantage of gpu graphics processing unit on your graphics card for some specific kinds of processing the gpu features in after effects are of the following 3 categories gpuaccelerated raytraced 3d renderer cuda on specific graphics cardsfast draft mode and hardware blit pipe open gl with somewhat stringent requirementsopen gl swap buffer open gl with looser requirementsimportant in general after effects does not require cuda features of any specific set of nvidia gpus only the gpuaccelerated raytraced 3d renderer requires this the other gpu features work on any gpu that meets certain basic requirements including amd and intel gpus continue reading for more features setting preferences for open gl and the gpuopen gl supports the drawing of interface items such as composition footage and layer panels other drawing functions like grids guides rulers and bounding boxes are now operated by open gl as well this feature is also known as the hardware blit pipe to enable open gl support for drawing interface items click the hardware accelerate composition layer and footage panels checkbox in edit  preferences  display windows or after effects  preferences  display mac os you can access information about the gpu and open gl in the gpu information dialog box choose edit  preferences  previews windows or after effects  preferences  previews mac os you have access to the gpu information dialog box click the gpu information button to launch the gpu information dialog box in this dialog box see information about the open gl capabilities for your installed gpu the information helps you determine the feature support levels for your gpu you can also see if cuda is available on your gpu and which version that is installed note to enable fast draft click the fast previews button on the composition panel and choose fast draft fast draft causes slight appearance differences in the composition panel best suited for quick previewing fast draft is useful for setting up and previewing a composition for later rendering in raytraced 3d note if your gpu is not supported or you have an old driver raytraced 3d compositions render on the cpu using all physical cores if you have a gpusupported configuration in a headless environment for example a render farm you can force raytraced 3d compositions to render on the cpu by setting the raytracing option in the gpu information dialog box renders done on the cpu match renders done on the gpu hardware considerations for open gl the gpu and after effects when working with raytraced 3d compositions it is important to have the proper hardware installed in your computer to work smoothly an nvidia video display card that has onboard cuda technology is required for working with raytraced 3d compositions with gpu acceleration requirements for gpuopen gl features raytraced 3d and fast draftthe following gpu and open glbased features in after effects require that features be categorized based on the capabilities of your gpu raytraced 3d renderer rendering on the gpufast draft previews mode faster blitting to the screen open gl swap bufferhardware accelerate composition layer and footage panels preference video optimizing for high performance in this video brian maffitt of total training shows how to optimize your computer to work with raytraced 3d compositions brian maffitt and total traininghttpwwwtotaltrainingcom feature support levels for open gl swap buffer this level simply requires a gpu that can do open gl 15 or greater with shader model 30 or greater most ati and nvidia cards and the intel hd graphics 3000 chipset available in the mac book air mac mini various windows machines etc and 4000 windows only at this time are supported if your gpu does not support these requirements software os blitting like cs55 occurs and there are improvements for software blitting in after effects as well for fast draft previews hardware blit pipe and cartoon gpu acceleration includes level 1 features this level requires open gl 20 or greater with shader model 40 or greater on windows and 256 mb or greater of texture memory most ati and nvidia cards released in the past five years plus the intel hd graphics 30004000 support this level if your gpu does not support these requirements these features will be disabled fast draft mode the hardware accelerate composition layer and footage panels preference the cartoon effects use open gl when available option the cartoon effect then runs on the cpu for raytraced 3d rendering on the gpuincludes level 1  2 features for machines with attached monitors this level requires a supported nvidia gpu and 512 mb or greater of texture memory for a current list of supported gpus see the adobe website install gpu drivers before working with after effects and cuda features install the latest video driver for your nvidia gpu windows install the latest whqlcertified driver for your gpu httpwwwnvidiacompagedrivershtml mac os install the nvidia cuda driver v4050 or later httpwwwnvidiacomobjectmacdriverarchivehtml you can update the cuda driver via the cuda panel in system preferences or by going to the nvidia website note if your gpu is not supported or you have an old driver raytraced 3d compositions render on the cpu using all physical cores if you have a
