basic description vitamin b2 also known as riboflavin is arguably the only vitamin that gives you a visual cue as to its passage through your body when there is a lot of vitamin b2 in the diet or in a supplement your urine turns bright yellow to show you it is there in fact the —flavin in riboflavin comes from flavus the latin word for yellow vitamin b2 like the other b vitamins is involved in energy metabolism it has also recently been found to affect the metabolism of iron in important ways the worlds healthiest foods are generally very rich in vitamin b2 in fact well over half of the foods profiled on our site contain at least 5 of the dietary recommended intake dri for vitamin b2 we rate five of our foods as excellent sources of vitamin b2 another 12 foods rate as very good sources while 21 rate as good sources role in health support promotes energy production like all the b vitamins vitamin b2 plays a key role in energy production its role here is complicated—it is important both for the energyproducing electron transport chain and the metabolism of fat molecules into chemically useful energy additionally vitamin b2 plays a role in the chemistry of other nutrients involved in energy production including folate and vitamin b6  offers antioxidant protection vitamin b2 is one of many nutrients required to recycle glutathione which is one of the most important antioxidants in the human body from a chemical standpoint what b2 does is facilitate the conversion of oxidized glutathione into reduced glutathione we believe that the best protection against free radicals comes from foods that are rich in many different antioxidants examples of good vitamin b2 sources that would fit this description include spinach beet greens and broccoli among others promotes iron metabolism marginal vitamin b2 status has been found to impair the ability to make red blood cells leading to a condition called anemia there is some debate about how this occurs with some scientists believing that vitamin b2 is necessary to mobilize iron from storage to incorporate into cells and others believing that vitamin b2 deficiency impairs iron absorption we believe that both of these could be true and recommend making sure your diet contains rich sources of all the nutrients necessary for blood cell production here are a couple of examples of recipes—our baked chicken breast with honey mustard sauce and 10minute rosemary lamb chopss —that are rich in both iron and vitamin b2 summary of food sources people eating a standard western diet receive about onequarter to onethird of their dietary vitamin b2 from milk and other dairy products if you look at the chart below youll see milk and yogurt represented as good sources of vitamin b2 to this day dairy is probably the best publicized source of this nutrient we would encourage you though to explore other sources of vitamin b2 for example crimini mushrooms are an excellent source of vitamin b2 and many leafy green vegetables also end up as good to excellent sources as well in terms of food groups we see almost all of them containing foods that are contributors to vitamin b2 nutrition many nondairy animal foods—including turkey sardines and eggs—end up in the top third of our b2rich foods legumes—and particularly soy foods—are also well represented many types of vegetables are rich in vitamin b2 in addition to leafy greens which are rich sources of a wide array of nutrients we see other brassica vegetables including broccoli cauliflower and brussels sprouts peppers root vegetables and squash on the list of vitamin b2rich foods you can even get vitamin b2 in some natural sweeteners like maple syrup  which contains about 6 of the rda in just one teaspoon our ginger yogurt with fruit is quite rich in vitamin b2 providing almost 40 of the rda as an example of how easy it can be to build a daily meal plan that meets your vitamin b2 needs lets do it with three sample meals for breakfast well choose huevos rancheros for lunch well whip up a healthy chefs salad with walnuts and french dressing for dinner well choose the healthy chicken caeser salad this gives you about one and onehalf times the rda for vitamin b2 nutrient rating chart introduction to nutrient rating system chart in order to better help you identify foods that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain we created a food rating system this system allows us to highlight the foods that are especially rich in particular nutrients the following chart shows the worlds healthiest foods that are either an excellent very good or good source of vitamin b2 next to each food name youll find the serving size we used to calculate the foods nutrient composition the calories contained in the serving the amount of vitamin b2 contained in one serving size of the food the percent daily value dv that this amount represents the nutrient density that we calculated for this food and nutrient and the rating we established in our rating system for most of our nutrient ratings we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are found in the u s food and drug

dridv5good dridv25 or density15 and dridv25impact of cooking storage and processing arguably the biggest impact on vitamin b2 nutrition in the food processing chain is due to damage from exposure to light in fact one of the reasons your milk is likely to come in a paper carton is to reduce the light damage to the vitamin b2 content as light damages the vitamin b2 it produces an offflavor that makes it taste less fresh it doesnt take much of this effect to become noticeable a 10 change occurs over a few days in glass exposed to light and studies show that milk drinkers can taste the difference luckily the dairy industry has developed methodology throughout the packaging and delivery chain to reduce this problem you can help retain the most vitamin b2 in your dairy products by purchasing it in opaque containers whenever it will be exposed to light its also important to note here that the b2 in cheese yogurt and other dairy foods is equally susceptible to damage from light and those foods need opaque storage containers as well vitamin b2 is surprisingly stable to heat and refrigeration one recent research group found a negligible loss of vitamin b2 over three days of refrigeration historically vitamin b2 was believed to be the heat stable fraction of vitamin b that said there is some loss of vitamin b2 with prolonged cooking techniques for example in one research study milk boiled for 15 minutes loses 27 of its initial vitamin b2 content like most of the other b vitamins processing of grains from whole to refined robs them of much of the vitamin b2 content for example 60 extraction flour the kind most commonly used in ordinary white bread where 40 of the whole grain is lost during processing contains only onefifth of the vitamin b2 content of whole unprocessed wheat the majority of states in the u s require enrichment of these highly processed flours with b2 as well as b1 b3 folic acid and iron and manufacturers in all states generally comply with the food and drug administrations voluntary guideline for enrichment of processed flour which has been around since the 1940s in short then the best way to ensure good vitamin b2 content of foods is to eat them fresh keep them dairy in particular from prolonged exposure to light and keep cooking times brief following the meal plans on our site youll be encouraged to do all three risk of dietary deficiency the risk of deficiency of vitamin b2 in the united states is not very high it appears that only about 2 of american adults fail to reach the dietary reference intake dri for vitamin b2 there is an emerging concern about vitamin b2 intake in adolescents especially adolescent girls this is the combined result of a reduced intake of dairy products and a wellknown aversion to fruits and vegetables in this age group we believe that the amount of fresh and varied foods in the worlds healthiest foods recipe library should ensure that you do not become deficient in vitamin b2 it is really not difficult to build a diet rich in vitamin b2 using the worlds healthiest foods a serving of a soy food—for example whole soybeans or tempeh —gets you a quarter of the way there adding another highvitamin b2 food such as spinach or yogurt will get you over half a days supply from here a smattering from any of a number of good vitamin b2 sources—and there are many to choose from—should get you to your target other circumstances that might contribute to deficiency as noted above the risk of vitamin b2 deficiency is not very high and usually requires some special circumstances aggressive medication protocols for cancer and aids have been reported to cause vitamin b2 deficiency vitamin b2 deficiency has also been noted in some indigenous populations that eat diets devoid of plant foods relationship with other nutrients vitamin b2 deficiency can impair blood cell production although there is some debate about how this happens it appears that vitamin b2 is necessary to incorporate dietary iron into the forming red blood cell it has also been hypothesized that deficient vitamin b2 stores impair the absorption of dietary iron however this interaction occurs two separate research groups have shown improvements in blood cell counts through restoring vitamin b2 to the diet in people who had low levels of the vitamin as noted above the stability of vitamin b2 in foods is questionable during storage particularly if the food is exposed to light researchers have recently learned that having other antioxidants in the food particularly vitamin c may help to spare the vitamin b2 content vitamin b2 is necessary to convert vitamin b6 to its active form hence deficiency of vitamin b2 could potentially reduce your ability to use vitamin b6 even when there is plenty in your diet risk of dietary toxicity there are to date no credible reports of toxicity from vitamin b2 that we were able to find the national academy of sciences similarly unable to demonstrate any health risk chose not to establish a tolerable upper intake limit ul for vitamin b2 intake since research trials have used doses of supplemental vitamin b2 more than 20 times the dietary reference intake dri without any evidence for adverse effect we believe it is highly unlikely that you could eat too much vitamin b2 under any circumstance one warning though—vitamin b2 can tend to make the urine appear very yellow diets rich in vitamin b2 may induce this effect it is not considered harmful but it may appear unusual at first disease checklist iron deficiency anemia migraine headache congestive heart failure high homocysteine cataract parkinsons disease hypertension public health recommendations in 1998 the food and nutrition board of the national academy of sciences nas established a set of dietary reference intakes dris for vitamin b2 that included recommended dietary intakes rdas by age and gender note that the standards for infants under one year of age are adequate intake ai standards these are summarized below06 months 03 mg612 months 04 mg13 years 05 mg48 years 06 mg913 years 09 mg1418 years female 10 mg1418 years male 13 mg19 years female 11 mg19 years male 13 mg pregnant women 14 mg lactating women 16 mg given the lack of demonstrated toxicity of vitamin b2 the nas chose not to establish a tolerable upper limit ul for vitamin b2 intake the daily value dv for vitamin b2 is 17 mg per 2000 calories this is the value that food labels use as a reference point as our whfoods recommendation for daily intake of vitamin b2 we chose the dietary reference intake dri level for men 14 and older of 13 milligrams this level is about 20 higher than the dri for women 19 and older of 11 milligrams and we chose it to make sure that both men
