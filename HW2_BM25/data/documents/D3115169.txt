a preview of the day ahead how much is an olympic gold medal really worth here are 4 possible answers ethan wolffmann money august 5 2016value is a funny thing more olympic medals are handed out every two years as the anthem plays and tears fall the camera often focuses in on the medals—the gold one especially—and naturally viewers are bound to wonder how much is that thing worth as with anything a gold medal’s true value depends on your point of view the organization that hands out medals may value them very differently than the individual who wins one how much a collector is willing to pay for such a medal is a different animal altogether as is how much the medal’s metal would be worth if it were melted down the point is there are many different ways to value an olympic gold medal let’s break it down the scrap value 501the first and easiest way of calculating the value of a olympic gold medal is figuring what the metal is worth if one were melted down since the mexico games in 1968 the medals have averaged 658 millimeters in diameter 65 millimeters in thickness and 1765 grams in weight london’s were the largest at between 375 and 400 grams but gold medals aren’t made of gold not entirely anyway only about six grams of each medal are 24karat gold the rest is sterling silver “sterling” means 925 silver and the rest copper in today’s values that makes the average gold medal worth around 366 london’s bigger golds are worth 501 nowadays at the high 2012 precious metals prices the medals from london would have been worth around 777 what if gold medals really were solid gold wired calculated that a typical gold medal would weigh 335 pounds and be worth around 76000 in terms of the pure value of the gold the value to collectors 10000 to over 1 million hundreds of gold medals are awarded during every olympic games and it’s inevitable that some athletes—who more often than not won’t get rich from their sport—wind up selling them medals are auctioned off fairly regularly so there’s some hard data on what they’re worth to somebody who wants to buy one there is a wide variance in what medals sell for at auction bostonbased rr auction which has sold many gold medals told usa today that an average price for a “common” gold medal—think archery or water polo with no wellknown athlete’s name attached—is about 10000 rarer older medals can easily sell for much more browsing through rr auction’s archives there’s a january 2016 sale that included four gold medals with prices from 4774683 for a gold from chamonix 1924 to 1011483 for a melbourne 1956 gold if a medal is gilded with publicity as well as the standard six or more grams of gold the value equation is completely different and auction prices can shoot through the roof the only remaining medal of the original four won by jesse owens in 1936 sold for 147 million in 2013 one of the “miracle on ice” medals from the 1980 team usa hockey team was expected to fetch 15 to 2 million but it failed to sell at auction earlier this summer the value of all that time  training 100000another way to look at the value of a gold medal is how much it costs the participant just to have a chance at winning one olympic hollywood fairytales are often big budget affairs specialized skills mean specialized training coaching and equipment—all of which can be enormously expensive last olympics the new york times reported that u s swimmer missy franklin’s parents dropped 100000 per year on her sport olympic cyclist bobby lea has poured thousands upon thousands of dollars year after year for the chance to top the podium former speed skater eric flaim told market watch that his sport cost his family at least 250000 and he got a pair of silvers every sport athlete and family has different amounts of “investment” needed and it’s probably too difficult to calculate an average expenditure in a meaningful way due to the massive variance training full time sacrificing studies and jobs can have huge opportunity costs as well as missing out on necessary education and prime years of work experience take tolls on later earnings even if an average cost could be found a second factor would render it relatively meaningless since you can’t guarantee a spot on an olympic roster let alone the top step of the podium for every family that supports an gold medalist there are thousands who never get within sniffing distance of the olympics even a child of gilded olympians furnished with full support of the state can’t guarantee a stuck landing in the end all the money spent on training coaching and competitions is the equivalent of a really expensive lottery ticket story continues the bonus value 25000jesse owens once said “i had four gold medals but you can’t eat four gold medals” still owens did make some money racing against horses and speaking about his accomplishments later in life which he couldn’t have done if not for the fame and glory he earned by winning all those medals nowadays the u s olympic committee gives a 25000 check to each american gold medal winner but that’s just the start of what winning gold can earn for an athlete just as there’s a wide spectrum for a medal loaded with history versus one earned in an overlooked skeet shooting competition the prestige a medal bestows upon the winner depends on the sport and the back story of the event and its participants a gold medal in a popular sport can mean milliondollar endorsements deals commentating gigs and more but sports without vibrant business models and followings will prevent a gold medal from earning much beyond fame in a small niche community a gold medal is the pinnacle for olympians but given that there were 301 gold medals given out in london 2012 each with a different story for how it was won it’s next to impossible to say what any given medal is truly worth recently viewed your list is empty what to read next facebook to send cambridge analytica datause notices monday
