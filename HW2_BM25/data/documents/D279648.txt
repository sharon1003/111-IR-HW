to the attending doctors to determine when t pa may be administered and if it is appropriate blood thinners there are two kinds of blood thinners antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants antiplatelet drugs when your skin is cut platelets bind together to form a blood clot which stops the bleeding similarly when a blood vessel is injured platelets cause blood clots to develop in the vessel however a clot located in an artery that is already stressed can lead to a stroke  antiplatelet drugs help prevent platelets from sticking together and therefore prevent blood clots from forming the most commonly used antiplatelet drug is acetylsalicylic acid asa commonly referred to as aspirin™ your doctor can tell you if you should take asa and how much you need to take to reduce your risk of stroke

heartbeat  atrial fibrillation  which can cause blood clots to travel from the heart to the brain they are commonly used in people who have had a stroke to help prevent stroke from recurring anticoagulant medications include heparin – given by needle at the hospital and often used after a stroke to prevent clotting it can only be taken for a few days warfarin – a pill that can be taken
