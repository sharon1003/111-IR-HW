ursula stott travel consultant answered dec 10 2017 · author has 160 answers and 147k answer views honestly the answers already written are excellent and i pretty much agree with all of them but i’ll give my opinion because it was asked for she’s probably interested in getting to know you it could be honest curiosity or romantic interest if she went on and on about her family she may just want it to be even and have you talk about yours if you told her stories about your family before she may just want to put names to faces she may want to imagine what you’re going to look like in twenty something years by looking at your family or like the others have said and most probably she wants to get a feel for your background11k views · view upvoters · answer requested by matt blanco related

major reader of classic works answered dec 27 2017honestly this sounds pretty straightforward to me she wants to get a sense of your own family and history as you now know hers it’s just like someone asking for your opinion about something you know alot about in a conversation after having shared their own perspective she’s interested in knowing you and where you come from if you’re not completely comfortable with this explain your discomfort to her or at least share a few photos and some funny family stories you don’t have to get especially deep sometimes women arent that complicated xd best

you you can tell a lot about someone by their family and if you like this person and can see yourself with her remember that you pretty much end up in a relationship with not just your partner but also their family friends and animals so yes it pays off to know about them ideally she comes from a happy and loving family you should be able to tell a little bit by the pictures she might just want to be assured that you have a good support system for example having happily married couples in your family helps to set an example for how you treat your romantic partner when i begin to date someone and i think it might go somewhere i usually want to know about their parents sorry if this sounds sad but women who come from divorced families or even worse if they come from being raised by a single mother whose father abandonded them have a much lower chance of being in happy relationships especially if the mother frequently vented about the situation of course i have met a few that were raised by excellent mothers and they came out as fine ladies i have chosen end communication with various women when i was less than impressed with their family why get involved with someone who has undesirable influences that will reach your children if you see yourself that far with them on the other hand when i met my exwifes family i was very impressed with them hence why i felt comfortable marrying her the time spent with her family was very pleasant and contributed to us having stayed together for so long there might be underlying psychology in regards to genetics such as what your children may look like height weight facial features etc family health etc but no one ever talks about this but it is in the back of some peoples head103k views · view upvoters your response is

author has 255 answers and 203k answer views it sounds to me that she may already be looking ahead for matrimonial possibilities if she weren’t head over heels about you this would not be an issue you should check your heart and see if you are open to something permanent if not you should kindly ask her if you can slow down a bit420 views terence agius studied at university of alberta answered dec
