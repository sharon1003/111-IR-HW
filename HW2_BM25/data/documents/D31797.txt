again 7 days later if lice are observed anybody who has lice should avoid close physical contact with other people until the lice are gone anyone who has been in close contact with the person should receive treatment this usually means sexual partners some lice have developed a resistance to some medications if a medication does not work first check that you have applied it correctly then speak to a pharmacist or doctor about an alternative treatment before using a treatment check with a pharmacist or doctor that you know how to use it and follow their instructions carefully if otc medications do not kill the lice a doctor may prescribe a stronger lotion or shampoo ivermectin lotion is approved for management of pubic lice oral ivermectin has been successfully used to treat pubic lice but this has not been approved by the fda malathion ovide aqueous lotion is suitable for anybody aged over 6 months malathion is flammable so it must keep away from cigarettes hair dryers and other heat sources however it has not been approved as a treatment for pubic lice in the united states by the food and drug administration fda instructions for malathion lotion or ivermectin cream in most cases are apply the lotion to the whole body including the scalp face neck and ears as well as the affected areas only keep the lotion away from the eyes if some does get in the eyes rinse thoroughly with water one total application will generally require about 100ml of lotion or 30 grams g to 60 g of cream ivermectin lotion leave on for 10 minutes malathion lotion leave on for 12 hours or overnight wash the medication off with warm water gently and thoroughly comb hair with a fine tooth comb to remove lice eggs repeat the process 7 days later do not use the medication more often than indicated and do not repeat the application for more than 3 consecutive weeks lindane shampoo is a prescription drug that can kill lice and eggs but it is not the first treatment doctors will give as it can be toxic to the brain anyone weighing less than 110 pounds people who have seizures women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and those with irritated skin or sores should not use it eyelashes if the eyelashes are affected treat the whole body as well as the lashes do not try to pull the eggs or shells out as there is a risk of eye injury the medication for eyelashes is different from the treatments for other parts of the body those should not be used on the eyes if only a few lice or nits are noted they can be removed by fingernails or by a fine tooth comb an eye ointment is available for those aged under 18 years or during pregnancy and breastfeeding it has a white or yellow soft paraffin base which suffocates the parasite apply twice to four times a day to the eyelashes making sure every part of each eyelash is covered wash hands thoroughly before applying and again after each time the ointment is applied gently wipe away any ointment that is still there from the previous application use a tissue then dispose of it apply twice to four times a day for 8 days continue treatment until dayt 10 if lice but not eggs remain another option is a weaker insecticide shampoo or cream rinse for example permethrin 1 percent keeping the eyes closed apply the cream to the base of the eyelashes start using a cotton bud leave for 5 to 10 minutes wash off with water if any gets into the eyes rinse them straight away with water in most cases the first treatment will successfully kill all the lice however the eggs may remain with the risk of hatching reapplying the medication after 7 days ensures that any hatched lice are killed off before they are mature enough to reproduce one week after the second treatment check for lice again a health provider can help you do this nits which are eggs or empty eggshells may remain for a while even after successful treatment this does not mean the infestation is still there however if there are moving lice or eggs that are not empty they may be able to hatch in this case see a doctor symptoms the presence of lice may not become apparent until 5 days to 3 weeks after the first contact itching and skin irritation are the main signs of an infestation itching will occur in the pubic region not when the insect bites but because the bite will trigger an allergic reaction to the louse saliva and feces the itching is usually worse at night red spots and skin lesions will appear usually as small red bumps or spots scratching may also result in marks blue spots on the skin may be visible on the thighs or lower abdomen other parts of the body may show symptoms such as the stomach upper thighs chest mustache and beard children may have symptoms around the eyelashes louse droppings may appear as dark brown or

the eyebrowsin the eyelashesin the hair around the anusin the hair of the armpitsin the pubic hair around the genital area after treatment empty eggshells may remain this does not mean the infestation is necessarily still present causes close body contact with another person is needed for lice to be passed on they cannot jump fly or swim but they crawl from one hair to another here are some common ways of passing on liceany type of sexual activitynonsexual bodily contact such as hugging or kissing but this is less commonsharing towels bedding and other personal items condoms do not protect

does not work in most cases one round of treatment will successfully kill all the lice however a second treatment is needed to kill lice that hatch after the first application one week after the
