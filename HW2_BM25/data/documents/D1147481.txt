science news from research organizations listening to classical music modulates genes that are responsible for brain functions date march 13 2015source helsingin yliopisto university of helsinkisummary although listening to music is common in all societies the biological determinants of listening to music are largely unknown according to a new study listening to classical music enhanced the activity of genes involved in dopamine secretion and transport synaptic neurotransmission learning and memory and downregulated the genes mediating neurodegeneration several of the upregulated genes were known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggesting a common evolutionary background of sound perception across species share full storya finnish study group has investigated how listening to classical music affected the gene expression profiles of both musically experienced and inexperienced participants all the participants listened to w a mozarts

of sound perception across species listening to music represents a complex cognitive function of the human brain which is known to induce several neuronal and physiological changes however the molecular background underlying the effects of listening to music is largely unknown a finnish study group has investigated how listening to classical music affected the gene expression profiles of both musically experienced and inexperienced participants all the participants listened to w a mozarts violin concert nr 3 gmajor k216 that lasts 20 minutes listening to music enhanced the activity of genes involved in dopamine secretion and transport synaptic function learning and memory one of the most upregulated genes synucleinalpha snca is a known risk gene for parkinsons disease that is located in the strongest linkage region of musical aptitude snca is also known to contribute to song learning in songbirds the upregulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans says dr irma järvelä the leader of the study in contrast listening to music downregulated genes that are associated with neurodegeneration referring to a neuroprotective role of music the effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating musicinduced effects researchers remark the findings give new information about the molecular genetic background of music perception and evolution and may give further insights about the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy story source materials provided by helsingin yliopisto university of helsinki note content may be edited for style
