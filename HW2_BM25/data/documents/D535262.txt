10 studies proving gmos are harmful not if science matters layla katiraee  genetic literacy project  november 13 2015activists often cite the alleged potential health risks of genetically modified foods one recent example of this— 10 scientific studies proving gmos can be harmful to human health  posted on collectiveevolutioncom—outlines many familiar concerns and points in each case to “credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why gmos should not be consumed” are these concerns credible what do the studies cited actually claim1 multiple toxins from gmos detected in maternal and fetal blood the blog post sites a 2010 study that alleges to show this danger the authors identified the bt protein cry1ab in maternal and fetal blood a protein found in some gmos but also commonly used as a pesticide in organic farming the paper is flawed the researchers measurements were based on an experimentassay designed to detect bt ’s cry1ab in plants not in humans as this post in biofortifiedorg explains the pregnant women in the study would have had to eat several kilos of corn in order to get the bt measurements that were detected in their blood additionally there’s the so what factor humans lack the receptors for the protein so it has no impact on us did you know that chocolate is toxic to dogs are you concerned that it might be toxic to you probably not if you are concerned then youve missed out on the greatest source of joy known to human taste buds some chemical compounds behave differently among species and both bt s cry1ab and chocolate are examples of this2 dna from genetically modified crops can be transferred into humans who eat them thats not what the cited 2013 study concluded the authors found that whole genes from our food can be detected in our plasma that does not mean that they’ve integrated into our dna it means that they’ve been found floating in the space between cells and thats any food not just gmos dna from gmos behave no differently than dna from organic or conventional foods if you arent concerned about the dna from blueberries transferring into you then you should not be concerned about dna from gmos either the paper’s deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments several recent papers see here and here have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little dna to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents for a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing see here 3 new study links gmos to gluten disorders that affect 18 million americans the article quotes for an alleged “study” by the institute for responsible technology irt but there is no study on the link of gmos to gluten allergies theres a link to a post on a webpage but there isnt a peerreviewed article irt is a oneman band run by activist jeffrey smith it is an ngo that advocates for the elimination of gmos from our food supply its not a university college or research institution it doesn’t do studies i’ve written about g luten allergies and gmos the celiac disease foundation has spoken out against the irts report gmo wheat has not been commercialized so any association of gluten allergies with the consumption of gmo wheat is on its face absurd as for charts that track an increase in gmo consumption in general and gluten allergies it’s a case of association with no causation ie the incidence of gluten allergies have increased over the past decade and the amount of gmos we eat have increased too but so have the number of plasma screens manufactured4 study links genetically modified corn to rat tumors this claim is the infamous seralini paper which was retracted and recently republished in a different journal without being peer reviewed the paper identified tumors in rats that were fed gmos andor the herbicide glyphosate longterm but the strain of rat used was predisposed to tumors the paper did not perform statistical analyses and used too few rats so it was not possible to determine if the tumors were due to the food the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rats would get tumors regardless of what they were fed finally the findings from seralinis paper are contrary to other longterm feeding studies an overview of the criticisms regarding this paper can be found here5 glyphosate induces human breast cancer cells growth via estrogen receptors this claim relates to glyphosate an herbicide used in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modified crops the cited paper examines the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth in approximately 80 percent of instances of breast cancer the diseased cells are hormone sensitive meaning they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread these researchers took two breast cancer cell lines one was estrogen sensitive and one was not and they examined the impact of increasing amounts of glyphosate on cell growth they found that glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen although the relationship was not as strong and it did not have an impact on the proliferation of the nonhormone sensitive breast cancer cell line the paper had numerous technical problems including the absence of data on controls a potentially critical omission additionally there actually seems to be a protective effect at higher concentrations of glyphosate instead of reaching a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer has an effect on cell growth there is no significant difference in cellular growth between the cells that received the highest doses of glyphosate and the controls which is why the data from the controls is an important factor this experiment was done with cells in a petri dish—what’s called an in vitro tissueculture experiment such research is of limited realworld value the cells are often finicky and need plenty of tlc in order to grow well different cell lines can also behave very differently the authors of the paper note some of these issues along with the fact that their data doesnt mesh with previous studies that have examined the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation  this previous paper suggests that glyphosate actually protects against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell lines and that glyphosate might be developed into an anticancer drug monsanto wrote a response to the paper noting that many studies examined the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none has found that the compound causes cancer some news reports misinterpreted the study writing that researchers concluded that glyphosate causes cancer when that is not the researchers findings they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate monsanto pointed out that even this finding is contrary to the body of evidence that exists on the topic the authors admit to this fact and discuss the appropriate next steps to examine this issue in micerats models for breast cancer i think that thats a great next step id also look at a few more breastcancer cell lines this is the most compelling research paper that ive read about that suggests a potential health risk surrounding glyphosate but the study must be reproduced and its issues ironed out however as i mentioned the paper isnt really about gmos as a class keep in mind that only a fraction of gmos are glyphosate resistant ie roundup ready crops and the use of glyphosate is not limited to gmos additionally the paper does several experiments with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth is very similar to that of glyphosates—meaning that there are natural compounds in our food that seem to have the same impact on breastcancer proliferation that this papers findings suggest for glyphosate there does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients although several publications have examined this issue without finding a positive correlation examples here here and here 6 glyphosate linked to birth defects no peer reviewed published scientific study makes such claims the source of this health concern is a publication by earth open source an antigmo ngo cofounded by an individual who also owns a gmotesting and certification company and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of antigmo sentiments see “about the authors” in this document7 study links glyphosate to autism parkinson’s and alzheimer’s the paper that led to this health claim does not constitute research its a hypothesis and no research was done to support the hypothesis the paper was reviewed by science journalist keith kloor at discover magazine who aptly compared it to a glenn beck chalkboard drawing the claims were printed in a payforplay journal also known as predatory journal meaning that for a fee one can get nearly anything published there have been several exposés on payforplay journals and many scientists believe that the phenomenon is eroding the quality of science heres an overview from naturecom here’s an exposé of pay for play journals8 chronically ill humans have higher glyphosate levels than healthy humans this claim is based on a paper published in the journal of environmental and analytical toxicology owned by the omics publishing group a notorious predatory publishing company the authors examined glyphosate levels in humans and different animals theres no indication of what the animals were fed how much how they were kept or myriad other variables any of these could invalidate the study the researchers do not say anything about the age sex weight height or genetic background of the humans or how much they ate if they washed their food how long they had been eating organicconventional diets and most mindblowing of all theres absolutely no definition for what constitutes being chronically ill any single issue that ive listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal9 studies link gmo animal feed to severe stomach inflammation and enlarged uteri in pigs in the study on which this claim is based the researchers gave pigs gmo feed and nongmo feed and identified the differences between the two groups the paper has been thoroughly challenged by many journalists and scientists journalist mark lynas highlighted the degree to which the data is cherrypicked the difference in inflammation between the gmfed and nongmfed pigs is apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories but theres no difference if you view it as a single category overall theres a high rate of inflammation for both groups which is not explained in the paper at the same time there are several parameters where gmfeed could be argued as having a protective effect there are 50 percent fewer heartabnormalities in pigs fed gmgrain but this isnt discussed as explained by geneticist anastasia bodnar the authors do not analyze the compositional differences in the feed between the two groups previous studies have determined that the environment ie water soil geography of a crop has a greater impact on proteins and metabolites than whether or not the crop is a gmo as such the differences seen in the pigs may not be due pesticides or presenceabsence of the transgenic protein rather they are most likely due to differences in composition of the feed geneticist val giddings notes that the animals had abnormally high rates of pneumonia which points to the possibility that something wonky was going on in conclusion even if the papers findings are real theres no knowing whether that’s due to something associated with transgenes or not because the researchers do not account for natural variation in the feed10 gmo risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety let’s set aside the fact that this isn’t a “ scientific study proving gmos can be harmful to human health ” which is the claim set out in the title there are three papers associated with this bullet point the first one is a review and i agree with a few of the points it makes it highlights the need for standardized tests and statistics in animal feeding studies for gmos and anyone who followed the seralini debacle would probably agree it summarizes papers that have performed feeding studies and their results however the review does not remove flawed papers from their overview and nor does it distinguish between feeding studies for gmo crops that have been commercialized vs crops that have never been submitted for regulatory approval the paper does not conclude gmo risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence the second paper is also a review piece the first author is affiliated with  friends of the earth  an antigmo ngo it does not constitute novel research and has a clear editorial slant the third paper does not even qualify as a review its a commentary published in 2002 in nature biotechnology which is a high caliber journal it outlined possible unintended consequences that could happen with a gmo—none of which have ever been documented or identified since then to the best of my knowledge in conclusion despite the title of the article none of these studies proves or even persuasively suggests that gmos can be harmful to human health the majority are either obviously flawed or are not scientific studies the current scientific consensus regarding gmos remains unchanged they are safe and do not pose a health risk to humans however a scientific consensus is subject to change if there is sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it but none of the studies reviewed here constitute such evidence layla katiraee contributor to the genetic literacy project holds a ph d in molecular
