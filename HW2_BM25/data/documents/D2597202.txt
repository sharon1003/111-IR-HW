superficial layers of neocortex periaqueductal gray substantia nigra stria terminalis nucleus accumbens shell and tegmental nucleus herein we provide evidence that cb 2 receptors in the thalamus play a functional role in the modulation of responses of neurons in the ventral posterior nucleus vpl of the thalamus in neuropathic but not shamoperated rats we describe a second such patient with infarctions involving the left dm and the right ventral posterior nucleus and ventral lateral nucleus nuclei adjacent to the dm associated with transient edema we found the connections normally described in the zrdctan mouse between i the inferior colliculus and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ii v1 and the superior colliculus iii the lateral posterior nucleus and v1 and between iv the inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate nucleus the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus vp receives two major sets of excitatory inputs one from the ascending somatosensory pathways originating in the dorsal horn dorsal column nuclei and trigeminal nuclei and the other originating from the cerebral cortex we report highly accentuated neuropathologic changes within the ventral posterior nucleus ventral posteromedial  vpmventral posterolateral  vpl of thalamus and in neuronal laminae iv and vi of the somatosensory cortex s1bf which receive and send information to the thalamic vpmvpl the thalamic lateral posterior nucleus lp of the hooded rat is regarded as a relay nucleus for the transmission of information from visuomotorrelated structures such as the superior colliculus pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus ppt and substantia nigra pars reticulata to visual cortical areas as well as the striatum we used rat thalamic brain slices and whole cell recordings from relay cells in various first order the lateral geniculate nucleus the ventral posterior nucleus and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate body and higher order the lateral posterior the posterior medial nucleus and the dorsal portion of the medial geniculate body relays to explore their responses to activation of muscarinic receptors here we used laser scanning photostimulation to compare in young mice 912 days old the organization of the reticular inputs to first and higherorder somatosensory relays namely the ventral posterior lateral nucleus and posterior nucleus respectively in contrast those to the posterior nucleus were complicated and varied considerably among neurons although almost all contained a single elliptical region near the reticulothalamic border in most cases they consisted of additional discontinuous regions or relatively diffuse regions throughout the thickness of the thalamic reticular nucleus our results suggest two sources of reticular inputs to the posterior nucleus neurons one that is relatively topographic from regions near the reticulothalamic border and one that is relatively diffuse and convergent from most or all of the thickness of the thalamic reticular nucleus we propose that the more topographic reticular input is the basis of local inhibition seen in posterior nucleus neurons and that the more diffuse and convergent input may represent circuitry through which the ventral posterior lateral and posterior nuclei interact we report a sequential neuroimaging study in a 48yearsold man with a history of chronic hypertension and lacunar strokes involving the ventral lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus the lateral posterior nucleus and pulvinar lppulvinar complex are the principal thalamic nuclei associated with the elaborate development of the dorsal and ventral streams of the parietal cortex in primates differentiation of the ventral nuclei is evident with the ventral posterior nucleus of the platypus enormously expanded into the interior of the cerebral hemisphere where it adopts a relationship to the striatum not seen in other mammals we now examine the hypotheses that thalamic lesions must extend posterior to the ventral caudal nucleus vc and include ventral medial posterior nucleus vmpo to result in loss of cold sensibility and cpsp the prepacemaker nucleus ppn in the area

the ventral portion of the medial geniculate nucleus auditory and the higher order posterior nucleus somatosensory and the medial portion of the medial geniculate nucleus auditory we found that the relative percentage of synapses from rl terminals varied significantly among these nuclei these values being higher for first order nuclei 126 for the ventral posterior nucleus and 82 for the ventral portion of the medial geniculate nucleus than for the higher order nuclei 54 for the posterior nucleus and 35 for the medial portion of the medial geniculate nucleus in the ipsilateral posterior nucleus there was a significant decrease of 38 at 2 days of monoarthritis the data suggest that gaba b2 m rna expression in the ventrobasal complex and posterior nucleus is regulated by noxious input

of the thalamus by retrograde labeling from the pn neurons in the ventral posterior medial vpm nucleus and the medial division of the posterior nucleus pom react in a similar manner although pom neurons are more profoundly depressed by inactivation of the contralateral bfc than vpm neurons we studied the responses to sensory stimulation of three diencephalic areas the central posterior nucleus of the dorsal thalamus the anterior tuberal nucleus of the hypo thalamus and the preglomerular complex in the central posterior nucleus most units were unimodal in the anterior tuberal nucleus of the hypo thalamus most units responded to more than one modality and showed a stronger response decrement to stimulus repetitions than units in the central posterior nucleus our data suggest that units in the central posterior nucleus are primarily involved in the unimodal processing of sensory information whereas units in the anterior tuberal nucleus of the hypo thalamus may be involved in multisensory integration results show that the lesions were centered upon the posterior portion of the ventral lateral vlp nucleus of the thalamus included the posterior part of the ventral lateral anterior nucleus vla and extended posteriorly to encroach upon the most rostral sector of the sensory ventral posterior nucleus vpla most notably there were differences in local input to neurons that based on analogy to barrel cortex are likely to project only to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus versus those that are likely to also project to the lateral posterior nucleus accordingly we recorded bursting behavior in single cells from awake behaving rhesus monkeys in firstorder the lateral geniculate nucleus the ventral posterior nucleus and the ventral portion of the medial

in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus using highresolution immunoelectron microscopy the central posterior nucleus of teleost fish is a cluster of neurons in the dorsal thalamus that plays an important role in controlling social behaviors in the lateral posterior nucleus despite a reduction in mean cell size there was not a significant change in either nuclear area or number of neurons

the lamination patterns of spinal cells projecting to the zona incerta zi intralaminar nuclei and ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus have been explored these results are similar to those seen after injections into the intralaminar or ventral posterior nuclei except that in the latter cases more labelled cells are located in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn particularly from the

lateral geniculate body lg and lateral posterior nucleus lp of the thalamus together but not lesions of lg or lp alone completely blocked the expression of fearpotentiated startle to a visual conditioned stimulus cs but not to an olfactory cs in contrast the other main thalamic relay of visual information the pulvinar and lateral posterior nucleus in carnivores is largely a higherorder relay since much of it seems to relay information from one cortical area to another previous studies have suggested that the descending pathway from the primary somatosensory si cortex to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus has only a mild facilitative influence over thalamic neurons extracellular single unit recordings were made in the medial and lateral ventro posterior nucleus

investigated for the marmoset monkey by recording from 55 single tactilesensitive neurons in the lateral division of the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus vpl with a projection to either si or sii identified with the use of the antidromic collision technique to understand how the interneuronmediated inhibition in the thalamus is regulated we studied the muscarinic effects on interneurons in

ascending afferents corticothalamic synapses in reticular nucleus contain slightly more glu r23 and three times more glu r4 than those in ventral posterior nucleus the data indicate that in comparison to the lateral posterior nucleus the maturation of neurons within the d lgn and min is incomplete with respect to cell body size during the early postnatal period the selective elimination of early cortical connections stemming from dorsal lateral geniculate laminae a and a1 and from the intermediate division of the lateral posterior nucleus may occur through a process of axon collateral withdrawal from the expanded cortical sites thereby giving rise to the adult pattern the lesions were located within the pulvinar the sensory nuclei the mediodorsal nucleus and the ventral lateral

of area 17 cortical terminals in the lateral division of the lateral posterior nucleus lpl of the cat and medial division of the inferior pulvinar nucleus ipm of the owl monkey we have investigated the possibility that the striaterecipient zone of the lateral posterior nucleus pulvinar complex may be responsible for the spatial and temporal frequency processing in posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex since these two regions establish strong bidirectional connections and share many visual properties visual responses in suprasylvian cortex were recorded before during and after the deactivation of the lateral part of the lateral posterior nucleus accomplished by the injection of lidocaine or gaba out of this number 11 units were affected by the deactivation of the lateral part of lateral posterior nucleus and one cell by the blockade of pulvinar in addition there were no significant differences between the low and high cutoff spatial frequency values computed before and after the deactivation of the lateral posterior nucleus deactivating the lateral posterior nucleus did not modify the direction selectivity nor the organization of the subregions of the lateral suprasylvian cortex classical receptive fields the absence of strong changes in posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex cell response properties following the functional blockade of the lateral posterior nucleus suggests that the projections from this part of the thalamus are not essential to generate the spatial characteristics of most posteromedial lateral suprasylvian cortex receptive fields on the other hand it is possible that the lateral posterior nucleus lateral suprasylvian cortex loop may be involved in other functions such as the analysis of complex motion as suggested by the findings from our and other groups we provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus type ii trn cells most likely function as recurrent inhibitory interneurons for the lateral posterior nucleus pulvinar complex lp because they could be activated antidromically by lp stimulation and orthodromically activated via axonal collaterals of lp cells in

neonatal tectal lesions in hamsters result in the elimination of a major central target of retinal axons massively denervate the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus lp and lead to a marked increase of the retinolp projection isolated clusters of stained neurons were also observed in the lateral posterior nucleus in the dorsal part of the medial geniculate nucleus and in the ventromedial

compared with the morphological development of dyeinjected cells they were not antidromically activated from an electrode in the region of the ventral posterior nucleus in the thalamus we have previously investigated the ventrolateral posterior nucleus of thalamus in gaers and found no neuron loss neurons of this thalamic cell group intermingle with cells of the central posterior nucleus cp to form a complex called cpppn the hypothesis that excessive stimulation of the lateral posterior nucleus by daily training in a radial maze may have facilitated the necrosis was supported by the inverse relationship between a linear combination of the numbers of normal neurons and oligodendroglia and the rate of learning during the earlier but not the later sessions preembedding immunogold histochemistry was combined with phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin anterograde tract tracing in order to analyse the relationship between the subcellular localization of the glu r1a metabotropic

projection from the rats superior colliculus sc to the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus lp has previously been described as arising from a morphologically homogeneous population of neurons in the stratum opticum so the lateral posterior nucleus contained numerous cbdir cells and fibers throughout its extent and it was thus difficult to determine the extent to which the extraperikaryal

hypo thalamus and densely innervates the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus and adjacent basal parts of the lateral hypothalamic area medial preoptic nucleus principal nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis ventral lateral septal nucleus posterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala posterior nucleus and immediately adjacent regions of the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala superficial injections led to labelling of both cells retrograde and terminals anterograde in areas of the ipsilateral primary and secondary auditory cortex and in its dorsoposterior field in an ipsilateral dorsal association area patches of label probably in ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex in the contralateral homotopic uf and in the ipsilateral medial geniculate body mgbv mgbd and mgbm and caudal posterior nucleus complex for example the neuropil of several thalamic nuclei ie dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus lateral posterior nucleus ventro posterior nucleus  cerebral cortex upper layers of the superior colliculus and matrix zones of the neostriatum were strongly immunoreactive while the anterior commissure corpus callosum optic tract and internal capsule were devoid of staining the mediorostral lateral posterior nucleus subparafascicular lateral geniculate and habenular nuclei also contained calretinin messenger rna probe label we show that somatostatin m rnacontaining neurons are widely distributed in a number of nuclei and grey areas of the human brain including neocortex putamen nucleus caudatus nucleus accumbens amygdala midbrain medulla oblongata hippocampal formation reticular nucleus of the thalamus and posterior nucleus of the hypo thalamus on lesion mapping on ct or mri all patients had involvement of the lateral part of the thalamus ventral posterior nucleus and ventral lateral nucleus these structures are near the corticospinal pathways and the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus explaining why hemiataxia is associated with hemiparesis or hypaesthesia in this type of infarct electrical stimulation of the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus elicited increases in extracellular serotonin concentration in the spinal cords of anesthetized monkeys1 the region traditionally described as the ventro posterior nucleus vp is a composite of vp proper and parts of the ventroposterior inferior nucleus vpi 3 in architecture location and cortical connections the region traditionally described as the anterior pulvinar ap of monkeys resembles the medial posterior nucleus pom of other mammals and we propose that all or most of ap is homologous to pom the footshock led to an increase in the interaction of the two main subsystems at the level of connections between primary visual cortex and the lateral posterior nucleus and a descending negative influence from the secondary visual cortex became dominant in thalamus the radioactivity was heterogeneously distributed the highest amounts being in the lateral posterior nucleus hrp injections into the rostral stp led to labeling in the lateral part of the gmv the anterodorsal division of the principal medial geniculate complex gmad and the lateral division of the posterior nucleus pol in an effort to determine whether this change reflected differential transneuronal degeneration of these cell types or alterations in the dendritic arbors of surviving cells this study reexamined this issue by restricting the analysis to a specific and relatively homogeneous subpopulation of superficial layer neurons those that project to the lateral posterior nucleus lp these cells surround the primordium of the medial geniculate body participating in the constitution of its marginal zone and invade the lateral posterior nucleus accumulating within its caudomedial part the density of positive axons and boutons was quite variable but regions which displayed the most massive network of axons included structures within the hypo thalamus itself anterior periventricular preoptic nucleus caudal and lateral hypo thalamus  ventral telencephalon superior and ventral subdivisions thalamictuberal areas central posterior nucleus and tuberal neuropil within the ventral territory of the prepacemaker nucleus and brainstem nuclei dorsal reticular nucleus and the medial paralemniscal nucleus retrogradely labeled neurons were present in the lateral posterior nucleus posterior nucleus of rioch pulvinar and medial interlaminar nucleus as well as in the lgn at all ages studied as in normal adult cats retrograde labeling also was present in the c layers of the lgn the medial interlaminar nucleus the posterior nucleus of rioch the lateral posterior nucleus and the pulvinar nucleus ipsilateral to a neonatal or adult lesion second in the lateral posterior nucleus and primary visual cortex the footshock led to significant enhancement of the metabolic responses to the patterned light it can be concluded that the distribution of nmda but not ampa receptors in the rat barrel field shows a strong coincidence with the zone of termination of the specific sensory afferents from the ventral posterior nucleus of the dorsal thalamus  extracellular recording intracellular recording intracellular horseradish peroxidase injection and receptive field mapping techniques were employed to evaluate the physiological and morphological properties of medial ventral posterior nucleus vpm and posterior nucleus pom neurons in normal adult rats this staining was demonstrated to be confined entirely within the medial division of the lateral posterior nucleus which is considered to be the principal tectorecipient zone of the extrageniculate visual thalamus three distinct pathways ascend from the torus semicircularis to the telencephalon they course through either 1 the lateral preglomerular nucleus of the posterior tuberculum 2 the anterior tuberal nucleus of the hypo thalamus or 3 the central posterior nucleus of the dorsal thalamus the efferent projections of the central posterior nucleus are presently unknown but the lateral preglomerular and anterior tuberal nuclei project to nonoverlapping portions of the telencephalon the dorsohorizontal stripe consisting of sir fibers terminals and roughly 200 cell bodies unilaterally stretches from the edge of the third ventricle at the thalamic dorsal posterior nucleus and the central posterior nucleus approximately 400 microns laterally to the ppn virtually no ca bp neurons were retrogradely labeled after injections of hrp into the predorsal bundle and dorsolateral midbrain tegmentum or into the lateral posterior nucleus the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus lgnd and the lateral posterior nucleus lp and of cell bodies projecting to these nuclei has been studied in the visual cortex of the wallaby macropus eugenii throughout development to determine how the characteristic laminar distribution of afferents and efferents of the mature cortex is achieved after phal injection in the face forelimb or hindlimb motor cortical areas small and densely packed boutons about 1 micron in diameter en passant and terminaux were seen in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus and more sparsely in the reticular nucleus the nucleus ventrobasalis and the posterior nucleus of the thalamus a separate projection with giant boutons 510 microns in diameter en passant and terminaux terminated in the posterior nucleus of the thalamus exclusively labeled neuronal elements in the anteromedial part pom of the posterior nucleus po were topographically organized as an upright body representation that mirrored a map in the ventroposterior nuclei vp it also has reciprocal connections with the nucleus lateralis posterior the dorsal and medial divisions of the medial geniculate nucleus and the caudal part of the posterior nucleus of the thalamus it has been demonstrated that a dorsal part of the pulvinar pl and a dorsal part of the caudal area of the lateral posterior nucleus lp projected mostly to the middle suprasylvian gyrus mssg while a ventral part of pl and a ventral part of the rostral area of lpto the rostral suprasylvian gyrus rssg the projections from the lateral lpl intermediate lpi and medial lpm subdivisions of the cat lateral posterior nucleus n we found that unilateral eye removal produced a progressive increase in fibrous substance p immunoreactivity in the nucleus of the optic tract lateral posterior nucleus and lateral geniculate nucleus of the side contralateral to the enucleation on the other hand unilateral lesions to the superficial layers of the superior colliculus produced a dramatic reduction in substance p immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral nucleus of the optic tract lateral posterior nucleus and dorsal and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei in bilaterally enucleated animals unilateral lesion to the superior colliculus produced as expected loss of immunoreactive fibers only in the lateral posterior nucleus and the retinorecipient nuclei ipsilateral to the lesion these results suggest that transneuronal changes in the distribution of substance p in collicular neurons observed after enucleation could be reflected in their projections to the other primary visual centers and to the lateral posterior nucleus  the results indicate that 1 each of the areas has a distinct pattern of distribution of afferent neurons in the ipsilateral visual thalamus  area 17 receives its principal thalamic input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus the caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b receive a major thalamic input from the lateral posterior nucleus and a minor input from the posterior nucleus while the rostral parts of areas 18a and 18b receive a major input from the posterior nucleus and a minor projection from the lateral posterior nucleus 2 the rostral and caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b each receive an associational input from area 17 3 the rostral parts of areas 18a and 18b each receive associational input from three different extrastriate regions the caudal part of the same extrastriate area and the rostral and caudal parts of the other extrastriate area whereas the caudal parts of areas 18a and 18b receive associational inputs only from one or two extrastriate regions 4 area 17 area 18b and rostral area 18a each receive a substantial associational input from lamina v of the caudal part of the frontal eye field fef in the motor cortex however the input from the fef to caudal area 18a if present is very small 5 the extrastriate areas studied receive associational input from the restrosplenial cingulate area 29d however the input from area 29d to area 17 appears to be very small the superficial layers of the cats superior colliculus innervate the medial subdivision of the thalamic lateral posterior nucleus lpm in the present study many neurones in the principal visual thalamic relay nuclei the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus dlg and to a lesser extent those in the lateral posterior nucleus lp were destroyed by injections of the neurotoxin  kainic acid  on the first day of postnatal life immunocytochemical methods have been combined with serial thin section analysis to study the synaptic organization of serotonin 5ht and tyrosine hydroxylase th immunoreactive terminals in the ventral posterior nucleus of the cat and monkey thalamus corticogeniculate axons are first detected in the geniculate and lateral posterior nucleus at 48 days after birth while corticocollicular axons first reach the superior colliculus at 71 days and by 81 days have innervated the superficial layers in syrian hamsters mature retinal terminals contain only low levels of the growthassociated protein gap43 whereas the lateral posterior nucleus lp of the thalamus contains high levels of this protein the densities of beta1 but not beta2 adrenoreceptors were increased in hypo thalamus anterior and lateral nuclei thalamus ventral posterior nucleus and amygdala basolateral nucleus of the stz diabetic rats moreover 3 days after ischemic insult 45ca had accumulated in the ipsilateral substantia nigra and ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus on p3 and p4 30 h after tracer was deposited in the cortex the hrp reaction product was observed in the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate body and in the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus but no labeled axons were observed in the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body lgbv until p5 in immature material both dendritic processes and somata in the mgd stain for nissl with our protocol many of these cells show a stellate arborization pattern that distinguishes this region from the mgv but is similar to the staining pattern of immature neurons of the lateral posterior nucleus the aberrant projection was traced radioautographically to the tectorecipient zone of the lateral posterior nucleus after an injection of tritiated amino acid in the parabigeminal nucleus lesions extending toward the anomalous terminal field in the lateral posterior nucleus however prevented the survival of a normal number of neurons in the parabigeminal nucleus when the unilateral tectal ablation was made together with a lesion of the ipsilateral posterior neocortex that produced cell loss in the thalamus the number of neurons remaining in the middle division of the contralateral parabigeminal were linearly related to the cell content of the lateral posterior nucleus we conclude that the anomalous target in the tectorecipient zone of the lateral posterior nucleus effectively replaces the normal projection field in the superior colliculus with regard to the trophic requirements for neuronal survival during development of the parabigeminal nucleus injections in al and ast produced retrograde transport to neurons in the medial division of the medial geniculate body mgm pin suprageniculate nucleus sg and to a lesser extent the lateral posterior nucleus lp the present experiments showed that there is a corticothalamocortical projection system in the cat which originates from the primary visual cortex relayed by the lateral part of the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus and reaching the medial bank of the lateral suprasylvian visual area extracellular microelectrode method and stereotaxic technique of brain were used to investigate the effects of radix salviae miltiorrhizae on the discharges of visceral pain in the posterior nucleus of thalamus poin cats contralateral input only was observed in the lateral posterior nucleus the present study was designed to investigate the relationship between the precruciate cortex pre ctx and the ventral lateral posterior nucleus vpl of the thalamus in the mechanisms of acupuncture analgesia neurons belonging only to first two groups were found in the lateral posterior nucleus  view all
