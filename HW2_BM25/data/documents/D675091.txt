math algebra introduction to algebra equation types of equations types of equations algebra is a vast subject that studies about the algebraic expressions and equations an algebraic expression is the combination of constants and variables where constants are the fixed quantities and variables are quantities that susceptible to vary equations are found everywhere in mathematics an algebraic equation refers to an algebraic expression with a symbol of equality  in other words an equation is a n expression which has an equal to  sign between the two algebraic quantities or a set of quantity for example  few algebraic equations are 1 4m n  2m  0 2 7a  4b  9c   8 3 2 sin a  cos a  2cos a students may come across several different types of algebraic equations  1 linear equation 2 quadratic equation 3 polynomial equation 4 trigonometric equation 5 radical equation 6 exponential equation solving equations means to find the value or set of values of unknown variable contained in it let us go ahead in this chapter and learn more about different types of differential equations and sample problems based on those different types of equations back to top an equation is an important part of calculus which comes under mathematics it helps us to solve many problem types of algebraic equations lets discuss different types of algebraic equations1 linear equations a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable the graph of linear equation is a straight line if there are two variables general form of the linear equation with two variablesy  mx  c m 0 where m is known as slope and c at that point on which it cut y axis linear equations with different variablesa the equation with one variable an equation who have only one variable examples8a  8  09a  72b the equation with two variables an equation who have only two types of variable in the equation examples7x  7y  128a  8d  749a  6b  82  0c the equation with three variables an equation who have only three types of variable in the equation examples5x  7y  6z  1213a  8b  31c  746p  14q 7r  82  02 radical equations an equation whose maximum exponent on the variable is and have more than one term or we can say that a radical equation is an equation in which the variable is lying inside a radical symbol usually in a square root examples3 quadratic equations quadratic equation is the second degree equation in one variable contains the variable with an exponent of 2 the general formax 2  bx  c  0 a 0examples of quadratic equations8x 2  7x  75  04y 2  14y  8 05a 2  5a  354 exponential equations an equation who have variables in the place of exponents exponential equation can be solved using the property   x  y examplesa b  0 here a is base and b is exponent4 x 08 x  325 rational equations a rational equation is one that involves rational expressions example types of math equations back to top here we will solve some algebraic equations solved examples question 1 solve the quadratic equation x 2  6x  27  0 solution given quadratic equation x 2  6x  27  0 x 2  6x  27  0 x 2  9x  3x  27  0  x x  9  3 x  9  0  x  3 x  9  0  either x  3  0 or x  9  0  x  3 or x  9 the values of x are 3 9 question 2 solve 8 x  32 solution given equation is 8 x  32  8 x  32 or 2 3 x  2 5 or 2 3x  2 5 since the bases of the equation are same set the exponents equal to one another  3x  5 x  question 3 solve  2 solution given equation is  2   2 to isolate the x squaring both side  x  3  4 x  4  3 x  1 percent change related topics math help online online math tutor
