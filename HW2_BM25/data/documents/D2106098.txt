exoplanets news astronomers have announced the discovery of a planet that is very nearly the same size as earth and orbiting its star in the habitable zone—that is at the right distance from its star to have liquid water on its surface we don’t know how earth like it is but this shows that we’re edging closer and closer to finding another earth and this one is the best bet we’ve found so far phil plait phil plait writes slate ’s bad astronomy blog and is an astronomer public speaker science evangelizer and author of death from the skiesthe planet is called kepler186f and was discovered using the kepler space telescope which was designed to look for planets orbiting other stars kepler exploits what’s called the transit method it stares at 150000 stars all the time looking for dips in the amount of light received from every star the idea is that if a star has planets and if we see the orbits edgeon then every time the planet passes between us and its parent star it’ll block an teensy bit of light usually far less than 1 percent this method is extremely powerful—about a thousand planets have been found this way in kepler data in fact most of the planets found this way have been from kepler another cool thing is that if you know how big the star is and we generally do then you can also determine the size of the planet by how much light it blocks kepler186f is one of the big success stories it’s part of a minisolar system a fiveplanet system orbiting a red dwarf a smaller cooler star than the sun the other four planets kepler186be are all very roughly earthsize but orbit far closer to the star ranging from 51 million kilometers 32 million miles to 165 million kilometers 10 million miles—for comparison mercury orbits the sun at a distance of about 50 million kilometers 31 million miles so this really is a solar system shrunk down but even though the star is cooler than the sun these planets are close enough to it to be pretty hot even the farthest of the four previously known would be hot enough to boil water on its surface assuming it has a surface worlds alike a comparison of the sizes of earth and kepler186f drawing by nasa amesseti institutejplcal tech186f is different though it orbits farther out about 53 million kilometers 33 million miles from the star where temperatures are more clement making some basic assumptions it lies near the outside edge of the star’s “habitable zone” where liquid water can easily exist on the surface of a planet we know of several dozen planets like that in the galaxy so far but what makes 186f special is its size it’s only about 11 times the size of earth together these make it potentially the most earthlike planet we’ve yet found i say potentially because honestly we don’t know all that much about it besides its size and distance from its star and its year—it takes 130 days to orbit the star once the next things we’d need to know about it are the mass what its atmosphere is like and the surface temperature the gravity of the planet depends on its mass and in many ways the atmosphere depends on the gravity unfortunately we don’t know either and we’re unlikely to the techniques used to find planet masses aren’t up to the task for this planet—the star is too dim to get reliable data the same is true for any air the planet might have as well and without that we don’t really know its surface temperature so we don’t know if this planet is like earth or more like venus with an incredibly thick poisonous atmosphere that keeps the surface ridiculously hot or like mars with very little air making it cold it could be a barren rock or a fecund water world or made entirely of styrofoam peanuts or some weird thing we haven’t even imagined yet still our models of how planets form are getting better and we’re getting a handle on how they behave according to what we know it’s most likely that kepler186f is a rocky planet like the earth with a similar surface gravity that in turn implies it could have water but again we just don’t know and anything beyond this is speculation there are a lot of factors in making a planet habitable as a random one it may take a magnetic field to make a planet livable ours protects us from the constant stream of subatomic particles the sun emits which over several billion years would have eroded away earth’s atmosphere that may be what happened to mars to be fair i’ll note that there is one planet found before that’s roughly the size of earth though bigger than kepler186f and in its star’s habitable zone but in that case the planet orbits at a distance where it receives about as much heat and light from its star as venus does from the sun … and look where that got venus kepler186f is therefore more likely to be earthlike than that other planet though again we can’t be sure with the information we have now top comment the bad news about kepler 186f1 its 500 ly distant2 it might be tidally locked because its closer in than venus this depends on its initial spin rate at formation which we dont know3 moreandrew pjoin in still this is exciting news—after all one of the main mission objectives of kepler was to do just this find an earthsized planet in its star’s habitable zone so my congrats to the team of astronomers involved it’s very nice indeed to see a spacecraft achieve its goal and there’s still lots and lots of data to go through from kepler there could easily be many many more such worlds hidden in the blips of starlight kepler has returned to earth we’re pretty sure there are billions— billions —of earthsized planets in the galaxy we now know of four that are in their star’s habitable zone if you include venus and the other planet i mentioned… and we also know that some worlds are outside the strict definition of the hz and yet still have liquid water jupiter’s moon europa and saturn’s moon enceladus  we’ve only just started looking who knows what else is out there tip o’ the lyot stop to
