lithiumlets start our look at the second row of the periodic table with lithium li lithium is the third element of the periodic table and was discovered in 1817 by a chemist named arfvedson you might find lithium in everyday objects such as medicines and batteries this is the first metal encountered in the periodic table and it is a silvery colored solid when purified one thing to remember is that lithium is never found alone in nature it is always bonded to other elements scientists use the letter pair li to represent lithium in chemical equations you might find it bonded to chlorine cl from the other side of the periodic table in the molecule lithium chloride li cl where can you find lithium batteries you have batteries in many of your toys in flashlights you need batteries in your watch you probably have a battery well most of those batteries need lithium to work lithium is an important element in the way a battery makes electricity medicine lithium is used as a medicine too when you take lithium it acts on nerves in your brain and changes the way you act rocks and soil lithium is a metallic element and is found in many rocks when youre out gathering interesting looking rocks lithium is probably one of the elements inside hot springs sometimes people take vacations at resorts some of those resorts are near springs were not talking about a spring that bounces up and down but mineral water springs that come out of the ground many people think that is healthy and fun to find these springs nuclear reactors lithium is a very important element in nuclear reactors it is a very light element which makes it important to scientists it is used in many chemical reactions and processes air conditioners next time its really hot out and youre nice and cool inside you should thank lithium lithium is used in air conditioning systems you know that everyone uses air conditioning that means everyone is using some lithium► more about the orbitals and compounds of lithium► next element of the periodic table
