goodsservicesvarious types of breach and more is contract law common sense no unfortunately those entering into contracts  including businesses involved in commercial transactions  often assume that common sense will govern so they fail to consult a civil litigation lawyer until it is fairly late in the game it is important to understand the basics of contract law the basics fortunately there is a detailed body of law governing contracts contract law sets a universal framework to determine whether you have a binding agreement what are the terms when a breach occurs and what damages are available lets cut right to the key questions that we are asked every day1 how is a contract formed and do all parties have to sign something2 is an oral contract enforceable3 how do you determine who is in breach4 what damages are recoverable5 does a contract have to be fair1 contract fo rm ationa contract requires an offer acceptance  something of value bargained for also called consideration or bargained for exchange plus reasonably specific terms offer lets start with the offer an offer is an objective manifestation of an intent to be bound to an agreement you going to walmart setting a tv on the checkout counter and handing over your credit card may suffice but not you saying to the walmart rep hey would you take 600 for this 650 tv acceptance the offer is accepted via the communication of an intent to be bound in a manner consistent with the offer if you set a tv on the counter of walmart and the clerk runs outside and puts a note on your car saying we accept that will not suffice you wanted to know before leaving the store whether you a deal fortunately you dont have to read each others minds courts look at the objective implication of the parties conduct in walmart your offer implied a certain way to accept by ringing you out at the register not putting a note on your car that example sounds silly but it illustrates an important point in pennsylvania a contract to settle a multibillion dollar lawsuit does not need to be in writing and hence many times during negotiations one party may think he has a deal when the other disagrees plus these fastpaced times texts and emails play a massive role in negotiations the courts are frequently called upon to resolve whether an offer has been accepted when one party hit send our law firm recently litigated a six figure case in this area we filed a petition to enforce a settlement agreement where no party had endorsed a writing see vycom v crighton plastics gd 10023363 court of common pleas of allegheny county the case resolved favorably for our client a settlement via email or other expression of intent of the parties through their appointed counsel is sufficient to create a binding agreement see commerce bankpennsylvania v first union nat bank 911 a2d 133 2006 “as a general rule signatures are not required unless such signing is expressly required by law or by the intent of the parties” id at 145 quoting shovel transfer  storage inc v pennsylvania liquor control bd 559 pa 56 739 a2d 133 136 1999 consideration a unilateral contract is unenforceable unilateral means that only one party is doing something a promise to make a gift is not enforceable each party must have skin in the game in the form of something specific exchanged it could be a promise for a promise or a service exchanged for another thing this is called consideration consideration in the amount of 1 in exchange for a brand new car can suffice if that is what the seller is truly bargaining for most rules have exceptions even if consideration is lacking a claim may exist for detrimental reliance or promissory estoppel if one has reasonably relied on a promise to his detriment the relying party can sue but only to the extent of his reliance  so if i promise to give you my car and you donate yours to charity in reliance i may be liable to you for the cost of you replacing your car if i break my promise likewise even if no contract exists if one party has done something that unjustly enriches another party a claim may exist for the amount of enrichment if for example a contractor goes to the wrong address and builds a beautiful garage that improves the value of the property but the property owner had no contract with the builder the contract may potentially have a claim for unjust enrichment if a court thinks that fairness requires it reasonably specific terms an agreement must included the essential terms a court can imply or read into the contract certain nonessential terms to effectuate the intent of the parties but the essential terms must be agreed upon what are essential terms this depends on the nature of the transaction if for example you are buying a car price is an essential term if key terms are greed upon and there is objective manifestation of intent to be bound it may not matter whether your contract is vague as to the exact time you will pick up the car unless the timing is essential to one party if one party makes a mistake about a contract term saying one price meaning another for example thats considered a unilateral mistake and the contract will remain enforceable against the mistaken party if however the the other party knows of the mistake or if there is a mutual mistake both parties are mistaken about price for example then the contract may not be enforced against either what the terms can you look beyond a writing for terms what about prior emails between the parties to determine the terms the answer is maybe courts look to the intent of the parties if there is a written agreement and the parties include a merger clause or zipper clause  saying this is the only agreement and prior statements are not part of the agreement  then you cannot look at prior transactions absent a zipper clause the courts may look beyond the four corners of the document to determine the parties intent this is called the parol evidence rule parol means outside the courts will not admit evidence of intent with regard to a fully integrated written agreement one containing a zipper clause note that the courts imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing in every contract in pennsylvania this will not create a basis to recover punitive damages or attorney fees as discussed below but it may does spare the parties the burden to write into every contract this shall be carried out in good faith etc what about fine print is that enforceable in many instances yes the question is did the parties have a chance to read it if one party inserts fine print and the other party opted against even reading it ignorance is no defense however if you go skiing and the resort owner prints language on the back of your ticket that you might never read thats considered a contract of adhesion and you may not be bound on limitations of liability as stated on the back of the ticket for example call any time for a free consultation 41278000082 oral contracts versus written contractsyou might ask how do i enforce an oral contract in pa or can i enforce it at all allow us to clear up some term terminology first oral contracts are sometimes referred to as verbal contracts or  verbal agreements  but thats not technically correct  oral  means spoken verbal is anything involving words something verbalized and you can verbalize in writing or through speech ok with that out of the way when does a contract have to be in writing the truth is not very often as mentioned above an oral agreement will suffice to settle a multibillion dollar lawsuit in pittsburgh pennsylvania in fact in pa most oral contracts are enforceable the only types of contracts that must be in writing are those involving the sale of an interest in real property land and buildings the sale of goods in excess of 500 if it falls within the uniform commercial code or ucc leases of real property in excess of one year residential construction and home improvement contracts and certain other specific types of agreements what type of agreement does not need to be in writing there are many these include contracts for any type of service everything from car washes to agency agreements the sale of goods that fall outside of the ucc settlements of lawsuits landlordtenant leases and agreements capable of performance within a year most often the issue with oral contracts is proof however a trial lawyer worth his salt can help you explore every option to maintain or defend a claim regarding an oral contract this is where experience and deep knowledge of the rules of evidence and procedure can carry you a long way call any time for a free consultation 41278000083 who is in breach some breaches are ok if immaterial to the overall transaction however some breaches go to the essence of the agreement and are considered a material breach those are more serious and allow the nonbreaching party to sue for damages but here you have to be careful if your opponent has only committed a minor or immaterial breach your attempt to set aside the contract could by itself constitute the material breach for this you should talk to a lawyer asap4 damages recoverablelets say the other side has materially breached and its clear they failed to pay you for services or they performed services and damaged your property now what in contract law you can sue for the benefit of your bargain meaning if someone agreed to sell you a nearnew mercedes worth 30000 for only 10000 then breaches the agreement you can sue for 20000 the benefit of your bargain but not for the car itself unless it is so unique it cannot be replaced few things meet that standard except for land no two parcels are alike or a rare painting can you sue for punitive damages or attorney fees you can also sue for consequential damages certain out of pocket expenses to repair or fix something to deal with the consequences of the breach but not for attorney fees punitive damages  stress lost wages unless its an employment contract inconvenience or pain and suffering  those things are not recoverable for a breach of contract but you may have a separate claim for fraud a total scam or recklessness or if your insurance company has failed to pay your claim properly you may have a claim for bad faith click here to learn about how court costsare calculated rescission is always available to those who have been defrauded by false representations a contract can be rescinded fraud in the inducement of a contact is where a party knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement to someone and that entices the person to enter into an agreement that he otherwise would have declined fraud during the performance of a contract however may not be actionable as the gist of your claim may be for breach of contract not fraud and thus you may only receive breach of contract damages not those recoverable for fraud such a punitive damages or attorney fees if your contract involved or involves consumer goods or services the other partys breach may trigger the unfair trade practices and consumer protection law which may entitle you to an award for treble or triple damages plus attorney fees if the other party had engaged in deceptive practices call any time for a free consultation 41278000085 fairness does a contract have to be fair this one is easy no way never unless one party owes a special duty to the other as his fiduciary for example otherwise all bets are off contracts are expressions of freedom to negotiate and the courts will not step in and second guess whether something is fair the whole point of entering into a contract is you think youre getting the best deal not the most fair deal to all parties if you dont like the deal you can walk away before agreeing to it by this token the courts will protect your good deals but not save you from poor ones unless the other side has violated the rules of the game the fact is modern civilization depends on a universal understanding of contract law imagine how long it would take to build a new home much less a skyscraper if the subcontractor hired to pour the foundation played by his own rules in terms of breach or contract interpretation the fact is all consumer and business transactions depend on uniformity in dealings helping youwe covered a lot and i hope you found this helpful to avoid civil litigation or to help you navigate it once it is filed but either way you should at least talk to a lawyer briefly to know your rights call for a free consultation 412 7800008
