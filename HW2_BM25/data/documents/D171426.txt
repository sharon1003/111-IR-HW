roman numeric system basic decimal pattern the original pattern for roman numerals used the symbols i v and x 1 5 and 10 as simple tally marks each marker for 1  i added a unit value up to 5  v  and was then added to  v to make the numbers from 6 to 9 i ii iii iiii v vi vii viii viiii x the numerals for 4  iiii and 9  viiii proved problematic among other things they are easily confused with iii and viii  and are generally replaced with iv one less than 5 and ix one less than 10 this feature of roman numerals is called subtractive notation the numbers from 1 to 10 including subtractive notation for 4 and 9 are expressed in roman numerals as follows i ii iii iv v vi vii viii ix x 2the system being basically decimal tens and hundreds follow the same pattern thus 10 to 100 counting in tens with x taking the place of i l taking the place of v and c taking the place of x  x xx xxx xl l lx lxx lxxx xc c note that 40  xl and 90  xc follow the same subtractive pattern as 4 and 9 similarly 100 to 1000 counting in hundreds c cc ccc cd d dc dcc dccc cm m many numbers include hundreds units and tens the roman numeral system being basically decimal each place is added separately in descending sequence from left to right as with arabic numbers for example the number 39 is xxxix three tens and a ten less one 246 is ccxlvi two hundreds a fifty less ten a five and a one as each place has its own notation there is no need for place keeping zeros so missing places can be simply omitted thus 207 for instance is written ccvii two hundreds a five and two ones and 1066 becomes mlxvi a thousand a fifty and a ten a five and a one 3 4roman numerals for large numbers are nowadays seen mainly in the form of year numbers other uses are detailed later in this article as in these examples1776 as mdcclxxvi the date written on the book held by the statue of liberty 51954 as mcmliv as in the trailer for the movie the last time i saw paris 61990 as mcmxc used as the title of musical project enigma s debut album mcmxc a d named after the year of its release2014 as mmxiv the year of the games of the xxii 22nd olympic winter games in sochialternative forms a typical clock face with roman numerals in bad salzdetfurth germany the standard forms described above reflect typical modern usage rather than a universally accepted convention usage in ancient rome varied greatly and remained inconsistent in medieval and modern times 7inscriptions dating from the roman period not infrequently use additive forms such as iiii and viiii for 4 and 9 instead of iv and ix there are even instances of both forms appearing within the same document while in standard usage subtractive notation is limited to use of adjacent numerals so that 99 for example is written xcix forms such as ic are not unknown xiix or iixx are sometimes used for 18 instead of xviii the latin word for eighteen is often rendered as the equivalent of twenty less two which may be the source of this usage sometimes v and l are not used with instances such as iiiiii and xxxxxx rather than vi or lx 8 9an inscription on admiralty arch london the number is 1910 for which mcmx would be more usual clock faces that use roman numerals normally show iiii for four o’clock but ix for nine o’clock a practice that goes back to very early clocks such as the wells cathedral clock of the late 14th century 10 11 12 however this is far from universal for example the clock on the palace of westminster in london aka  big ben  uses a normal iv 11at the beginning of the 20th century different representations of 900 conventionally cm appeared in several inscribed dates for instance 1910 is shown on admiralty arch london as mdccccx rather than mcmx while on the north entrance to the saint louis art museum 1903 is inscribed as mdcdiii rather than mcmiii 13history preroman times and ancient rome although roman numerals came to be written with letters of the roman alphabet they were originally independent symbols the etruscans for example used    ⋔  and ⊕ for i v x l c and m of which only i and x happened to be letters in their alphabet hypotheses about the origin of roman numerals tally marks one hypothesis is that the etruscoroman numerals actually derive from notches on tally sticks which continued to be used by italian and dalmatian shepherds into the 19th century 14thus ⟨ i ⟩ descends not from the letter ⟨i⟩ but from a notch scored across the stick every fifth notch was double cut ie ⋀ ⋁ ⋋ ⋌ etc  and every tenth was cross cut  x  iiiiλiiiixiiiiλiiiixii  much like european tally marks today this produced a positional system eight on a counting stick was eight tallies iiiiλiii or the eighth of a longer series of tallies either way it could be abbreviated λiii or viii  as the existence of a λ implies four prior notches by extension eighteen was the eighth tally after the first ten which could be abbreviated x and so was xλiii likewise number four on the stick was the inotch that could be felt just before the cut of the λ  v  so it could be written as either iiii or iλ  iv  thus the system was neither additive nor subtractive in its conception but ordinal when the tallies were transferred to writing the marks were easily identified with the existing roman letters i v and x the tenth v or x along the stick received an extra stroke thus 50 was written variously as n и k ψ ⋔ etc but perhaps most often as a chickentrack shape like a superimposed v and i ↆ this had flattened to ⊥ an inverted t by the time of augustus and soon thereafter became identified with the graphically similar letter l likewise 100 was variously ж ⋉ ⋈ h or as any of the symbols for 50 above plus an extra stroke the form ж that is a superimposed x and i like  came to predominate it was written variously as i or ɔic was then abbreviated to ɔ or c with c variant finally winning out because as a letter it stood for centum latin for hundred the hundredth v or x was marked with a box or circle thus 500 was like a ɔ superimposed on a ⋌ or ⊢ becoming d or ð by the time of augustus under the graphic influence of the letter ⟨d⟩ it was later identified as the letter d an alternative symbol for thousand was i or ciɔ or cꟾɔ  and half of a thousand or five hundred is the right half of the symbol i or iɔ or ꟾɔ  and this may have been converted into ⟨d⟩ 15 this at least was the etymology given to it later on meanwhile 1000 was a circled or boxed x ⓧ ⊗ ⊕ and by augustinian times was partially identified with the greek letter φ phi over time the symbol changed to ψ and ↀ the latter symbol further evolved into ∞ then ⋈ and eventually changed to m under the influence of the latin word mille thousand hand signals alfred hooper has an alternative hypothesis for the origin of the roman numeral system for small numbers 16 hooper contends that the digits are related to hand gestures for counting for example the numbers i ii iii iiii correspond to the number of fingers held up for another to see v then represents that hand upright with fingers together and thumb apart numbers 6–10 are represented with two hands as follows left hand right hand 6  v i  7  v ii  8  v iii  9  v iiii  10  v v and x results from either crossing of the thumbs or holding both hands up in a cross another possibility is that each i represents a finger and v represents the thumb of one hand this way the numbers between 1–10 can be counted on one hand using the order i p ii pr iii prm iv it v t vi tp vii tpr viii tprm ix in x n ppinky rring mmiddle iindex tthumb nno fingersother hand this pattern can also be continued using the other hand with the fingers representing x and the thumb l intermediate symbols deriving from few original symbols a third hypothesis about the origins states that the basic ciphers were i x c and φ or ⊕ and that the intermediary ones were derived from taking half of those half an x is v half a c is l and half a φ⊕ is d  17 the φ was later replaced with m the initial of mille the latin word for thousand middle ages and renaissance minuscule lowercase letters were developed in the middle ages well after the demise of the western roman empire and since that time lowercase versions of roman numbers have also been commonly used i ii iii iv and so on since the middle ages a  j  has sometimes been substituted for the final  i  of a lowercase roman numeral such as  iij  for 3 or  vij  for 7 this  j  can be considered a swash variant of  i  see example 1  the use of a final  j  is still used in medical prescriptions to prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it is written 18 19numerals in documents and inscriptions from the middle ages sometimes include additional symbols which today are called medieval roman numerals some simply substitute another letter for the standard one such as  a  for  v  or  q  for  d  while others serve as abbreviations for compound numerals  o  for  xi  or  f  for  xl  although they are still listed today in some dictionaries they are long out of use 20number medieval abbreviation notes and etymology5 a resembles an upsidedown v also said to equal 5006 ↅ either from a ligature of vi

the letters i v x l c d and m by putting these letters together the reader would obtain a number usually indicating a particular year modern use by the 11th century hindu–arabic numerals had been introduced into europe from alandalus by way of arab traders and arithmetic treatises roman numerals however proved very persistent remaining in common use in the west well into the 14th and 15th centuries even in accounting and other business records where the actual calculations would have been made using an abacus  replacement by their more convenient arabic equivalents was quite gradual and roman numerals are still used today in certain contexts a few examples of their current use are spanish real using iiii instead of iv as regnal number of charles iv of spain names of monarchs and popes eg elizabeth ii of the united kingdom pope benedict xvi these are referred to as regnal numbers eg ii is pronounced the second this tradition began in europe sporadically in the middle ages gaining widespread use in england only during the reign of henry viii previously the monarch was not known by numeral but by an epithet such as edward the confessor some monarchs eg charles iv of spain and louis xiv of france seem to have preferred the use of iiii instead of iv on their coinage see illustration generational suffixes particularly in the us for people sharing the same name across generations for example william howard taft iv in the french republican calendar initiated during the french revolution years were numbered by roman numerals – from the year i 1792 when this calendar was introduced to the year xiv 1805 when it was abandoned the year of production of films television shows and other works of art within the work itself it has been suggested – by bbc news perhaps facetiously – that this was originally done in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programmes 23 outside reference to the work will use regular hindu–arabic numerals hour marks on timepieces in this context 4 is usually written iiii the year of construction on building faces and cornerstones page numbering of prefaces and introductions of books and sometimes of annexes too book volume and chapter numbers as well as the several acts within a play eg act iii scene 2 sequels of some movies video games and other works as in rocky ii  outlines that use numbers to show hierarchical relationships occurrences of a recurring grand event for instance the summer and winter olympic games eg the xxi olympic winter games the games of the xxx olympiadthe super bowl the

xxx  this usage has also been inconsistent specific disciplines entrance to section lii 52 of the colosseum with numerals still visible in astronomy the natural satellites or moons of the planets are traditionally designated by capital roman numerals appended to the planet’s name for example titan s designation is saturn vi in chemistry roman numerals are often used to denote the groups of the periodic table they are also used in the iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry for the oxidation number of cations which can take on several different positive charges they are also used for naming phases of polymorphic crystals such as ice in computing roman numerals may be used in identifiers which are limited to alphabetic characters by syntactic constraints of the programming language in la te x for instance labelitemiii refers to the label of an item in the third level iii of a nested list environment in military unit designation roman numerals are often used to distinguish between units at different levels this reduces possible confusion especially when viewing operational or strategic level maps in particular army corps are often numbered using roman numerals for example the american xviii airborne corps or the ww2era german iii panzerkorps with hinduarabic numerals being used for divisions and armies in music roman numerals are used in several contexts movements are often numbered using roman numerals in music theory the diatonic functions are identified using roman numerals see roman numeral analysisindividual strings of stringed instruments such as the violin are often denoted by roman numerals with higher numbers denoting lower strings in pharmacy roman numerals are used in some contexts including s to denote one half and n to mean nothing 25 see the sections below on  zero  and  fractions  in photography roman numerals with zero are used to denote varying levels of brightness when using the zone system in seismology roman numerals are used to designate degrees of the mercalli intensity scale of earthquakes in tarot roman numerals with zero are used to denote the cards of the major arcana in theology and biblical scholarship the septuagint is often referred to as lxx as this translation of the old testament into greek is named for the legendary number of its translators  septuaginta being latin for seventy in entomology the broods of the thirteen and seventeen year periodical cicadas are identified by roman numerals in advanced mathematics including trigonometry statistics and calculus  when a graph includes negative numbers its quadrants are named using i ii iii and iv these quadrant names signify positive numbers on both axes negative numbers on the x axis negative numbers on both axes and negative numbers on the y axis respectively the use of roman numerals to designate quadrants avoids confusion since hinduarabic numerals are used for the actual data represented in the graph modern use in continental europe some uses that are rare or never seen in english speaking countries are relatively common in continental europe for instance capital or small capital roman numerals are widely used in romance languages to denote centuries eg the french xviii esiècle 26 and the spanish siglo xviii mean 18th century slavic languages in and adjacent to russia similarly favour roman numerals  xviii век  on the other hand in slavic languages in central europe like most germanic languages one writes 18 with a period before the local word for century boris yeltsin s signature dated 10 november 1988 the month

tombstones the month is written in roman numerals while the day is in hinduarabic numerals 14 vi 1789 and  vi 141789 both refer unambiguously to 14 june 1789 timetable on a shop window in vilnius roman numerals are sometimes used to represent the days of the week in hoursofoperation signs displayed in windows or on doors of businesses 27 and also sometimes in railway and bus timetables monday taken as the first day of the week is represented by i sunday is represented by vii the hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time in the example case left the business opens from 10 am to 7 pm on weekdays 10 am to 5 pm on saturdays and is closed on sundays note that the listing uses 24hour time sign at 179 km on route ss4 salaria north of rome roman numerals may also be used for floor numbering 28 29 for instance apartments in central amsterdam are indicated as 138 iii with both a hinduarabic numeral number of the block or house and a roman numeral floor number the apartment on the ground floor is indicated as  138huis  in italy where roads outside builtup areas have kilometre signs major roads and motorways also mark 100metre subdivisionals using roman numerals from i to ix for the smaller intervals the sign  ix  17 thus marks kilometre 179 a notable exception to the use of roman numerals in europe is in greece where greek numerals based on the greek alphabet are generally used in contexts where roman numerals would be used elsewhere special values zero the number zero does not have its own roman numeral but the word nulla the latin word meaning none was used by medieval scholars in lieu of 0 dionysius exiguus was known to use nulla alongside roman numerals in 525 30 31 about 725 bede or one of his colleagues used the letter n the initial of nulla or of nihil the latin word for nothing in

conveniently expressed using the normal seven letter symbols of conventional roman numerals 1630 on the westerkerk in amsterdam with the date expressed in apostrophus notation apostrophus one of these was the apostrophus 34 in which 500 usually written as  d  was written as  ɔ while 1000 was written as c  ɔ instead of  m  15 this is a system of encasing numbers to denote thousands the c s and ɔ s functioned in this case as the roman equivalent of parentheses and has its origins in etruscan numeral usage each extra set of c combined with ɔ raises c  ɔ by a factor of ten for example cc  ɔɔ is 10000 and ccc  ɔɔɔ is 100000 whereas the  ɔ representing 500 is raised by a factor of ten by combining it with a ɔ for example  ɔɔ is 5000 and  ɔɔɔ is 5000 the d and m used to represent 500 and 1000 in conventional roman numerals were probably derived from  ɔ and c  ɔ respectively for example base number c  ɔ  1000cc  ɔɔ  10000ccc  ɔɔɔ  100000with  ɔ ɔ  500 c  ɔ  ɔ  1500 broken down as c  ɔ plus  ɔ cc  ɔɔ  ɔ  10500 broken down as cc  ɔɔ plus  ɔ ccc  ɔɔɔ  ɔ  100500 broken down as ccc  ɔɔɔ plus  ɔwith  ɔɔ ɔɔ  5000 cc  ɔɔ  ɔɔ  15000 broken down as cc  ɔɔ plus  ɔɔ ccc  ɔɔɔ  ɔɔ  105000 broken down as ccc  ɔɔɔ plus  ɔɔwith  ɔɔɔ ɔɔɔ  50000 ccc  ɔɔɔ  ɔɔɔ  150000 broken down as ccc  ɔɔɔ plus  ɔɔɔsometimes c  ɔ was reduced to ↀ for 1000 john wallis is often credited for introducing the symbol for infinity modern ∞ and one conjecture is that he based it on this usage since 1000 was hyperbolically used to represent very large numbers similarly  ɔɔ for 5000 was reduced to ↁ cc  ɔɔ for 10000 to ↂ  ɔɔɔ for 50000 to ↇ and ccc  ɔɔɔ for 100000 to ↈ 14page from a 16thcentury manual showing a mixture of apostrophus and vinculum numbers see in particular the ways of writing 10000 vinculum another system is the vinculum where a conventional roman numeral is multiplied by 1000 by adding an overline 14 although mathematical historian david eugene smith disputes that this was part of ancient roman usage 35 the notation was certainly in use in the middle ages and is at least a convenient and conventional way to express numbers greater than 3999 in roman numerals for instance iv for 4000xxv for 25000adding vertical lines or brackets before and after the numeral seems to have been used at least by late medieval times to multiply a roman numeral by 10 thus  m  for 10000 rather than x perhaps under the influence of arabichindu numerals which were by this time coming into use in combination with the overline the bracketed forms might be used to raise the multiplier to say ten or one hundred thousand thus viii  for 80000 or 800000 xx  for 200000 or 2000000this needs to be distinguished from the custom of adding both underline and overline to a roman numeral simply to make it clear that it is a number eg mcmlxvii see also egyptian numerals etruscan numerals kharosthi numerals roman abacus protowriting roman numerals in unicode pentimal system references gordon arthur e 1982 illustrated
