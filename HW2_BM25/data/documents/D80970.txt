of ordnance and of gunnery should be such that they would be able to make minor repairs to guns—to supervise all work in connection with guns to command detachments which were of such size as not to warrant a commissioned officer being assigned to them they are at present in command of marine detachments at naval magazines are performing duty as first sergeants of regularly organized companies at various posts in connection with the repair of guns at various marine corps stations in connection with the training of recruits and in general performing duties that require the utmost reliability for a number of years candidates for promotion to this grade were required to take a special course of instruction before receiving their warrants but recently because of the lack of first sergeants and the numerous small detachments organized it has been necessary to detail many of them for duty as first sergeants as soon as there are a sufficient number of first sergeants available it is intended to reestablish the school and to give gunnery sergeants a thorough course of instruction prior to their permanent appointment to this grade in order that they may be experts in all matters pertaining to the care and preservation of naval ordnance at the time of this congressional testimony there were 82 gunnery sergeants in the usmc culture edit gunnery sergeants are commonly referred
