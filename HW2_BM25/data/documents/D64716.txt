treatment provider western u s i noticed the comment that without insurance the cash pay or out of pocket cost for proton treatment for prostate cancer can reach 40000 i would just like to highlight that this is very dated i paid double that cost and in comparison with other pbrt centers in the u s this was at the low end one was over 200000 and this was considered cash rate without insurance so i expect that insurance would be billed a great deal more i was told by one proton center that billed charges to insurance could exceed 300000 or more but payment would be based on contract rate with insurance if they approved proton treatment which in my case they did not was this post helpful to you yes no report prohibited or spam comment on your experience with radiation therapy subject amount
