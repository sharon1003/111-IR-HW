forces to gauge how much someone has had to drink and determine whether or not alcohol use contributed to a crime perpetrated smaller breathalyzers are also available for personal use using a breathalyzer regularly after drinking can help an individual gauge how his or her body metabolizes liquor to use a breathalyzer and interpret the results it is first important to understand how a breathalyzer works history of breathalyzers the concept of the breathalyzer dates back to the mid1700s at that time j j plenc proposed that poisons could be identified chemically and proceeded to chemically identify alcohols for purely academic purposes this line of academic study continued for two centuries in 1937 a professor at indiana university rolla n harger began using chemical testing to specifically measure levels of intoxication he patented the drunkometer in 1938 unfortunately the drunkometer had to be recalibrated every time it was moved the modern breathalyzer was invented by professor robert f borkenstein in 1954 it remains the primary intoxication identifier because it is highly portable and accurate types of brethalyzers there are multiple types of breathalyzers each using a slightly different scientific method to determine the alcohol level in the blood based on the alcohol breathed into a mouthpiece as alcohol is consumed and metabolized it enters the bloodstream when the blood travels to the lungs for oxygenation the alcohol in the blood moves across the membrane and into the alveoli or the lungs air sacs so as a person exhales alcohol is released along with carbon dioxide this alcohol is detected by the breathalyzer and used to determine the users bloodalcohol content the ratio of breath alcohol to alcohol in the blood is 2100 parts to one this means that 2100 milliliters of exhaled breath will contain the same amount of alcohol as one milliliter of blood this is why it is essential for a deep breath to be exhaled fully to get an accurate breathalyzer reading factors that can affect accuracy there are multiple factors that can affect a breathalyzer tests accuracy being aware of these factors can help people avoid an overly high reading and serious legal trouble shallow breath not taking a deep enough breath or not blowing into the breathalyzer correctly can lead to an inaccurately low reading or an error reading if there is an error reading on an official breathalyzer by a law officer a blood test may be required if a user is testing his or her own level it will simply lead the user to an inaccurate conclusion recent drinking if a person has consumed an alcoholic beverage within 20 minutes of taking a breathalyzer it can read inaccurately high this is because alcohol remaining in the mouth which is stronger than that exhaled from the lungs is pushed into the breathalyzer ahead of the breath itself and raises the bloodalcohol content detected make sure to wait 20 minutes between the last liquorbased beverage and taking a breathalyzer to ensure the most accurate results breathalyzer accuracy there are a few things users can do to maintain the accuracy of the breathalyzer that they are using technique for the most accurate results to get the most accurate results from a breathalyzer test wait at least 20 minutes after drinking or smoking to take the test blow into the machine with a slow steady breath trying to blow with the same force each time the test is taken always blow into the breathalyzer until the machine signals the user to stop do not push any buttons while the breathalyzer determines the bloodalcohol content which may take several seconds maintaining a breathalyzers accuracy breathalyzers should also be recalibrated every 200 to 300 tests to ensure accuracy recalibration should be completed by the breathalyzer manufacturer in some cases the manufacturer can simply provide the user with a newly calibrated cylinder which can be installed in the breathalyzer by the user types of breathalyzer testing there are several types of technology used to create breathalyzer testing machines fuel cells are more expensive but are also more accurate intoxilyzers on the other hand are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and use infrared spectrum technology to detect and gauge the level of alcohol in the blood fuelcell fuel  cell breathalyzers are the only form of breathalyzer that can be legally admitted to court as evidence they use the same fuelcell technology as the fuel cells currently being developed as a vehicle power source inside the device are two platinum electrodes with a porous acid layer between them when alcoholtainted air is passed through the fuel cell the platinum oxidizes the alcohol to produce a specific acid it also produces a body of protons and electrons this energy passes through electric pathways in the cell the greater the electric current produced the higher the blood alcohol level detected color change breathalyzers this device contains two vials of liquid each holds a mixture of chemicals which when combined with the exhaled alcohol causes a chemical reaction resulting in a change of color when a user breathes into the device it bubbles through the first vial filled with a mixture of chemicals as the breath passes through the mixture the sulfuric acid removes the alcohol from the water and moves it into a liquid solution the alcohol then reacts with the potassium dichromate to produce chromium sulfate potassium sulfate acetic acid and water this mixture is compared with the second vial of unaltered chemicals to determine the bloodalcohol level intoxilyzers intoxilyzers use infrared technology to determine intoxication molecules of different types vibrate at different speeds and therefore absorb infrared light differently inside an intoxilyzer an internal lamp emits a broadband infrared beam the beam is pushed through a chamber where the exhaled breath is stored and then through a filter wheel the filter is set to detect specific wavelengths that are absorbed by ethanol in the alcoholic exhalations the greater the light absorption the higher the bloodalcohol content detected law enforcement use for a law enforcement official to administer a breathalyzer test he or she must be trained in how to give the test how to calibrate the test and how to legally record and report the test results a driver is considered drunk if the blood alcohol level detected is above 08 grams per 100 milliliters of tested blood breathalyzer myths there are many urban legends about ways to beat breathalyzer tests many of these are myths and cannot be used to beat the test in a legal setting sucking on pennies there is a longheld belief that sucking on pennies will lower the amount of alcohol that is detected by the breathalyzer because the copper somehow alters or eliminates the alcohol in the emissions copper cannot block or alter the alcohol furthermore pennies are made predominantly of nickel and cannot change the breathalyzers findings eating and drinking many people believe that eating a large meal breads or other heavy substance to absorb the alcohol will make their breathalyzer test lower similarly it is believed that drinking a soda or coffee which contains caffeine will sober an individual up enough to drive unfortunately while both of these actions may reduce the physical effects of the alcohol and make an individual feel more sober and alert it will not alter the bloodalcohol content or change the reading on a breathalyzer certain alcoholic beverages it is believed that certain alcoholic beverages like zima cannot be perceived by a breathalyzer test this is not true while it is true that the higher a beverages alcohol percentage the less of the alcohol it takes to raise the bloodalcohol content it is not true that some alcohols cannot be detected shopping for a breathalyzer test when shopping for a breathalyzer consider not only the initial investment but the ongoing cost of maintenance and calibration look for breathalyzers that are new and in their original packaging as secondhand items may be less accurate or damaged a user cannot guarantee when calibration is needed or if it is accurate at the time of purchase buying breathalyzers on e bay if youre ready to start looking at breathalyzers on e bay head to the electronics department and continue to the tv  audio  surveillance section from there you can proceed to the gadgets  other electronics section and continue to the breathalyzer subsection you can then sort by keychain models handheld models or tabletop models you can also sort by brand location sensor technology and other search modifiers be sure to check the sellers feedback in order to ensure that the breathalyzer youre buying is of good quality its important to not purchase a lowquality item as it could lead to inaccurate readings conclusion breathalyzers are a powerful tool designed not only to help law officers determine how much a suspect has had to drink but also to help individuals monitor their alcohol consumption and bloodalcohol level there are multiple kinds of technology used in breathalyzers to determine how much alcohol is in an exhalation each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages generally the more accurate and specific the breathalyzers results the more complex the technology used and the more expensive the machine is to purchase select a breathalyzer based on its total cost its usability and its ongoing maintenance requirements
