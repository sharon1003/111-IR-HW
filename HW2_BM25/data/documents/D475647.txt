a history of journalism the longing of news is important and indispensable for many therefore understanding why this need is so big is essential some myself included might assume that news is essential to some because they want to be aware and in the loop of the most important events taking place in their city or around the world oddly enough the access to news is essential for a very different reason as a timefiller according to mitchell stephens book called “a history of news”  most people use newspapers to kill time and for personal use like movie listings and checking the weather before they get dressed in the morning stephens p10 this was discovered by a sociologist named bernard berelson who studied the reaction of new yorkers after a newspaper 17day strike on june 30 1945 when looking at reactions and asking if it was really important to read the newspapers the reactions and replies were a strong yes but only one third of the people observed sais it was due to their need to keep up with certain stories stephens p10 most admitted to using the newspaper as timefillers and as a tool to get their lives organized journalism began by an urge to tell others of news that only they or very few knew about early in the twentieth century people would bargain and trade objects and food for news it was all about word of mouth and who said what stephens p20 unfortunately word of mouth can get tricky because messages tend to get distorted and eventually end up being almost completely different than the original piece of information distributed messengers criers and minstrels were the answer to making sure many people could hear the same news all at once reducing the chances of distortion leaders of large societies like the zulu king in the 1930’s needed to get their information quickly distributed but in an effective way this is where trained news specialists more specifically runners were used stephens p21 messengers or news specialists were very beneficial to the person who hired or used them a king could use messengers to control and select what news was sent out to his people which meant a control over members of their society and also a power over what news was received stephens p23 this is an image of a crier for the liberal faction of the hopi tribe at the turn of the 20th century photo mitchell stephens criers were a little different then messengers messengers delivered news to certain people targeted people whereas criers would enter a village and stand in the middle of a street and yell out their news stephens p22 according to stephens criers were “the most regular and trustworthy form in which news was presented to preliterate societies” p22 the messages criers carried were structured in order to be easily remembered and addressed their audience in a direct way p23 criers were around at the turn of the 2oth century and were used for many years stephens p23 coffeehouses and novellistesanother method for getting news around which was extremely popular in the 1930’s was similar to messengers yet it required the inquirers to gather at a specific location in order to get their news these locations were coffeehouses or pubs according to stephens these were ideal locations because “the beverage pulls people in and loosens their tongues the place fills with news” p33 this was an engraving done by edward ward in 1720 representing the coffeehouses and how heated news talk could get photo mitchell stephens eventually spoken news which was done with criers and messengers as explained earlier began to be on the decline coffeehouses were extremely threatened by the 18th century in europe due to the beginning of printed news stephens p37 in order to try and keep their customers coffeehouses would buy and subscribe to every print news available to them as an attempt to keep their business’s as busy as they used to be according to stephens by the 19th century newspapers who were done with the telegraph and the steam press would disperse news within mintues and reach a much larger audience much quicker than spoken news ever did although it was a huge advantage for newspapers it did not eliminate spoken news p37 people would still talk about the news but they would talk about news that derived from the press p37 printed news and controlling the news handwritten letters began to travel more and more and columbus is an example of this when he sent out a letter about his discoveries to the court in 1493 stephens p72 according to mitchell stephen’s the letter explained that columbus discovered an “island inhabited by people wearing certain leaves about their genitals but nothing more” p72 the picture below is of the exact letter of columbus this is the exact letter from columbus describing his discoveries in the indies and was printed in 1493 photo mitchell stephens the most influential technology of all time has to be the printing press as stephens explains when talking about the printing press “no invention changed the amount of information available to humankind as radically as the nonelectric handoperated machine that arrived in europe in the 15th century” p75 it was revolutionary but it also intensified the battle for the control of the news p77 a huge issue which i touch on in my other sections of the website is how journalists control the news with today’s social media and citizen journalists it is much harder for journalists to control what information is sent out and how to approach their stories although this is true today controlling the news has been part of journalism for almost its entire existence monarchs would control the news that went out and would make sure that the news were not giving a bad image of the government p80 this is a reproduction of the gutenberg printing press photo mitchell stephens balladswritten letters were around for many years and eventually news ballads came out from the reign of charles viii to the end of the 19th century stephens p85 they relate to spoken news because they are written to be performed out loud these ballads were worth a lot and very costly for example one ballad could get in return 40 shillings and a bottle of wine p85 below is an example of what a ballad looks like when part of a pamphlet which is how they used to print news this is an example of a news ballad written by thomas deloney printed in 1588 photo mitchell stephens the first newspapersit arrived in early 17th century europe stephens p131 what qualifies a newspaper as a newspaper is that it needs to be available to a significant portion of the public needs to be published regularly has variety in each issue and finally it has to have a recognizable title or format p131 this is one of the oldest surviving european newspapers and printed approximately around 1609 photo mitchell stephens although historians might agree that these qualifications are what distinguish a newspaper there might have been an earlier newspaper which came out in 1566 in venice they were called “handwritten news sheets” as well as known under the name of “gazettes” p137 the information and evidence on the venice news sheets is not clear enough to really confirm it as the worlds first newspaper but i think it is interesting to compare it with the previous image therefore i included an image of these news sheets below handwritten news sheet written in may 1566 photo mitchell stephens the history of journalism is one that is long to explain but the above information provided is the most important in order to answer to my argument coffeehouses and the control of news by monarchs are the important facts to consider when comparing journalism back then to journalism today my next section will look at how social media affects journalism advertisements
