many options in the way of colors finishes etc which can make your cost per square foot go up or down the first step in estimating your floor replacement project is to narrow down your choice of flooring material when you have between one and three it is easier to do the math and understand the costs involved at that point simply multiply the square footage by the flooring cost per square foot to arrive at the total materials cost we recommend adding 10 to this due to incidental needs like curved edges which mean you need a whole new piece or having to cut the flooring due to the edge needed for a wall labor costs calculation of labor isn’t as straightforward as estimating the materials the reason is that what contractors might charge to remove the current flooring especially in cases of tile and hardwood can vary wildly installation costs can vary just as much so we would recommend contacting 23 contractors and asking how much they charge per square foot for removal and installation of flooring depending on your square footage you might get a discount usually for projects over 500 sq ft example formula to calculate all flooring costs as an example let’s say i’m replacing my carpeting with tile flooring the tile i’m installing is 150 per square foot and i’m redoing my kitchen which is 250 square feet a contractor has quoted me a flat 150 feet for ripping up and hauling away my used carpet and will install the new tile flooring for 3 per square foot let’s figure materials first 150 per square foot for the tile multiplied by 250 square feet which equals 375 add in 10 and the total for flooring materials comes to 41250 for labor 3 times 250 square feet equals 750 no need to add 10 here add in the removal and haul away for the carpeting and the total labor cost is 900 the total flooring installation price will be the sum of 41250 for the materials plus 900 for the labor therefore the estimated cost is 131250 plus applicable taxes if you don’t wish
