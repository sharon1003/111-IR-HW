time or visitation is a legal term referring to the opportunity for the child to spend time with the parent who does not have sole legal custody this parent is often called the noncustodial parent custody and parenting time problems arise most often when parents ask the court for a dissolution of the marriage divorce or a legal separation however custody problems may also arise between parents who have never been married or who no longer live together custody and parenting time problems do not go away after the divorce is final in these situations parents sometimes disagree about who makes decisions affecting the childs health welfare and education where the child lives and how much parenting time a noncustodial parent has who decides custody and parenting time parents may agree between themselves about custody or parenting time however if the parents cannot agree and if the arizona legal system becomes involved for example when a parent asks the court for a divorce only the superior court may decide these issues questions about custodywhat is meant by sole custody this means that one person has sole legal custody of a child in this situation the court orders that one parent be responsible for making the major decisions regarding the child’s care or welfare although both parents may discuss these matters the parent designated by the court has authority to make final decisions in the event the parents do not agree what is meant by joint custody this means joint legal custody or joint physical custody or both in most cases in order to obtain an order for joint custody both parents must agree to and submit a written parenting plan to the court can more than one parent be granted custody by the court yes in addition to sole custody the law allows the court to grant joint legal custody and joint physical custody or both what is legal custody legal custody is the status where one or both parents are responsible for making the major decisions regarding the child’s care or welfare when legal custody is awarded to one parent it is called sole legal custody the law does not favor one form of custody over another what is joint legal custody when the court grants joint legal custody each of the parents has the same rights to make decisions about the child’s care and welfare and neither parent’s rights are superior to those of the other parent in the best interest of the child the court may direct that certain decisions be made by only one parent even when joint legal custody is granted the court may order joint legal custody without ordering joint physical custody if parents have joint legal custody does the child live with each of them for equal amounts of time not necessarily having joint legal custody does not mean that parents also have joint physical custody or equal parenting time see section 25403 arizona revised statutes what is joint physical custody when the court grants joint physical custody the place where the child lives the childs physical residence is shared between the parents in a way that the child will have essentially equal time and contact with both parents joint physical custody may be granted in situations where parents share joint legal custody or when one parent is granted sole custody does the law favor joint custody or sole custody arizona law does not favor one form of custody over another also the court may not prefer a parent as a custodian because of that parents sex what is the procedure for getting a custody order the court may grant a custody order only in certain kinds of cases most often custody is determined when the parents are seeking a legal separation or divorce or when parents are asking the court to change a custody decision that was made in an earlier separation or divorce case custody also may be ordered when one parent starts a court case to decide paternity or maternity of a child when a parent starts a court case for legal separation or divorce and the parents cannot agree about child custody custody automatically becomes an issue for the court to decide these court decisions are made in temporary orders hearings and in final trial if the parties are unable to reach agreement after a decree of legal separation or divorce has been granted the court still has authority to change modify an earlier custody order how can a court’s custody order be changed either parent may request in writing that the court modify a custody order to change an existing order it must be shown that the best interests of the child are served the request is filed with the clerk of the superior court and a fee for filing is charged however there are limitations on requesting a modification for example a request may not be filed for one year from the date of the earlier order unless there are special circumstances seriously endangering the childs physical mental emotional or moral health if a form of joint custody has been ordered a modification may be requested at any time if there is evidence that domestic violence spousal abuse or child abuse has occurred since the date the last order was granted in a joint custody situation a parent must wait six months before seeking a modification if the reason for the request is that one parent has failed to obey the courts custody order how does the court make its decision about custody if there is a dispute about custody the court sometimes refers the parents to internal court mediation services this process gives the parents an opportunity to reach an agreement regarding custody and related issues however if the parents are unable to agree on custody the court will decide for them sometimes the court seeks professional advice from outside experts who evaluate the family situation or offer an opinion about custody in some situations the court also may order an investigation by a social service or other agency in every case the court must decide custody based on a determination of the best interests of the child what if the parents agree how custody should be decided usually it is best if parents can agree on decisions about raising children after a legal separation or divorce

court by law may require that the court not accept the parents agreement what does the court consider when deciding what is in the childs best interests in custody disputes state law provides guidance to the courts by listing factors that the court should consider these include such things as the wishes of the parents the childs wishes how the child interacts with each parent and any other children in the family the health of each person involved the childs adjustment to home school and community which parent primarily has provided care for the child in the past and which parent is more likely to allow the child to have frequent and meaningful contact with the other parent the court also must consider whether there has been domestic violence in the family drug or alcohol use by a parent or other circumstances that may endanger the childs physical mental emotional or moral health the court will presume that an award of custody to a parent who committed an act of domestic violence is contrary to the childs best interests what if the parents want to have joint legal custody if the parents request joint legal custody they also must submit to the court a written plan parenting plan indicating how they will cooperate to raise and care for the child the court may order joint legal custody without ordering joint physical custody the court also may order joint legal custody even if

desiring to move with the child must give 60 days notice to the other parent before the child may be moved more than 100 miles from the other parent or from the state the 60day period gives sufficient time to the nonmoving parent to request a hearing to stop the move what if my job requires an immediate transfer in less than 60 days a parent who is required to relocate in less than 60 days must be a parent with joint physical custody and have the agreement of both parents or a court order allowing the move of the child if agreement cannot be reached in the situation of required relocation in

of parenting time with a newborn child although more frequent shorter visits may be appropriate some counties coconino maricopa mohave pima pinal and yavapai have established guidelines to help parents and the courts decide how much parenting time is important to the child the arizona supreme court has also published model parenting time plans to assist parents in establishing agerelated

depend on the circumstances of each family considering the childs age and development when parenting time is described only as reasonable it is difficult to predict when or for how long parenting time periods should occur when preparing an agreement or parenting plan it is recommended that parents specifically decide when and for how long parenting time periods will be including how to handle and allocate special occasions like vacations school breaks birthdays and holidays so that both parents are considered guidelines available in some counties and the model parenting time plans may be useful to parents in making these decisions the parenting time order should be written specifically enough to enable the court to enforce the order if the order is not followed and one parent files a request for enforcement are parenting time and custody related yes arizona law provides that in most cases a parent not granted custody of the child is entitled to reasonable parenting time rights to

party to supervise or oversee the parenting time periods in some cases the exchange of the child is supervised by a third party to diminish the conflict between the parents to which the child would be exposed without supervised exchanges if the parents cannot agree in connection with any or all of these issues at the beginning of the case one or both parents may file a request with the court for temporary orders temporary orders are shortterm decisions made by the judge which remain in effect until a final court order is entered in the case the preliminary injunction is the first temporary
