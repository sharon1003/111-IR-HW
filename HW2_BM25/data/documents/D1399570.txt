make copies from my originals to submit a copy to a defendant for a civil court case and to receive a copy from my originals to respond to a court order by 10232014 i spoke today with an office depot staff member who identified her self as linda rose and who said her title is “risk manager” she said that she is willing to speak to “whoever” at the court andor to defendant about the mistakes that were made when office depot made copies from my originals that were going to the court and a copy for me and to the defendant on or about 330 pm on 10232014 some adds of a car wash copies were combined with the copies i submitted to the defendant via the u s postal mail and other documents that needed to be copied were not office depot said they are willing to reimburse me for the court cost for the court to make copies from the original documentation that were submitted to the court for me and to the defendant however office depot is not willing to put down in writing what they just told me today they are willing to do sadly they also said to me “you filed it”i can no longer trust office depot quality of business output when they tell the customer “you filed it” meaning we didn’t so basically is not our fault but i believe it is when i informed the person who made the copies i am coming back because you made mistakes on the copies you recently made of the same originals and i need you to be very cautious this time because they are going to the court and i need to go from here to the u s postal service to send the copies you make to the defendant and immediately after i need to take the originals to the court and i have to turned them in by no later than 430 pm today office deport was made aware of previous mistakes made and the fact that the copies made the customer was trusting they would be correct this time and due to time constraints they needed to be copied correctly the statement made by office deport “you file it” and the refusal to accept responsibility in writing tells me a lot about the integrity of the quality of work they advertise to customers i am sadden and i am disappointed about their response you have a nice day additional facts of the events are written below for your convenience these are mrs jernigan’s notes of my conversation with linda from office depot yesterday and today and additional statements made by me or the staff at office depo if you have any questions please feel free to write to me at 471 e kicklighter rd lake helen fl 32744 on 10252017  approximately 232pm plaintiff received a phone call from some identifying themselves as linda roses from office depot phone  5614383694 asking me to call her back on 10252017  approximately 232 pm plaintiff calls back linda hears voice recording linda rose is not available plaintiff leaves a message “calling you back” and leaves a message with name and phone number plaintiff calls again and linda answers and states “i understand there was an issue” i am the risk manager i explained the unintended business error of their department manager on 4232017 and the fact that the same person made the copies for free because she recognized she made mistakes making copies the last time she made copies though i said i was willing to pay i explained i spoke to nicole and i asked nicole if she remembers that mr jones admitted of me being there on 10232014 at approx 330 for the copies to be made and nicole admitted she heard mr jones that yes i head him say that he knows you were there mrs linda stated she will get statements she understands don’t want the court to strike and said to me “i will get back with you tomorrow” i explained i thought i should call the news if necessary if he does not sign but i figure he has a right to do whatever about it i explained also to linda today and nicole on 10242017 that i explained to the dept manager to be cautious in making the original copies they are going to the court and the defendant and i needed a copy too and i also explained to the department manager after the copies are done i was going directly to the post office to mail the defendant a copy and then straight to the court because i needed to turn them in by no later than 430 pm i explained to linda that the dept manager seem to have a problem with one of the printers and often walked to what it appear to be a recycle big trash can i just hoped that she knew what she was doing and the other guy seemed to be confused at times and she went from doing one thing to another so obviously she was multitasking i also said that when i came with the copies on 10232017 i advise mr jones that i had to come back because there was mistakes made when i had them do my copies when i came the last time that i was there and he said see the the dept manager and i explained to him when i looked at who he was referring to that’s the same lady that made the mistake when i came before on 10262017  approximately 952 am i received a call from 5614383694 mrs linda rose left a message october 26 2017 for me to call her back risk manger i spoke to yesterday at approximately 956 i call back voice message states “not available” i leave a voice message saying this is mrs jernigan calling back and left phone number i call back again  approximately  approx 1005 am mrs linda answered the phone and tells me that they “are not going to be able to write a letter and sign it”  she suggested that i explain to the judge what happened i replied i did and you have a copy of what i explained to the court and the statement i needed you all to sign linda said “i am willing to speak to the court or whoever about what happened” and “i am willing to reimburse you for the charges of getting a copy from the originals filed in court” and linda also said “we understand there was a mistake made but we didn’t file it” i replied “i trusted your business” i asked linda if she was willing to put on paper what she just said to me today that she is willing to do but she replied “no” i said you can say whatever today and tomorrow you can change your mind she said give them my name and phone she is willing to reimburse me for the cost to make copies again from the originals i submitted to the court and she is willing to speak to the court to whosoever about what happened she said i am not going anywhere she said you filed it i said i trusted your business to do what’s right i explained if i am not mistaken it is 300 per copy she still agreed to reimburse me the cost i explained the court documents i submitted are not showing yet on the docket and i am not sure how the defendant will react notes were typed on10262017  approximately 1041 am on this sheet reply jim davenport october 18 2017 at 544 pm buy from staples office depot customer service is lousy waited for a filing cabinet and it arrived oct 17th the box was fine on the outside opened up the box in front of the two truckers who delivered it and under an undamaged piece of packing foam the corner was dented we then pulled the cabinet out and the left side had been broken and the two bottom drawers were sprung and couldn’t be opened the truckers took it back i called customer service and they gave me a 30 price adjustment and guaranteed it’d be delivered the 18thtoday by 500 p m i spoke to supervisor crystal who did what she could but she provided no satisfaction this will go up the chain from me to my corporate offices as they have a very large national acct woffice depot my ref11894680 probably means nothing they claim there was a truck problem and it’ll be here tomorrow reply randy fulton october 17 2017 at 1253 pm i will attempt to be brief but this has been one of the most frustrating “customer service” experiences ever purchased a refurbished dell laptop advertised as having a 1 year warranty power cord does not fit snuggly battery does not have adequate charge life i had this exact model through work the battery easily lasted 4 hours this laptop was about 15 – 2 hours max i contacted office depot regarding the warranty i was told to contact dell dell said the laptop did not have a warranty contacted office depot they could not directly answer my question about who was responsible for the warranty asked if i wanted to return it i preferred not to since i already purchased  installed office 2016 from office depot the laptop seemed fine i just needed a power cord  battery i was told they could reimburse me 125 i asked if that would cover the cost reply “i don’t know but that’s what i’m authorized to offer” i stated that they needed to get an accurate quote and if it is more get approval after all the laptop came with a 1 year warranty i only had it a couple weeks he took my number in case we got disconnected while he checked on prices through dell we were disconnected and he never called back meanwhile i called the office depot 800  i email the complaints division i repeated received the run around but each time was told how sorry they were for the inconvenience and i was repeatedly asked about returning the laptop again i prefer to keep the laptop i just want a power cord  battery i spent several weeks going back and forth leaving my cell number and asking for a supervisor to call me never received a call no one could explain the “warranty” i finally said i would return the laptop for a refund but also wanted a refund on office 2016 which was purchased through office depot again i could not get anyone to respond i have literally used office depot for several years our company spends thousands of dollars every year our business will be going to a company that understands customer service i am typically pretty patient and not one to complain but this is ridiculous reply barbara steffens october 10 2017 at 434 pm on oct 6th attempted to purchase a printer the one i wanted was not in stock so i purchased another one with the help of the employee brought it home and found it to be not what i needed took it back and ordered the original was told it would be in on the 9th on the 9th i called and found out it was not going to be the 9th but the 10th and it was not going to the store but to my house i was not going to be home and when i spoke with the salesperson he said oh when i asked for your address it meant it was being shipped to your address i asked him how the heck was i supposed to know that to which he had no reply he insisted i should have know where it would be delivered and just could not understand why the computer read the 9th and the order printed the 10th i had to reschedule the tech to come out and hook it up the attitude was one of “oh well” sorry about that this will be the last transaction i will make with office depot personnel need to communicate with customers as i for one cannot read minds there was never a true apology and that really frosts me reply mohammad saleem september 29 2017 at 1147 pm my credit was charged later office depot cancelled my order but they

i wanted to purchase a 389 chair and needed help she telephoned for a man and a crude rude obnoxious person showed i explained i wanted a certain chair but had to know that the arm rests were removable he kept explaining how they worked and put the box on a dolly and headed for front door i had 2 60 pkg of printer 18 in pens tried to order business cards but no one there needed packaging tape the man had no interest that i needed other items parked the dolly and left me standing i told the cashier i wanted the manager to get help he said the man was the manager i left my nearly 500

reply amy garcia october 17 2016 at 1235 pm i placed an order on 101216 and this was a three delivery order i received order 1 and 3 i talked to your chat room person and they said the order needed verbal verification i told them that i had never had to do that so they suggested that i call customer service i called and they told me that the order would be delivered on 101416 it was not delivered and i call your chat room again again they told me that i would have to talk to your customer service because of the verbal authorization so i called again and they said someone in customer service would call me back they never do but this time they did and asked if i place an order and i said yes they said thank you and that the order would be delivered on monday i finally told them if not delivered by monday 1017 that i would cancel the order and go to staples instead order was not received on 1017 and i called your chat room once again they said i needed verbal authorization and i told them that i gave the authorization on friday he then said that the order can be replaced and it would arrive 101816 i told them just to cancel the order and that i would do business with staples if you check our history you will see that we order lots from office depot and this one order has dissatisfied me so much that i finally placed my order with staples ever since you merged with office max customer service has not been up to par i don’t know if i will order again from you but for right now i will order from staples you are losing alot of customers due to poor customer service and deliveries reply marilyn july 28 2016 at 208 pm since i cannot find a real email for you i am responding here but not expecting to hear anything back…you guys have really gone done hill subject order 852816712001hello…on july 23rd i placed this order when i received this confirmation i noticed the color envelopes came up as ivory rather than white i chatted on line with your customer service and he assured me it was taken care of i specifically asked him 3 times and he guaranteed me it was off when i received the next confirmation it showed that the white was ordered and he still left on the ivory he out right lied to me so i called customer service and once again was reassured that it was taken care of well i received my clips and pens but never received my business cards i looked at my credit card and i had been charged for 2837…1653 and 1653 and 4490 i called customer service again and a women said i never ordered business cards which you can see i did she then refunded me for the one envelopes of 1653 and said i would received my other envelopes yesterday i still have not received my envelopes and am now waiting to see if i even get my business cards since she reordered them yesterday i can tell you i have always shopped with you for years but will probably never deal with you again this has been utterly ridiculous and i am considering contacting the better business bureau especially because of all the discrepancies on my credit card only god knows what your people do they sure do not know what to do and will lie about anything i am assuming to make their job easier or to make you more money this is not the type of customer service or company i want to deal with thought you needed to know order number 852816712001 status in process order date 07232016

s cosby gentlemen i previously was as staples customer unfortunately for me they moved out of my area and to save time and money from driving to their store in boynton beach being a senior citizen on a limited fixed income i started to go to office depot store 91 i purchased a new laptop computer and a new printer there and have done many other purchases in addition to ink paper and other products i get a request for a survey on my receipts every time i purchase an item i feel i am wasting my time as i get a 1000 coupon good on a 5000 purchase every time i respond to the survey but they don’t seem to want to honor them i went to the tore today purchased over 5000 in ink used a 1200 ink recycling coupon along with a 1000 coupon on my last register receipt i gave the cashier one of those coupons for over 5000 they refused to take it because i was using other coupons why should i waste my time filling out your survey if the coupons wont be honored i feel i will have to drive further to staples to get what i need where they take coupons they issue i am glad now that your merger with staples did not go through it is approximately 345 pm wednesday june 29 2016 my phone number is

gets resolved reply tree gallagher may 13 2016 at 122 am my employer died suddenly  had several music items to send to a music teacher in ny due to area i called the merritt island office depot 3214592588 prior to my bringing all in to insure they office depot would be able to box pack  ship as needed i arrived at w items placed in a basket of their provision as the store was basicly empty was a tad surprised by the checkout boys look of horror  disgust as i entered i smiled explained the packingshipping needed  with another look of “no way” w eyebrow raised he threw i hand in gester behind head  replied “over there” i proceeded to where the office depot sign said packing shipping  mail through ups or us postal service i was ignored to the best of the rude ability of the “customer service” man until he was forced to make eye contact w me then producing a scowl of displeasure he said not asked… “you want help w that then proceeded to grill me on the number i called was not his store as he was the only one pu phone  he never would have said that i showed him the number time  connection time on my phone  he still continued his insistence i never called embarrassed as he interacted w several other sneery employees saying rude comments i could her as other patrons  pointing over n over  his watch finally a somewhat non snarky employee reluctantly aproched  looking so confused you might have thought i asked him to play what i needed to send he relayed they were not that “store” said he would be afraid to try  that they had no supplys seriously odd as i was right beside the huge sign both behind stating packing supplys  in front under the services provided we packship so was told to “pack it up  find another place” imagine my surprise when i figured that was what your company sign intended not what i was told i have never been treated so poorly in my experiences here in fl that says so so much shame on your training process  your supervision of staff to allow myself or anyone looking to pay for a service all says you do provide including your staff that pu’s the phone after 4 calls  20 rings disgusting lazy rude inexcusable treatment of customers  harsh visual allowed to other potential customers observing the interaction no excuse ever replyrobert breaks september 18 2015 at 326 pm purchased computer for my son 14yrs on aug 29 and left it at the store to load program purchased salesman said it would be ready in about two days i called back in three days to see if it was ready and was told to check the website to follow the progress they also said they would call when it was ready to pick up after sixteen days of following the progress and waiting for a call i went to the store to get my purchase price back they only gave me the price of the computer and made me pay115 for the “work done” the store manager joe rodriguez said he texted corporate to see if he could refund the 115 but it would take two days before he would find out and then he would call me no call and even going to the store and being told he would call me he has not the absolute poor management of the situation is obvious – there was no contact advising the computer was ready for pick up and the web site showed “in progress” even after i cancelled the order mr rodriguez even told me he had seen the computer sitting in the work room for quite a while but he never followed up on why it was still there i feel that they are stealing this “service performed” money from me and no one with this company cares about the customers mr rodriguez is a poor example of a supervisor and apparently is not going to respond back to me he is not capable of making a decision and corporate should contact me to satisfy my complaint one way or another reply rodney kirkpatrick august 19 2015 at 123 pm on august 82015 i brought my laptop and external hard drive into store 0860 to have virus removed and to transfer all my information to my external hard drive in 24 hours they lost my hard drive with all my private information pictures music and social security numbers to me and my kids today is august 19th and no one has contacted me about this issue they only email me and say that someone from another department will contact me no one ever calls this has been very difficult for me and do not know what to do who to contact my computer is still at the store with no external and no saved data this store does not even have a camera to see who took the hard drive how can a large company do this to a customer and do not try to put the customer back whole again and to top all this off they charge me 18999 for this service which i have not received a refund for now my info is in the hands of a stranger my social is in the hands of a stranger my private pictures is in the hands of a stranger can someone help pleasereply c walther may 2 2015 at 224 pm need to buy a laser printer and i was told by office depot customer service that the store located at college blvd and us 41 in fort myers had most of the laser printers i call then up the store staff confirms this so i drive 20 miles to get there what happens i am in the printer section alone the store is almost empty and all the sales people are bsing together i had to go over and pull one of them out to help me i then start to ask him questions and ask for a demonstration what i find out is that none of the color laser printers is configured so it will print in color exactly why this is is frankly beyond me when i tell the salesman i will not shell out half a grand to buy a color printer without seeing it print color he seems to get mad i get angry at that point and walk out exactly what kind of business plan has you trying to sell products you can’t even demonstrate no wonder you people are losing out to staples you can kiss off your useless sales force your worthless printer displays and your idiotic store policies reply michelle shaw december 3 2014 at 506 pm on thanksgiving night office depot was to open at 600pm for a sale i need to get my daughter a laptop for school and this will be her one christmas present this year so this is the only reason i was out on thanksgiving in the snow and cold my husband and i came to our local store and arrived at 515pm with approx 3540 people in front of us we got in line and office depot employees allowed us to line up inside the evening was going well we waited while several employees walked by stood and talked amongst themselves and offered people the sales flyer that i had gripped in my hand for 45 minutes “opening” time began promptly at 600pm and we walked in an orderly fashion to the laptops found the dell for 17999 sitting on the end cap with the price in front of it i immediately asked the manager standing nearby how to get one and his reply… ready for it “we had 75 vouchers for that and they are all gone” what how can 75 vouchers be gone and i am 40th in line he says that he handed them out at 400pm now if i had arrived at 515pm and there were 200 people in line at office depot then i would not have stood there assuming the deal would be gone by the time i got there the ad said 6pm if i knew line didn’t matter and handouts began prior to the opening i would have been there earlier lastly do you think a sign could be posted…saying they were all sold… do you think that one of the 8 associates walking around talking could have made an announcement that everyone was wasting their time in line i get how lines work and how sales work but this was not right also manager told me about the vouchers at 4pm and then walked away from me… great service please explain the location was4338 fox valley center dr new york square aurora il 60504 6305851383reply mike baskovich november 5 2014
