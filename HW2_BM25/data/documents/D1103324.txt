⇐ previous topic  next topic ⇒standard error of the mean summary standard error of the mean tells you how accurate your estimate of the mean is likely to be introduction when you take a sample of observations from a population and calculate the sample mean you are estimating of the parametric mean or mean of all of the individuals in the population your sample mean wont be exactly equal to the parametric mean that youre trying to estimate and youd like to have an idea of how close your sample mean is likely to be if your sample size is small your estimate of the mean wont be as good as an estimate based on a larger sample size here are 10 random samples from a simulated data set with a true parametric mean of 5 the xs represent the individual observations the red circles are the sample means and the blue line is the parametric mean individual observations xs and means red dots for random samples from a population with a parametric mean of 5 horizontal line as you can see with a sample size of only 3 some of the sample means arent very close to the parametric mean the first sample happened to be three observations that were all greater than 5 so the sample mean is too high the second sample has three observations that were less than 5 so the sample mean is too low with 20 observations per sample the sample means are generally closer to the parametric mean once youve calculated the mean of a sample you should let people know how close your sample mean is likely to be to the parametric mean one way to do this is with the standard error of the mean if you take many random samples from a population the standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of the different sample means about twothirds 683 of the sample means would be within one standard error of the parametric mean 954 would be within two standard errors and almost all 997 would be within three standard errors means of 100 random samples n3 from a population with a parametric mean of 5 horizontal line heres a figure illustrating this i took 100 samples of 3 from a population with a parametric mean of 5 shown by the blue line the standard deviation of the 100 means was 063 of the 100 sample means 70 are between 437 and 563 the parametric mean ±one standard error usually you wont have multiple samples to use in making multiple estimates of the mean fortunately you can estimate the standard error of the mean using the sample size and standard deviation of a single sample of observations the standard error of the mean is estimated by the standard deviation of the observations divided by the square root of the sample size for some reason theres no spreadsheet function for standard error so you can use stdev yssqrt count ys where ys is the range of cells containing your data this figure is the same as the one above only this time ive added error bars indicating ±1 standard error because the estimate of the standard error is based on only three observations it varies a lot from sample to sample means ±1 standard error of 100 random samples  n 3 from a population with a parametric mean of 5 horizontal line with a sample size of 20 each estimate of the standard error is more accurate of the 100 samples in the graph below 68 include the parametric mean within ±1 standard error of the sample mean means ±1 standard error of 100 random samples n20 from a population with a parametric mean of 5 horizontal line as you increase your sample size the standard error of the mean will become smaller with bigger sample sizes the sample mean becomes a more accurate estimate of the parametric mean so the standard error of the mean becomes smaller note that its a function of the square root of the sample size for example to make the standard error half as big youll need four times as many observations standard error of the mean and standard deviation of the mean are equivalent terms people almost always say standard error of the mean to avoid confusion with the standard deviation of observations sometimes standard error is used by itself this almost certainly indicates the standard error of the mean but because there are also statistics for standard error of the variance standard error of the median standard error of a regression coefficient etc you should specify standard error of the mean there is a myth that when two means have standard error bars that dont overlap the means are significantly different at the p 005 level this is not true browne 1979 payton et al 2003 it is easy for two sets of numbers to have standard error bars that dont overlap yet not be significantly different by a twosample t –test dont try to do statistical tests by visually comparing standard error bars just use the correct statistical test similar statistics confidence intervals and standard error of the mean serve the same purpose to express the reliability of an estimate of the mean when you look at scientific papers sometimes the error bars on graphs or the ± number after means in tables represent the standard error of the mean while in other papers they represent 95 confidence intervals i prefer 95 confidence intervals when i see a graph with a bunch of points and error bars representing means and confidence intervals i know that most 95 of the error bars include the parametric means when the error bars are standard errors of the mean only about twothirds of the error bars are expected to include the parametric means i have to mentally double the bars to get the approximate size of the 95 confidence interval in addition for very small sample sizes the 95 confidence interval is larger than twice the standard error and the correction factor is even more difficult to do in your head whichever statistic you decide to use be sure to make it clear what the error bars on your graphs represent i have seen lots of graphs in scientific journals that gave no clue about what the error bars represent which makes them pretty useless you use standard deviation and coefficient of variation to show how much variation there is among individual observations while you use standard error or confidence intervals to show how good your estimate of the mean is the only time you would report standard deviation or coefficient of variation would be if youre actually interested in the amount of variation for example if you grew a bunch of soybean plants with two different kinds of fertilizer your main interest would probably be whether the yield of soybeans was different so youd report the mean yield ± either standard error or confidence intervals if you were going to do artificial selection on the soybeans to breed for better yield you might be interested in which treatment had the greatest variation making it easier to pick the fastestgrowing soybeans so then youd report the standard deviation or coefficient of variation theres no point in reporting both standard error of the mean and standard deviation as long as you report one of them plus the sample size n anyone who needs to can calculate the other one example the standard error of the mean for the blacknose dace data from the central tendency web page is 1070 how to calculate the standard error spreadsheet the descriptive statistics spreadsheet calculates the standard error of the mean for up to 1000 observations using the function stdev yssqrt count ys web pages this web page calculates standard error of the mean and other descriptive statistics for up to 10000 observations this web page calculates standard error of the mean along with other descriptive statistics i dont know the maximum number of observations it can handle rsalvatore mangiaficos r companion has a sample r program for standard error of the mean sasproc univariate will calculate the
