appear we received enough to fill twelve pages…why are we here do we serve a greater purpose beyond the pleasure or satisfaction we get from our daily activities – however mundane or heroic they may be is the meaning of life internal to life to be found inherently in life’s many activities or is it external to be found in a realm somehow outside of life but to which life leads in the internal view it’s the satisfaction and happiness we gain from our actions that justify life this does not necessarily imply a selfish code of conduct the external interpretation commonly makes the claim that there is a realm to which life leads after death our life on earth is evaluated by a supernatural being some call god who will assign to us some reward or punishment after death the meaning of our life its purpose and justification is to fulfill the expectations of god and then to receive our final reward but within the internal view of meaning we can argue that meaning is best found in activities that benefit others the community or the earth as a whole it’s just that the reward for these activities has to be found here in the satisfactions that they afford within this life instead of in some external spirit realm an interesting way to contrast the internal and external views is to imagine walking through a beautiful landscape your purpose in walking may be just to get somewhere else – you may think there’s a better place off in the distance in this case the meaning of your journey through the landscape is external to the experience of the landscape itself on the other hand you may be intensely interested in what the landscape holds it may be a forest or it may contain farms villages you may stop along the way study learn converse with little thought about why you are doing these things other than the pleasure they give you you may stop to help someone who is sick in fact you may stay many years and found a hospital what then is the meaning of your journey is it satisfying or worthwhile only if you have satisfied an external purpose – only if it gets you somewhere else why indeed cannot the satisfactions and pleasures of the landscape and of your deeds be enough greg studen novelty ohio a problem with this question is that it is not clear what sort of answer is being looked for one common rephrasing is “what is it that makes life worth living” there are any number of subjective answers to this question think of all the reasons why you are glad you are alive assuming you are and there is the meaning of your life some have attempted to answer this question in a more objective way that is to have an idea of what constitutes the good life it seems reasonable to say that some ways of living are not conducive to human flourishing however i am not convinced that there is one right way to live to suggest that there is demonstrates not so much arrogance as a lack of imagination another way of rephrasing the question is “what is the purpose of life” again we all have our own subjective purposes but some would like to think there is a higher purpose provided for us perhaps by a creator it is a matter of debate whether this would make life a thing of greater value or turn us into the equivalent of rats in a laboratory experiment gloster’s statement in king lear comes to mind “as flies to wanton boys we are to the gods – they kill us for their sport” but why does there have to be a purpose to life separate from those purposes generated within it the idea that life needs no external justification has been described movingly by richard taylor our efforts may ultimately come to nothing but “the day was sufficient to itself and so was the life”  good and evil 1970 in the “why are we here” sense of the question there is no answer it would be wrong however to conclude that life is meaningless life is meaningful to humans therefore it has meaning rebecca linton leicester when the question is in the singular we search for that which ties all values together in one unity traditionally called ‘the good’ current consideration of the good demands a recognition of the survival crises which confront mankind the threats of nuclear war environmental poisoning and other possible disasters make it necessary for us to get it right for if hannah arendt was correct concerning the ‘banality of evil’ which affected so many nazi converts and contaminated the german population by extension we may agree with her that both western rational philosophy and christian teaching let the side down badly in the 20th century if we then turn away from plato’s philosophy balanced in justice courage moderation and wisdom from jewish justice and christian selfdenial if we recognize kant’s failure to convince populations to keep his three universal principles then shall we look to the moral relativism of the western secular minds which admired nietzsche stalin’s purges of his own constituents in the ussr tainted this relativist approach to the search for the good besides if nothing is absolute but things have value only relative to other things how do we get a consensus on the best or the worst what makes your social mores superior to mine – and why should i not seek to destroy your way we must also reject any hermit monastic sect or other loner criteria for the good life isolation will not lead to any longterm harmony or peace in the global village if with nietzsche we ponder on the need for power in one’s life but turn in the opposite direction from his ‘superman’ ideal we will come to some form of the golden rule ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’ however we must know this as an experiential reality there is lifechanging power in putting oneself in the place of the other person and feeling for and with them we call this feeling empathy persons who concentrate on empathy should develop emotional intelligence when intellectual intelligence does not stand in the way of this kind of personal growth but contributes to it we can call this balance maturity surely the goal or meaning of human life is therefore none other than finding oneself becoming a mature adult free to make one’s own decisions yet wanting everyone in the world to have this same advantage this is goodernie johns owen sound ontario‘meaning’ is a word referring to what we have in mind as ‘signification’ and it relates to intention and purpose ‘life’ is applied to the state of being alive conscious existence mind consciousness words and what they signify are thus the focus for the answer to the question what seems inescapable is that there is no meaning associated with life other than that acquired by our consciousness inherited via genes developed and given content through memes units of culture the meanings we believe life to have are then culturally and individually diverse they may be imposed through hegemony religious or secular benign or malign or identified through deliberate choice where this is available the range is vast and diverse from straightforward to highly complex meaning for one person may entail supporting a football team for another climbing higher and higher mountains for another being a parent for another being moved by music poetry literature dance or painting for another the pursuit of truth through philosophy for another through religious devotions etc but characteristic of all these examples is a consciousness that is positively and constructively absorbed engaged involved fascinated enhanced and fulfilled i would exclude negative and destructive desires for example of a brutal dictator who may find torturing others absorbing and engaging and thus meaningful such cases would be too perverse and morally repugnant to regard as anything other than pathological the meaning of life for individuals may diminish or fade as a consequence of decline or difficult or tragic circumstances here it might sadly be difficult to see any meaning of life at all the meaning is also likely to change from one phase of life to another due to personal development new interests contexts commitments and maturity colin brookes woodhouse eaves leicestershire it is clearly internet shopping franchised fast food and surgicallyenhanced boobs no this is not true i think the only answer is to strip back every layer of the physical world every learnt piece of knowledge almost everything that seems important in our modern lives all that’s left is simply existence life is existence it seems ‘good’ to be part of life but really that’s your lot we should just be thankful that our lifespan is longer than say a spider or your household mog our overevolved human minds want more but unfortunately there is nothing more and if there is some deity or malignant devil then you can be sure they’ve hidden any meaning pretty well and we won’t see it in our mortal lives so enjoy yourself be nice to people if you like but there’s no more meaning than someone with surgicallyenhanced boobs shopping on the net while eating a big mac simon maltman by email to ask ‘what is the meaning of life’ is a poor choice of words and leads to obfuscation rather than clarity why so to phrase the question in this fashion implies that meaning is something that inheres in an object or experience – that it is a quality which is as discernible as the height of a door or the solidity of matter that is not what meaning is like it is not a feature of a particular thing but rather the relationship between a perceiver and a thing a subject and an object and so requires both there is no one meaning of say a poem because meaning is generated by it being read and thought about by a subject as subjects differ so does the meaning different people evaluate ideas and concepts in different ways as can be seen from ethical dilemmas but it would be wrong to say that all these meanings are completely different as there are similarities between individuals not least because we belong to the same species and are constructed and programmed in basically the same way we all have feelings of fear attachment insecurity and passion etc so to speak of ‘the meaning of life’ is an error it would be more correct to refer to the ‘meanings of life’ but as there are currently around six billion humans on earth and new psychological and cultural variations coming into being all the time to list and describe all of these meanings would be a nigh on impossible task to ‘find meaning in life’ is a better way of approaching the issue ie whilst there is no single meaning of life every person can live their life in a way which brings them as much fulfilment and contentment as possible to use utilitarian language the best that one can hope for is a life which contains as great an excess of pleasure over pain as possible or alternatively a life in which as least time as possible is devoted to activities which do not stimulate or which do nothing to promote the goals one has set for oneself steve else swadlincote derbyshire the meaning of life is not being dead tim bale london the question is tricky because of its hidden premise that life has meaning per se a perfectly rational if discomforting position is given by nietzsche that someone in the midst of living is not in a position to discern whether it has meaning or not and since we cannot step outside of the process of living to assess it this is therefore not a question that bears attention however if we choose to ignore the difficulties of evaluating a condition while inside it perhaps one has to ask the prior question what is the meaning of meaning is ‘meaning’ given by the greater cosmos or do we in our freedom construct the category ‘meaning’ and then fill in the contours and colours is meaning always identical with purpose i might decide to dedicate my life to answering this particular question granting myself an autonomously devised purpose but is this identical with the meaning of my life or can i live a meaningless life with purpose or shall meaning be defined by purpose some metaphysics offer exactly this corollary – that in pursuing one’s proper good and thus one’s meaning one is pursuing one’s telos or purpose the point of these two very brief summaries of approaches to the question is to show the hazards in this construction of the question karen zoppa the university of winnipeg one thing one can hardly fail to notice about life is that it is selfperpetuating palaeontology tells us that life has been perpetuating itself for billions of years what is the secret of this stunning success through natural selection life forms adapt to their environment and in the process they acquire one might say they become knowledge about that environment the world in which they live and of which they are part as konrad lorenz put it “life itself is a process of acquiring knowledge” according to this interpretation of evolution the very essence of life its meaning is the pursuit of knowledge knowledge about the real world that is constantly tested against that world what works and is in that sense ‘true’ is perpetuated life is tried and proven knowledge that has withstood the test of geological time from this perspective adopting the pursuit of knowledge as a possible meaning of one’s life seems literally a natural choice the history of science and philosophy is full of examples of people who have done just that and in doing so they have helped human beings to earn the selfgiven title of homo sapiens – man of knowledge axel winter wynnum queensland life is a stage and we are the actors said william shakespeare possibly recognizing that life quite automatically tells a story just as any play tells a story but we are more than just actors we are the playwright too creating new script with our imaginations as we act in the ongoing play life is therefore storytelling so the meaning of life is like the meaning of ‘the play’ in principle not a single play with its plot and underlying values and information but the meaning behind the reason for there being plays with playwright stage actors props audience and theatre the purpose of the play is selfexpression the playwright’s effort to tell a story life a grand play written with mankind’s grand imagination has this same purpose but besides being the playwright you are the audience too the recipient of the playwrights’ messages as playwright actor and audience you are an heir to both growth and selfexpression your potential for acquiring knowledge and applying it creatively is unlimited these two concepts may be housed under one roof liberty liberty is the freedom to think and to create “give me liberty or give me death” said patrick henry for without liberty life has no meaningful purpose but with liberty life is a joy therefore liberty is the meaning of life ronald bacci napa cathe meaning of life is understood according to the beliefs that people adhere to however all human belief systems are accurate or inaccurate to varying degrees in their description of the world moreover belief systems change over time from generation to generation from culture to culture and era to era beliefs that are held today even by large segments of the population did not exist yesterday and may not exist tomorrow belief systems be they religious or secular are therefore arbitrary if the meaning of life is wanted a meaning that will transcend the test of time or the particulars of individual beliefs then an effort to arrive at a truly objective determination must be made so in order to eliminate the arbitrary belief systems must be set aside otherwise the meaning of life could not be determined objectively however life has no meaning because meaning or significance cannot be obtained without reference to some arbitrary belief system absent a subjective belief system to lend significance to life one is left with the ‘stuff’ of life which however offers no testimony as to its meaning without beliefs to draw meaning from life has no meaning but is merely a thing a set of facts that in and of themselves are silent as to what they mean life consists of a series of occurrences in an infinite now divorced of meaning except for what may be ascribed by constructed belief systems without such beliefs for many the meaning of life is nothing surely however life means something and indeed it does when an individual willfully directs hisher consciousness at an aspect of life deriving from it an individual interpretation and then giving this interpretation creative expression thus the meaning in the act of giving creative expression to what may be ephemeral insights stated another way the meaning of life is an individual’s acts of creation what exactly is created be it artistic or scientific may speak to the masses or to nobody and may differ from individual to individual the meaning of life however is not the thing created but the creative act itself namely that of willfully imposing an interpretation onto the stuff of life and projecting a creative expression from it raul casso laredo texas rather than prattle on and then discover that i am merely deciding what ‘meaning’ means i will start out with the assumption that by ‘meaning’ we mean ‘purpose’ and because i fear that ‘purpose’ implies a creator i will say ‘best purpose’ so what is the best purpose for which i can live my life the best purpose for which i can live my life is refusing all the easy ways to destroy this is not as simple as it sounds refusing to destroy life – to murder – wouldn’t just depend on our lack of homicidal impulses but also on our willingness to devote our time to finding out which companies have murdered union uprisers to finding out whether animals are killed out of need or greed or ease to finding the best way to refuse to fund military murder if we find our military to be murdering rather than merely protecting refusing to destroy resources to destroy loves to destroy rights turns out to be a fulltime job oh sure we can get cocky and say “well oughtn’t we destroy injustice or bigotry or hatred” but we would be only fooling ourselves they’re all already negatives to destroy injustice bigotry and hatred is to refuse the destruction of justice understanding and love so it turns out we finally say “yes” to life when we come out with a resounding throatwrecking “no”carrie snider by email i propose that the knowledge we have now accumulated about life discloses quite emphatically that we are entirely a function of certain basic laws as they operate in the probably unique conditions prevailing here on earth the behaviour of the most elementary forms of matter we know subatomic particles seems to be guided by four fundamental forces of which electromagnetism is probably the most significant here in that through the attraction and repulsion of charged particles it allows an almost infinite variation of bonding it allows atoms to form molecules up the chain to the molecules of enormous length and complexity we call as nucleic acids and proteins all these are involved in a constant interaction with surrounding chemicals through constant exchanges of energy from these behaviour patterns we can deduce certain prime drives or purposes of basic matter namely1 combination bonding2 survival of the combination and of any resulting organism3 extension of the organism usually by means of replication4 acquisition of energy since these basic drives motivate everything that we’re made of all the energy molecules and chemistry that form our bodies our brains and nervous systems then whatever we think say and do is a function of the operation of those basic laws therefore everything we think say and do will be directed towards our survival our replication and our demand for energy to fuel these basic drives all our emotions and our rational thinking our loves and hates our art science and engineering are refinements of these basic drives the underlying drive for bonding inspires our need for interaction with other organisms particularly other human beings as we seek ever wider and stronger links conducive to our better survival protection and extension of our organic integrity necessitates our dependence on and interaction with everything on earth our consciousness is also necessarily a function of these basic drives and when the chemistry of our cells can no longer operate due to disease ageing or trauma we lose consciousness and die since i believe we are nothing more than physics and chemistry death terminates our life once and for all there is no god there is no eternal life but optimistically there is the joy of realising that we have the power of nature within us and that by cooperating with our fellow man by nurturing the resources of the world by fighting disease starvation poverty and environmental degradation we can all conspire to improve life and celebrate not only its survival on this planet but also its proliferation so the purpose of life is just that to involve all living things in the common purpose of promoting and enjoying what we are – a wondrous expression of the laws of nature the power of the universe peter f searle topsham devon“what is the meaning of life” is hard to get a solid grip on one possible translation of it is “what does it all mean” one might spend a lifetime trying to answer such a heady question answering it requires providing an account of the ultimate nature of the world our minds value and how all these natures interrelate i’d prefer to offer a rather simplistic answer to a possible interpretation of our question when someone asks “what is the meaning of life” they may mean “what makes life meaningful” this is a question i believe one can get a grip on without developing a systematic philosophy the answer i propose is actually an old one what makes a human life have meaning or significance is not the mere living of a life but reflecting on the living of a life even the most reflective among us get caught up in pursuing ends and goals we want to become fitter we want to read more books we want to make more money these goaloriented pursuits are not meaningful or significant in themselves what makes a life filled with them either significant or insignificant is reflecting on why one pursues those goals this is secondorder reflection reflection on why one lives the way one does but it puts one in a position to say that one’s life has meaning or does not one discovers this meaning or significance by evaluating one’s life and meditating on it by taking a step back from the everyday and thinking about one’s life in a different way if one doesn’t do this then one’s life has no meaning or significance and that isn’t because one has the wrong sorts of goals or ends but rather has failed to take up the right sort of reflective perspective on one’s life this comes close to socrates’ famous saying that the unexamined life is not worth living i would venture to say that the unexamined life has no meaning casey woodling gainesville flfor the sake of argument let’s restrict the scope of the discussion to the human species and narrow down the choices to1 there is no meaning of life we simply exist2 to search for the meaning of life and3 to share an intimate connection with humankind the notion of love humans are animals with an instinct for survival at a basic level this survival requires food drink rest and procreation in this way the meaning of life could be to continue the process of evolution this is manifested in the modern world as the daily grind humans also have the opportunity and responsibility of consciousness with our intellect comes curiosity combined with the means to understand complex problems most humans have at some point contemplated the meaning of life some make it a life’s work to explore this topic for them and those like them the question may be the answer humans are a social species we typically seek out the opposite sex to procreate besides the biological urge or desire there is an interest in understanding others we might simply gain pleasure in connecting with someone in an intimate way whatever the specific motivation there is something that we crave and that is to love and be loved the meaning of life may never be definitively known the meaning of life may be different for each individual andor each species the truth of the meaning of life is likely in the eye of the beholder there were three choices given at the beginning of this essay and for me the answer is all of the above jason hucsek san antonio txnext question of the month the next question is what is the nature of reality answers
