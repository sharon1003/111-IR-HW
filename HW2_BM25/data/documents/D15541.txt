what happens if you dont put enough eggs in cake mixby fred decker oct 03 2017very early professional cooks and bakers learn to make a ritual of setting out all their ingredients before starting a recipe that way they never get halfway through a recipe and find out that theyre missing a vital ingredient its a good habit to get into even if you only bake from boxed cake mixes video of the day error loading player flash plugin failed to load how cake mixes work the ingredients in a cake mix can be divided into two categories the first is ingredients necessary to make a cake the second is the various additives needed to keep the ingredients fresh and to ensure that the cake has the desired light soft crumb the first group includes normal everyday ingredients like flour sugar and baking powder the second consists of anticlumping ingredients to keep the mixture powdery antioxidants to keep them from going stale and emulsifiers to help the ingredients mix properly the baker adds oil water and eggs to complete the cake what eggs do the eggs added to a cake mix serve a number of functions the proteins in the egg provide some of the structure that holds the cake together while the fats in the yolk make it richer and bettertasting the fats in the yolk also help soften the texture of the cake keeping it from becoming chewy the yolk also contains emulsifiers that help the other ingredients blend together cake mix with reduced eggs a cake mix can be prepared without eggs more easily than a scratchmade cake it already contains some fat in dried form and youll add more when you mix it the egg yolks emulsifiers arent necessary because the cake mix already includes other emulsifiers such as lecithin the cake might be dryer and chewier than usual but you can compensate for that by adding more oil in short if you have fewer than the three eggs a normal boxed mix calls for you can use what eggs you have and add enough extra water and oil to make up the difference cake mix without eggs if you wish you can also make a boxed cake mix entirely without eggs you can compensate for the loss of flavor by using milk instead of water but its not usually necessary you can make an acceptable cake just by pouring a standard 12 ounces soda into the mix another alternative is to add sour cream or yogurt in place of the eggs for a healthier version use a can of pumpkin puree with the cake mix applesauce or other pureed fruit will work too making a moist and nutritious cake lose weight feel greatchange your life with my plate by live strong  comgoalgender ageweight heightget my calorie goalyou might also likewhat kind of oil is best for baking a cake how to flavor cakes how to make lemon cake mix ahead how to make a box carrot cake extra moist what happens if i dont put baking powder in a pound cake what can i use instead of eggs for baking a cake how to prevent baking a dry cake how to bake a really moist boxed cake what can i use in place of vegetable oil for cake mix can you substitute water for milk when baking a cake what is the difference between mixing  beating in baking how to replace eggs with bananas in cake mix what happens if you do not put baking soda in a cake how to make boxed cake mix fluffier and lighter how to bake a cake with soda how to prevent an air bubble when mixing how to cook prepared crab cakes how to keep homemade bread from crumbling how to keep chiffon cake from shrinking how to make a cake soft and moist without the cake falling apart
