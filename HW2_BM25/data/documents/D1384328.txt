solved expensive routers worth it ninjamilez apr 27 2015 133 amso sometimes youre given a free internet router by your isp when you sign up for one of their tariffs or have been with them for a while for example bt sent me a home hub 5 when i signed up for fibre optic internet last year would i see any difference in wired andor wireless performance in terms of connection stability or even throughput and speed if i bought a better router i understand the difference between wireless standards such as a bgn ac etc the home hub 5 is already wireless ac capable4 answers last reply apr 29 2015 best answer apr 29 2015more about expensive routers worth rayven2 apr 27 2015 325 amhey its pretty hard to say however if you plan on just browsing the internet and being a regular user i wouldnt worry too much about it in saying that some routers can have additional features settings configuration options and additional security as for speed tho if your current router supports up to lets say 100 megabits persec and your speeds are below that youll be fine so i doubt your isp will give you a bottlenecked router another issue is sometimes the isp companies can become real bitchy for lack of a better term about what kind of router you use so you have to deal with that as well hope that helps ninjamilez apr 27 2015 439 amrayven2 said hey its pretty hard to say however if you plan on just

and streaming media are my main uses i was thinking that a better router would probably provide better latency for gaming more than anything if any improvement could be seen itd probably only improve by a couple of ms at most i reckon ill just stick with the hh5 for now then what youre saying about additional features security etc matches with what ive been reading elsewhere related resources is it worth buying expensive 100 modemrouter what is the advantage does buying the expensive gtx 1060 worth it is it worth to buy the more expensive version of a specific card is it worth it to get a

the assumptions above are not entirely true if latency is important then looking at a routers ability to handle multiple tasks at the same time becomes very important also if the router is sharing its cpu among routing wireless functions and other things that puts further strain on it and affects performance namely latency this is why you are seeing dual core 1ghz and better processors in the latest crop higher end of routers units like the netgear nighthawk series use 1ghz dual core or better plus they also have in some models additional cpus that power the radios to remove the burden of the main cpu and handling these tasks too netgear r7500 r8000 so there is more to this then you would think bob silver netgear networking advisor ninjamilez apr 29 2015 1133 ambobsilver said well the
