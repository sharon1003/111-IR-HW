but can reach 15 m the leaves are deciduous rounded 6–12 cm long and across softly hairy on both surfaces and with a doubleserrate margin the flowers are produced very early in spring before the leaves and are monoecious with singlesex windpollinated catkins male catkins are pale yellow and 5–12 cm long while female catkins are very small and largely concealed in the buds with only the bright red 1–3 mm long styles visible the fruit is a nut produced in clusters of one to five together each nut held in a short leafy involucre husk which encloses about three quarters of the nut the nut is roughly spherical to oval 15–20 mm long and 12–20 mm broad larger up to 25 mm long in some cultivated selections yellowbrown with a pale scar at the base the nut falls out of the involucre when ripe about 7–8 months after pollination 1 3 4it is readily distinguished from the closely related filbert  corylus maxima by the short involucre in the filbert the nut is fully enclosed by a beaklike involucre longer than the nut 1taxonomy  editthe scientific name avellana derives from the town of avella in italy 5 and was selected by linnaeus from leonhart fuchs s de historia stirpium commentarii insignes 1542 where the species was described as  avellana nux sylvestris  wild nut of avella 6 that name was taken in turn from pliny the elders first century a d encyclopedia naturalis historia 7ecology  editthe leaves provide food for many animals including lepidoptera such as the casebearer moth coleophora anatipennella caterpillars of the concealer moth alabonia geoffrella have been found feeding inside dead common hazel twigs see also list of lepidoptera that feed on hazels the fruit are possibly even more important animal food both for invertebrates adapted to circumvent the shell usually by ovipositing in the female flowers which also gives protection to the offspring and for vertebrates which manage to crack them open such as squirrels and corvids  both are considered pests

it is roughly spherical to oval in shape about 15–25 mm long and 10–15 mm in diameter with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell the nut falls out of the husk when ripe about seven to eight months after pollination hazelnuts are rich  dubious – discuss in protein and unsaturated fat moreover they contain significant amounts of manganese copper vitamin e thiamine and magnesium 9there are many cultivars of the hazel including barcelona butler casina clark cosford daviana delle langhe england ennis fillbert halls giant jemtegaard kent cob lewis tokolyi tonda gentile tonda di giffoni tonda romana wanliss pride and willamette 10 some of these are grown for specific qualities of the nut including large nut size and early and late fruiting cultivars whereas other are grown as pollinators the majority of commercial hazelnuts are propagated from root sprouts 10 some cultivars are of hybrid origin between common hazel and filbert 4common hazel is cultivated for its nuts in commercial orchards in europe turkey iran and caucasus the name hazelnut applies to the nuts of any of the species of the genus corylus this hazelnut or cobnut the kernel of the seed is edible and used raw or roasted or ground into a paste the seed has a thin dark brown skin which has a bitter flavour and is sometimes removed before cooking the top producer of hazelnuts by a large margin is turkey specifically the giresun province turkish hazelnut production of 625000 tonnes accounts for approximately 75 of worldwide production 11references  edittrees portal a b c d rushforth k 1999
