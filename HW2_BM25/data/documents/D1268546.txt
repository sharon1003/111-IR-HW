back to dr hues homepage acid soils in hawaii problems and management n v hue and h ikawa department of agronomy and soil science college of tropical agriculture and human resources university of hawaii at manoa introduction acid soils by definition are those with p h below 70 the lower the p h the more acid is the soil each unit p h drop indicates ten times more acidity for example p h 50 has 10 times more acidity than p h 60 and 100 times more acidity than p h 70 most hawaii soils have p h ranging from 40 to 80 and many have p h below 60 table 1 lists p h of some common items for comparison table 1 p h of some common items item p h  most acid soils 4060 lemon juice 2224 orange juice 3440 vinegar 4045 acid rain 3050 clean rain water 5557 fresh milk 6366 blood plasma 7072 mild soap solution 85100 how soils become acid in hawaii many soils have become acid because of warm temperatures and high rain fall under such environmental conditions soils weather quickly basic cations eg ca mg k which are essential to living organisms are leached from the soil profile leaving behind more stable materials rich in fe and al oxides this natural weathering process makes soils acid and generally devoid of nutrients soil acidification by weathering manmade processes also contribute significantly to soil acidity applications of nh4 producing fertilizers eg urea anhydrous nh3 nh42so4 acidify soils through a biological reaction by which nh4 is oxidized to no3 and h sulfur dioxide so2 and nitrogen oxides nox released primarily by industrial activities react with water to form acid rain which acidifies soils particularly forest soils with low buffering capacities why acid soils are infertile acid soils have many problems that adversely affect crop growth most important among these are aluminum toxicity aluminum is more soluble under acidic conditions and high al levels are toxic to plants aluminum toxicity usually damages the root system first aluminumaffected roots tend to be shortened and swollen having a stubby appearance manganese toxicity unlike al mn toxicity first shows up in plant tops the symptoms vary among plant species but often are specific for a given species for example stunted crinkled and chlorotic leaves are the mn toxicity symptoms in soybeans calcium deficiency unlike acid soils of the us mainland acid soils in hawaii are often cadeficient rather than altoxic this problem is particularly severe in kauai the oldest island in the state since ca is fairly immobile inside the plant its deficiency symptoms first appear at the growing points in corn and taro cadeficient plants are stunted young leaves are unable to fully unfurl then the leaf tips or margins soon die ca deficiency in bunlong taro courtesy of ms m calisayphosphorus deficiency phosphorus can react strongly with fe and al components of acid tropical soils thereby becoming unavailable for plant uptake older leaves in pdeficient plants are often purple because of the accumulation of anthocyanins purple pigments managing acid soils liming although planting acidtolerant crops is a reasonable option for dealing with acid soils liming is traditionally used to correct soil acidity and to improve soil productivity when lime ie ca co3 is added to a moist soil the following reactions will occur 1 lime is dissolved slowly by moisture in the soil to produce ca2 and oh ca co3  h2o in soil  ca2  2oh  co2 gas 2 newly produced ca2 will exchange with al3 and h on the surface of acid soils 2ca2  soilal  soilca  al3  soilh soilca  h 3 limeproduced oh will react with al3 to form al oh3 solid and with h to form water al3  3oh  al oh3 solid h  oh  h2othus liming eliminates toxic al3 and h through the reactions with oh excess oh from lime will raise the soil p h which is the most recognizable effect of liming another added benefit of liming is the supply of ca2 and mg2 if dolomite camg co32 is used because soils differ widely in mineralogy organic matter and clay content they require different amounts of lime to raise soil p h to a given value thus lime requirement curves should be constructed for individual soils to be used in lime estimation figure 1 shows an example of such curves figure 1 lime requirement curves of the halii soil kauai and the paaloa soil oahu planting acidtolerant crops different plant species even varieties within a species grow best at different p h ranges for example azalea and camelia grow well only at p h below 55 and appear to sufferfrom fe andor mn deficiencies at higher p h also pineapple can tolerate soil acidity much better than sugarcane table 2 lists soil p h ranges for optimum growth of selected crops table 2 soil p h range for optimum growth of some crops crop p h  alfalfa 6575 avocado 6065 azalea 4550 camelia 4555 ginger 6070 macadamia 5065 pineapple 4757 sugarcane 6070 taro 5565 conclusions acid soils are widespread in hawaii as well as around the world their occurrences are caused by natural processes weathering andor manmade processes adding nh4 producing fertilizers to soils releasing acid forming gases to the atmosphere acid soils are infertile because of i al andor mn toxicities and ii ca andor p deficiencies acid soils can be managed by liming based on appropriate lime requirement curves or by growing acidtolerant crops back to dr hues homepage
