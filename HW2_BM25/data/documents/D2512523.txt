what is the difference between marginal revenue and marginal benefits its all about supply and demand marginal revenue and marginal benefits can help companies determine how much of a product to produce in order to maximize profits marginal benefit is a measure of a consumers benefit of purchasing an additional unit of a good or service while marginal revenue is a measure of how much money a company earns by producing a unit of a good or service marginal benefit marginal benefit measures the incremental increase in benefit to a consumer achieved by consuming one additional unit of a good or service another way to think of marginal benefit is the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay in order to consume that additional unit in a typical situation marginal benefit will decline as the consumption of a good or service increases lets say a consumer wishes to purchase an additional pair of shoes if that consumer is willing to pay 50 for that additional pair then the marginal benefit of that purchase is 50 however the more pairs of shoes that consumer has the less he or she will want to pay for the next one this is because the benefit of owning an extra pair of shoes decreases as the consumer accumulates more and more shoes marginal revenue marginal revenue is the increase in revenue generated from selling one additional unit of a good or service marginal revenue is calculated by dividing the change in total revenue by the change in quantity sold the change in total revenue is calculated by subtracting the revenue before the last unit was sold from the total revenue after the last unit was sold lets say a company manufactures space heaters and brings in 20 in revenue by producing its first heater in this case its marginal revenue would be 20 20 in revenue1 unit now lets say that company produces a second heater and brings in 15 in revenue the marginal revenue gained by producing that additional unit is 15 3520  15 change in revenue1 additional unit while marginal revenue can remain steady over a certain level of output it tends to diminish as a company produces more units of a given product companies can maximize their profits by making sure that the cost of producing an additional unit does not exceed the additional revenue gained by selling that unit marginal revenue and monopolies in a competitive market marginal revenue may not be all that remarkable in a monopoly on the other hand the marginal revenue a company gains from selling an additional unit will always be less than the price that unit is sold for in a monopoly one company is able to control overall production for a given product however to sell an additional unit the company that has the monopoly must decrease the price for all units sold and thus lose out on revenue lets say theres a single company that produces flying cars and sells them for 500000 apiece and that this company sells one car in its first week of operation and brings in 500000 in revenue in this case its marginal revenue would be 500000 500000 in revenue1 unit now lets say that same company reduces the price of the flying car to 400000 to sell more units and is able to sell one more unit immediately the marginal revenue for the additional unit is 400000 900000500000  400000 change in revenue1 additional unit if the 400000 price point compels more consumers to purchase flying cars as the company sells more units for 400000 its marginal revenue will decrease from when it sold its first flying car this article is part of the motley fools knowledge center which was created based on the collected wisdom of a fantastic community of investors wed love to hear your questions thoughts and opinions on the knowledge center in general or this page in particular your input will help us help the world invest better email us at knowledgecenterfoolcom thanks  and fool ontry any of our foolish newsletter services free for 30 days we fools may not all hold the same opinions but we all believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors the motley fool has a disclosure policy how to invest in stocks why should i invest how do i invest get started investing what should i invest in whens the right time to invest investing tools compare stock brokers compare ira accounts financial calculators compare brokers
