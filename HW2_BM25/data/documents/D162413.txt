information history diet purchasing a canary breeds color feeding vermin and disease prevention hybrids and mules housing molt color and genetics breeding historydo canaries come from the canary islands are the islands named after the birds or the other way around yes we first meet up with the canary bird in the canary islands off the coast of africa in a line with spain the birds are named after the islands not the other way around curiously the romans named them the dog islands for the inhabitants bred an extremely large type of dog as might be expected the ever pragmatic romans were more interested in fierce guard dogs than in little singing birds canary is a corruption of canis latin for dog what does the wild canary look like the wild canary is very similar in appearance to the common green canary  rather like a starved runt english house sparrow one might venture to say that natures original version of the canary did not seem to offer much in the way of a very auspicious startbreedsare there pure breeds of canaries like in other domestic animals do only certain kinds sing by the early sixteenth century canaries were prized as pets in the european world over a span of five hundred years through selective breeding many distinct varieties of canaries have been developed though all adult male canaries sing some were bred purely for vocal ability of which the roller canary is the best example the looks of a roller are given very little consideration most of these feathered carusos could easily be mistaken for one of the wild birds rollers sing with a closed beak common singers perform with an open beak and are called choppers american singers are a special breed produced from a cross of roller and border canaries and are very popular in the united states these birds maintain both rolled and chopped notes in their musical repertoire judges also score them on the basis of physical conformation all canaries but particularly american singers and rollers are capable to a degree of mimicry it is possible to teach them simple musical scores instrument tones wild bird calls and even a word or two of human speech dont think that any canary is going to give an african gray or a mynah bird any sort of competitionas a digression up until the industrial revolution and the advent of loud machinery it was common for craftsmen to keep canaries in their shops for entertainment the canary in the coal mine was an extension of this practice of work place bird keeping the canary would die from gas fumes alerting the men to the danger the people of great britain delighted in experimenting with the possibilities inherent in the size and form of the canary the results were the norwich the yorkshire the gloster and the border the norwich and yorkshire are two of the giants of the canary kingdom either might be twice the size of a common canary the norwich concentrates on bulk with a broad head and chest the yorkshire expresses height being a tall thin bird the gloster is a miniature canary breed with the broad head and chest of the norwich but only threequarters of the size of the more usual canaries the gloster is best know for its cap or crest corona of feathers on the head rather reminiscent of the old beatles hairdo the border first kept along the border of england and scotland possesses refined and pleasing proportions the french and italians took special delight in birds of position and in frilled breeds both among the most strange and striking examples of the breeders art birds of position like the belgian hunchback show what looks like a curvature of the spine the birds posture is that of an inverted half moon the scotch fancy canary and the scantily feathered italian gibber italicus are other examples of this category the feathers of the frilled canaries are long and twisted the first impression that one gets is that a feather duster has sprung to life the parisian frill is one of the larger varieties the combination of size and bushy feathers produces an illusion of a bird the size of a dove canary breeds have been developed in the united states every fair sized town of italy can be counted on to have its own breed of canary these will nearly all be derived from combinations of the breeds described above or will be refined versions of them what is a type canary any variety of canary that is raised for novel appearance as opposed to song or color is called a type canary hybrids and muleswhat are hybrids and mules in europe it is very popular to cross canaries with other finches the goldfinch the european siskin and the european green finch are most often used the overwhelming majority of these crosses are infertile hence the term mule mules are produced for their singing ability and are also exhibited at shows have any of these crosses been used in the development of the modern canary it is possible over the last half a millennium that some fertile crosses were achieved and subsequently bred back to canary stock this means that the domestic canary is not identical as a species to the wild canary what is the venezuelan redhooded siskin the most important hybrid is the venezuelan red siskin spinus cuculatus male crossed with the canary serinus canarius canarius hen this breeding scheme produces some fertile males in the first generation these hybrids are the foundation for the red factor canary the venezuelan red siskin is an endangered species now with the red factor well established the production of further red siskin x canary hybrids is a somewhat questionable practice color and geneticsall canary colors are based upon genes that control the melanin and the lipochrome the melanin is the black in the original wild canary the lipochrome is the ground color yellow in the original bird the combination of black and yellow gives the appearance of a green bird the gene that removes melanin is partially dominant one factor gives a variegated a patchwork mix of light and dark colors bird two a clear canary a clear canary only shows the ground lipochrome color the lipochrome colors are dominant white recessive white yellow and red there are a large number of factors that affect the melanin color the lizard one of the original british breeds is actually based upon a gene that restricts the deposition of melanin in the plumage the result is a scale pattern giving rise to the lizard name what is hard and soft feather what are feather lumps there are two categories of feather quality hard and soft hard feathered birds have tight plumage and bright colors soft feathered canaries have downier plumage and the colors are subdued in general a soft feathered bird should always be mated to a hard feathered bird if soft feathered birds are bred together for a number of generations feather lumps will begin to appear feather lumps are unsightly masses of ingrown feathers the gloster canary the best examples of which are all soft feathered is especially prone to this malady of genetic origin what are lethal traits the corona cap and the dominant white are two lethal traits incomplete dominant lethal genes cant exist in a homozygous state as both members of a chromosome pair lethal factors cause the death of the individual crossing two dominant whites or two crests gives an expectation of 25 fertile eggs failing to hatch always breed a capped bird to a normal consort canary always pair a dominant white to a yellow ground bird keep in mind that a blue canary is a combination of melanin and white lipochrome if the white is the dominant white two blues can not be crossed dominant white can be told from recessive white by visual examination a dominant white canary will always show some trace of yellow in the flight feathers the recessive white is pure white hard feather is often listed as a lethal trait in any event its not a good idea to mate hard feathered birds together can any color bird be shown for exhibition type birds can be any color the clears tend to win with glosters mostly clear variegated birds with dark caps make for very striking specimens for the colorbred birds the melanins and the lipochromes are shown in different classes which are further broken down into hard and soft feather clear birds are always more popular as pets since most people consider these light colored canaries more attractive dietwhat is the basic canary diet the white bread of canary nutrition is a seed mix consisting of 70 canary seed and 30 rape this is often called black and white what fresh foods are required every day the birds must get a high protein food most breeders use chopped hardboiled chicken egg a special nestling food or a mixture of the two during the breeding and moulting seasons the canaries should get as much of this as they will eat at other times a halfteaspoon per bird a treat cup full per bird per day will do the hardboiled egg spoils quickly care must be taken in warm weather any fruit vegetable or green that is used for human consumption with the exception of avocado can be offered to canaries canned corn is an especially loved and nutritious item what is soaked seed are sprouts the same thing dry cracked corn wheat safflower oil sunflower and buckwheat can be put in jar with water in the refrigerator and allowed to soak overnight this softens the hull and breaks complex carbohydrates into sugars this soaked seed is very valuable when the birds are feeding their nestlings mung beans and many other seeds can be fed as sprouts soak the seed in water for 24 hours drain completely and then rinse in a strainer under running cold tap water rinse in the strainer every day until the seed sprouts if any mold develops discard the batch and drain it better next time the container that the sprouting seed is in must have some air flow a paper towel held in place by a rubber band works great what other items should be fed small pieces of whole wheat bread or corn bread are greatly relished by canaries canaries should always have cuttlebone and mineral grit how do you give canaries vitamins vitamins can be mixed with the water follow the directions precisely always change at the water at least once a day cods liver oil and wheat germ oil can be mixed with the seed to fortify it with vitamins a d and e one teaspoon of each is mixed with ten pounds of seed dont use any more than that if you have only a few birds make smaller batches for the treated seed quickly becomes rancid in warm weather some of the major seed companies produce good brands of vitamin fortified seed there are a lot of hucksters selling colored bird seed the colors are nothing but food coloring some mix a vitamin powder with the seed this all gets lost when the birds hull the seed do canaries need pellets a variety of pellets and other processed foods are now sold for canaries if you wish to try these new dietary items out on your birds go right ahead i suggest that pellets be only one facet of canary nutrition pellets can serve as a dietary supplement always offer a variety of foods to your birds if your flock refuses to consume the pellets this is not a cause for alarmshould bird food be kept in the refrigerator the refrigerator is a good place to store bird feed use a zip lock bag or a tupperware style container to keep out moisture in the cooler all bird food even pellets and vitamin enriched seeds will last a long time i notice grubs and moths in the seed is this dangerous cold storage also prevents the development of feed moths the moths and larvae are themselves harmless dont worry about a few of these insects in the seed or bird room under warm conditions the moths will quickly spread if large numbers are present discard the feed are fountain feeders a good idea deep dishes should be used for canaries the fountain style dispensers are useless for the birds will constantly spill all the seed out wasting it what other seeds do canaries eat many seeds can be fed to canaries thistle oat groats shelled sunflower and hemp are great favorites these oily seeds must be rationed as they are very fattening wild seeds can be gathered and fed to canaries the green ripe milky seeds are very nutritious wild thistle and sunflowers with small seeds are canary favorites if you find a source of budding hemp in the great outdoors best to keep quiet about itbe sure that the wild plants are not contaminated with toxic or noxious substances and are not naturally poisonous how often do canaries require food and water keep seed and water before the canaries at all times small birds can starve to death or dehydrate in very few hours color feedingwhat is color feeding any canary can develop a shade of orange by adding paprika cayenne or red pepper to its food the norwich yorkshire and lizard are color fed for shows the red factor canary requires a carotenoid concentrate to exploit its full color potential the best formula is a mix of half pure canthaxanthin and half pure betacarotene both chemicals are manufactured by hoffmanla roche mix one teaspoon of the blend with one gallon of water it helps to start off with a little hot but not boiling water this makes it easier to dissolve the powder keep the unused portion in the fridge it lasts a week the birds portion must be changed daily hoffmanla roche does not sell to individuals but a club could arrange for a pharmacist to order the chemicals store the dry powders in a dry cool dark location flim flammers sell diluted products at exorbitant prices dont get ripped off this caveat especially applies to imported products in fancy packaging if you expect to show your birds carefully check the rules governing color feeding exhibition glosters can never be color fed some breed organizations and clubs only allow the use of plant substances in the natural form these venues prohibit the entry of canaries that have been fed concentrates housingwhat kind of cage is good for a pet canary if you are keeping a canary as a pet for its singing ability just buy any cage that you like it must be constructed of metal and at least 18 long and 10 high and 10 wide canaries exercise by flying back and forth not up and down bamboo cages are very attractive and economical are they a good idea dont use a bamboo or wicker cage impossible to clean these enclosures are not sa nitary what should be kept in mind if a number of canaries are being kept if you have a number of cages dont bother with shelves put two or three screws into the wall and hang the cage from the screws a shelf is just another thing to cleanno birds like to be out in the open with a solid wall behind them birds dont have to worry about a predator sneaking up on them if you must put a column of cages in the center of a room cover the backs with sheet metal this will preserve a feeling of security canaries are not social birds one bird kept as a pet will be perfectly happy two males will always fight as will a male and female except during the nesting season for breeding its best to buy all metal breeding cages for economy cages can be constructed from « x « wire mesh or preferably « x 1 welded wire the wooden breeding cages with wire fronts are obsolete and a waste of time and money wood can never be really sterilized these old fashioned units need to be scraped scrubbed and repainted every year flight cages are not needed canaries do much better and get much more exercise with just one bird to the cage what material is best for perches the best perches are made of halfinch by halfinch square baluster board available at any good lumberyard if you must use round dowel stick scrape it with a hack saw blade to make the surface rough the smooth polished surface is very exhausting for the birds make sure that the perch is clean at least once a month either replace the perch or clean it with hot water bleach and pine oil make sure that it is dry before you put it back in the cage the sandpaper that fits over the perch is not a good idea most dont fit properly and constantly slip putting the bird off balance standing in sand paper cant be very comfortable what is the possible range for temperature and humidity a year round temperature of 75 degrees fahrenheit and low humidity is best canaries properly acclimated can withstand temperatures of just above freezing to nearly 100 fahrenheit these extremes dont do them any good and should be avoided only subject your birds to such heat or cold if those are the conditions under which you live yourself during a heat wave if air conditioning is not available mist the birds often with cool tap water never use a strong fan around any bird the ensuing drafts can lead to sickness and death even in warm weather how does a canary take a bath canaries like to take baths the bird will splash around a dish of clean water in the cage  you dont restrain the bird and try to scrub it like you would a doghow is the cage kept clean plain newspaper is fine on the cage bottom never use cat litter canaries will eat it and die corn cob bedding must be changed every day damp corn cob quickly becomes moldy the cageliner paper sold in pet shops is fine but most breeders use newspaper as often as possible disinfect the cage gently take the bird out and place it in a temporary cage then scrub the original cage with hot water and a disinfectant my neighbor says that birds should be let out to fly around the house for exercise is this so the cage is your birds home to them the cage is not a prison but a safeguard from a terrible world letting your bird out for some exercise is like throwing people off of a cruise ship for a little swim  sure to be a terrifying experience does a hectic schedule bother canaries canaries need a regular schedule they must wake up and go to sleep with the sun keep the cage in a room that is quiet when it is dark out its a good idea to cover the cage at night with a heavy cloth loud noises and bright lights can startle and disturb canaries this is certainly a cruel form of stress and can instantly cause the birds death breedingwhat is the breeding season how is light involved without the use of artificial lights in the northern hemisphere canaries start to breed around april the male and female should be kept in separate cages by late february the hens will be frantically tearing up paper and the cocks will be singing in a vigorous manner wait a week before you put them together for the male develops the urge to breed before sperm production is peaking if the hen is not trying to build a nest she will not matemany breeders setup fullspectrum fluorescent lights in order to keep their birds in a basement or other poorly lit area using a timer it is possible to increase the length of daylight during the normally dark hours of november and december the market for pet canaries is in the spring right around easter by breeding early the commercial operation supplies its markets most efficiently it is not a good idea for the hobby breeder particularly the novice the fall and winter months are the busiest times for most peoples work and social schedule taking care of a canary breeding colony can be an oppressive burden during the winter holiday season a clever use of electric lights is to start the birds day earlier or later than the sun normally allows this gives the working hobbyist the opportunity to care for the canaries either before or after work hours how does a canary build a nest buy a plastic canary nest the wire nests are useless for the birds get their nails caught in them this can result in a lost leg and other tragedies fine dry grass makes the best nest material but shredded paper or burlap is ok dont use the fine threads sold as nesting material this garbage wraps itself about the birds toes and legs cutting off the circulation if not discovered quickly gangrene will set in resulting in the loss of the limbs and digits if not death how should the male and female canaries be introduced i s it normal for the male to beat the hen when the birds are in condition place the male and females cages along side each other the male should immediately start to sing and the hen should reflexively squat if this is observed the birds can be placed together right away if not wait until you see the birds kissing through the cage bars dont allow the male to beat the hen this is not a natural or required step despite what a few morons have writtenonce mating has been observed the cock can be removed and placed with another hen to repeat the process canaries are naturally polygamous out of thousands of canary nests ive only observed one case of a monogamous pairing there is no reason not to leave the male and female together though the hen alone incubates the eggs the cock will help with the feeding of the nestlings how many eggs are produced how long does it take for the eggs to hatch do the eggs require any sort of special handling the average number of eggs is five though any number from one to ten is not unusual ive observed clutches of eight where all eggs hatched the eggs hatch about fourteen days after the hen starts to sit some hens start to incubate right after laying the first egg others will wait until the entire clutch is produced some breeders remove the eggs and replace them with plastic eggs the real eggs are stored in rolled oats corn meal or sawdust at about 65 degrees fahrenheit the actual eggs have to be turned every day to prevent the contents from settling when five eggs are collected they will be returned to the nest the idea of this procedure is for all the eggs to hatch on the same day and thus prevent the youngest from being a runt ive never bothered with this and dont know anybody that actually does though all the books write about it the procedure is more trouble than its worth more young will be lost from improperly handled or broken eggs than by the hens inability to handle a range of sizes of young can the hen become ill from producing eggs what should be done if it happens can it be prevented if you expect the hen to lay an egg and you see her on the bottom of the cage in obvious distress or exhaustion she probably has egg binding the bird will die within a few hours without help the best course of action is to seek a veterinarians help ive gently felt the outside of the afflicted hens abdomen and been able to propel the lodged egg through the vent but i have no medical training so can not tell you to do the same thing do not hold the hen over a pot of boiling water do not attempt an olive oil enema ive seen both of these idiocies offered as serious advice in published works egg binding can be caused by a lack of calcium so be sure that a mineral grit and cuttlebone is available at all times vitamins are needed for calcium to be used so be sure that all aspects of nutrition are correct should the hen be given a bath when sitting on eggs as long as it is not cold let the hen bathe every day while incubating this will aid in the embryos development and eventual hatching how can i tell if the eggs are fertile after the hen has been sitting three days or more the egg can be carefully held up to a light a newly laid or infertile egg will be clear allow the light to shine directly through a fertile egg will display the embryo and the network of veins supporting it eventually even when held to a light a fertile egg will become opaque will the mother destroy the eggs if she smells a human odor on them dont overly disturb the sitting hen she will not destroy the eggs because of a foreign odor like small mammals constantly pulling the eggs away can distress her enough to abandon the nest do canaries need any sort of special care when breeding the birds should be getting a high protein food every day all year round once the first egg hatches make sure that you increase the amount offered for the first couple of weeks this is all that the hen will feed her young a lot of food is required to fuel the nestlings explosive growth some hens take extremely good care of their young others refuse to even sit on the eggs ive had birds that lovingly cared for their young for a week or two at that point the mother would mutilate the baby birds if after a couple of tries a hen does not make a good mother either just keep her as a pet or give her away to a good home will one canary hen raise anothers chicks with rare breeds it is possible to foster the eggs under other canaries the canary hen can not distinguish eggs just be sure that the eggs are about the same age what is banding get closed bands for your infants when the babies get pin feathers the main group of toes can be pointed forward and the last one pointed back then the closed band can be slipped onto the leg once the bones of the toes harden a band can not be slipped on or off this gives a permanent identifying mark will the hen go to nest again the same year when the first group of young is about three weeks old the hen will desire to breed again simply put in another nest when the first group of young is eating on their own put them in a different cage for a day or two their cage can be left next to the mothers this way she can feed them through the bars
