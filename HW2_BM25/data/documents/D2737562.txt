11 communication and consent updated 20 march 2018client relationship111 the client may be the owner of the animal someone acting with the authority of the owner or someone with statutory or other appropriate authority care should be taken when the owner is not the client practice staff should ensure they are satisfied that the person giving consent has the authority to provide consent the provision of veterinary services creates a contractual relationship under which the veterinary surgeon andor veterinary nurse shouldensure that clear written information is provided about practice arrangements including the provision initial cost and location of the outofhours emergency service and information on the care of inpatientstake all reasonable care in using their professional skills to treat animal patientskeep their skills and knowledge up to datekeep within their own areas of competence save for the requirement to provide emergency first aidmaintain clear accurate and comprehensive case records and accountsensure that all staff are properly trained and supervised where appropriategenerally ensure that the client is made aware of any procedures to be performed by practice staff who are not veterinary surgeons where appropriaterecognise that the client has freedom of choicewhen referring a case ensure that the client is made aware of the level of expertise of the referral veterinary surgeon andtreat clients fairly and without discrimination informed consent112 informed consent which is an essential part of any contract can only be given by a client who has had the opportunity to consider a range of reasonable treatment options including euthanasia with associated fee estimates and had the significance and main risks explained to them for nonurgent procedures the consent discussion should take place in advance of the day of the treatmentprocedure where possible the client’s consent to treatment should be obtained unless delay would adversely affect the animals welfare the following matters should be considered during the discussion with the client to ensure informed consent the nature purpose and benefits of any treatment or proceduresthe likely outcomes of any treatment or procedures with a clear indication of both common and serious risks presented in a way that the client understands eg explain any clinical termsthe veterinary surgeon should avoid making assumptions for example about a client’s financial constraints or a client’s understanding of the possible side effects complications or the failure to achieve the desired outcome with agreed treatmentfinancial estimates and an agreement on any financial limits this should also be documented on the consent form or on an attached detailed estimatewhere appropriate an explanation that the diagnosis is tentative subject to further investigationchecking with the client whether they have any questions or concerns regarding the diagnosis treatment and costsinforming the client where appropriate that other treatment is available that may have greater potential benefit than those available at the practice  see chapter 1 referrals and second opinions  and ensuring where possible that consent can be obtained from the client for any deviations from the treatment plan including costs therefore where possible ensuring that the practice has the client’s emergency contact details and that these are up to date responsibility for seeking client consent113 ordinarily it is expected that the veterinary surgeon undertaking a procedure or providing treatment is responsible for discussing this with the client and obtaining the client’s consent if this is not practical the veterinary surgeon can delegate the responsibility to someone else provided the veterinary surgeon is satisfied that the person they delegate to is suitably trained and has sufficient knowledge of the proposed procedure or treatment and understands the risks involved114 the most suitable person to delegate the responsibility of obtaining consent to would be another veterinary surgeon failing which a registered veterinary nurse or student veterinary nurse115 where a veterinary surgeon chooses to delegate this task the veterinary surgeon is responsible for ensuring that the client has been given enough time and information to make an informed decision and has given their consent before starting any treatment consent forms116 consent forms should be viewed as an aid to consent in conjunction with a discussion with the client117 if a client does not want to know about the possible risks and costs of a proposed procedure or treatment this should be documented on the consent formclinical records118 if additional procedures or tests are offered on the consent form eg preop bloods the veterinary surgeon should ensure that the client has been advised as to the potential advantages and advised of the associated costs this should be documented on the consent form119 consent forms may be used to record agreement to carry out specific procedures they form part of the clinical records if any amendments are made subsequently these should be initialled dated and a note of subsequent conversations recorded on the clinical records1110 for routine procedures information leaflets can be useful to explain to clients what is involved with a specific procedure anaesthesia expected outcome after care etc clients should be given an opportunity to consider this information before being asked to sign a consent form use of information sheets should be encouraged but should not be used as a substitute for discussions with individual clients1111 a copy of the form should be provided to the person signing the form unless the circumstances render this impractical the rcvs practice standards scheme manual provides that for ‘general practice’ signed consent forms are required for all procedures including diagnostics medical treatments surgery euthanasia and when an animal is admitted to the care of a veterinary surgeon1112 specimen consent forms form of consent for euthanasia and form of consent for anaesthesia and surgical procedures are available to download in the related documents box at the bottom of this page communication1113 veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses should seek to ensure that what both they and clients are saying is heard and understood on both sides this could be done by asking questions and summarising the main points of the discussion1114 veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses should encourage clients to take a full part in any discussion and to ask questions about their options or any other aspect of their animal’s care veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses should make sure that clients have sufficient time to ask questions and to make decisions1115 veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses should use language appropriate for the client and explain any clinical or technical terminology that may not be understood1116 where the client’s ability to understand is called into question veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses will need to consider whether any practical steps can be taken to assist the client’s understanding for example consider whether it would be useful for a family member or friend to be present during the consultation additional time may be needed to ensure the client has understood everything and had an opportunity to ask questions1117 if the clients consent is in any way limited or qualified or specifically withheld this should be recorded on the clinical records veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses must accept that their own preference for a certain course of action cannot override the clients specific wishes other than on exceptional welfare grounds1118 provision should be made for uncertain or unexpected outcomes eg in relation to dental procedures clients should be asked to provide contact telephone numbers to ensure discussions can take place at short notice provision for the veterinary surgeon or veterinary nurse to act without the client’s consent if necessary in the interests of the animal should also be considered1119 when arrangements have been made to bring an animal under the animals scientific procedures act 1986 for experimental investigation the client should be made aware of the general provisions of the act so that informed consent can be given1120 when an animal is enrolled on a clinical trial the client should be made aware of the general provisions of good clinical practice and be supplied with any other relevant information such as ethical guidelines and relevant contact details so that informed consent can be given1121 practice staff may be the first to become aware of any misunderstanding by clients concerning a procedure or treatment veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses should advise practice staff to communicate any concerns to the senior veterinary surgeon and ensure that the client is kept fully informed1122 veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses in the veterinary team and different practices should be encouraged to work together to ensure effective communication with clients and with each other discussion of fees1123 discussion should take place with the client covering a range of reasonable treatment options and prognoses and the likely charges including ancillary or associated charges such as those for medicinesanaesthetics and likely postoperative care in each case so as to ensure that the client is in a position to give informed consent the higher the fee the greater is the necessity for transparency in the giving of detailed information to the client1124 it is wise for any estimate to be put in writing or on the consent form and to cover the approximate overall charge for any procedure or treatment including vat pre and postoperative checks any diagnostic tests etc the owner should be warned that additional charges may arise if complications occur if a quote is given it may be binding in law1125 if during the course of treatment it becomes evident that an estimate or a limit set by the client is likely to be exceeded the client should be contacted and informed so that consent to the increase may be obtained this should be recorded in writing by the veterinary surgeon public health1126 veterinary surgeons should inform clients and others as appropriate of any human health care implications arising from the condition care tests or treatment of animals particularly those who may be more at risk young persons and children1127 persons under the age of 18 are generally considered to lack the capacity to make binding contracts they should not be made liable for any veterinary or associated fees1128 persons under the age of 16 should not be asked to sign a consent form where they have provided a signature parents or guardians should be asked to countersign1129 where the person seeking veterinary services is 16 or 17 years of age veterinary surgeons should depending on the extent of the treatment the likely costs involved and the welfare implications for the animal consider whether consent should be sought from parents or guardians before the work is undertaken1130 particular care should be taken when the treatment involves issues of health and safety as for supplying controlled drugs within the meaning of the misuse of drugs act 1971 to anyone under the age of 18 mental incapacity1131 the mental capacity act 2005 applicable in england and wales states ‘a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of or a disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain it does not matter whether the impairment or disturbance is permanent or temporary …’ the adults with incapacity scotland act 2000 provides that incapable persons are those aged 16 or over who lack one or more of the capacity to act make decisions communicate decisions understand decisions or retain the memory of decisions by reason of mental disorder or of inability to communicate because of physical disability however a person is not incapable only because of a lack of or deficiency in a faculty of communication if it can be made good by human or mechanical aid there is currently no primary legislation dealing with mental incapacity in northern ireland1132 where it appears a client lacks the mental capacity to consent veterinary surgeons should try to determine whether someone is legally entitled to act on that person’s behalf such as someone who may act under an enduring power of attorney if not veterinary surgeons should act in the best interests of the animal and seek to obtain consent from someone close to the client such as a family member who is willing to provide consent on behalf of the person prev supporting guidance next
