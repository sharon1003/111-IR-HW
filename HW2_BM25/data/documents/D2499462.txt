anaphylaxis redirected from anaphylactoid reactions also found in dictionary thesaurus encyclopedia  anaphylaxis definition anaphylaxis is a rapidly progressing lifethreatening allergic reaction description anaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction in which the immune system responds to otherwiseharmless substances from the environment unlike other allergic reactions however anaphylaxiscan kill reaction may begin within minutes or even seconds of exposure and rapidly progress to cause airway constriction skin and intestinal irritation and altered heart rhythms in severecases it can result in complete airway obstruction shock and death causes and symptoms causes like the majority of other allergic reactions anaphylaxis is caused by the release of histamineand other chemicals from mast cells mast cells are a type of white blood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tissues that regulate exchange with the environment the airwaysdigestive system and skin on their surfaces mast cells display antibodies called ig e immunoglobulin type e theseantibodies are designed to detect environmental substances to which the immune system is sensitive substances from a genuinely threatening source such as bacteria or viruses arecalled antigens a substance that most people tolerate well but to which others have an allergicresponse is called an allergen when ig e antibodies bind with allergens they cause the mastcell to release histamine and other chemicals which spill out onto neighboring cells the interaction of these chemicals with receptors on the surface of blood vessels causes thevessels to leak fluid into surrounding tissues causing fluid accumulation redness and swelling on the smooth muscle cells of the airways and digestive system they cause constriction on nerve endings they increase sensitivity and cause itching in anaphylaxis the dramatic response is due both to extreme hypersensivity to the allergen andits usually systemic distribution allergens are more likely to cause anaphylaxis if they areintroduced directly into the circulatory system by injection however exposure by ingestioninhalation or skin contact can also cause anaphylaxis in some cases anaphylaxis maydevelop over time from less severe allergies anaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods drugs and insect venom specific causesinclude fish shellfish and mollusks nuts and seeds stings of bees wasps or hornets papain from meat tenderizers vaccines including flu and measles vaccines penicillin cephalosporins streptomycin gamma globulin insulin hormones acth thyroidstimulating hormoneaspirin and other nsaids latex from exam gloves or condoms for example exposure to cold or exercise can trigger anaphylaxis in some individuals key terms acth — adrenocorticotropic hormone a hormone normally produced by the pituitary glandsometimes taken as a treatment for arthritis and other disorders antibody — an immune system protein which binds to a substance from the environment nsaids — nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs including aspirin and ibuprofen tracheostomy tube — a tube which is inserted into an incision in the trachea tracheostomy to relieve upper airway obstruction symptoms symptoms may include urticaria  hivesswelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth swelling of the sinuses difficulty breathing wheezing cramping vomiting or diarrhea anxiety or confusion strong very rapid heartbeat  palpitationsloss of consciousness not all symptoms may be present diagnosis anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid development of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen identification of the culprit may be done with rast testing a blood test thatidentifies ig e reactions to specific allergens skin testing may be done for less severeanaphylactic reactions treatment emergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injection of adrenaline epinephrine whichconstricts blood vessels and counteracts the effects of histamine oxygen may be given as well as intravenous replacement fluids antihistamines may be used for skin rash and aminophyllinefor bronchial constriction if the upper airway is obstructed placement of a breathing tube or tracheostomy tube may be needed prognosis the rapidity of symptom development is an indication of the likely severity of reaction the fastersymptoms develop the more severe the ultimate reaction prompt emergency medical attentionand close monitoring reduces the likelihood of death nonetheless death is possible from severeanaphylaxis for most people who receive rapid treatment recovery is complete prevention avoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliable method of preventing anaphylaxis for insectallergies this requires recognizing likely nest sites preventing food allergies requiresknowledge of the prepared foods or dishes in which the allergen is likely to occur and carefulquestioning about ingredients when dining out use of a medicalert tag detailing drug allergies is vital to prevent inadvertent administration during a medical emergency people prone to anaphylaxis should carry an epipen or anakit which contain an adrenalinedose ready

or exaggerated allergic reaction of an organism to foreign protein or other substances substances most likely to cause this include drugs such as antibiotics local anesthetics andcodeine drugs prepared from animals such as insulin adrenocorticotropic hormone and enzymesdiagnostic agents such as iodinated xray contrast media biologicals used to provide immunitysuch as vaccines antitoxins and gamma globulin protein foods the venom of bees wasps andhornets and pollens molds and animal dander the latex in gloves or foley catheters may cause a reaction in sensitive individuals physiologic basis anaphylaxis is an allergenreagin reaction brought about by large quantities of ig e antibodies  immunoglobulins that respond to the presence of foreign agents individuals whohave an anaphylactoid type of immune response have a familial predisposition to overreact in thepresence of an allergen because of their tendency to produce an overabundance of ig eantibodies when an allergen enters the body reagins ig e antibodies which are attached to cells throughout the body interact with the allergens this interaction is destructive to some of the bodys cells if the interaction is severe the outcome can be fatal during the interaction mast cells and eosinophils release histamine slowreacting substance of anaphylaxis srsa bradykinin and enzymes histamine brings about bronchospasmwidespread peripheral vasodilation and increased permeability of the capillaries srsa causesincreased constriction of the bronchioles and bronchi bradykinin has effects similar to those of histamine together they promote collapse of the vascular network by permitting the loss of fluidfrom the blood vessels into the interstitial fluid compartment clinical manifestations if the allergen comes into contact with cellbound ig e in the respiratorytract the tissues of the mucosa release chemical mediators that produce the symptoms of asthma and hay fever an insect bite or sting can produce localized swelling redness anditching or a more severe systemic reaction local anaphylactic reactions usually produce mildly irritating symptoms which should not be ignored because the reaction can rapidly escalate into a systemic response involving cellsthroughout the body the patient may then experience generalized itching swelling andurticaria as the process continues respiration is impaired because of bronchospasm andlaryngeal edema if an airway is not maintained and supplemental oxygen provided the personwill die of respiratory failure another lifethreatening series of events is related to vascular collapse resulting from a shift in body fluid the symptoms are hypotension decreasing levels of consciousness tachycardiaand diminished production of urine without effective treatment these symptoms progress to profound shock and death treatment and patient care mild anaphylaxis can be treated with antihistamines localapplications of cold to minimize swelling and topical applications of medications to relieveitching and soothe the skin all anaphylactic reactions require careful assessment andmonitoring and the patient should be instructed to seek additional help if he or she experiencesdizziness heart palpitations or prolonged or spreading edema anywhere in the body the drug of choice in the initial treatment of severe anaphylaxis is epinephrine administered intravenouslysubcutaneously sublingually or by intermittent positive pressure breathing the mode of administration is governed by the urgency of the situation and the presenting symptoms epinephrine causes bronchodilation reduces laryngeal spasm and elevates the blood pressure steroid therapy is initiated to counteract the effects of histamine by decreasing capillarypermeability acting as antiinflammatory agents steroids also stabilize mast cells and preventfurther release of chemical mediators supportive measures include administration of intravenous fluids and plasma to restoreintravascular fluid volume pressor agents such as dopamine norepinephrine and isoproterenol are given to increase and maintain blood pressure the best way to control anaphylaxis is by preventing it from happening in the first place but this is not always possible a person engaging in normal activities outside the clinical setting canaccidentally come in contact with an allergen an allergic individual should be prepared for such an event by understanding his or her allergy and knowing what actions to take those with knownatopic allergies should wear a medical identification necklace or bracelet and those who undergosystemic reactions should carry with them at all times a kit containing diphenhydramine  benadryl a syringe and needle and vials of epinephrine these kits require a writtenprescription from a primary health care provider in the clinical setting all health care personnel should be alert to the need for identifying patientswith known allergies
