white all together that symbolizes a permanent home surrounding that are red and white alternating rays that expand to the edges it’s flown at city hall and century ii it’s printed on tshirts and mugs so where has this flag been for nearly 80 years and what’s the deal with what some describe as a resurgence in wichita pride local artist chris gulick says “resurgence” isn’t the right term“i mean it’s been a birth it’s like this is the very first time since the flag was first made that i have been able to see in any kind of little bit of research i could even locate this is the first time that this thing have ever been used to this magnificence gulick says it’s huge it’s a rolling train and you’re not going to stop it now”artist chris gulick stands before a wichita flag credit courtesy chris gulick gulick says that around 20 years ago he noticed the being flown at century ii but nowhere else the image is public domain no one owns it or the rights making it free to be used or modified by anyone so gulick rallied some local artists to try their luck at promoting the design to fill a void that was perceived by some wichitans“seeing this flag i went ‘well why do we keep hearing people complain about our selfesteem or we need a catchphrase why do we keep having these arguments’ because here’s this thingwhy don’t we just make use of it he says they printed the wichita flag on ornamental license plates but the products didn’t go over well“we couldn’t give them away gulick says i think still have the last brand new one”gulick’s story is the complete opposite of what is currently happening with the wichita flag but if he’s bitter about it it doesn’t show he credits millennials with the recent success“i am just ecstatic that your generation has picked this thing up after guys like me turned gray and used it for what it is a graphic symbol with which to rally around your own local pride he says wichita flag merchandise lines the workroom where everything from flag pins to tshirts to home decor is sold credit abigail wilson  kmuwone place where plenty of wichita pride can be found is a small quirky store called the workroom janelle king runs the business which specializes in custom drapery and upholstery king says starting about two years ago the workroom became one of the few places to find wichitaflagthemed merchandiseand it’s all locally sourced“we started off doing some screenprinted flags on our fabric remnants and they just started flying out the door king says from there i’ve really expanded our line to include everything from coffee mugs to tshirts to artwork and more”this increased supply and demand of the flag gives rise to one question what came first for this recent movement the wichita flag or the wichita pride janelle king stands with some of the merchandise sold at the workroom in wichita credit abigail wilson  kmuwking says its the pride“i think the flag is just an image or symbol that is giving people the opportunity to showcase their wichita pride she says and it’s something that unifies everyone”wichita has consistently had a problem with brain draina stagnant economy and lack of jobs leading to the mass exodus of educated young people that included king who for a time moved away but she says now that she’s back she feel the city has over the years turned out to be pretty cool it’s just starting to steamroll our coffee culture has just exploded all of the local breweries and stuff the food truck culture all of those things are really what’s going to help the city grow and i feel like hopefully we’re doing our part in that too she says another organization that has been working to highlight wichita pride is the city’s chamber of commerce angie elliott is the director of business services for the chamber she started wearing a circular flag pin of the flag on her lapel early this summer after she found some for sale at the workroom“people asked me ‘what’s that button what is that’ and i said ‘well it’s the wichita flag elliott says and they’d look at me kind of strange and say ‘what are you talking about i didn’t know we had a flag i’ve lived here my whole life i didn’t know we had a flag and i said ‘well i’ve lived here my whole life too and i didn’t know we had a flag but we do that gave her the idea to give people their own flag button to in turn give to someone else a tshirt bears the wichita flag“so i went back to the workroom and i bought a bunch more buttons and kind of carried around this little pouch of buttons and i gave them to some coworkers who also are lifelong wichitans and it just keeps spreading elliott says you see a lot of people using it in a way thats meaningful to them and i think thats really what its about”she’s rightjust look around the flag has become meaningful to a lot of people around town especially local businesses where the design is used on tabletops on the walls and within logos wichita artist johnny freedom calls himself more of a handyman than an artist but his work which features the wichita flag the keeper of the plains and other wichitaesque symbolism has taken off in the past year he uses latex paint wooden pallets old fences antique doors anything he can find to make oneofakind pieces of art the mentality i think we’re seeing here in wichita isnot stemming from the flag but the flag being part of it is people taking pride in our community but also taking steps in order to make sure local business grows here flourish and support our economy freedom says so the wichita flag which had seemingly been lost for decades is back and for chris gulick whose vision of the flag being flown high over town is finally being realized it’s not about who started the movement or why so really a big thank you to you and your generation for taking this symbol and running with it like what it is… a flag of patriotism gulick says whether it’s a symbol of wichitans longstanding love for their city or a catalyst for newly found pride in a younger crop of citizens it’s hopefully here to stayrepresenting the freedom to come and go as you please related99 invisible episode 104 vexillonaire joint commission on vexillographic principles the
