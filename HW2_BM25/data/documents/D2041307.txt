essential oils you most likely ended up on this page because i linked to it from one of my posts–i’ve fallen in love with essential oils i use them multiple times everyday and sometimes several oils at a time if you know me personally you know that 1 i’m a stickler for quality food and beauty products and 2 i love ways of approaching health and wellness and quality of life naturally although i’ve bought oils in the health food store a few times i was never all that impressed with them overall and i wondered what all the hype was about then my friend introduced my to young living oils and i found myself scouring their website and all the resources i could find to decide what to order next truthfully i haven’t yet found an oil i don’t like the thing that made me jump in and finally buy my own oils was that i had read a lot about how oils could be used during pregnancy childbirth and for babies since i’m taking both a proactive and natural approach to my own pregnancy and mommyhood oils fit right in i decided right then that i would learn and practice everything i could with my oils why do i recommend young living i teach nutrition courses for a few universities and the fundamental concept i base my entire teaching philosophy on is to empower people to make informed choices about food and lifestyle i use the term true food nutrients to represent the empowerment principle – know where things come from and how they are raised and purposely eat foods that add value to your health the same goes for essential oils young living offers this promise – they own their farms and they run a very tight supply chain i trust their essential oils above all others because they are pure and unadulterated and are manufactured for therapeutic use not just for smell honestly i’m not just looking for results with my oils i’m looking for quality products that i can feel good about buying so how do i order the essential oils here’s the deal you can get the essential oils i recommend in one of two ways wholesale or retail via the young living website why should i order wholesale you get a 24 discount when you buy oils as a wholesaler you get support and new oily friends supplied by me click here to join my facebook group–you don’t have to have purchased any oils to do this partwhen you buy the premium starter kit you get a whole kit of oils plus a diffuser and bonuses along with great reading material you can choose to sell oils to other people if you want to but you are not required to do this what’s the catch i’m honest—there is one catch you have to spend 50 a year to remain a “wholesaler” and keep getting the discount since yl has tons of amazing oils and other products body care items and toothpaste are my current fave to choose from i know you can spend the 50

sign up with one of these kits to become a wholesale member this is mandatory to maintain your 24 discount going forward you only need to spend 50 worth each subsequent year with young living on any product in their store that’s it you can also purchase other items at this time if you wish set up your optional essential rewards program er now don’t be confused by this next step buying one of the er kits is not a requirement to sign up as a wholesale member this is a rewards program you can opt into to start earning money back to help pay for your oils at this point you can skip this step by selecting ‘no thank you i plan on enrolling in the essential rewards program later’ if one of the er kits looks valuable to you then by all means get one in addition to your starter kit but please understand that you cannot buy an er kit in lieu of a starter kit this program is the most economical way to purchase your oils and other products but you can sign up at any time if you decide that this is something you are interested in select the kit from the listed options that you would like to ship in your first essential rewards order despite what they imply – you will not receive this kit every month – you can change the products from monthtomonth through your virtual office for each er order and you only need spend 50 a month to remain in the program – the longer you remain in the program the more points you will receive to help pay for your oils then you will also need to select a ship date this is the day each month when you order will go out i recommend writing this down on your calendar so you don’t accidentally order the same thing twice agree to terms  conditions confirm your order to confirm the tool will log you in and it will show you your order again and it will make you enter in your payment information again we wouldn’t want that to happen because then you would not get your oilsthat’s it congratulations you will receive a confirmation email– you can log
