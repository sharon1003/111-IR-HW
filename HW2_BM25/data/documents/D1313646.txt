 â€“ oep 8 points 4 years ago the water you drink doesnt really go to the bladder not in any direct way it really is about 2 separate simultaneous processes when you drink water it is absorbed through the lining of the small and large intestines into your blood this absorption occurs at a rate that depends largely on how much water you need at that time your body uses the concentration of certain elements to keep track of how much water is in the blood and tissues if there isnt enough water you get thirsty and the kidneys filter out less water if there is too much your thirst is suppressed and the kidneys filter out more the kidneys have to produce a small amount of urine constantly to get rid of metabolic wastes but it also helps maintain the correct amount of water in your body so if you add a lot of water your kidneys will detect that and filter out more this is the reason why your urine is clear when you drink a lot of water and much darker when you dont so basically the answer to your question depends on how hydrated you are at that moment if you are dehydrated your kidneys will conserve water and it may be hours before you make any urine if you are overhydrated you will make urine immediately but is the urine you make the water you just drank not really the water you drink is diluted all over your body some of it may be excreted directly into the urine but the likelihood is that most of the urine will be water that was already in your body it all depends on the proportions this is a very simplified answer so nephrologists and renal physiologists should feel free to add what they willpermalink embed save give gold
