the 6th district and the 3rd moved into huntington in suffolk county and parts of southeast nassau county in the 1980s most of eastern nassau was added to the 4th district and the 3rd was composed of northwest nassau a narrow corridor along li sound and northwest suffolk after the 1992 redistricting the north shore was transferred to the new 5th district and the 3rd consisted of inland areas of northern and eastern nassau county and the nassau county south shore an even narrower corridor linked the northwest nassau and northwest suffolk portion of the 5th district leaving most of oyster bay in the 3rd the 2002 remap removed some areas of eastern nassau but added south shore towns in suffolk county and the shore areas of northeast nassau in 2012 the district moved from the south shore to
