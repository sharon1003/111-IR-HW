asteraceae compositae it can be found growing in temperate regions of the world in lawns on roadsides on disturbed banks and shores of water ways and other areas with moist soils t officinale is considered a weed especially in lawns and along roadsides but it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation common dandelion is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind these balls are called blowballs 5 or clocks in both british and american english 6 7 8 9contents  hide 1 description2 taxonomy21 north

edittaraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically 5–40 cm 20–157 in tall but sometimes up to 70 cm 28 in tall the stems can be tinted purplish they are upright or lax and produce flower heads that are held as tall or taller than the foliage the foliage may be uprightgrowing or horizontally spreading the leaves have petioles that are either unwinged or narrowly winged the stems can be glabrous or sparsely covered with short hairs plants have milky latex and the leaves are all basal each flowering stem lacks bracts and has one single flower head the yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts and all the flowers which are called florets are ligulate and bisexual in many lineages fruits are mostly produced by apomixis 10 notwithstanding the flowers are visited by many types of insects 11the leaves are 5–45 cm 20–177 in long and 1–10 cm 039–394 in wide and are oblanceolate oblong or obovate in shape with the bases gradually narrowing to the petiole the leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth 10the calyculi the cuplike bracts that hold the florets are composed of 12 to 18 segments each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous the lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series with the apices acuminate in shape the 14–25 mm 055–098 in wide involucres are green to dark green or brownishgreen with the tips dark gray or purplish the florets number 40 to over 100 per head having corollas that are yellow or orangeyellow in color the fruits called cypselae range in color from olivegreen or olivebrown to strawcolored to grayish they are oblanceoloid in shape and 2–3 mm 0079–0118 in long with slender beaks the fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that have sharp edges the silky pappi which form the parachutes are white to silverwhite in color and around 6 mm wide plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes while some have 16 or 32 pairs 12taxonomy  editripe fruits north american dandelions  editthe taxonomy of the genus taraxacum is complicated by apomictic and polyploid lineages 13 14 and the taxonomy and nomenclatural situation of taraxacum officinale is not yet fully resolved 12 the taxonomy of this genus has been complicated by the recognition of numerous species 15 subspecies and microspecies eg rothmalers flora of germany recognizes roughly 70 microspecies 16 the plants introduced to north america are triploids that reproduce by obligate gametophytic apomixis 12 17 some authorities recognize three subspecies of taraxacum officinale including 18 19taraxacum officinale ssp ceratophorum ledeb schinz ex thellung which is commonly called common dandelion fleshy dandelion horned dandelion or rough dandelion it is native to canada and the western us 20 some sources list it as a species taraxacum ceratophorum 21 22taraxacum officinale ssp officinale which is commonly called common dandelion or wandering dandelion taraxacum officinale ssp vulgare lam schinz  r keller which is commonly called common dandelion two of them have been introduced and established in alaska and the third ssp ceratophorum is native there 23european dandelions  edittaraxacum officinale l dandelion is a vigorous weed in europe with diploid sexual populations in the southern regions and partially overlapping populations of diploid sexuals and triploid or tetraploid apomicts in the central and northern regions these european dandelions can be divided into two groups the first group reproduces sexually as do most seed plants this group consists of dandelions that have a diploid set of chromosomes and are sexually selfincompatible sexual reproduction involves a reduction of the somatic chromosome number by meiosis followed by a restoration of the somatic chromosome number by fertilization diploid dandelions have eight pairs of chromosomes and meiosis is regular with normal pairing of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase i stage of meiosis 24the second group consists of polyploid mostly triploid apomicts meaning that both a viable embryo as well as a functional endosperm is formed without prior fertilization in contrast to the sexual diploids the pairing of chromosomes at metaphase i in triploid apomicts is strongly reduced however pairing is still sufficient to allow some recombination between homologous chromosomes 24taraxacum officinale has many english common names of which some are no longer in use including blowball lionstooth cankerwort milkwitch yellowgowan irish daisy monkshead priestscrown and puffball 25 other common names include faceclock peeabed wetabed 26 swines snout 27 white endive and wild endive 28carl linnaeus named the species leontodon taraxacum in 1753 the current genus name taraxacum derives possibly from the arabic tharakhchakon 10 or from the greek tarraxos 29 the common name dandelion comes from the french dent de lion or lions tooth in reference to the plants jaggededged leaves 29ecology  edita field of dandelions in mazovia poland taraxacum officinale is native to europe and asia 30 and was originally imported to america as a food crop 31 it is now naturalized throughout north america southern africa south america new zealand australia and india it occurs in all 50 states of the usa and most canadian provinces 23 it is considered a noxious weed in some jurisdictions 32 and is considered to be a nuisance in residential and recreational lawns in north america 33 it is also an important weed in agriculture and causes significant economic damage because of its infestation in many crops worldwide 32the dandelion is a common colonizer of disturbed habitats both from wind blown seeds and seed germination from the seed bank 34 the seeds remain viable in the seed bank for many years with one study showing germination after nine years this species is a somewhat prolific seed producer with 54 to 172 seeds produced per head and a single plant can produce more than 5000 seeds a year it is estimated that more than 97000000 seeds hectare could be produced yearly by a dense stand of dandelions  citation needed when released the seeds can be spread by the wind up to several hundred meters from their source the seeds are also a common contaminant in crop and forage seeds the plants are adaptable to most soils and the seeds are not dependent on cold temperatures before they will germinate but they need to be within the top 25 cm 1 in of soil 23t officinale is food for the caterpillars of several lepidoptera butterflies and moths such as the tortrix moth celypha rufana see also list of lepidoptera that feed on dandelions even though dandelion pollen is of poor nutritional quality for honey bees they readily consume it and it can be an important source of nutritional diversity in heavily managed monocultures such as that of blueberries 35 36 honey bees have not been shown to lower their pollination activity on nearby fruit crops when foraging on dandelions 37while not in bloom this species is sometimes confused with others such as chondrilla juncea that have similar basal rosettes of foliage 38 another plant sometimes referred to as fall dandelion is very similar to dandelion but produces yellow fields later fossil record  editt officinale has a fossil record that goes back to
