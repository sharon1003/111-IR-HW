clocks typically dont do much but display the time free alarm clock adds alarm functionality to your computer letting you create multiple alerts that can wake you up or remind you when its time to do something the programs interface is plain and attractive and we had no trouble figuring out how to use it attractive buttons across the top of the interface let users add edit and delete alarms each alarm can be set to go off only on certain days of the week and users can select whether they want the alarm to loop snooze turn on the monitor or wake up the computer from sleep mode we especially liked the options for customizing the alarm sounds there are 11 builtin options including bells birds a flute and a cuckoo clock users can also use their own audio files to create custom alarms which is always a nice touch the program has an online help file that describes its features but its really not necessary everything about free alarm clock is commonsense overall we think this is a great

doesnt allow you to set an alarm for a specific datearaneum august 21 2017  version free alarm clock 401pros none really very basic cons you cant set an alarm for a future date only today or every monday etc which to be honest makes this pretty much useless summary if you want to set alarms for specific dates this is useless reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value woke me up but doesnt allow my pc to sleeppanderpander march 07 2017  version free alarm clock 401pros it woke me up which is great cons i clicked wake up pc from sleep or something like that from the alarm menu assuming that it would only wake my laptop up when the alarm needs to go off this was unfortunately not the case it woke my laptop up whenever it fell asleep regardless of the time of day i decided to uninstall the software but the problem still remained summary even after uninstalling the software my laptop wont stay in sleep mode this is obviously irritating but i am more concerned about my laptop who is already an old lady now she isnt allowed any sleep which could potentially tip her over the edge if anyone knows how to fix this please let me know you would make my week and potentially save an old ladys life and i mean who doesnt want to save an old ladys life nothing in life gets you more hero points than that and we all know who loves hero points girls or dudes if you are a girl or a dude that likes dudes you do you but if you want to do you know what i mean  someone else youll need hero points which as you guessed would be flying your way if you could help me fix this laptop of mine and remember the saving the old lady part reply to this review was this review helpful 101101  reviewget rating value best little alarm clock for windows everastroannie
