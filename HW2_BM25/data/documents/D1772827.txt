generic routing encapsulation gre is a protocol that encapsulates packet s in order to route other protocols over ip network s gre is defined by rfc 2784  download this free guide how sdn is transforming wan operations free handbook access our handbook now to navigate the waters of sdn in the wan with tips on overcoming implementation challenges use cases for sdwan and how to adjust to the altered network engineering career prospects that result corporate email address by submitting your personal information you agree that tech target and its partners may contact you regarding relevant content products and special offers you also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the united states and that you have read and agree to the terms of use and the privacy policy gre was developed as a tunneling tool meant to carry any osi layer 3 protocol over an ip network in essence gre creates a private pointtopoint connection like that of a virtual private network  vpn  gre works by encapsulating a payload  that is an inner packet that needs to be delivered to a destination network  inside an outer ip packet gre tunnel endpoints send payloads through gre tunnels by routing encapsulated packets through intervening ip networks other ip routers along the way do not parse the payload the inner packet they only parse the outer ip packet as they forward it towards the gre tunnel endpoint upon reaching the tunnel endpoint gre encapsulation is removed and the payload is forwarded along to its ultimate destination in contrast to iptoip tunneling gre tunneling can transport multicast and ipv6 traffic between networks advantages of gre tunnels include the following gre tunnels encase multiple protocols over a singleprotocol backbone gre tunnels provide workarounds for networks with limited hops gre tunnels connect discontinuous subnetworks gre tunnels allow vpns across wide area networks  wan s while gre provides a stateless private connection it is not considered a secure protocol because it does not use encryption like the ip security  ipsec  encapsulating security payload  esp  defined by rfc 2406
