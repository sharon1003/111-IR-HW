hide 1 history2 design21 the great tower3 references4 external links history  edittattershall castle has its origins in either a stone castle or a fortified manor house built by robert de tattershall in 1231 1 this was largely rebuilt in brick and greatly expanded by ralph 3rd lord cromwell treasurer of england between 1430 and 1450 1brick castles are less common in england than stone or earth and timber constructions when brick was chosen as a building material it was often for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable the trend for using bricks was introduced by flemish weavers there was plenty of stone available nearby but cromwell chose to use brick 2 about 700000 bricks were used to build the castle which has been described as the finest piece of medieval brickwork in england 2 3of lord cromwells castle the 130 foot 40 metre high 4 great tower and moat still remain it is thought that the castles three state rooms were once splendidly fitted out and the chambers were heated by immense gothic fireplaces with decorated chimney pieces and tapestries it has been said that the castle was an early domestic country mansion masquerading as a fortress 2 cromwell died in 1456 and the castle was initially inherited by his niece joan bouchier but it was confiscated by the crown after her husbands demise 4 tattershall castle was recovered in 1560 by sir henry sidney who sold it to lord clinton later earl of lincoln and it remained with the earls of lincoln until 1693 1 it passed to the fortesques 1 but then fell into neglect it was put up for sale in 1910 its greatest treasures the huge medieval fireplaces were still intact when an american bought them they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping lord curzon of kedleston stepped in at the eleventh hour to buy the castle and was determined to get the fireplaces back after a nationwide hunt they were found in london and returned 5 he restored the castle 1 2 and left it to the national trust on his death in 1925 1 lord curzon had undertaken restorations on it between 1911 and 1914 2 it remains today one of the three most important surviving brick castles of the mid15th century 4the experience of tattershall led lord curzon to push for heritage protection law in britain this was enacted as the ancient monuments consolidation and amendment act 1913 design  editthe plan of the castle is roughly rectangular it is bounded by an inner moat surrounded by an outer moat 1 the inner enclosure or ward was that of the original 13thcentury castle and the original entrance was on the north side towards the west end 1the outer ward between the outer moat and inner moat housed the stables 1 the middle ward originally accessed by a bridge from the outer ward housed a gatehouse and guardhouse today access to the castle is via this middle ward 1 the inner moat encompasses the inner ward where the great tower and the kitchens now demolished were situated 1the great tower  editinterior of tattershall castle the tower is about 66 feet 20 m across there are separate entrances to the basement to the ground floor parlour and to the spiral staircase leading to the upper floors of the tower this suggests that the basement and ground floor were intended to provide communal accommodation while the three great upper rooms were an independent private suite or solar room 6 the design was extremely simple with four floors slightly increasing in size at each level by reductions in wall thickness 1 the fireplaces indicate that the rooms were not intended to be subdivided but were kept as one great room at each level one of the four corner turrets contains the staircase but the other three provided extra accommodation rooms at each level 1the basement was used to store spices and other kitchen items it is believed that during the civil war it was used as a prison 1the ground floor was the parlour and it was here that local tenants would come to pay their rent 4 today the parlour is licensed for civil wedding ceremonies for up to 90 guests 7 8the first floor of the private suite was the hall which would have been used to entertain and wine and dine guests 4the second floor was the audience chamber and only the finest of guests would have been admitted here a brick vaulted corridor led to a small waiting room before the great hall of the audience chamber which today houses flemish tapestries bought by lord curzon 4the third floor would have been the private chamber where the lord would have retired for the night 1above these are the roof gallery and battlements which provide good views across the lincolnshire landscape as far as boston to the south and lincoln to the north 1 it is not possible today to access the turrets 1the brick foundations to the south of the great tower projecting into the moat mark the site of the 15thcentury kitchens 1today the old guardhouse about 330 feet 100 m northeast of the tower is the gift shop and the grounds are home to a number of peacocks 8references  editnotes a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r dr m w thompson 1974 tattershall castle guide the national trust a b c d e adrian pettifer 2002 english castles a guide by
