1998 many news reports indicated that drinking wine in moderation may lessen the chance of developing macular degeneration researchers reported in the january 1998 issue of the journal of the american geriatrics society that people who drink wine in moderation may be less likely to develop agerelated macular degeneration amd this finding was based on an analysis of data collected between 1971 and 1975 for the national health nutrition and examination survey nhanes1 from 3072 adults 45 to 74 years of age with eyerelated changes that indicated amd the study found the lowest risk of agerelated macular degeneration in people who reported having only about one drink of wine a month but because of faulty recall that could really be two or three glasses of wine said dr thomas obisesan chief of the geriatrics section at the howard university hospital in washington beer and liquor showed no significant effect on the risk of macular degeneration however the national institutes of health national eye institute believes that it would be premature to make any recommendations based on this single study while this is an interesting finding that bears further investigation the authors of the study warn that the study should not be used to “draw inferences about a cause and effect relationship” it also should be noted that later studies have found no such relationship between macular degeneration and wine drinking and that the findings reported are of borderline significance the authors of the study expressed concerns about the reliability of the data indicating the amount of alcohol consumed as these data are often subject to recall bias in addition the study did not completely take into account possible confounding factors especially smoking many studies show that smoking is a risk factor for macular degeneration since there is generally more smoking among alcohol users smoking status should be taken into account in the analyses the reliability of the diagnosis of macular degeneration in those surveyed is also questioned by the national eye institute because the methods now used to diagnose macular degeneration in large studies have been improved and are quite different than those used in the early 1970s
