axel marrocco answered apr 11 2016i have looked at all of the answers and some of those in other sources and none of the answers seem to capture the emotion of watershed moment  the aha or epiphany moment the eureka moment a discovery or the moment of change ex the moment einstein envisioned the theory of relativitywatershed moment  an event marking a unique or important historical change of course or one on which important developments depend  watershed  dictionary definition  while a bend in a river might be an nice analogy to a change in the course of your life or a mountain range might divide the direction of water indicating the trajectory of a life all of these explanations seem to communicate a static fate and such a massive change in destiny do we not use the term watershed moment as a time when a project changed direction or when a path ex to a solution is discovered do we not refer to some dynamic event or situation that caused these changes in direction only if we are accepting the concept of divine plan would you say that the change was like the bend in the river that we had simply not come to yet or that the mountain rage was always there and it was only our fate to fall to the east or the west conceptually i envision a watershed moment as an impact bump on on a wet tree ex after a rain that causes the leaves gush down water or that magic moment when heat or weight causes snow slide off a tin roof even in these smaller analogies i am not comfortable that a cause creating change an affect poetically communicates the effect33k views · view

and 52m answer views on 2300acre property that the catholic sisters of st francis owned in northwest colorado springs were several watersheds along its western border next to national forest there were also many smaller builtup mounds of earth created to stem the spring run off so that water didnt just run off so fast that none of it would have time to soak into the ground for agricultural and landscaping use these structures were set up in the late 1800s by the lennox family which originally owned much of this land to raise and maintain its prize  winning dairy cow herds the property was only three to five miles from the nearest coach and then rail stub at monument valley creek which would greedily grab that run off and send it south when the sisters sold all but a central 200acre plot of land where the buildings that housed the retired members of their society nursed others back to life and provided places for visiting clergy and patrons to stay for limited lengths of time those old structures were still there today with peregrine having been built out now for 30 years they have been replaced by more modern culverts and a cemented drainage system watersheds stem slow direct water runoff from mountain or tributary sources therefore the word was paired with moment to phrase up the sense that some point in time there was a directive force at work that would directly shape the path of conversation deliberation military action and so forth the phrase a watershed moment is being used presently to describe usa presidential candidate donald trumps victory in the state of indiana and his competitor senator ted cruzs subsequent bailing from the campaign trail it is the title of a post by author jackie gingrich cushman syndicated news columnist and daughter of

there are many good answers to this and i have only what amounts to an addendum in modern usage we talk of a watershed as a geographical landform that moves fresh rain water see also alluvial plain floodplain and for a laugh water closet there were many forms of sheds in the old west but i don’t recall anything about a water shed the small typically aframe roofed structure above a community well is called a well house  although it’s more like a shed than a house  perhaps another answerer will better illuminate this there is only the sketchiest of associations between a “watershed moment” and “getting the gossip” at a water fountain ie where employees gather and chat at a workplace but surely for millennia there have been countless moments when people queuing up to gather or drink at a well conversed still that concept is quite distinct from what we now mean by the phrase watershed moment to put a cap on my speculation with regard to this thread without changing anything said in ancient times in some places it’s still the case the rockstone community laundry area is a rather legendary place for gossip because typically river water flows through the area it could also be considered a watershed of sorts134k views · view upvoters · answer requested by gareth jones quora user discipulus answered oct 9 2017 · author has 248 answers and 1297k answer views john boulay there

essentially a watershed moment marks a major historical turningpoint after which there is no going back as many of the other answers point out the term is taken from geography and refers to the
