vote26down votefavorite5i know it is rather rude to think of it this way and i dont want to offend anyone religiously but being dead is usually thought of as a very permanent condition in the united states so why does spanish use the word estar instead of ser to indicate that condition is there some background to this in terms of religion or politeness if i say mi padre es muerto would that have a drastically different meaning than if i had used estar or is the first one just plain incorrect and should never be used at allseleccióndepalabras cópulasshare improve this questionedited dec 6 11

permanence but condition  estado as opposed to being  ser  being dead is a albeit permanent condition or situation that a human is in – jrdioko dec 6 11 at 2235n this link you can find a good answer

or even known yet thats what the entire field of linguistics is about – paul legato jan 1 14 at 1910show 1 more comment8 answers active oldest votesup vote21down voteaccepted although it is true that estar usually indicates a nonpermanent temporary condition whereas ser usually signals a permanent condition you have to take into account that estar is normally used to express a condition resulting from a transformation process or actual change and ser is normally used when referring to an inherent characteristic with no involvement of process change or transformation in other words ser normally has the purpose of including the subject into a certain class this explains why there are some adjectives that express a permanent condition but can only be combined with estar this is so because they express the result of a change or transformation muerto is one of those adjectives and another example is roto el vaso está roto and not el vaso es rotoshare improve this answeredited dec 6 11 at

1 14 at 1036lucas if essentially arbitrary exceptions are needed this means that the supposed rule is incorrect or incomplete in some way languages arent arbitrary but the rules are sometimes complex and nonobvious this is what the field of linguistics studies – paul legato oct 8 14 at 4032paul legato ok then look harder and tell me when you find the rule without exceptions – lucas oct 8 14 at

transitive it means kill so él es muerto por means hes killed by though this meaning quite unused and doesnt sound natural morir is usually used as an intransitive verb and we use asesinar with kill meaning – javi dec 6 11 at 2256this cant be correct since ser is used for professions citizenship and so on jorge es médico jorge es ciudadano de tal país etc professions and citizenship can be

property does not change for the object while estar means a transition so él está muerto because he was alive before but mi camiseta es verde because it will not change by itself 1 in the case of verde you can also say la manzana está aún verde because while the tshirt does not change by itself the apple doesshare improve this answeredited dec 7 11 at 1021dusan2812 14 30answered dec 6 11 at

estar defines its state so one defines characteristics the other one defines conditions the rule permanent non permanent is a good rule but a rule of thumb so not always true john is tall —

describe a nonpermanent characteristic or something subject to change its state ser it is used to described something permanent or an inherent characteristic of something but in this case estar muerto you need to use the verb estar because estar muerto comes from the participle form of the verb morir  el ha muerto so almost any adjetive or characteristic that comes from the participle of a verb use estar for instance a door can be open or close it is not permanent but you say la ventana esta abierta la ventana esta cerrada because abiertaabierto is the participle of abrir as cerradacerrado is the participle of cerrar if you use the verb ser with these participles then you are using the passive voice so if you say el esta muerto he is dead es es muerto it would be something like he is being killedshare improve this answeranswered dec 1 14 at 1215pedroyurrita1add a commentup vote0down vote i think its because you use ser  participle when its passive voice the fire was put out by him el fuego fue apagado por él and you use estar in other cases im very bored right now ahora mismo estoy muy aburrido as i side note we never say es muerto its sounds unidiomatic and i dont even think it

both verbs ser and estar can be used with muerto estar is used to describe the condition of being dead the key is that the subject has not always been dead the subject was alive sometime in the past so here being dead or alive is a transient condition other adjectives that depict a transient condition are vivo enfermo sano preso libre soltero casado divorciado viudo el hombre está vivo el hombre está sano el hombre está libre el hombre está casado examples like libre soltero casado divorciado viudo can also have the verb ser without changing the meaning el hombre es libre el hombre es soltero el hombre es divorciado sano can be preceded by the verb ser but the meaning is altered el hombre es sano means that the man is healthy not only is well but he probably has a healthy life that maintains him wellwith adjectives like muerto casado divorciado and sano although with sano is somewhat weird you can use tenses other than present to indicate that the new condition is initiated by the action of a third party fue muerto a balazos serán casados por un ministro ha sido divorciado en dos ocasiones correct but estado is more usual y por su palabra fue sano its correct but somewhat
