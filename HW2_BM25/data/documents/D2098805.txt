alternative title principle of diminishing marginal productivity diminishing returns also called law of diminishing returns or principle of diminishing marginal productivity economic law stating that if one input in the production of a commodity is increased while all other inputs are held fixed a point will eventually be reached at which additions of the input yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output in the classic example of the law a farmer who owns a given acreage of land will find that a certain number of labourers will yield the maximum output per worker if he should hire more workers the combination of land and labour would be less efficient because the proportional increase in the overall output would be less than the expansion of the labour force the output per worker would therefore fall this rule holds in any process of production unless the technique of production also changes early economists neglecting the possibility of scientific and technical progress that would improve the means of production used the law of diminishing returns to predict that as population expanded in the world output per head would fall to the point where the level of misery would keep the population from increasing further in stagnant economies where techniques of production have not changed for long periods this effect is clearly seen in progressive economies on the other hand technical advances have succeeded in more than offsetting this factor and in raising the standard of living in spite of rising populations learn more in these related articleseconomics construction of a system…results because of the socalled law of diminishing returns although wages are held down profits do not rise proportionately because tenant farmers outbid each other for superior land as land prices were increasing malthus concluded the chief beneficiaries of economic progress were the landowners read moretheory of production substitution of factors…is the property known as “diminishing marginal rates of substitution” the marginal rate of substitution of factor 1 for factor 2 is the number of units by which x 1 can be reduced per unit increase in x output remaining unchanged in the diagram if feet of gold wire are indicated…read morepopulation population in human biology the whole number of inhabitants occupying an area such as a country or the world and continually being modified by increases births and immigrations and losses deaths and emigrations as with any biological population the size of a human population is limited by the supply of read more productivity productivity in economics the ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce it usually this ratio is in the form of an average expressing the total output of some category of goods divided by the total input of say labour or raw materials in principle any input can be used in the read more marginal productivity theory marginal productivity theory in economics a theory developed at the end of the 19th century by a number of writers including john bates clark and philip henry wicksteed who argued that a business firm would be willing to pay a productive agent only what he adds to the firm’s wellbeing or read more more about diminishing returns2 references found in britannica articles assorted referenceseconomic systems in economics construction of a systemproduction theory in theory of production substitution of factors external websites article history article contributors feedback corrections updates help us improve this articlecontact our editors with your feedback
