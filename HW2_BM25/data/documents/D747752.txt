major discoveries in the past decade have forced astronomers to review the definition of a planet our solar system now has three classified dwarf planets our beloved pluto eris and ceres sections what defines a planet pluto plutos moons eris ceres related links related lessons modeling the orbits of planets phases of charon what defines a planet the definition of a planet was revised again in 2006 according to nasa the international astronomical union iau most recently defines a planet as a celestial body that is in orbit around a star but is not itself a satellitehas sufficient mass so it is nearly spherical in shapehas cleared the neighborhood around its orbiton the other hand a dwarf planet is defined as a celetial body that is in orbit around a star but is not itself a satellitehas sufficient mass so it is nearly spherical in shapehas not cleared the neighborhood around its orbitthe only difference between a planet and a dwarf planet is the area surrounding each celestial body a dwarf planet has not cleared the area around its orbit while a planet has since the new definition three objects in our solar system have been classified as dwarf planets pluto ceres and eris text courtesy of nasaback to top pluto for 76 years until 2006 pluto was known as the ninth planet in our solar system since then pluto has been relegated to dwarf planet status discovered in 1930 pluto is a member of the outer region of our solar system known as the kuiper belt it has a highly inclined and eccentric 248year orbit around the sun as the secondlargest known dwarf planet pluto is approximately 2390 km in diameter and is composed primarily of ice and rock it is very difficult to precisely determine the diameter of pluto since it is so far away pluto is on average 40 times farther from the sun than earth pluto and its largest moon charon click to enlargethe new horizons spacecraft scheduled to arrive at pluto in 2015 will be able to provide us with more accurate measurements of pluto plutos surface is made almost entirely of nitrogen ice with traces of methane and carbon monoxide data from hubble space telescope leads scientists to believe plutos interior is about 60 rock and 40 ice which is consistent with the composition of a comet pluto has a thin atmosphere made of the same components of its surface nitrogen methane and carbon monoxide like a comet plutos atmosphere freezes as it moves away from the sun and the ices sublimate as it approaches the sun back to top plutos moons in 1978 the discovery of plutos largest moon charon gave scientists an opportunity to learn more about pluto the two icy objects eclipsed each other from earths point of view from 19851990 allowing scientists to more precisely determine their diameters and masses at approximately 1186 km charons diameter is just less than half of plutos pluto is also eight times more massive than charon pluto and its three known satellites charon nix and hydra click to enlargeit is not uncommon for a moon to be locked synchronously with its planet just as earths moon is locked to earth it is far less common however for a planet to be locked synchronously with its moon the plutocharon system is the only planetmoon system in our solar system locked synchronously together with each always showing the same face to the other two more moons were discovered orbiting pluto in 2005 nix and hydra are considerably smaller than pluto and charon at only 40 km and 160 km in diameter respectively nix orbits pluto at 48700 km from the center of mass of the system more than twice the orbital distance of charon hydra is the outermost of plutos satellites orbiting at 64800 km from the center of mass of the plutonian system back to top eris the eccentric orbit of eris click to enlargediscovered in 2005 eris is now the largest known dwarf planet in our solar system its diameter is estimated at 3000 km and it weighs roughly 166 x 1022 kg which is about 27 more massive than pluto like pluto it is very difficult to make precise measurements of eris diameter and mass but these are the most updated estimates eris orbits the sun at the far reaches of our solar system in an area known as the scattered disk scattered disk objects sdos tend to have highly inclined and eccentric orbits eris orbit is tilted at an angle of 44 degrees with respect to the ecliptic you can see from the picture how much more inclined this is compared to plutos orbit which is tilted only 17 degrees to the ecliptic eris orbital period is just over 556 years currently at a distance of about 97 au eris is at aphelion it wont be closest to the sun at perihelion until march 2257 eris has one known moon dysnomia named for the mythological daughter of eris dysnomias diameter is estimated to be less than 150 km it takes only 15 days for dysnomia to orbit eris at a distance of about 37370 km it is thought that dysnomia formed around eris in a similar way our moon formed around earth this theory states that earth was involved in a major collision with an object over 1000 km across that ejected a lot of material from the surface of earth this material eventually combined to form our moon back to top ceres the moon right is about 48 times the size of ceres click to enlargetwo of the largest members of the asteroid belt ceres left and vesta right click to enlargeitalian astronomer giuseppe piazzi discovered ceres in 1801 first classified as a planet ceres was later catalogued as an asteroid with the discovery of eris in 2005 after 150 years as the head of the asteroid belt ceres became the solar systems smallest dwarf planet ceres is still the largest and by far the most massive member of the asteroid belt the diameter of ceres is about 950 km and it alone makes up one third of the asteroid belts total mass launched in the summer of 2007 nasas dawn spacecraft is headed for two of the asteroid belts largest objects dawn is scheduled to arrive at the asteroid vesta in 2011 and collect data during a series of orbits after four years of interplanetary travel dawn will arrive at ceres to collect more information on the newly designated dwarf planet back to top related
