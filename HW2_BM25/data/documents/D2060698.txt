netherlands contents  hide 1 history2 timeline3 player roster31 active32 former4 achievements5 gallery6 references history  editthe teams original incarnation has roots in a north american lineup headed by fluffnstuff called team fire that went on to represent comp lexity gaming at the international 2012 following an early knockout the co l squad disbanded with tc ixmike88 and fluffnstuff moving over to liquid and joining bu lba who competed at ti2 with evil geniuses and korok formerly of quantic gaming  in 2013 the team established itself as one of the premier north american organizations with this roster placing highly in events such as the raidcall d2l the defense season 3 the premier league season 4 and the american dota league in addition to securing an invite to the international 2013 after a rocky start they fell into the lower half of the bracket by a thin margin which saw them defeat mufc and then had one of their defining moments in a stellar performance against lgdcn knocking the chinese behemoth out of the event a loss to the defending champions invictus gaming saw them out in 78th place after the event the roster changed once more with ixmike88 going inactive to focus on ixdl and korok leaving for school qojqva of mousesports and waytosexy of dignitas eventually filled the ranks after a strong start in online leagues and group stages the team had major stumbles at both fall lan events falling early at both mlg columbus and dream league by early winter the team started to falter in its online play as well with the frustration boiling over and being shown by fluffnstuff on his tlnet blog 1 the blog resulted in an ultimatum for fluff win as captain or be removed from the team 2 the team failed to improve and liquid soon parted ways with fluff 3 after trialing a few players including sneyking de mo n was added to the roster to take his place despite some early promise the team still struggled falling to evil geniuses and north american rejects in straight sets and in doing so failing to qualify for the summit shortly after tl fell to evil geniuses in the final stages of the esl one frankfurt qualfiers due to the teams recent struggles they were not invited as a direct seed to the international 2014 and instead had to fight through another set of qualifiers liquid ended the group stage tied for first setting up a winners finals against nar a team they had yet to ever take a match off liquid fell 02 setting up a match against exliquid players ixmike and fluff on their new team sneaky nyx assassins after a close game one liquid appeared to have captured the momentum and convincingly took game two advancing them to play nar in the finals the finals ended up being much more back and forth than any other set between the teams but after the delayed final game and liquids eventual defeat they were forced to settle with a playin position for ti4 following up their disappointing ti4 qualifiers the team continued to experiment with juggling their roles while playing in the gest  the challenge 4 demon moved to the carry or offlane with tc moving to support the team showed some early success against we try and relax but stumbled again when they hit nar in the semi finals liquid capped off the month with a disappointing group stage exit in the d2l western challenge  in early june the team did manage a small bright spot with their second place finish in the second season of the american dota league season 2 falling to mousesports 13 in the finals the team also shuffled positions slightly again with bu lba moving to support and de mo n to the offlane the tournament marked team liquids last official matches before fighting for the wildcard spot in seattle in a month and a halfs time although liquid earned a trip to seattle they still needed four wins to make their way into the main event of the tournament first up was the favorite cis coming out of china and led by black heavily favoring the picks of skywrath mage for bu lba and tidehunter for de mo n liquid crushed cis in two straight games with a combined kill score of 4912 this would advance them forward to face mvp phoenix who had won their series against virtuspro on the other side of the bracket after a close first match in which tl came out on top liquid were able to ride the momentum and close out the series in convincing fashion in the second match qualifying for the main event without losing a game at the main event liquid stumbled out the of the blocks with another loss to nemesis navi us exnar but bounced back in a major way with wins over favorites newbee evil geniuses and dk in day 1 in day 2 tl continued to rack up wins beating empire and fnatic but lost three to cloud9 lgd and most notably arrow gaming a loss that would haunt them in the next stage in day 3 liquid managed to defeat the previous two ti winners invictus gaming and alliance with an additional win over titan but also dropped two matches one to natus vincere and one to vici gaming liquid only had one game on day 4 with a win guaranteeing them at least top 6 in the group stage and top 8 overall unfortunately mousesports went on to defeat them and liquid finished in a 4 way tie for 5th spot but fell to 7th after accounting for the tiebreaking rules their 7th place in group put them up against lgd gaming in the next round the team liquid upset in the previous year they would face off again in an elimination match loser walking home with 50000usd and the winner guaranteed at least ten times that this year was different from the previous though and lgd outclassed liquid convincingly taking two straight games and knocking liquid out of the tournament in 9th10th place the postti shuffle was not kind to liquid it was announced de mo n had departed a couple weeks after the event quickly followed up by waytosexy about a week later team tinker appeared featuring both bu lba and qojqva many hoped this was a trial for a new roster for liquid but after less than a month it was revealed that the two had left the liquid organization being the last man standing tc left liquid in early october leaving liquid without a
