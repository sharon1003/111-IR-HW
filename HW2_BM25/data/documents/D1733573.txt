different tune the westminster chimes are worldfamous so there would probably be a public outroar if the chimes were changed it is possible to change the chimes  you would have to detach the cables

the furthest you can hear the bells hard to say some people who live near tower bridge report that they can hear big ben on a quiet evening in the 1860s when london was quieter the sound would have been clearer there are even reports that a sentry on guard at windsor once heard the bell chime why does one of the chimes sound odd we think youre talking about the 13th chime in the hour sequence this bell which chimes twice in succession chime 12 and 13 has two hammers we think perhaps youre interpreting the double strike as an odd sound where were the quarter bells made the quarter bells

clock what is the official name of the clock the great westminster clock how accurate is the clock it is accurate to within one second when you hear the first chime of big ben that marks the hour on the dot who designed the clock edmund beckett denison he worked with edward dent on the design edward dent had proposed a clock design and edmund beckett denison made lots of modifications so he deserves the credit as designer and heres the best part  he was a lawyer not a clockmaker and he intentionally did not patent his new escapement  which meant other turret clockmakers could use the new technology for their clocks what makes the clock work are you ready for this gravity there are huge weights on long cables that attach to each train of gears the clock engineers wind the cables three times a week and as gravity pulls the weights down the trains rotate their rotation is regulated by the escapement and the swinging pendulum as long as the clock is properly wound and as long as gravity keeps working which looks likely the great westminster clock will keep on tickinghow is the great clock kept in time the clock engineers phone up the speaking clock to check the time then they make adjustments to the clock they add pennies to the pendulum to speed it up or remove them to slow it down are the hands made of metal and are they heavy how big are the hands how much do the hands weigh each hour hand the short one is 27 metres long and weighs about 300 kilogrammes 600 pounds each minute hand the long one is 42 metres long and weighs about 100 kilogrammes 220 pounds how big each number is in comparison to everyday object like car double decker bus etc the numbers on the dials are about 2 feet tall how long does it take to adjust for daylight savings not too long actually they use the adjustment as an opportunity to do some maintenance on the great clock they stop the clock at 1000 pm and perform the maintenance then they start it back up at 200 am new time how much does the clock weigh the clock mechanism weighs 5 tons who looks after the great westminster clock  big ben there is a whole team of people including the keeper of the great clock and several clock engineers they have to wind the clock three times a week and make sure the clock is maintained they also ensure the clock keeps correct time and is reset for daylight savings time plus every so often they have to change all those lightbulbs which illuminate the faces at nightwhat makes the bells chime the great westminster clock has three trains of gears the going train the chiming train and the striking train the going train keeps time and moves the hands on the faces at quarter past at half past at quarter to and on the hour it tells the chiming train to pull the cables which make the quarter bells chime also on the hour it tells the striking train to pull the cable to make big ben chime how do the clock faces get cleaned how often do they get cleaned with soap and water about every five years a team of window washers abseil rappel from the belfry down to the faces of the clock and wash each face they have to be careful not to break the glass or to lean on the hands we asked our contact at the clock tower how much it cost to clean the four faces and he says less than youd think back to top  the birthday  the bell  the belfry  the clock  the clock tower  curious
