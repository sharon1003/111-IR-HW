never sought to adopt the euro as its official currency for the duration of its membership of the eu and secured an optout at the euros creation via the maastricht treaty in 1992 polls have shown that the majority of british people have been against adopting the euro and in a june 2016 referendum the uk voted to withdraw from the european union meaning there is virtually no chance of any future adoption despite never being a member of the euro the currency is used in the uks cypriot territories and london is home to the majority of the euros clearing houses 1contents  hide 1 history2 usage21

brown set out the five economic tests that must be met before the uk would adopt the euro the united kingdom entered the european exchange rate mechanism a prerequisite for adopting the euro in october 1990 the uk spent over £6 billion trying to keep its currency the pound sterling within the narrow limits prescribed by erm but was forced to exit the programme within two years after the pound sterling came under major pressure from currency speculators the ensuing crash of 16 september 1992 was subsequently dubbed  black wednesday  during the negotiations of the maastricht treaty of 1992 the uk secured an optout from adopting the euro 2the government of former prime minister tony blair declared that  five economic tests  must be passed before the government could recommend the uk joining the euro and promised to hold a referendum on membership if those five economic tests were met her majestys treasury first assessed five economic tests in october 1997 when it was decided that the uk economy was neither sufficiently converged with that of the rest of the eu nor sufficiently flexible to justify a recommendation of membership at that time another assessment was published on 9 june 2003 by gordon brown when he was chancellor of the exchequer though maintaining the governments positive view on the euro the report opposed membership because four out of the five tests were not passed however the 2003 document also noted the considerable progress of the uk towards satisfying the five tests since 1997 and the desirability of making policy decisions to adapt the uk economy to better satisfy the tests in future it cited considerable longterm benefits to be gained from eventual prudently conducted emu membership the uk would also have to meet the eus economic convergence criteria maastricht criteria before being allowed to adopt the euro which at that time the uks annual government deficit to the gdp was above the defined threshold the government committed itself to a tripleapproval procedure before joining the eurozone involving approval by the cabinet parliament and the electorate in a referendum gordon brown blairs successor ruled out membership in 2007 saying that the decision not to join had been right for britain and for europe 3 in december 2008 josé barroso the president of the european commission told french radio that some british politicians were considering the move because of the effects of the global credit crisis 4 5 the office of the prime minister gordon brown denied that there was any change in official policy 6 in february 2009 monetary policy affairs commissioner joaquín almunia said the chance that the british pound sterling will join high 7the united kingdom released new coin designs in 2008 following the royal mint s biggest redesign of the national currency since decimalisation in 1971 german news magazine der spiegel saw this as an indication that the country has no intention of switching to the euro within the foreseeable future 8 it is however an unwritten convention that the coin designs should be changed every 40 years to keep the coinage fresh 9in the uk general election 2010 the liberal democrats increased their share of the vote but lost seats one of their aims was to see the uk rejoining erm ii and eventually joining the euro 10 but when a coalition was formed between the liberal democrats and the conservatives the liberal democrats agreed that the uk would not join the euro during this term of government following the election of a majority conservatives government in the subsequent election a referendum on eu membership itself was held and the decision was taken to leave the eu with the uks vote to withdraw from the eu euro adoption is now a practical impossibility even if government and or public opinion were to change the eus position is that new third countries would only adopt the euro through membership of the eu 11 withdrawal may also negatively impact londons position as a hub for euro clearing 1usage  editthe uks cypriot bases are the only part of the uk to officially use the euro cypriot territories  editthe sovereign base areas of akrotiri and dhekelia in cyprus introduced the euro at the same time as cyprus on 1 january 2008 previously they used the cypriot pound since the independence of cyprus treaties dictate that british territories in cyprus will have the same currency as the republic of cyprus these are the only places under british control where the euro is legal tender  citation needed they do not issue separate euro coins following the british vote to withdraw from the eu in june 2016 ioannis kasoulides foreign minister of cyprus announced that cyprus wished to have eu citizen privileges remain for these areas if the uk ceases to be a member 12clearing  editlondon is home to three quarters of all euro clearing in the world to a value of 927bn euro the second largest hub is paris which operates 11 of clearing in light of the uks withdrawal from the eu the eu is looking at whether these operations should be forced to move from london to within the eu so the activities could be regulated by the european central bank 1exchange rate  editin june 2003 gordon brown stated that the best exchange rate for the uk to join the euro would be around 73 pence per euro 13 on 26 may 2003 the euro had reached 721 pence a value not exceeded until 21 december 2007 14 during the final months of 2008 the pound declined in value dramatically against the euro the euro rose above 80 pence and peaked at 97855p on 29 december 2008 15 this compares with its value between march and october 2008 when the value of the euro was about 78 pence and its value of about 70 pence between april 2003 and august 2007 with the impact of the global financial crisis of 2008 on the british economy including failing banks and plunging uk property values 16 some british analysts stated that adopting the euro was far preferable to any other possible solutions for britains economic problems 17 there was some media discussion about the possibility of adopting the euro on 29 december 2008 the bbc reported that the euro had reached roughly 977p due to poorer economic forecasts this report stated that many analysts believed that parity with the euro was only a matter of time 18at that time some shops in northern ireland accepted the euro at parity causing a large influx of shoppers from across the irish border this made some shops the most successful in their company for several weeks 19 20 alex salmond the then first minister of scotland called for more scottish businesses to accept the euro to encourage tourism from the eurozone noting that this is already done by organisations such as historic scotland 21during 2009 the value of the euro against the pound fluctuated between 961p on 2 january and 84255p on 22 june in 2010 the value of the euro against the pound fluctuated between 91140p on 10 march and 81040p on 29 june on 31 december 2010 the euro closed at 86075p 22 23 24 25 26 a report in britains daily telegraph argued that the high euro had caused problems in the eurozone outside germany there was a fairly steady decline in the euro rate during 2013 2014 and 2015 from 85p to 70p during 2016 the pound declined against several currencies meaning the euro rose especially on 24 june 2016 because of the eu

to withdraw the uks membership of the euro was always a possibility if the uk decided to drop its optout for this time considerations on the impact of membership were weighed heavily economics  editsome believe that removing the united kingdoms ability to set its own interest rates would have detrimental effects on its economy one argument is that currency flexibility is a vital tool and that the sharp devaluation of sterling in 2008 was just what britain needed to rebalance its economy 28 another objection is that many continental european governments have large unfunded pension liabilities they fear that if britain adopts the euro these liabilities could put a debt burden on the british taxpayer 29 though others have dismissed this argument as spurious 30 one of the underlying issues that stand in the way of monetary union is the structural difference between the uk housing market and those of many continental european countries 31the entry of the uk into the eurozone would have likely resulted in increased trade with the other members of the eurozone 32 it could also have had a stabilising effect on the stock market prices in the uk 33 a simulation of the entry in 1999 indicated that it would have had an overall positive though small effect in the long term on the uk gdp if the entry had been made with the rate of exchange of the pound to the euro at that time with a lower rate of exchange the entry would have had more clearly a positive effect on the uk gdp 34 a 2009 study about the effect of an entry in the coming years claimed that the effect would likely be positive improving the stability for the uk economy 35an interesting parallel can be seen in the 19th century discussions concerning the possibility of the uk joining the latin monetary union 36public opinion  editfurther information on eurosceptics euroscepticism the wording of the question may have varied but the figures showed that a majority of british people have been

eurobarometer polls 46sterling zone  editif the united kingdom had joined the eurozone this would also have affected the crown dependencies and some british overseas territories that also use the pound sterling or which have a currency on a par with sterling in the crown dependencies the isle of man jersey guernsey and alderney pounds all share the iso 4217 code gbp in the british overseas territories the gibraltar falkland islands british indian ocean territory and saint helena pounds are also fixed so that £1 in the local currency equals £1 in sterling the british antarctic territory and south georgia and the south sandwich islands do not have their own currencies and use the pound sterling when france adopted the euro so did the french overseas departments and territories that used the french franc the cfp franc the cfa franc and the comorian franc that are used in overseas territories and some african countries had fixed exchange rates with the french franc but not at par – for various historical reasons they were worth considerably less at 1 french franc  182 cfp francs 75 comorian francs or 100 cfa francs the cfa franc and the comorian franc are linked to the euro at fixed rates with free convertibility maintained at the expense of the french treasury the cfp franc is linked to the euro at a fixed rate it was suggested that the sterling zone territories would in the event of the uk adopting the euro have four options enter the eurozone as a noneu member and issue a distinct national variant of the euro—just as monaco and the vatican have done the eu has only allowed sovereign states to adopt this approach to date also it has demanded that monetary agreements be entered into by noneu members who wish to issue their own euro coinage and prevented andorra from issuing their own coins until the agreement was signed such agreements the eu has stated must include adherence to eu banking and finance regulation use standard euro coins issued by the uk and other eurozone countries this may be perceived by some as losing an important symbol of independence maintain their existing currency but peg at a fixed rate with the euro maintaining a fixed rate against currency speculators can be extremely expensive as the uk found on black wednesday adopt a freefloating currency or a currency fixed to another currency as the jersey government had hinted gibraltar was in a different position being within the eu as part of the uks membership if the uk were to have adopted the euro it might not have been possible to implement an optout for gibraltar or whether it would have had a separate referendum banknotes  editsome private sector banks in scotland and northern ireland issue banknotes of their own design the banking act 2008 47 amended the rights

across the eurozone the european central bank announced a total ban on the issuing of banknotes by entities that were not national central banks legal protection of banknotes in the european union member states a move from sterling to the euro would have ended the circulation of subnational banknotes as all euro banknotes of a given denomination have an identical design however as national variation is a requisite of euro coins it would have remained an option for the royal mint to incorporate the symbols of the home nations into its designs for the british national sides of euro
