home  garden decorating  remodeling difference between compressed wood and ply wood furniture i wish to buy furniture for my house as in bed wardrobe dressing table etc i have taken lot of opinions but still confused between to buy compressed wood or ply wood furniture please guide me1 following 12 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer compressed wood is little pieces of wood like chips and sawdust all glued together then it is usually covered with a photograph of wood to make it look nice its not too expensive but it wont last well when gotten damp or when moved there are higher grades but still has a lifespan plywood is the next step up  thin sheets of wood are shaved off of the tree then glued together to make a sandwich these can last 50 even 75 years if kept dry and cared for  especially if it is a higher quality of plywood you can make plywood furniture yourself  its not hard the highest step up is solid wood i saw some the other day from the 1700s and they were still in excellent shape my suggestion would be to just buy cheap used furniture for your needs and use the savings to buy one really nice solid wood piece whenever you can afford it they will last generations dottie · 7 years ago2 0 comment1source s grab 16000 woodworking plans here  httpwoodworking naturally savercom i letha · 2 years ago1 0 comment compressed wood board source

drawn and therere stepbystep explainations of how the plan should be done and put together there are several other sites whose collection of plans have the dimensions totally wrong without any

it comes to woodworking and diy projects s he has been a woodworker for many many years cons there is only one drawback that we could find and that being with 16000 woodworking plans you are bound to get some which look a little disorganized but that is understandable as it is very difficult to place all these plans into their proper categories secondly it might take you a little longer to do the downloads on because of the size of them but the members area include an option to upgrade to the dvd so you can save time on downloading bottom line truth is ive been a carpenter for almost 36 years and i havent found anything like this for less than 10s of thousands of dollars heres the bottom line if you are planning to start on your woodworking project this isnt something you should use its something that you would be insane not to check the site httptinyurlcomwood working ted plans anonymous · 4 years ago0 0 comment before telling difference i would like to define these terms compressed wood furniture “wood which has been impregnated with resin and subjected to a high pressure to increase its density and strength” ply wood furniture “a material composed of thin sheets of wood glued together with the grains of adjacent sheets oriented at right angles to each other” now to make difference between both is easy to understand compressed wood is soaked with resin and to rise its power we will give high pressure on it whereas ply wood needs glue type thing for joining small sheets together jerry · 2 years ago0 0 comment you get what you pay for the best furniture is made of solid hardwood but many good manufacturers use plywood or particleboard to keep the cost down for the consumer for example you may buy a good looking dresser that has a maple exterior but the back and drawers are made of plywood or particle board the dresser that is part hardwood and part plywood may cost half as much as a solid hardwood piece of furniture maybe you are buying a dresser for a teenager and you only need something that will last 5 to 10 years in this case something made of particleboard with an oak veneer on it would work just fine steve httponestopfurniturestorescomsteve

designing of furniture sneha · 2 years ago0 0 comment the technology of laminated wood consists in dividing the log into planks which are then dried and sorted in degrees of quality they to are then united together to form a ”laminate” about 33 millimetre thick finally they are glued together to form beams and structural elements in different sizes they can be geometric in shape or take on any curved form wood laminates improve upon the natural strengths of solid lumber and reduce or eliminate such inherent defects as warping bowing and shrinkage precise lengths can be cut which are consistent in quality throughout the board or the panel reducing waste and labour in a wide range of applications plywood is manufactured by slicing or rotary peeling thin 25 mm sheets of material veneer from a flitch or log and then laminating three or more veneers into a rectangular sheet perhaps 1200 mm × 1200 mm for very thin sheets otherwise 1200 mm × 2400 mm laminating an odd number of plies 3 5 7  reduces warping while increasing the number of plies increases the resistance to shearing forces gail · 2 years ago0 0 comment1 2 next perhaps you would like to learn more about one of
