family  relationships singles  dating whats a hopeless romantichow can you tell if someones a hopeless romantic what do people mean when they say heshes a hopeless romantic is that a good thing or a bad thing 6 following 10 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer i think the term hopeless romantic can have many definitions  but it is commonaly perceived as a person who is in love with love and loves the romance of love this person has an idealistic romantic view of love which can border on fantasy sometimes which of course can fall short of the reality of love in most relationships they really are looking for the man or woman of their dreams or their soul mates or that one true love and when they find that special one they have a lot of love to give and will show their love in many romantic ways  and they are hopelessly romantic in the sense that they cant and dont want the romantic part of their love to end and will do everything within their power to perpetuate it by doing romantic things because their love is an idealistic love personally i dont think thats a bad thing at all who wouldnt appreciate that kind of love  as long as it doesnt smother a person but i think hopeless romantics are givers and not takers i think a hopeless romantic really wants their partner to be happy and will always put them first and that is not a bad thing as a matter of fact thats the way both partners should show their love for one another i think it can be a bad thing for the hopeless romantic only if their special way of showing love by doing so many sweet things by being so romantic is taken for granted or if the person that they are lavishing all of this romantic love on is unworthy and using them hopefully the special one they find will be worthy of such a love and be capable of returning this romantic love in kind what a lucky couple they would bescottie · 1 decade ago23 0 comment askers rating hopeless romantic source shttpsshrinkima7vqfvaibhav · 2 years ago0 0 comment hopeless romantics believe in love and fairy tales they dream of roses and candlelight walking on the beach at sunset and dancing in the rain they know that somewhere out there is a knight in shining armor ready to carry them off or a beautiful princess waiting to be carried off into the sunset hopeless romantics believe in true love and the eternal bliss that comes from being united with one’s soul mate is what they crave most hopeless romantics recognize in themselves the ability to love infinitely deeply and they ache to be loved with the same fervor in return when a hopeless romantic has someone to lavish their affection on lavish they do hopeless romantics sometimes write love letters full of poetic phrases and send flowers but mostly they try to find a thousand thoughtful little ways to show their love they make romance into an art form hopeless romantics wear rosecolored glasses in their eagerness to find “the one” a hopeless romantic may either be extraordinarily picky or not discerning enough hopeless nonromantics think that hopeless romantics are delusional and too intense other than the seeming futility in the search for a soul mate nothing frustrates a hopeless romantic more than a significant other who does not understand the hopeless romantic temperament hopeless romantics are the idealists the sentimental dreamers the imaginative and the fanciful they give the world its onceuponatimes and happilyeverafters hopeless romantics may have their feet on the ground but their souls fly somewhere over the rainbow the idea of a hopeless romantic definitely has some beautiful and positive elements to it the one thing that should be understood and discussed is that a relationship is hard work and it is never perfect there are times or lengthy periods in the relationship that will be uneasy or angst moments as well as those joyful moments source s a hopeless romantic is part of my

everything in his power to make sure he pleases me and what s funny is all i want to do is make sure he is pleased and knows how much i love and care about him to go from someone who can t show any feelings or any emotions to someone who is so giving and loving is in my eyes a rare gift kendra · 2 years ago1 0 comment they make their biggest decisions regarding love and lovers based on their emotions and spur of the moment excitement rather than on pragmatic rational choices they often wear their heart on their sleeve and can become infatuated very easily for instance theyll marry someone they met like last week because theyre all caught up in the intense infatuation of a new thing rather than wait until they know everything about the personblah · 1 decade ago1 1 comment its a good
