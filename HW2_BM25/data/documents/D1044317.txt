votefavorite17i come from a background of mo m i think i understand esb conceptually however im not too sure about the practical differences between the two when it comes to making a choice architecturally here is what i want to know1 any good links online which can help me in this regard2 can someone tell me where it makes sense to use one over the other any help would be usefuljava soa messaging esb momshare improve this questionasked nov 21 08 at 1631asak628 4 15 27add a comment6 answers active oldest votesup vote38down voteaccepted messaging tends to concentrate on the reliable exchange of messages around a network using queues as a reliable load balancer and topics to implement publish and subscribe an esb typically tends to add different features above and beyond messaging such as orchestration routing transformation and mediation id recommend reading about the enterprise integration patterns which gives an overview of common patterns youll tend to use in integration problems which are all based above a message bus though can be used with other networking technologies too for example using open source apache active mq provides a loosely coupled reliable exchange of messages then you can use apache camel to implement the enterprise integration patterns for smart routing transformation orchestration working with other technologies and so forthshare improve this

fact esb solutions reach their own loose coupling and asynchronous communication capabilities just using the paradigm offered by the specific mom implementation therefore moms represent solutions for dataevents distribution at customized level of qo ss according to the specific vendor implementation instead esbs represent solutions providing capabilities to realize complex orchestrations in a soa scenario where we have multiple providers offering their services and multiple consumers interested in consuming the services offered by the first ones complex orchestrations imply communication between legacy systems everyone of these with its own data domain representation rules and services on specific data and its own communication paradigm one consumer interact with the esb using corba another one using ws and so on it is clear that esb represents a more complex architectural solution aimed to provide the abstraction of databus such as the electronic buses that everyone have in his own pc able to connect a plethora of service providers to a not well specified plethora of service consumers hiding heterogeneity in i data representation and ii communication sorry for the long post but the concepts are complex and it is very difficult to be effective and efficient in a short statementshare improve this answeredited feb 13 14 at 1058valentin despa155k 14 59 85answered may 14 11

messages from a messaging system such as something jmsbased or it could work with other types of message such as soapbased web services in that respect its more general than mo m disclaimer i am an

with web services in its true form provides application loose coupling by sending the data through one the elements of the message mom provides not only application loose coupling but process loose coupling along esb comes with additional features supporting governance centric approach both can be used independently or together depending upon the scenarioshare improve this answeranswered jan 26

orchestration with soa 10 tibco bizz talk one things does not stop the other really more importantly it is the semantics given to the messages exchanged in the system that play an important role in
