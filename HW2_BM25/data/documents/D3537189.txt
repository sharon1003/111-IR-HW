screening and prevention save print share actions amniocentesis authored by dr jacqueline payne 14 dec 2016this article is for medical professionals in this article genetic counselling indications for amniocentesis procedure diagnostic testing of amniotic fluid risks and complications of amniocentesis other diagnostic techniques amniocentesis is an invasive diagnostic antenatal test it involves taking a sample of amniotic fluid in order to examine fetal cells found in this fluid amniocentesis is usually reserved for those women considered at higher risk of carrying a fetus with a chromosomal or genetic abnormality the amniotic fluid extracted contains cells from the amnion and fetal skin lungs and urinary tract which can then undergo chromosomal genetic biochemical and molecular biological analysis annually about 5 of the pregnant population approximately 30000 women in the uk are offered an invasive prenatal diagnostic test usually either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling cvs  1 timing of amniocentesis  1 early between 12 and 14 6 weeks of gestation this is not recommended as it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and higher incidence of talipes midtrimester between 15 and 18 weeks of gestation this is the most common time for the procedure third trimester may be undertaken for late karyotyping and for detection of fetal infection in prelabour rupture of the membranes amniocentesis is an invasive test posing risk to fetus and mother it is therefore not used as a screening test genetic counselling genetic counselling should ideally be offered prior to any pregnancy when there is a family history of a condition which might be diagnosed either by amniocentesis or cvs it is clearly important to avoid unnecessary invasive testing in pregnancy where possible diagnostic testing should be provided within the context of informed consent and autonomy both about the conditions being tested and about the implications for the continuation of the pregnancy  2 pre and posttest genetic counselling are both indicated indications for amniocentesis it is important to remember that women choose whether or not to undergo amniocentesis the list of indications becomes shorter with good preconceptual genetic counselling and earlier recognition of increased risk which may make cvs a better option most common indications for amniocentesis are positive antenatal screening tests including for example combined test for trisomy abnormalities  3 abnormal fetal anomaly scan a previous child with chromosomal abnormalities any other congenital abnormality a history of parent carrying a balanced chromosomal translocation 1 in 410 chance of a fetus being affected risk of a recessively inherited metabolic disorder mother carrying an xlinked disorder to determine fetal sex analysis to detect specific conditions from dna if gene identified for example fragile x syndrome sickle cell disease cystic fibrosis enzymatic activity in amniocytes for example taysachs disease fluid biochemistry for example in congenital adrenal hyperplasia  17ohprogesterone amniocentesis is also used much later in pregnancy to test for lung maturity procedure most commonly performed at 1516 weeks of gestation informed written consent should be obtained rhesus immunoprophylaxis should be given where appropriate fetomaternal transfusion is a risk in amniocentesis and cvs it should be performed under continuous ultrasound guidance  1 a 22gauge spinal needle is inserted through the maternal abdominal and uterine walls into the pocket of amniotic fluid within the amniotic sac1020 ml of fluid are aspirated or approximately 1 ml per week of gestation a cell filtration system may be used smaller volumes may be aspirated where advanced laboratory techniques require less material if results are abnormal and the patient wishes it termination of the pregnancy can be carried out at 1820 weeks diagnostic testing of amniotic fluid it is useful to know what is offered locally as there is some variation between laboratories the following tests can be performed on the amniotic fluid afp and acetylcholinesterase levels for neural tube defects bilirubin levels for gestational assessment and to detect isoimmune haemolysis tests of lung maturity various  for example lecithintosphingomyelin ratio enzyme analysis many and varied including for inborn errors of metabolism on fetal cells extracted from amniotic fluid testing for genetic and chromosomal disorders rapid testing results in 2448 hours  4 in most areas this will identify specifically downs syndrome trisomy 21 edwards syndrome trisomy 18 pataus syndrome trisomy 13 turner syndrome klinefelters syndrome other sex chromosome anomalies chromosome analysis after cell culture results take about two weeks this will give full karyotyping but even this will not identify all chromosomal abnormalities other possible tests on fetal cells appropriate genetic counselling may preclude the need direct dna analysis techniques for example for taysachs disease phenylketonuria duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis indirect dna analysis used for example to detect linkage disorders when the exact gene is not known patients should be advised of how and when results of testing will be available and this may vary according to the tests being done and the laboratory used risks and complications of amniocentesis discomfort uterine cramping vaginal bleeding about 2 amniotic fluid leakage about 17  5 maternal rhesus sensitisation in susceptible pregnancies also true for cvs amnionitis about 01 miscarriage risk  6 7 an increased risk of midtrimester miscarriage compared with the background risk has generally been quoted as about 051 a systematic review and metaanalysis which included only studies published since 2000 therefore reflecting current practice suggests the procedurerelated risks are much lower at 01 and may even simply reflect the pregnancy characteristics of the women concerned rather than the procedure itself the procedurerelated risk in twin pregnancies is higher than in singleton pregnancies and is about 1  8 failure of cell culture from 1 up to 5 if performed under 12 weeks of gestation very experienced surgeons more than100 procedures per year may have higher success rates and lower procedurerelated miscarriages  1 anxiety for parents due to lateness of diagnosis this may make decisions about termination of pregnancy very difficult the small risks associated with the procedure mean that some women who are clear that they would not wish to terminate an affected pregnancy choose not to have the test other diagnostic techniques cvs  9provides diagnosis in the first trimester is the technique of choice for invasive prenatal diagnosis before 15 weeks results are rapid there is less risk of pregnancy loss compared with early amniocentesis which is no longer recommended but a greater risk of pregnancy loss compared with midtrimester amniocentesis  5 cvs before 10 0 weeks of gestation is no longer performed due to an association with fetal defects limb reduction oromandibular defects  1 cvs is more technically demanding  10 see also separate chorionic villus sampling article any benefits of earlier diagnosis with cvs must be carefully balanced against the slightly greater risk of pregnancy loss compared with secondtrimester amniocentesis  5 there appears to be no significant difference in longterm health outcomes between children who had transcervical cvs or amniocentesis for prenatal testing  11 did you find this information useful further reading and references ogilvie c akolekar r pregnancy loss following amniocentesis or cvs samplingtime for a reassessment of risk j
