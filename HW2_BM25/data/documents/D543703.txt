of a footer how do i cut my anchor™ windsor stones® to finish my project start by measuring the size of the piece you will need to finish that row for cuts that are 12 of a stone you will notice that many of the stones you have purchased have a groove in the backside of the stone this is a built in stress point to help you split stones in half you start your cut by scoring the wall piece around all four sides with a heavyduty 3 inch masonry chisel and a hand sledgehammer then simply roll the stone onto its face with the back sticking up in the air then set the 3 inch masonry chisel into the groove and strike it with the sledge hammer and after a couple blows the stone should split in half for cuts that are smaller or larger than a 12 stone you will need to make your own stress point after measuring your cut size use the same measurement to mark your stone on the top bottom and back use your chisel to score the stone on all four sides then continue to work your chisel up and down your score line until the stone breaks why do i use landscape fabric behind my retaining wall the landscape fabric serves as a filter to keep small soil particles from working their way through the wall when moisture is present remember that any material used as a barrier behind your wall must allow moisture to come through so it can help prevent your wall from failing should i mortar the top row of my retaining wall to prevent kids from lifting or moving them we don’t recommend mortaring any of our wall products since these walls are designed to be motarless a good construction grade adhesive is recommended when you need to secure the top row to prevent kids from moving your wall pieces and is highly advised we have found that there are several concrete adhesives that work well and most adhesives can be applied with a caulk gun go to your local pavestone dealer and ask for a quality construction grade adhesive example md 400 what is the lip on the bottom of the anchor™ windsor stone® for the lip serves as a guide and interlock when stacking the wall pieces on top of each other the lip ensures that the wall will angle towards the material it is holding back thus creating a wall that is less likely to fail some wall systems use fiberglass pins that you insert into the wall pieces this serves as a guide as well but is much more time consuming and not very forgiving if you haven’t placed your wall pieces exactly right the pinless anchor system with the lip is much quicker and easier to install what are the advantages of having a anchor™ windsor stone®
