trolls susan wloszczyna november 4 2016  9print page tweet“ trolls” is a sugarshocked “ shrek ” an aggressively autotuned animated fun ride for easily distracted times imagine being trapped in a 3d bouncy castle while being pelted by glitter sparkles rainbows unicorns marshmallows and cupcakes as dayglo woodland creatures modeled on those smiley naked dolls with feral cottoncandy tresses that were a thing back in the ‘60s attempt to bliss you into submission yes it’s likely that most kids won’t notice that this bedazzled confection echoes a certain fairytaleskewering franchise built around a sullen green ogre that turned dream works the company also behind “ trolls” into a ‘toon superpower the switcheroo here is that there are not one but two miserable males who are rescued by their love interests while the ladies save the day advertisement the original “shrek” for all of its merciless mockery of a certain competitor’s legacy at least possessed a beating heart and an expansive soul as exhibited by its thennovel use of the melancholy ballad “hallelujah” in its tale of redemption “ trolls” meanwhile is a derivative madcap money machine that is all about ensuring that dream works which has had few hits other than sequels in recent years has a fresh pipeline of steady revenue all you have to do is sit through the end credits to see how many bodies were devoted to securing licensing deals targetcom alone lists 165 tiein products that said youngsters and more than a few adults probably won’t care that this visual simulation of mindlessly munching an entire bowl full of skittles and starbursts in one sitting is basically hollow inside even with its rather rote message that the power to be happy resides within us all we are but mere humans and it will be hard to resist the prefabricated pseudo charms of an escapist musical fantasia that invests most of its ingenuity into its insanely infectious soundtrack the oldies lean heavily on reimagined staples from every wedding reception held since the ‘80s “ september ” “i’m coming out” “total eclipse of the heart” “hello” “ true colors ” and even the brady bunch ditty “it’s a sunshine day”most of these beatheavy jams are made all the more catchy by being primarily sung to wormhole perfection by the film’s two melodicallyendowed lead voice actors anna kendrick in prime “ pitch perfect ” form and justin timberlake whose selfpenned “can’t stop the feeling” just might be the new “everything is awesome” in terms of being impossible not to suddenly hum for no reason days after leaving the theater but what about the plot you say well once upon a time—as shown scrapbookstyle with tactile felt cutouts—there was a race of teenytiny supercute trolls whose entire existence revolved around singing dancing and group hugs performed on the hour unfortunately their joyful existence is interrupted once every year by their sourpuss nemesis neighbors known as the bergens a warty tribe of giants with lousy posture wonky teeth and bad attitudes whose town seems bedecked in what only could be called sewage chic advertisement this gathering of grumps celebrate a holiday known as trollstice when they allow themselves to feel happy for one day by consuming sweettasting trolls yes we are talking cannibalism here but it is only threatened not seen one year king peppy  jeffrey tambor decides to fight back with the war cry “no troll left behind” and finds a way to allow his multihued subjects to flee to safety for two decades they have been left uneaten—until royal daughter poppy kendrick throws a loud rave party complete with fireworks branch timberlake the chicken little of trollhood who is so glum that he is the color of mud warns that the noise will draw the attention of their enemies and soon enough bergen villainess chef  christine baranski channeling carol burnett  descends upon the wee revelers and scoops up a handful to feed to king gristle  christopher mintzplasse  who has never felt happiness off poppy goes to save her friends batting away bizarre beasties on her journey and is soon joined by a reluctant branch oppositesattract tension ensues between the pair who eventually decide to recruit a bergen scullery maid named bridget who harbors a crush on the king to distract him enough so they can allow the other trolls to escape of course a beauty makeover occurs cinderellastyle—swoopy troll hair is involved—but one can only do so much with a bergen as bridget zooey deschanel gives the most engaging vocal performance and manages to add muchneeded pathos she bemoans the fact that she smells like gravy and comic energy to the proceedings as she vamps the selfcentered gristle of course love eventually conquers all but it can’t camouflage the fact that this narrative is so weak that it is not just secondary to the musical numbers but perhaps even tertiary considering the merchandising push behind this enterprise money as they say might not buy happiness but for just 2299 you can get a pink hoodie for the poppy in your life with troll hair attached just beware of hungry bergens popular blog posts“why do fireflies have to die so soon” a tribute to isao

• 1 year ago i dont know why anyone is surprised aside from how to train your dragon most of dreamworks movies consistently end with the latest pop song to get kids dancing or some random 70s hit to bump up the nostalgia factor mr movies • 1 year ago agreed i honestly hoped this film would flop so that dreamworks would crash fiscally this year they need to reevaluate themselves my5critters • 1 year ago visually this movie was made for kids and as a parent the music was a bonus since i had to sit through it and watch it with my granddaughter i wasnt looking for an exceptional or complex script or anything more than feelgood fluff since it is a childrens movie and i dont think any young kids will be writing a dissertation about it sarcasm its simple optimistic message was enough for any young kid to grasp i really enjoyed it and my granddaughter loves it that was enough for me christian peterson • 9 months ago you know the its a sunshine day song is im pretty sure combined with another really good song called move your feet by junior senior • 1 year ago this movie is not about me if so it would be four starsunion of the sun • 1 year agocannibalism even on animation is not cute  funny i can not believe during the making of this film no one ever raise a question eating trolls alive is ideal for kids to watch  the first 10 minutes of this film in a 12 empty theater almost every kids 5 and under are crying  and screaming  becuase their favorite blind bag character are gonna get eaten alive wow  this is by far to most unwatchable kids movies of all time we only stay in the theater for no more than 15 minutes and i also see many parents left my5critters • 1 year ago versus disney killing off a parent in almost all of their flicks i do remember my fiveyearold crying
