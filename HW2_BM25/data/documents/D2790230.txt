using this driver along with a microsoft wireless gaming receiver to allow usage of the 360 controller on the mac i have successfully mapped 2 controllers to the 1 and 2 player control config but only the player 1 controller works the other does not work at all snes9x is able to handle both controllers discreetly so i can have pv p in street fighter but nestopia is having problems with my good ole nes games any ideas i searched before i posted30791  062607 0435 amre xbox 360 wireless controllers w nestopia  re dirtgopher dirtgopher member joined jun 2007 posts 3to put it more succinctly is anyone else having a problem getting 2 identical controllers recognized individually the wireless part is handled at the driver level and that works fine so i would imagine the controllers look just like usb devices to nestopia cmon show luigi some love he just stands there at lvl 11 until time runs out30795  062607 0449 amre xbox 360 wireless controllers w nestopia  re dirtgopher r belmont very

nestopia but my husband isnt says its the greatest emulator hes ever used we recently put our pc through ou home theatre system and now get to play nintendo games on 42 high def seems ironic with the available computing power we have we revert to the games of our youth we are running vista with no option to change to xp and we have exactly the same problem we can get the controllers recognized by the system we can even map for the second controller but when we try to use the second players controller it doesnt respond if you have any advice on how to get this to work itwould be appreciated39309  031208 1021 pmre xbox 360 wireless controllers w nestopia  re kazlady edversion 20member joined mar 2008 posts 1hey everyone new guy so this is my problem i downloaded nestopia and everything is running great the keyboard was a pain in the ass so i decided to get a wireless xbox 360 controller for the pc so i installed the drivers and all the patches and updates the computer detects the controller and responds to it whenever i push the x button in the middle of the controller so when i activate the emulator and the game and try to contol my game nothing happens it works great on the keyboard but not on the controller i try accessing my input controls on the emulator and it also detects it but nothing happens and yes i do have a wireless adapter for the controller which came with it i am running nestopia on a hp pavillion with windows vista home premium 32bit i really want to play these games someone help me should i just get a cheap logitech controller 39400

external keyboard emulation software so at least you can play your games for now at least until the real solution is found40304  041608 0633 pmre xbox 360 wireless controllers w nestopia  re gy romite joebells member joined apr 2008 posts 5welp i personally am able to use two wireless xbox360 controllers with my vista x64 pc setup in our living room as a media center i am having a problem that it erases my controller config if i happen to turn it on without a controller turned on is that happening to some of you are you turning it on sometimes with only one controller turned on and so its erasing the seconds config when you are setting the config kazlady are you making sure to choose the second xbox 360 wireless controller from the little pull down menu on the upper right part of the input config screen it should say joy1 for player 2 when you configure it and player one of course should say joy0 and unfortunately xpadder does not work with the wireless 360 controllers there is a japanese driver with an english translation that will make it appear that the controller is always plugged in and it will give alot more config options but it makes it a one controller per wireless gaming reciever setup so if you wanted to use two controllers you would have to have two wireless gaming recievers40312  041608 1109 pmre xbox 360 wireless controllers w nestopia  re joebells gy

issues though really nothing should be required but microsofts driver as it works ok for me here with two controllers i really hate having more stuff running than necessary and xpadder is a bit flaky for sure white screens believe he fixed that and multiple controllers showing up and suchlast edited by joebells 041708 1227 am  hop to
