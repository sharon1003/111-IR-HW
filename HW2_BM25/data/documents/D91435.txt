credits glossary introduction when one thinks about the state of maine lobsters come to mind historically this resource has dominated the ranks as maine’s most valuable commercial fishery in the year 2008 alone preliminary finds show over 69700000 pounds were harvested in the state at a value of over 244000000 the maine department of marine resources dmr is the state agency authorized to address matters concerning the lobster industry and other fisheries associated with maine’s coastal resources its mission is to conserve and develop marine and estuarine resources to conduct and sponsor scientific research to promote and develop the maine coastal fishing industries to advise and cooperate with local state and federal officials concerning activities in coastal waters and to implement administer and enforce the laws and regulations for these enumerated purposes this web page provides information about the history of lobstering the biology of the lobster conservation practices and laws and rules pertaining to the fishery in the state of maine a written test for residents interested in acquiring a noncommercial lobstercrab harvesting license can be obtained by contacting the following department of marine resources licensing division 21 state house station augusta me 043330021 207 6246550 or the dmr license application page under other forms the answer sheet to the test

americans used them to fertilize their fields and to bait their hooks for fishing the first official maine lobster landings were reported by james rosier a member of captain george weymouth’s crew in an account of a voyage to maine in 1605 rosier wrote “and towards night we drew with a small net of twenty fathoms very nigh the shore we got about thirty very good and great lobsters…which i omit not to report because it sheweth how great a profit fishing would be…”in a sense the maine lobster fishery began with rosier’s account and it is therefore probably the oldest continuously operated industry on the north american continent actual development of the fishery of course did not take place until many years later in colonial times lobsters were considered “poverty food” they were harvested by hand along the shoreline and served to prisoners and indentured servants who exchanged their passage to america for seven years of service to their sponsors in massachusetts some of the servants finally rebelled they had their contracts state that they would not be forced to eat lobster more than three times a week it is not entirely clear when maine lobsters were first marketed the commercial importance of the fishery in supplying outofstate markets did not come about until after 1840 massachusetts dealers began looking to maine lobster grounds for a continuing supply of the species a demand for fresh lobsters in the large marketing areas of new york and boston was a strong incentive for fishermen to specialize in these crustaceans it is believed that the primary factor which resulted in the exploitation of the lobster resource was the sudden success of the canning industry the spreading fame of maine lobsters and the lack of adequate facilities for distribution of fresh product were the factors that stimulated the beginning of the canning industry in 1840 during the early years of this new industry lobsters were brought by smacks sailing vessels with live wells to the eastport cannery from the western part of the state before long the success of the new venture led to the construction of 23 factories scattered along the coast as far west as portland the canneries were so efficient at processing that they were soon forced to work with smaller lobsters in 1860 james p baxter recalled that four to five pound lobsters were considered small and two pound lobsters were being discarded as not worth the effort to pick the meat for canning only 20 years later the canneries were stuffing meat from halfpound lobsters into the tins for processing a sign that the fishery had been exploited by 1880 the canning industry made obvious the need for conservation and law enforcement if the fishery was to survive following the collapse of the canning industry the fresh lobster industry took over the commercialization of the fishery the first lobster pound appeared on vinalhaven in 1875 and others quickly followed originally in deep tidal creeks today they are more common on docks floating in the harbor using the pound dealers could wait for the price of lobster to increase or allow a newly molted lobster time to harden its shell these live storage facilities became the backbone of the modern lobster industry by the 1930’s the traveling smackmen were being replaced by local land based buyers who served as the link between the harvesters and the public the buyer purchased lobsters from a harvester who in turn bought fuel bait and other gear from the buyer the local buyer then either sold the lobsters to people who came down to the docks or turned them over to a regional dealer who sent the lobsters out of state tidal pounds and other holding devices have made possible the development and maintenance of more stable marketing conditions records of annual harvest and the value of the catch to the state’s fishermen have been kept with varying degrees of regularity since 1880 more accurate and detailed records have been compiled annually since 1939 throughout the 1990’s there have been significant record high landings more information on maine lobster landings data the biology of the lobster the american lobster homarus americanus is one of about 30 species of clawed lobsters found in the world’s oceans characterized by its large claws it is the only clawed lobster found in the northwestern atlantic a relatively shallow species it ranges from labrador to north carolina with the largest concentrations found in the shoal waters off maine and the canadian maritimes the lobster is one of the many tenlegged crustaceans found in the ocean an animal without a backbone it is protected by an external skeleton composed of a flexible material called chitin this exoskeleton is a restrictive structure that must be shed before the animal can grow therefore a lobster’s life is a series of molts regulated by a variety of other factors since lobsters are bottom dwellers at depths where light may be of low intensity color may or may not constitute camouflage the familiar dark greenishblacks are most common but mixed colors calicos blues reds yellows and even albinos exist the unusual colored lobsters are genetic mutations when any of these lobsters are cooked the pigment is altered by the heat to produce the familiar red color the lobster’s body consists of two parts the joined head and thorax often called the body and the jointed abdomen or tail two compound eyes at the ends of short flexible stalks are located on either side of the sharp bony projection called the rostrum also attached to the head are two pairs of antennae a short twobranched pair used in the chemical location of food and a long whip like pair used in touch and orientation the lobster uses its claws in the feeding process with the crusher claw being the larger of the two appendages near the mouth called maxillipeds direct the food to the jaws the food passes from the mouth to the threechambered stomach by a short esophagus in the midchamber the gastric mill a set of chitinous teeth grinds the food in the posterior chamber juices from the digestive gland often called tomalley start digestion the food is absorbed by the digestive gland and distributed throughout the body by means of the blood undigested food passes through the intestine located down the tail and exits via the anus liquid waste material is extracted from the blood by the antennal glands and excreted through openings at the base of each second antenna the gills are enclosed by the curving edges of the carapace in a cavity called the gill chamber twenty pairs of gills have numerous filaments arranged around a central axis somewhat like a bottle brush the blood flows past these filaments on the inside and sea water passes by the filaments on the outside allowing the exchange of gases water enters the gill chamber from the back and leaves from the front movement through the chamber is the result of the constant beating of the second maxilla called the gill bailer every few minutes the gill bailer reverses its beat for a few strokes to wash the silt or other debris from the gills this process maintains the gills at peak operating efficiency lobsters may take five to eight years to reach sexual maturity the female sex organs called the ovaries or “coral” are two cylindrical rods traversing from the middle of the body to the tail the openings from the ovaries to the outside are located on the basal segment of the third walking legs the female has a seminal receptacle on the ventral surface near the junction of the thorax and abdomen which stores viable sperm up to two years after mating lobsters mate seasonally generally just after the female molts the female releases a continuous stream of eggs from the oviduct openings as the eggs pass the seminal receptacle they are fertilized covered with a gluelike substance they stick to each other and the swimmerets the female protects her eggs from predators keeps them clean and oxygenates them for nine to eleven months when the eggs are ready to hatch the female walks into the current unfurls her tail and vigorously waves her swimmerets which releases the freeswimming larvae into the water she releases them a batch at a time a practice that increases their chances for survival the lobster larvae are free swimmers but are distributed by the water currents they rise to the surface and actively seek their food from plankton during this freeswimming period which lasts from 15 to 25 days the lobsters are prey to many animals including their own kind the newly hatched lobsters do not resemble the adult lobster they are about 8 mm long with large eyes and no claws over a period of a few weeks the larvae molt three times changing in size and structure until they look like miniature adults as stage iv post larvae they settle to the ocean floor and become bottom dwellers the lobster molts about seven times the first year then at a slower rate from that point on from first stage larvae to adult legal size the lobster has molted between 25 to 27 times it is estimated that a onepound lobster may be five to seven years of age with each molt a legal sized lobster may increase in carapace length by 14 and gain 4050 in weight the record for the largest documented lobster goes to one taken off nova scotia in 1977 it weighed 44 pounds six ounces and may have been 100 years old one of the most remarkable phenomena of the lobster is reflex amputation it will throw off an appendage when stimulated by shock fear or injury in this way it sometimes does itself serious injury to escape a worse fate however it has the power to regenerate or grow back a new appendage a lost claw walking leg or antenna will increase in size with each successive molt more information on lobster biology maine lobster management marine resources have always been a traditional part of maine’s culture from fishing for cod back in the 1800’s to new species such as urchins and sea cucumbers many generations of mainers have derived their income from the sea an estimated 73 species of fish 26 species of whales porpoises seals and 1600 different bottomdwelling organisms reside in the gulf of maine there are currently over 70 marine species being harvested commercially the department of marine resources is required by maine law to manage these and all emerging fisheries the management of the lobster resource is in transition the federal sustainable fisheries act passed in 1996 identified the resource as being overfished and mandated the rebuilding of the fishery this requirement has driven numerous discussions at the national marine fisheries service nmfs the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc the maine lobster advisory council lac and the maine lobster zone councils in 1997 the asmfc began the implementation of an interstate conservation plan for rebuilding the lobster stock the maine legislature responding to lac recommendations implemented methods to limit entry by zone into the lobster fishery these measures will define how the industry will look in the future the goal of the asmfc is to maintain a healthy lobster resource by restoring egg production atlantic coast wide requirements include prohibition on possession of berried lobsters prohibition on possession of lobster parts prohibition on possession of vnotched female lobsters requirement for biodegradable panels requirement for a minimum gauge size limitation on landings by fishermen using gear or methods other than traps required permitting and trap tagging required escape vents and a maximum trap size in addition commercial lobstermen are limited to a maximum of 800 traps per vessel prohibited from possession of a lobster greater than 5” carapace length required to vnotch all egg bearing female lobsters and required to maintain a zero tolerance definition of vnotching these conservation measures are strongly endorsed by the state of maine and its commercial lobstermen more information on lobster management noncommercial lobstercrab harvesters in 1996 the state of maine passed a law allowing its residents a lobstercrab license for recreational purposes traditionally lobster fishing in maine was strictly a commercial endeavor so with this privilege comes a level of responsibility on the part of the license holder remember that lobstering is a heavily regulated fishery and that the laws and rules that apply to commercial harvesters apply to the noncommercial lobstermen as well due to the increase of noncommercial licenses from 207 in 1997 to 2109 in 2002 the lobster advisory council requested that a training program be developed for noncommercial harvesters in 2002 a law was passed

hour before sunrise between june 1st and october 31st it is unlawful to haul lobster gear after 400 pm eastern daylight savings time saturday until ½ hour before sunrise the following monday morning from june 1st to august 31st both days inclusive lobster measurement title 12 section 6431lobsters must be measured with a special doublesided gauge to make sure that they are “keepers” you may purchase a gauge from your local fishing supply store a legal lobster in the state of maine has a carapace or body shell length that measures between 3 ¼ inches and 5 inches the measurement is made between the extreme rear of the eye socket to the end of the carapace minimum lobster size has a carapace or body shell length of 3 ¼ inches maximum lobster size has a carapace or body shell length of 5 inches lobsters are measured from the extreme rear of the eye socket along a line parallel to the center line of the body shell to the rear end of the body shell in order to be a “keeper” this length must be at least 3 ¼ inches but no longer than 5 inches lobster measurement is determined by the state of maines doublesided gauge note a common error made by novice lobstermen is to measure over the horn or rostrum located above the eye socket make certain that your measure is in the extreme rear of the eye socket and below the horn exception no violation shall occur if the illegal lobster is immediately liberated alive into the coastal waters penalty for oversized or undersized lobsters a fine of 500 for each violation and in addition a fine of 100 for each lobster involved up to and including the first 5 and a fine of 200 for each lobster in excess of 5 or if the number of lobsters cannot be determined a fine of not less than 1000 or more than 5000 a court may not suspend a fine imposed under this section mutilation it shall be unlawful to possess any lobster or part thereof which is mutilated in a manner which makes accurate measurement impossible bait title 12 section 6432ait is unlawful to use offal bait to fish for or take lobsters or crabs offal means the carcass waste parts renderings or remains of a wild or domesticated animal that is not a marine organism but does not include animal hide from which the hair has been removed note the possession of offal while fishing for or taking lobster or crabs is a violation of this section molesting lobster gear title 12 section 6434 rule 2505it is unlawful for anyone except the licensed owner or a marine patrol officer to raise lift transfer possess or in any manner molest any lobster trap warp buoy or lobster car an adjudication under this section carries a mandatory three 3 years loss of license note a lobster trap car buoy or warp may be moved or removed from the waters or shores of the state for the purpose of returning the lobster gear to the licensed owner or properly disposing of lobster gear by any person who has written permission from a marine patrol officer any person who wants to obtain written permission to remove the above described gear must contact the department in advance of removal this includes all gear that has washed ashore and is seemingly abandoned underwater storage title 12 section 6443any trap or other container used for storing lobsters beneath the surface of the coastal waters must be clearly marked with the fishing license number of the person storing the lobsters any trap or other container and the contents within found in violation of this section may be seized and the contents returned to their natural habitat egg bearing lobsters title 12 section 6436when a female lobster releases her eggs they are glued to the swimmerets under her tail the number of eggs carried by a female varies with her size the smallest mature lobster in maine will produce about 6000 eggs while the largest will produce about 100000 eggs the female lobster protects and oxygenates her eggs for nine to eleven months before they hatch out as larvae the thousands of eggs under her tail resemble berries which is why a lobster with eggs is often referred to as a berried female scientists estimate that only 110th of the 1 of eggs that hatch will survive to minimal legal size it is against the law to take transport sell or possess any lobster that is bearing eggs carried under the tail penalty for possessing an egg bearing lobster is 1000 for each violation and in addition a fine of 200 for each lobster involved up to and including the first 5 in excess of 5 a fine of 400 for each lobster or if the number of lobsters cannot be determined a fine of not less than 2500 or more than 10000 there is no violation if a berried female is immediately liberated into coastal waters it is illegal to remove the eggs from a berried female the penalty for removing eggs from a female lobster is 1000 for each violation and in addition a fine of 300 for each lobster involved or if the number cannot be determined a fine of not less than 1000 or more than 5000 title 12 section 6438a subsection 2 determining the sex of a lobster in order to determine the sex of a lobster you must look at the first pair of appendages under the tail called swimmerets they are positioned near the base of the last pair of walking legs the first pair of swimmerets are hard in the male and soft and feathery in the female vnotched lobsters title 12 section 6436 rule 2515all lobstermen in the state of maine participate in a mandatory vnotch program requiring them to notch all eggbearing lobster prior to liberation the practice of notching a known “breeder” extends her protection beyond the hatching of her eggs while viewing the top side the flipper immediately to the right of the center one is subject to be notched should the female lobster be carrying eggs a vnotch tool or a sharp knife is used to remove a onequarter 14 inch deep portion from the center of the flipper this vnotch will remain through the next few molts allowing her to reproduce for several years to come if the vnotch grows out it should be vnotched again to the onequarter 14 inch size to maintain the protection of this breeder a natural occurrence may also cause mutilation to a female’s right flipper which also makes her illegal to possess a female lobster marked with a vnotch in the right flipper next to the middle flipper is illegal to possess the correct flipper is determined when the underside of the lobster is down and the tail is toward the person making the determination it is illegal to possess a female lobster mutilated in a manner which could hide or obliterate a vnotch including that missing flipper no violation is charged if a vnotchedmutilated female lobster is immediately liberated into our coastal waters the penalty for a v notchedmutilated female is 500 for each violation and in addition a fine of 100 or each lobster involved up to and including the first 5 and a fine of 400 for each lobster in excess of 5 or if the number of lobsters cannot be determined a fine of not less than 1000 or more then 5000 a court may not suspend a fine imposed under this subsection trap construction lobster traps are also known locally as “pots” the material used for construction has changed over the years but the basic compartmented design continues to attract and catch lobsters today most lobster traps used in maine’s fishery are constructed of plastic coated wire they usually have two funneled openings called “heads” through which lobsters enter the first compartment commonly called the “kitchen” after feeding lobsters may venture through the inner funnel or parlor head into the compartment called the “parlor” escape vent title 12 section 6433 rule 2585it is against the law to fish for or take lobsters unless the lobster trap is equipped with unobstructed vents or gaps in the parlor section there are two types of plastic vents used in wire traps rectangular and circular rectangular vent this vent has an opening of 1 1516 inches by 5 ¾ inches the vent can be placed near the bottom of the trap with the vent opening no higher than one row of mesh from the bottom the vent can also be placed on top of the parlor section but must be over the parlor head circular vent this vent has two circular openings 2 716 inches in diameter and commonly referred to as “crab vents” circular vents can only be used in a trap when the vent is placed in the trap horizontally not vertically one above the other circular vents can be put in the parlor section of the trap along the bottom edge or on the top of the parlor section but must be over the parlor head if you have wooden traps you must have an opening of 1 1516 inches along the bottom edge which can be accomplished by separating the laths of the parlor section or over the head of the parlor section biodegradable escape panel title 12 section 6433a rule 2580biodegradable escape panel all lobster traps must be equipped with a biodegradable ghost panel a “ghost panel” is a panel which is designed to release lobsters from traps which are lost while fishing often times the ghost panel and escape vent are combined into one unit this can be accomplished by using ferrous metal hog rings 332” in diameter or less to hold the plastic escape vent in place instead of stainless steel hog rings just be sure that enough of the trap wire is cut out behind the escape vent to meet the required opening of 3 ¾” by 3 ¾” for a ghost panel by providing a large opening when the hog rings dissolve the trap does not continue to retain lobsters it if is lost at the bottom of the sea every lobster trap must have an unobstructed ghost panel located near the bottom edge of the parlor section either on the sides at the end or on the top if the ghost panel is placed directly over the head other than ferrous metal hog rings ghost panels may be attached using untreated natural material such as cotton hemp sisal jute twine not exceeding 316 of an inch in diameter or soft wood lath any material may be used as a panel if it is held in place by any of the materials listed above in section 1 panels must be constructed in such a manner as to create an unobstructed opening of at least 3 ¾” by 3 ¾” or in a wooden trap an unobstructed opening at least 3 inches wide along the entire length or height of the parlor section when the panel is removed or opened tagged traps title 12 section 6431b rule 2508tagged traps all lobster traps both commercial and noncommercial must have current state issued tags installed in them to be fished or transported by vessel the tags must be purchased from the department of marine resources and replaced yearly new tags must be installed by june 1st of each year the tags are required to be securely attached to the bridge of the trap in a manner for which the tag was designed the lobster trap tag shall be placed in the trap to be clearly visible for inspection by a marine patrol officer no person shall fish with lift haul raise or transport any lobster trap with a tag which has been tampered with or where the tag number is illegible or missing note trap tags issued to noncommercial lobstercrab harvesting license holders do not display the lobstercrab license number and therefore do not fulfill this requirement the license number needs to be added to the trap if a tag is lost or broken it must be replaced contact your local marine patrol officer or dmr headquarters for replacement tags trap runners title 12 section 6433btrap runners a lobster trap must have a device attached to the trap that is designed to prevent damage to the lobster’s claws if stick runners are used the runners may be made out of any material the runners must be at least ¼ inch thick and a minimum of two runners must be attached to the lobster trap placed on opposite sides of the bottom of the trap if a second layer of material is used in lieu of stick runners the material must be layered in a manner that creates a mesh size smaller than the base trap mesh when attached to the bottom of the trap if a device other than the ones identified in the above sections is used it must be designed to minimize damage to the lobster’s claws and must be approved by the commissioner of the department of marine resources federal  state whale gear modification required for all traps in maine coastal waters rule chapter 7501  7502 protected resources in addition to lobster conservation the marine mammal protection act and endangered species act provide conservation and protection of marine mammals and turtles the atlantic large whale take reduction plan alwtrp has been developed to reduce to a rate approaching zero fishing gear entanglements that cause serious injury or mortality to all large whales the state of maine is fully committed to the protection of the atlantic large whales while at the same time protecting the economic and operational realities of our state’s fisheries the department of marine resources has implemented a state take reduction plan which is composed of two primary components a sightingssurveillance network and a disentanglement network the alwtrp mandates whale safe modifications for all lobster gear the universal requirements are no line floating at the surface no wet storage of gear over 30 days and encouragement of knotfree buoy lines all persons who fish lobster gear in maine’s coastal waters from the head of tide to the exemption line shall comply with one of the following alwtrp options all buoys must be attached to the buoy lines with a weak link having a breaking strength no greater than 600 poundsall buoy lines must be made entirely of sinking line or all ground lines must be made entirely of sinking line note weak links may include swivels plastic weak links rope of the appropriate strength hog rings rope stapled to a buoy stick or devices approved in writing by the national marine fisheries service nmfs in addition the weak link must be designed so that the bitter end of the buoy line is clean and free of knots when the weak link breaks examples and pictures of weak links and other information about the alwtrp are available at

responsible to see that said craft is equipped as specified in the rule nothing in this rule shall be construed to permit the operation of any watercraft on the federal waters in maine unless they conform to all applicable federal laws and rules pertaining thereto personal flotation devices pfdall personal flotation devices types i ii or iii used aboard watercraft shall be coast guard approved clearly labeled or imprinted as such placed so as to be readily accessible in the craft maintained in good serviceable condition and of an appropriate size for whom the person it is intended devices designed to be thrown type iv shall be immediately available on said craft devices which use kapok or fibrous glass for flotation material must have such material encased in plastic covers the purpose of a personal flotation device commonly referred to as a life jacket is to provide additional buoyancy to help you float buoyancy is the force required to keep you afloat with your head and chin above water this force is expressed in pounds several factors affect the amount of buoyancy that a person may need to float these include size weight lung size age percent of body fat and a person’s physical condition because of these varying factors it is best to try your personal floatation device in the water before an actual emergency occurs to ensure that it will keep you afloat shown below are the different types of pfd’s type i this is the easiest pfd to pull on in an emergency and is designed for extended survival in rough open water it usually will turn an unconscious person faceup and has 22 pounds of buoyancy this is the best pfd to keep you afloat in remote regions where rescue may be slow in coming type ii this “classic” pfd comes in several sizes for adults and children and is for calm inland water where there is a chance of fast rescue it is less bulky and less expensive than a type i pfd and may turn an unconscious person faceup in the water it has 155 pounds of buoyancy type iii these life jackets are generally considered the most comfortable with styles for different boating activities and sports they are for use in calm water where there is good chance of a fast rescue since they will generally not turn an unconscious person faceup flotation aids come in many sizes and have a minimum buoyancy of 155 pounds type iv these are designed to be thrown to a person in the water throwable devices include boat cushions ring buoys and horseshoe buoys they are not designed to be worn and should be supplemented by a pfd it is important to keep these devices easily accessible for emergencies they should not be used for small children nonswimmers or unconscious people type v special use device is intended for specific activities and may be carried instead
