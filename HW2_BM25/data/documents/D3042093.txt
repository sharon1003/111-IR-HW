naming young drivers on their parents insurance policy insuring your first car may seem an impossibly expensive task so its understandable that many young drivers consider being a named driver on their parents car insurance at first heres some helpful information to explain this option and to clarify when a new driver should get a policy in their own name were often asked questions like can and should i get cover on my parents insurance policy would it be cheaper do you get a no claims bonus as a named driver can learner drivers be covered on their parents insurance policy can i drive my parents car on a provisional licence what would it cost to add a provisional licenceholder to my parents insurance when should i get an insurance policy in my own name annoyingly the answer to most of these questions is  it depends on your circumstances in the right circumstances its perfectly ok to be insured as a named driver on your parents policy and you could save money in the short term but there are several reasons why its not always a good idea and in some cases you might even be breaking the lawget an online quote when its ok to be covered by your parents insurance regardless of whether you still have a provisional driving licence or youve recently passed your test your parents insurance company might agree to add you to their policy if you are only an occasional driver ie your parents are the main drivers but you have their permission to drive the car sometimes and your parents are the registered keeper of the vehicle ie dvla records show that your parents own the carthe insurance company will charge an additional premium to add you as a named driver to your parents policy all insurers calculate premiums slightly differently so we cant say exactly how much it will be your parents might ask you to pay this extra premium but in the shortterm this is probably a cheaper option than taking out your own insurance policy disadvantages of piggybacking your parents insurance youre not earning a no claims bonus while youre just a named driver on someone elses policy though some insurers will give an introductory discount if youve been a named driver we explain the whole no claims bonus system here if youre interested while the first years premium might seem high after just one year with no claims the discount youve earned will make your own policy much more affordable and that discount just keeps getting bigger over the next few years it seems like a nobrainer to bite the bullet and start earning that discount  youve got to do it one day right the car must belong to one of your parents and they must be the main driver for the insurance policy to legally be in their name if you own the car and you are the main driver youre breaking the law if the policy is not in your own name  this is called called  fronting  car insurance and the law  illegal frontingparents have to tread a fine line if theyre trying to help their children get cheaper insurance if they take out a policy in their own name naming the child as an additional driver or they add their child to their existing policy they are breaking the law if their son or daughter is actually the main driver of the vehicle premiums are calculated largely on the risk presented by the policyholder so pretending that an experienced parent is a more regular driver of the car than their inexperienced child is fraudulent this practice is called “ fronting ” but many parents and young drivers are unaware that its illegal such situations often come to light when a claim is submitted but far from settling the claim the insurance policy might be cancelled the young man or woman could also find themselves in court charged with driving without valid insurance and facing a stiff penalty when you should get a policy in your own name as a rule of thumb if you are the owner of a vehicle or drive it more regularly than anybody else in all likelihood you ought to be the policyholder too do you get no claims bonus as a named driver only the policyholder can earn the full rate of no claims bonus so until a young driver has an insurance policy in their own name they wont build up the usual no claims bonus however when you are ready to buy your own policy some insurers will give an introductory discount if youve been a named driver on another policy subject to proof of no claims building up your no claims discount in a policy of your own is the fastest way to reduce your insurance premium provisional drivers insurance you don’t need a full driving license in order to take out insurance in your own name you can take out your own insurance policy even on a provisional license and it’s particularly recommended that you do so if the car you are learning to drive in is owned or driven solely by you it’s common for parents to add their son or daughter to their own insurance as a named driver while they are still learning to drive but the same legal situation prevails here as mentioned before if the child is actually the main driver of the vehicle both parent and child could find themselves in legal hot water the shortterm gain of a lower insurance premium isnt worth the risk the cost of insurance for a young driver on a provisional license may not be too much different to that for a driver having just passed their driving test with the same ability to start building up their no claims bonus immediately it makes sense in the long run if you have a provisional driving license get an online quote here other useful information can i
