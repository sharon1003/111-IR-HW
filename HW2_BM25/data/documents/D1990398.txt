what is metaphysics traditionally the word metaphysics comes to us from ancient greece where it was a combination of two words – meta meaning over and beyond – and physics thus the combination means over and beyond physics in the definition found in most dictionaries metaphysics is referred to as a branch of philosophy that deals with first cause and the nature of being it is taught as a branch of philosophy in most academic universities under the label of “speculative philosophy”in today’s world however the word metaphysics has become a description of many fields of interest when one expresses an interest in metaphysics that interest may be in any one or a combination of the following subjects philosophy religion parapsychology mysticism yoga esp dreams jungian psychology transpersonal and theocentric psychology astrology meditation selfhelp studies positive thinking life after death transcendentalism mysticism reincarnation the common denominator of these and all similar subjects of course deals with an exploration of reality and in the idealistic sense how such knowledge may benefit human life on this earth both individually and collectively if then this is the aim of such interests it is why most professional metaphysical practitioners regard metaphysics as a spiritual philosophy or way of life all but a very few practitioners in metaphysics today have a pivotal point of some sort of spiritual philosophy in whatever system or teaching of metaphysics they are engaged it is important to understand this especially when reviewing the legal technicalities of being in metaphysics professionally if we were to travel from one metaphysical teacher or organization to another we would find people engaging in different things all under the label of metaphysics this could be a wide range such as yogis mystics astrologers positive thinking teachers meditation teachers spiritual healers graphoanalysts selfhelp teachers counselors coaches and so on the range is wide but again the basic denominator is the search for truth purpose and meaning in life which cannot be isolated from basic spiritual questions all of these fields therefore are regarded as part of metaphysics by the university of metaphysics and the university of sedona in regard to its doctoral degree and to its other programs and affiliations with its students and graduates it is not the position of the universities or its parent body the international metaphysical ministry to take one phase of study over another as it is the belief of the universities that there are many paths humans may travel on the way to finding truth there is an old proverb which states “no matter what path a human may travel it is my path no matter where they walk it leads to me”in a more absolute sense we like to think of metaphysics as dealing with the basic questions of life such as the relationship of man mind and the universe which leads to answers to the ageold questions of anyone who has truly paused to reflect on life by asking the most fundamental questions of all – “who am i what am i where have i been and where am i going”new thought a metaphysically oriented movement because of a commonly shared spiritual philosophy held by unity religious science and many independents the term new thought was adopted to denote a religious movement the basic premise was that everything is one vast universal mind the human mind and body included by fostering the thought of healing in the human mindbody the god part of the mind could affect a healing this is a holistic approach characterized by the synthesis of body mind and spirit as well as the integration of the spiritual philosophical and metaphysical this theory has led to the success of such spiritual movements as unity and religious science and has stimulated the birth of many independent teaching centers and churches along metaphysical lines our universities the university of metaphysics the university of sedona and the international metaphysical ministry imm regard all of these practitioners and fields as being in relation to its curricula degrees and affiliations with its students and graduates it is not the position of either university or its parent body the international metaphysical ministry to favor one phase of the study of metaphysics over another it is our belief that there are many paths humans may travel on the way to finding truth purpose and meaning in life universal intelligence being the creator of all things thus lives and exists in all things which can be thought of as the existence of an ultimate unity unity symbolizes love and love is the spirit of universal intelligence or god—dr paul leon masters
