the 3d fingerprinting companylearn more the future of fingerprinting flash scan3d was founded on the idea that the future of fingerprinting extends today’s technologies into the 3rd dimension it is our belief that not only do future acquisition techniques acquire data in three dimensions but the matching algorithms of the future also reside in the 3rd dimension taking matching to the 3rd dimension allows for more information per minutia point as well as the possibility for new minutia features the company the companyflash scan3d is continuing to explore the applications of the technology with a multitude of research partners in the following fields biometrics• 3d fingerprint acquisition • presentation attack detection pad • 3d matching forensics• 3d digital latent print collection • 3d postmortem fingerprinting • 3d impression evidence the technology structured light illumination sli is one of the most accurate noncontact surface scanning methods it is a commonly used method in scientific and industrial applications because of its high degree of accuracy speed and scalability to different object sizes flash scan3d was the first to adopt this technology for the commercial application of 3d fingerprinting and is the only company using the 3d ridge information acquired by the sli technique for extraction of a backward compatible 2d fingerprint the benefits the benefits3d3d data provides the most accurate representation of a true fingerprint without 3d data a to scale quality 2d contact print equivalent cannot be produced all 3d imaging techniques share the characteristic that scale is inherent in the acquired data 2d contactless imaging techniques can only estimate scale yet will never acquire the true curvature or surface of the finger being scanned contactless contactless systems show promise for reducing failure to acquire rates far during fingerprint enrollment since fingerprint condition – wet dry and worn prints – do not affect the acquisition process no contact with a platen also leads to a more consistent print since the variable of pressure is removed additionally a reduction in maintenance from the need to clean the platen and sanitary benefits of a touchless system are inherent to contactless systems backward compatible there are millions of fingerprints in databases today that are in a 2d format that was acquired from legacy contact based techniques the device of the future not only needs to have advanced benefits compared to today’s technology but also needs to be interoperable with existing systems flash scan3d’s scanners get an accurate 3d surface map of the finger and ridges allowing for to scale transformations from 3d to 2d equivalent prints advanced padas the use of biometric systems continue to increase pad or presentation attack detection has become a growing interest for fingerprinting devices of the future by collecting 3d and 2d information over time as well as an active projection system inherent to the system design our system has knowledge of what a true fingerprint should look like from a textural 2d optical spectral structural 3d and temporal motion aspect want to learn more or get in touch with us email us
