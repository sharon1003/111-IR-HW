thor fire telescopic lantern rechargeable torch and charger review thor fire telescopic rechargeable lantern torch and charger as you guys know i adore the great outdoors and anything that makes the outdoors even more enjoyable is ok with me so when i was contacted by thor fire and asked if i would like to show you guys some handy gadgets i jumped at the chance today im showing the very clever thor fire camping led telescopic mini lantern that is also a torch and dynamo charger for your devices ive even added a video to show you how good this little gadget is packaging i kindly received a parcel with a few things to show you guys which are coming soon my courier was a little over enthusiastic at getting my parcel in the postbox so the packaging is a bit dented but its all undamaged in the box you get your thor fire lantern leaflet instructions and 2 cables one for charging via mains usb power if you have a power charger or usb straight from your pc the other female usb to hand crank charge a usb device thor fire lantern closed description the thor fire telescopic lantern is made of several types of abs plastic making it extremely light and portable at only 59oz i love the colorful orange which is synonymous with outdoor products so it makes it easier to find in your bag or rucksack it fits comfortably in the palm of your hand closed at only 84cm in diameter and 44cm in depth open it measures122cm high this amazing little gadget has a bundle of usestorch lantern usb charger conversation curiosity starter the science bit the high level light on both torch and lantern is 65 lumens the low level is 15 lumens but you can see how bright 15 lumens is on the video its plenty to see what your doing note the manual states 65 and 15 lumens but amazon states its 160 and 30 lumens i feel amazon maybe correct as its very bright compared to the 6515 lumens i will try to find out for you all lighting times approx it takes 4 hours to charge via usb high level will last approx 40 minutes low level 45 hours 1 minute of cranking gives 4 minutes of high level light 1 minute of cranking gives 11 minutes on low are you still with me the working principle the thor fire adopts the principle of cranking for power by 3 phase brushless alternator for power generation the power is then stored in the built in 300m ah37v lithium battery this is then used totally for the led light the top part of the lantern shows the torch with a magnifying circle to amplify the light to its best the side has the rubberized charging port and onoff button the underneath has 3 rubber feet and the dynamo cranking handle and the carry handle a brilliant design theyve thought of everything to cram into such a small space opened up it extends out to give you a comfortable cranking circle a clever addition is the cranking handle grip which spins as you turn saving tired wrists and pinky blisters i love companies who think of the little things the handle opens up to be used as a carry handle or hanger for inside a tent or on a tree or bush as seen in my video the most clever thing is that this compact portable torch opens out to a usable lantern that gives off the perfect amount of light for camping see my video simply but gently pull the halves apart to reveal a great size lantern you can see the clips that hold the 2 ends together when not in use or used as a torch charging next plug in the 35mm charging cable supplied and charge mine arrived half charged and was ready in a few hours it has a protector flap which protects from dust and damp so you really dont have to worry about this tough little lamp charging a usb device or phone so you find yourself in the middle of nowhere and yes you guessed it your phone dies and you need an emergency phone call but you have your thorfire lamp and emergency charger yayso get out the female usb cable and your own phone charger cable and connect them together it should look like this now start to crank the dynamo now the instructions say 3 circles a seconderwellthis maybe a bit difficult more like 12 circles a second unless your britains strongest man or woman of course or they happen to be tagging along with you in which case they could carry you to safety now you need to keep cranking for at least a few minutes until you see your phone with at least 2 to get your call you will also see the red led light up on the thor fire to say its charging this is best seen in my video now in all honesty this would kill my arm to keep this up so hopefully when or if i need an emergency phone charge that i have my other half with me but it does the job and afterall it could save a life note it also has a smart protection chip incase of over chargingclever little lampinteresting note it charges your device both backwards and forwards for all you lefties out there or if you just want to go backwards lantern and torch i have to say wow as the light is really bright on both the torch and the lantern you will see in my main video that i actually thought i had the torch and lantern on high yet it was still on low so my surprise is absolutely genuine i didnt realize that every time i turn off the thor fire it resets back to low each time but you have to think of how long you need to use your light as this lantern doesnt hold its charge as long on high here you can see the difference between hi and low torch settings i had placed the torch facing a bush over 14 feet away and you can see how the high beam lights up all the surrounding area lighting tests i just have to add my own lighting tests to this review for you guys the instructions say 40 mins on high after being charged via usb but on our test its managedwait for itdrumroll45 minutes on high where it dropped to low and lasted another 3 hours15 minutesamazing huhmore tests to come the thor fire camping rechargeable  hand crank led lanternflashlight review your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available

love with this lanterntorch the fact that during a powercutof which we get alot of out here i have guaranteed power for a light is just amazing and it gives us peace of mind its an ideal storm lantern to keep nearby when the weather turns we now make sure its always charged via usb and its kept to hand just incase but incase we forget i always have hand powererormy strong man power lol as a torch it really gives great light even on lowessentially you dont need to use high unless your desperate to find something low is plenty as you can see in my video the lamp gives fantastic ambient light perfect for tents or reading etc i have added the video as well as you need to see this clever lantern in action as me rambling on saying its got great illumination is all very well but sometimes you need to make up your own mind that its right for you once you open it out the corrugated plastic is strong and the whole lantern is splash proof and most certainly rain proof with its rubber power closure the lantern really gives amazing ambient light and the torch great direct light you have a 3 in 1 product torch lantern and charger im so impressed and i really have a thing for outdoor products too its rugged light portable and once collapsed down its easily thrown in your backpack or bag to take anywhere you barely know your carrying it ive dropped it a few times and its definitely
