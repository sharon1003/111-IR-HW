20while some use a much broader definition of what is considered eurodance 1 over time the term particularly came to refer to an nrgbased genre from the 1990s which included a solo vocalist or a rappervocalist duet 21 although the term was initially used to describe only european dance music productions there are some examples of acts from the 1990s produced in america which followed the same music style and became popular particularly in europe nowadays are also referred to as eurodance music 22 23characteristics of the music  editmost eurodance is characterized by synthesizer riffs one or more vocals with simple chorus one or more rap parts sampling and a strong beat 2 24 sometimes nonrap vocals are used 24eurodance often carries a positive upbeat attitude the lyrics usually involve issues of love and peace dancing and partying or expressing and overcoming difficult emotions the early to mid1990s eurodance vocals were frequently done by a solo vocalist or a mixed rappervocalist duet 24many groups used variations of the rappervocalist theme such as a german rapper with american singers  real mc coy  or the use of reggae rap as in ice mc and fun factory or scat singing as in scatman john 24 solo singing artists such as alexia haddaway lynda thomas tess corona whigfield double you and dj bo bo also contributed to the genre eurodance lyrics are almost always sung in english regardless of the artists nationalities 24almost all eurodance emphasizes percussion and rhythm the tempo is typically around 140 beats per minute but may vary from 110 to 150 24 25most eurodance is very melodydriven unlike most pop music which is usually written in major keys most eurodance songs are in minor keys similarly to techno this along with positive lyrics helps contribute to the overall powerful and emotional sound of eurodance 2 besides the contribution of the female or male vocals there is often a noticeable use of rapid synthesizer arpeggios 2popularity  editin europe
