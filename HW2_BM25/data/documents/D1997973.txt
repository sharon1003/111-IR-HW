bright large flower heads of sunflowers helianthus annuus and cultivars present a nectar and pollen mother lode for their pollinators which are bees of all kinds each flower heads central disc contains many smaller tubular disc flowers each with its own supply of nectar and pollen the showy outer ray petals help attract the pollinators bees go from flower to flower within the disc becoming covered with pollen they then pollinate other sunflowers as they go from plant to plant the success of sunflower as a crop for seeds and oil depends totally on bees kinds of bees people are most familiar with honeybees and these are the traditional commercial pollinators of sunflowers with beekeepers hiring out their bee colonies to service sunflower fields other kinds of wild bees also pollinate sunflowers some wild bees like bumblebees bombus spp and carpenter bees xylocopa spp are noticeable because they are large but others are smaller than honeybees and often overlooked by gardeners they move quickly and its hard to get a good look at them because sunflowers attract a large number of different kinds of bees a national project known as the backyard bee count enlists volunteers to plant sunflowers and record the number and kinds of pollinators that visit the flowers to better understand noncommercial bee populations honeybees honeybees are native to asia and europe but have long since been taken throughout the world because theyre domesticated pollinators and can be moved around in hives most attention gets paid to them however their mobility has also made them vulnerable to pathogens toxins and diseases as exemplified by the decline in honeybee populations due to colony collapse disorder or ccd in california where the majority of commercial hybrid sunflower growing takes place it takes 15 hives per acre to get effective sunflower pollination honeybees exhibit varying behavior when visiting sunflowers some collect only nectar some collect only pollen and some collect both nectar is used to make honey and pollen gets mixed with honey to feed to the developing bee larvae in the hive wild bees there are many kinds of wild native bees with the species varying according to your geographic location bumblebees carpenter bees leafcutter bees megachile spp  digger bees anthophoridae sweat bees halictidae and mason bees osmia spp are among the bees that are effective pollinators theyre being studied anew in view of declining honeybee populations findings indicate that they are more numerous than thought and that they are better pollinators than honeybees cornell university scientist bryan danforth found that native bees were two to three times more effective pollinators than honeybees stanford universitys sarah greenleaf and claire kremen found that native bees interacting with honeybees on hybrid sunflowers increased pollination five times more than honeybee pollination alone most of the pollination gain resulted from the wild bees presence altering the behavior of foraging honeybees so that they deposited more pollen on female flower parts leading to greater seed development encouraging wild bees if you would like to see a variety of wild bees on your sunflowers and other garden plants there are steps you can take to lure them in wild bees flourish in a diverse habitat that offers lots of different nesting sites to the various kinds of wild bees nearby hedge rows fields wooded areas and bare rocky slopes give wild bees places to live some wild bees use plant twigs or stems to make nests in some dig burrows into soil preferring sloped or welldrained areas of open soil bumblebees nest in abandoned mouse nests bees are very sensitive to pesticides so avoiding pesticide use in your garden helps boost bee populations
