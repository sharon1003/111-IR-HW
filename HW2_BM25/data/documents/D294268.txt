aggregates aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand gravel or crushed stone that along with water and portland cement are an essential ingredient in concrete for a good concrete mix aggregates need to be clean hard strong particles free of absorbed chemicals or coatings of clay and other fine materials that could cause the deterioration of concrete aggregates which account for 60 to 75 percent of the total volume of concrete are divided into two distinct categoriesfine and coarse fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles passing through a 38inch sieve coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 019 inch but generally range between 38 and 15 inches in diameter gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit river lake or seabed crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock boulders cobbles or largesize gravel recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases soilcement and in new concrete after harvesting aggregate is processed crushed screened and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation if necessary a benefaction process such as jigging or heavy media separation can be used to upgrade the quality once processed the aggregates are handled and stored to minimize segregation and degradation and prevent contamination aggregates strongly influence concretes freshly mixed and hardened properties mixture proportions and economy consequently selection of aggregates is an important process although some variation in aggregate properties is expected characteristics that are considered includegradingdurabilityparticle shape and surface textureabrasion and skid resistanceunit weights and voidsabsorption and surface moisture grading refers to the determination of the particlesize distribution for aggregate grading limits and maximum aggregate size are specified because these properties affect the amount of aggregate used as well as cement and water requirements workability pumpability and durability of concrete in general if the watercement ratio is chosen correctly a wide range in grading can be used without a major effect on strength when gapgraded aggregate are specified certain particle sizes of aggregate are omitted from the size continuum gapgraded aggregate are used to obtain uniform textures in exposed aggregate concrete close control of mix proportions is necessary to avoid segregation shape and size matter particle shape and surface texture influence the properties of freshly mixed concrete more than the properties of hardened concrete roughtextured angular and elongated particles require more water to produce workable concrete than smooth rounded compact aggregate consequently the cement content must also be increased to maintain the watercement ratio generally flat and elongated particles are avoided or are limited to about 15 percent by weight of the total aggregate unitweight measures the volume that graded aggregate and the voids between them will occupy in concrete the void content between particles affects the amount of cement paste required for the mix angular aggregates increase the void content larger sizes of wellgraded aggregate and improved grading decrease the void content absorption and surface moisture of aggregate are measured when selecting aggregate because the internal structure of aggregate is made up of solid material and voids that may or may not contain water the amount of water in the concrete mixture must be adjusted to include the moisture conditions of the aggregate abrasion and skid resistance of an aggregate are essential when the aggregate is to be used in concrete constantly subject to abrasion as in heavyduty floors or pavements different minerals in the aggregate wear and polish at different rates harder aggregate can be selected in highly abrasive conditions to minimize wear
