country and devotion to its welfare” a patriot is “one who loves his or her country and zealously supports its interests”i agree with that definition however i think too many of us confuse patriots with heroes we think they are one and the same but i beg to differ when i think of heroes i think of nathan hale who regretted he had “but one life to give for his country” i think of adm farragut i believe it was who said “damn the torpedoes full speed ahead”i think of george washington praying at valley forge and i hear patrick henry exclaiming “give me liberty or give me death”when i think of heroes i think of robert e lee u s grant davy crockett douglas mac arthur andrew jackson adm nimitz stormin’ norman schwarzkopf colin powell colin p kelly and the thousands of boys at iwo jima lenny skutnik – i think i remember his name – surely comes to mind – the citizen who jumped in the icy potomac to help rescue drowning passengers who otherwise would not have survived that air florida crash in washington d c i think of ollie north and even athletes like tommy moe and nancy kerrigan in the olympics rafer johnson and george foreman who raised american flags instead of clenched fists but these are heroes not just patriots men and women who rose to challenges met crisis and physical danger faced death and defeat – and won they saved lives conquered armies dared mightily – stared death in the face – and became heroes i think the true american patriot is something different oh some american patriots may be public heroes too – but i truly believe there is an american patriot who will never make headlines be singled out for any award or even be noticed by anybody but close family and friends he or she will live a long productive quiet life – and be buried with very little fanfare but this person is a true american patriot he’s an accountant who supports his family takes them with him to church or synagogue pays every nickel of his taxes – and advises his clients to do the same she’s a homemaker – a wife and mother – who not only raises and trains and nourishes her kids but also is active in the pta and brownies and cub scouts and the ladies auxiliary he’s a gas station attendant who walks the precincts getting out the vote – for city council members not just presidents and governors she’s a highschool civics teacher who loves her subject and her students and for pitiful pay actually awakens in some of them a sense of pride in america and a sense of personal responsibilityhe’s a local preacher not a nationally known tv evangelist but a gentle loving man who really is a good samaritan and somehow inspires folks in his little congregation to reach out to the hurting and needy around them she’s a volunteer – involved in a thousand worthy enterprises political and social and humanitarian and spiritual – who gives and gives and gives some more never expecting anything in return personally just the satisfaction of having made a difference he’s a cop he walks a beat and wears that badge and he believes in those rules that hold a society together he obeys and defends and preserves the law oh he can be a little tough and cynical sometimes because he sees so much of the worst of us – but he’s risking his life every day trying to give each of us a chance at the best in us these – and so many others – are my idea of the american patriot they’re quiet hardworking honest sharing neighborly people they vote go to sunday school clog the freeways and subways work two or three jobs and still volunteer for worthy causes write their congressmen buy american if they can pray for their president even if they didn’t vote for him and sing “the star spangled banner” at public functions with a lump in their throats and a tear in their eyes the rest of the world still envies america and it’s not because of our heroes – they have their own – it’s because of the millions and millions of american patriots and what they’ve accomplished together it’s because of the american spirit – that contagious colorblind multiethnic and multicultural mysterious and dynamic “can do” force that ties us together that unites us into a family nearing 300 million people – but that also influences individual behavior even when nobody’s looking yes that force that spirit has made us still the envy and role model of the whole world but you can’t buy it wholesale or in quantity it comes in individual packages – and it’s exhibited in lifelong often anonymous commitment – and each package i call an american patriot i believe this story is true and share it with you by way of example a very wealthy man was dying in my hometown of nashville tenn the few members of his family gathered close to be there in his last moments and hopefully to be remembered substantially in the will when he died a small but luxurious funeral procession was put together befitting the economic status of the deceased but when the funeral cortege the long black limousines following the hearse arrived at the only entrance of the nashville cemetery – they couldn’t enter there was a steady procession of people of all ages many on foot some in much more ordinary vehicles in a far larger crowd of mourners entering the cemetery at just that time and they were blocking the entrance completely the youngest son of the deceased wealthy man got out of his car and stomped up to the state trooper who was directing traffic “what’s the hold up here we have one of the wealthiest and most influential men in this part of the country in our hearse and we’re being held up for a long time what is this procession and who are they coming to bury anyway”the state trooper looked at the young man with a rather icy and almost pitying countenance he said “son i’m sorry you and your limousines are being held up this way this crowd will be by in just a few minutes and then i’ll let you in who are they burying somebody i’m sure you never head of – she was a small woman a crossing guard at a big elementary school here she stood directing traffic like i am right now and helped thousands of kids get safely across the street to their classes and safely home after school all these people are the grateful parents and relatives teachers and friends and many of them the kids themselves who are now grown up coming to pay their last respects”he paused then added “it looks like more people knew her and hated to see her go than the folks in your limousines”that little nameless lady that elementaryschool crossing guard is my idea of a true american patriot she’s the very kind of person a hero in her own way who makes america unique in human history if you agree with my definition look in the mirror – you may see another one and if so god bless you related special offer“the patriot’s handbook a citizenship primer for a new generation of americans”share on facebook share on twitter email print
