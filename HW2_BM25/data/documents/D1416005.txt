bit about sports the modern game actually grew out of three sports that were developed independently in three different european countries the czech hazena the danish handbold and the german torball all three were based on soccer but essentially replaced the foot with the hand so that the ball could be advanced by batting or throwing rather than by kicking hazena was being played by slovak peoples as early as 1892 its rules were first codified in 1906 by a college professor handbold the danish word for handball was developed in 1898 by a teacher holger nielsen as an alternative to soccer in 1906 nielsen revised the rules considerably and began organizing competitions outside the school at which he taught similarly torball was created in 1915 by a german gymnastics teacher max heiden professor carl schelenz of the berlin physical education school in 1919 combined elements of handbold and torball and adapted the soccer playing field for a new sport which he called handball actually translating the danish into german schelenz also borrowed from basketball which was just becoming popular in germany to allow dribbling as a means of advancing the ball by 1925 the game had become fairly popular in other european countries the international amateur handball federation iahf was established in 1928 handball was a demonstration sport at the olympics that year and again in 1932 that form of handball designed to be played outdoors by teams of eleven players was a fullfledged olympic sport at the 1936 berlin games the united states finished sixth and last in the competition meanwhile a different indoor version of handball was being developed in the scandinavian countries based largely on danish handbold this version had only seven on a side and was played in a considerably smaller area the iahf held the first sevenaside world championships in 1938 after world war ii the sevenplayer game gradually took over from the elevenplayer version in europe and also spread to other continents world championship play which had been ended by the war began again in 1954 and handball was restored to the olympic program in 1972 competition for womens teams began in 1976 when handball was introduced to the united states about 1930 the name was already being used for the court game that was very popular in ymcas across the countryso the new import was called field handball eventually shortened to fieldball and it was at first played primarily by girls and women the sevenplayer version however became known as team handball in the united states although it has never achieved great popularity it was adopted by the u s army as a camp sport in many areas of the country many boys and girls clubs also took it up followed by explorer scouts and even some high schools and colleges the u s team handball federation was founded in 1959 to standardize rules and sanction competition team handball has been described as a combination of soccer basketball and ice hockey i liken it to water polo on land the object is to score by throwing or hitting an inflated ball into a goal a player can move the ball by dribbling it as in basketball by hitting it with any part of the body above the knee or by throwing it only the goalkeeper is allowed to kick the ball this of course is the reverse of soccer where all other players have to kick the ball and only the
