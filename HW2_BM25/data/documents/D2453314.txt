october 5 2014wwe cm punk chants the end for aj lee opinion aric mitchell cm punk ditched the wwe shortly before launch of the wwe network and despite fanboy rumors that he’s coming back as well as the more broadly held hope among fans that a comeback is even possible he remains off the roster nevertheless that doesn’t stop fans from starting up at random events throughout the country“cmpunk cmpunk”usually but not always the words are said when wwe appears in chicago punk’s hometown more often than not they’re said whenever aj lee his wife and a stillactive member of the roster shows up to work a match or promo naturally this is a nightmare for aj lee even though most of the fans who participate in it are attempting respect for the man she calls her husband they’re actually disrespecting her in the worst way possible first of all they’re saying that she’s not good enough through her inring ability to be worthy of respect the reality aj is one of the best female workers that the wwe has secondly they create a tense situation for aj lee with her employer after all cm punk walked out on his contract because he basically wanted to book himself according to columnist eddie gobbo that’s been a bit of a recurring theme for punk throughout his career things don’t go his way he takes his ball and goes home while he’s a talented worker this type of attitude has kept him from being in the same dialogue with the wwe greats for example when the company brought in steve austin they gave him a crappy gimmick known as “the ringmaster” rather than giving up he used it as a foot in the door and then kept working on his craft until “stone cold” steve austin was born cm punk in contrast would use this as a reason to noshow events it’s natural that his controversial personality wouldn’t sit well with wwe and it’s always possible they could end up taking that out on aj lee for now she shows up and continues to get booking attention because she’s one of the only divas the company has that is worth anything but with nxt stars like charlotte coming up it’s only a matter of time before the company has enough talent to make lee replaceable at that point the cm punk chants will serve as an everready reminder that they no longer need the aggravation of keeping aj lee on the roster do the cm punk chants have to stop for aj’s sake share pin it tweet trending now wwe news the miz comments about cm punk  fighting in ufccm punk return floyd mayweather is the perfect opponent for former wwe star says matthew ryder of brfloyd mayweather should face nick newell not cm punk or conor mc gregor in ufc debut reports mmajunkielatest headlines‘sword gai’ season 2 on netflix part 2 of anime ‘sword gai the animation’ teased for mangabased series march 24 2018mother sexually abused fiveyearold daughter and livestreamed it for her ‘online master’march 24 2018parkland school shooting survivor defends the nra and accuses ‘time magazine’ of bias march 24 2018‘dragon ball super’ episode 131 leaked images tease jiren’s final stand universe 7’s victory march 24 2018ariel winter opens up about coping with mental illness march 24 2018amazon echo dot  alexa star in new rap video by too many t’s march 24 2018
