computing what the nuc here’s how to outfit intel’s miniature pcby matt smith — posted on july 18 2015  1200pmif you’d like a simple barebones computer intel’s nuc is worth a look the only problem with this inexpensive pc is the fact it comes as a kit so you must purchase your own ram and hard drive here’s what you need to know before you pull the trigger nuc i choose youbefore you buy any components you’ll need to decide on the nuc itself there’s several current models available and they can be divided into three main categories on the low end there’s the celeron and pentium powered models that sell for 130 to 180 though affordable their performance is limited so they’re only suited for the most basic pcs the next step up are the core i3 and i5 models these have more capable processors better integrated graphics and bump the maximum ram from eight to sixteen gigabytes they also feature a few more ports the i3 models retail for around 280 while i5 models start around 370 aside from the processor integrated graphics is the only major difference between the two the i3 has intel hd 5500 while the i5 has hd 6000 both models have the same enclosure and connectivity options then there’s the king of all nucs the i7 which ships at about 475 it unfortunately doesn’t have a quadcore i7 but it does offer the highest clock speed of any nuc and bumps the integrated graphics up to intel’s iris 6100 this model is also available only in the larger nuc case we recommend most users steer clear as the marginal bump in performance isn’t worth the significant step up in price while most nucs have an enclosure there is a line available without these are officially called “board” systems rather than “kit” systems these are difficult to find and don’t have a price advantage compared to those with a case so we don’t recommend them the midrange “fat” core i5 model known as the nuc5i5ryh is likely the best overall value it offers an intel core i55250u processor with hd 6000 graphics for 359 and it can support either m2 or sata hard drives a question of memory as mentioned most nucs support up to sixteen gigabytes of ram with the exception of the entrylevel celeron and pentium units we recommend installing at least 4gb of memory if you purchase a pentium or celeron model and at least 8gb if you go with a core variant you may not actually need that much but ddr3 memory is at its lowest price in years bill robersondigital trends nucs have only two dimm slots available and they’ll only accept smaller laptop memory rather than fullsized desktop memory your best bet is to buy a matching pair that in sum offers the ram desired if you’d like 8gb of memory then you’ll want to buy a pair of two 4gb sticks that’ll set you back about 50 at current prices it’s important to buy a matching pair of memory your nuc may not boot if you try to mixandmatch different types and sizes of ram we recommend sticking with basic 1333mhz ddr3 memory because nucs won’t be used for tasks demanding enough to benefit from faster ram this set from g skill is a reliable inexpensive choice mass storage once you have the ram sorted you’ll want to turn to the hard drive depending on the nuc you buy you’ll either have the ability to install a 25” sata hard drive and m2 solid state drive or just the latter the m2 ssd is the way to go if performance is your priority these tiny drives which look a bit like a stick of ram are smaller easier to install and offer excellent performance and they’re only slightly more expensive than a similar 25” drive on average we recommend the samsung 850 evo you can grab a 250gb version of 120 bill robersondigital trends if mass storage is your goal you can select a larger less expensive 25″ solid state drive western digital’s wd5000lplx is a good choice among the mechanical options as it offers 500gb for just 55 those looking for solid state can go with the sata version of the samsung 850 evo which offers 500gb for about 180 note that the nucs supporting sata drives have a height limit of nine millimeters the highest capacity drives that we know will fit are the western digital blue series and the western digital hybrid drive series these can be had in capacities up to 1tb what you don’t need you may wondering if there’s any additional peripherals needed like wifi ethernet or bluetooth generally speaking the answer is no even the least expensive nuc has 80211ac with bluetooth 40 several usb 30 ports and an ethernet jack all of the most recent models can support a 4k monitor over minidisplay port as well rejoice windows is free that’s all the hardware but you still need an operating system fortunately microsoft has given you a new option – the windows 10 insider program enrollment is free and provides you perpetual free use of the operating system the catch is you must continually upgrade your system as each build will eventually expire linux is an option too you can buy a retail copy of windows of course note that whatever you buy you’ll have to obtain a  iso file and install via a usb stick or use an optical hard drive for installation since there’s no optical drive available in the nuc itself no version of windows is particularly well suited to the nuc as long as you grab windows 7 or newer you’ll be fine that’s all you need to know to buy a nuc and properly outfit it my personal recommendation if you want maximum bang for your buck is to buy the nuc5i5ryk eight gigabytes of ddr3 1333mhz ram and a 250gb samsung 850 evo m2 hard drive this configuration will work out to about 530 if you use the free windows insider program making the nuc a very affordable yet surprisingly capable small pc editors recommendations how much ram do you need it’s probably less than you
