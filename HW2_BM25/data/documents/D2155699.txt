in what your first year of study makes you an expert you have no clue what a liver cleanse can do as i pasted another persons posting about testing when you do a cleanse see a nd and not a md because nds have forgotten more then an md will ever know about health mds just want to control the symtoms with drugs and not help your body heal itself why for one simple reason  medical doctors are great for emergencies but for your health and what it takes to be healthy listen to people who know how to live a long healthy life mds life span is less then the general population by 45 years added and for those people that say detoxification does nothingjust tell them to test your ast alt cyp450 liver enzymes before and after a cleanse and then have them explain how these changes are possible if liver detox does nothing hawaiianhealer · 1 decade ago7 3 1 comment hi nature doing a livergallbladder cleanse as well as a colon cleanse are two very important things if you want to heal yourself of an illness or disease it is important to know that the liver is the major fat burning organ in the body the liver is the only organ that can pump fat out of the body and the liver is the filter and cleanser of the bloodstream every single person in my opinion has a sluggish liver if your liver is sluggish you cannot burn fat properly you cannot get fat out of the body properly and you cannot filter and clean your blood properly therefore if you have a sluggish liver you are absolutely guaranteeing yourself illness and disease your liver is sluggish because of all the chemicals and toxins in the food that you eat and all the nonprescription and prescription drugs most notably if you are on cholesterolreducing drugs you absolutely have a sluggish liver if you have ever taken an antibiotic in your life the antibiotic has killed the friendly flora in your intestine causing a candida yeast overgrowth which always goes and attacks the liver when you do a liver cleanse almost everyone feels so much better they cant believe the difference best of health to you source sexperienced healing and educating many years herbdoccom healing oneself · 1 decade ago3 5 comment if you want to do a proper liver detoxification i would not recommend doing the one that entails consuming olive oil and lemon juice there has been multiple studies done on the particular cleanse because a lot of people pass gall stones when on this cleanse the problem was that when they analyzed these gall stones they found that they were composed of lemon juice and olive oil the two products had congealed to form stones there are much better ways to detoxify your liver and gall bladder i would suggest going to see a registered naturopathic doctor because we are properly trained to recommend and lead you through healthy detoxifications a lot of complications can arise in people that do this particular detox you are suggesting so i would be very cautious there are many other diets supplements and herbs that can be very effective drinking lemon juice in warm water before you eat however is a good thing lemon juice has been shown to stimulate the liver and therefore is helpful when doing a detox just be careful with all the information you read off the internet you should seek out an alternative health care provider that is properly trained added and for those people that say detoxification does nothingjust tell them to test your ast alt cyp450 liver enzymes before and after a cleanse and then have them explain how these changes are possible if liver detox does nothing
