leaders of the bohemian revolt were executed in 1621 the nobility and the middle class protestants had to either convert to catholicism or leave the country 33the following period from 1620 to the late 18th century has often been called colloquially the dark age the population of the czech lands declined by a third through the expulsion of czech protestants as well as due to the war disease and famine 34 the habsburgs prohibited all christian confessions other than roman catholicism 35 the flowering of baroque culture shows the ambiguity of this historical period ottoman turks and tatars invaded moravia in 1663 36 in 1679–1680 the czech lands faced a devastating plague and an uprising of serfs 37the 1618 defenestration of prague marked the beginning of the bohemian revolt against the habsburgs and therefore the first phase of the thirty years war the reigns of maria theresa of austria and her son joseph ii holy roman emperor and coregent from 1765 were characterized by enlightened absolutism in 1740 most of silesia except the southernmost area was seized by king frederick ii of prussia in the silesian wars in 1757 the prussians invaded bohemia and after the battle of prague

abolished in two steps between 1781 and 1848 several large battles of the napoleonic wars – battle of austerlitz battle of kulm – took place on the current territory of the czech republic joseph radetzky von radetz born to a noble czech family was a field marshal and chief of the general staff of the austrian empire army during these wars the end of the holy roman empire in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of the kingdom of bohemia bohemia lost its position of an electorate of the holy roman empire as well as its own political representation in the imperial diet 39 bohemian lands became part of the austrian empire and later of austria–hungary during the 18th and 19th century the czech national revival began its rise with the purpose to revive czech language culture and national identity the revolution of 1848 in prague striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the bohemian crown within the austrian empire was suppressed 40ceremonial laying of the

austrian empire needed to redefine itself to maintain unity in the face of nationalism at first it seemed that some concessions would be made also to bohemia but in the end the emperor franz joseph i effected a compromise with hungary only the austrohungarian compromise of 1867 and the never realized coronation of franz joseph as king of bohemia led to a huge disappointment of czech politicians 40 the bohemian crown lands became part of the socalled cisleithania officially the kingdoms and lands represented in the imperial council  prague pacifist bertha von suttner was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 in the same year the czech social democratic and progressive politicians including tomáš garrigue masaryk started the fight for universal suffrage the first elections under universal

powers and later against bolshevik troops 41 in 1918 during the collapse of the habsburg empire at the end of world war i the independent republic of czechoslovakia which joined the winning allied powers was created with tomáš garrigue masaryk in the lead this new country incorporated the bohemian crown bohemia moravia and silesia and parts of the kingdom of hungary slovakia and the carpathian ruthenia with significant german hungarian polish and ruthenian speaking minorities 42 czechoslovakia concluded a treaty of alliance with romania and yugoslavia the socalled little entente and particularly with france the first czechoslovak republic comprised only 27 of the population of the former austriahungary but nearly 80 of the industry which enabled it to successfully compete with western industrial states 43 in 1929 compared to 1913 the gross domestic product increased by 52 and industrial production by 41 in 1938 czechoslovakia held a 10th place in the world industrial production 44although the first czechoslovak republic was a unitary state it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of europe in the interwar period the effects of the great depression including high unemployment and massive propaganda from nazi germany however resulted in discontent and strong support among ethnic germans for a break from czechoslovakia the first czechoslovak republic comprised only 27 of the population of the former austriahungary but nearly 80 of the industry 43adolf hitler took advantage of this opportunity and using konrad henlein s separatist sudeten german party gained the largely german speaking sudetenland and its substantial maginot line like border fortifications through the 1938 munich agreement signed by nazi germany france britain and italy czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference and czechs and slovaks call the munich agreement the munich betrayal because france which had an alliance with czechoslovakia and britain gave up czechoslovakia instead of facing hitler which later proved inevitable despite the mobilization of 12 millionstrong czechoslovak army and the francoczech military alliance poland annexed the zaolzie area around český těšín hungary gained parts of slovakia and the subcarpathian rus as a result of the first vienna award in november 1938

resistance to nazi occupation both at home and abroad most notably with the assassination of nazi german leader reinhard heydrich by czechoslovakian soldiers jozef gabčík and jan kubiš in a prague suburb on 27 may 1942 on 9 june 1942 hitler ordered bloody reprisals against the czechs as a response to the czech antinazi resistance the edvard beneš s czechoslovak governmentinexile and its army

following a sovietorganised referendum the subcarpathian rus never returned under czechoslovak rule but became part of the ukrainian soviet socialist republic as the zakarpattia oblast in 1946 czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a bridge between the west and east however the communist party of czechoslovakia rapidly increased in popularity with a general disillusionment with the west because of the prewar munich agreement and a favourable popular attitude towards the soviet union because of the soviets role in liberating czechoslovakia from german rule in the 1946 elections the communists gained 38 50 of the votes and became the largest party in the czechoslovak parliament they formed a coalition government with other parties of the national front and moved quickly to consolidate power a significant change came in 1948 with coup détat by the communist party the communist peoples militias secured control of key locations in prague and a single party

austria below that of greece or portugal in the 1980s the communist government completely nationalized the means of production and established a command economy the economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s the political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s including numerous show trials the most famous victims milada horáková and rudolf slánský and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s culminating in alexander dubček s leadership in the 1968 prague spring which tried to create  socialism with a human face  and perhaps even introduce political pluralism this was forcibly ended by invasion by all warsaw pact member countries with the exception of romania and albania on 21 august 1968 student jan palach became a symbol of resistance to the occupation when he committed selfimmolation as a political protest the invasion was followed by a harsh program of  normalization  in the late 1960s and the 1970s until 1989 the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition dissidents published charter 77 in 1977 and the first of a new wave of
