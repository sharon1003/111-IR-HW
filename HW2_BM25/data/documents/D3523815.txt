overcoming fatigue post seizure topic living with epilepsy  adults hello  im new here and am glad to have found this forum thank you im well controlled on lamictal but get a bee in my bonnet every now and again and try to ween off the meds  a denial thing to be sure inevitably a seizure comes mea culpa i know my question though is this what do any of you do to combat postseizure fatigue is it better just to sleep for hours on end until your body catches up or is there something that can be done to avoid this period its not unusual for me to sleep for up to 3 days after a seizure thanks so

xr also can help temporarily reduce fatigue in some users not everyone however like adderall xr caffeine is also a stimulantalerting agent which can lower the seizure threshold for some most of caffeine effects 100 mg for me fade away in about 4 hours with a slight residual perhaps up to 15 hours vs adderall xr 5 mg which i tried which kept me up for 30 hours or so so i dont use strong adderall xr myself but weaker caffeine instead which works a little for me  not a cure i am adhd inattentive with central auditory processing disorder capd not epilepsy log in to post comments re

neurodiagnostic tech i also have seizures i would acccidently forget my medication and i would be in seizure world i did not like to be so drowsy after seizures i asked different neurologists about the drowsiness because i really wanted to work and not be drowsy i needed the income the first thing they would tell me is rest was probably the cause of my personal seizure activity it would be the reason you had the seizure it usually took me a few days until my recall would be back to its normal self the other reason is how i was eating while i was at work it is the type of seizures you are having too if your body is giving you the signal too i also wanted to be off medicationbut because of the discharges i needed to balance my brains discharges i needed to work and that actually helped the seizures and help keep my job log in to post comments re overcoming fatigue post seizure permalink submitted by chibi kowai on wed 20100428 0219siezures have been compared to running a marathon and i cant run a marathon i have just always slept and let my body heal back up i use to wean myself off but stopped that bad habit when i had to pay my first ambulence bill it was over 1k o o but ya lol so behave and you hopefully wont have to worry about the zzz 3log in to post comments re overcoming fatigue post seizure permalink submitted by rosegirl on wed 20100428 1309i just sleep i used to just go right into it right away but now if i was gonna take my when i started seizing i remember and start reaching for them probably trying to talk but gibberish is coming out im almost out of it right away but whoever was there with me keeps me awake long enough for me to take my meds if i was about to or they help me up to get back to bed or the couch i usually sleep for about 35 hours after that i can usually get through the day walking kinda zombielike granted theres not much for me to do so i usually end up in my bed asleep its best just to let your body ride it out no sense in trying to stop it the odds arent in your favor is it a self diagnosed weaning or did your dr tell you to because it sounds like you are deciding yourself if you should wean yourself off your meds log in to
