home  cancer facts  cancer and family history  genetic counseling  types of genetic testing types of genetic testing the following information describes the three main types of genetic testing chromosome studies dna studies and biochemical genetic studies tests for cancer susceptibility genes are usually done by dna studies chromosome studies chromosomes are the long stretches of dna that contain our genes “cytogenetics” is a word used to describe the study of chromosomes the chromosomes need to be stained in order to see them with a microscope when stained the chromosomes look like strings with light and dark “bands” a picture an actual photograph from one cell of all 46 chromosomes in their pairs is called a “karyotype” a normal female karyotype is written 46 xx and a normal male karyotype is written 46 xy the standard analysis of the chromosomal material evaluates both the number and structure of the chromosomes with an accuracy of over 999 percent chromosome analyses are usually performed using a blood sample white blood cells prenatal specimen skin biopsy or other tissue sample chromosomes are analyzed by specially trained health care personnel that have advanced degrees in cytogenetic technology and genetics chromosome studies may be performed when a child is born with multiple birth defects chromosome studies also may be performed when people have certain types of leukemias and lymphomas to look for specific chromosome rearrangements changes in the order of the chromosome material associated with these types of cancers dna studies a gene is a short stretch of dna on a chromosome the stretch of dna is a code or recipe for making a specific protein the body needs to function properly to study genes you have to analyze the dna to determine whether the dna “alphabet” has any “spelling errors” in it there are two ways to analyze the dna by direct studies looking at the actual gene itself or by indirect studies looking at areas of dna called markers that are very close to the gene direct dna studies direct dna studies simply look directly at the gene in question for an error errors in the dna may include a replication of the gene’s dna duplication a loss of a piece of the gene’s dna deletion an alteration in a single unit called a base pair of the gene’s dna point mutation or the repeated replication of a small sequence for instance three base pairs of the gene’s dna trinucleotide repeat different types of errors or “mutations” are found in different disorders it is usually very important to find the mutation that is present in a family by studying the family member with the disorder in question in this case cancer before testing relatives without the cancer when a particular mutation is found in a relative with cancer other family members can choose to have testing for the mutation to determine if they have an increased risk to develop certain cancers and to pass the mutation on to the next generation the dna needed for direct dna studies is usually obtained by taking a blood sample indirect dna studies sometimes the gene that when mutated causes a condition has not yet been identified but researchers know approximately where it lies on a particular chromosome other times the gene is identified but direct gene studies are not possible because the gene is too large to analyze in these cases indirect dna studies may be done indirect dna studies involve using “markers” to find out whether a person has inherited the crucial region of the genetic code that is passing through the family with the disease markers are dna sequences located close to or even within the gene of interest because the markers are so close they are almost always inherited together with the disease when markers are this close to a gene they are said to be “linked” if someone in a family has the same set of linked markers as the relative with the disease this person often also has the diseasecausing gene mutation because indirect dna studies involve using linked markers these types of studies also are called “linkage studies” indirect studies usually involve blood samples from several family members including those with and without the disorder in question this study is to establish what pattern of markers appear to be associated with the disease once the diseaseassociated pattern of markers is identified it is possible to offer testing to relatives to determine who inherited this pattern and as such is at increased risk of cancer the accuracy of linkage studies depends on how close the markers are to the faulty gene in some cases a reliable marker is not available and the test therefore cannot give any useful information to the healthy family members in many cases several family members are needed to establish the most accurate set of markers to determine who is at risk for the disease in the family linkage studies may take many weeks to complete because of the complexity of these studies many of the cancersusceptibility genes that we know about today were discovered using linkage studies of families who had multiple family members with cancer biochemical genetic studies biochemical genetic testing involves the study of enzymes in the body that may be abnormal in some way enzymes are proteins that regulate chemical reactions in the body the enzymes may be deficient or absent unstable or have altered activity that can lead to clinical manifestations in an adult or child ie birth defects there are hundreds of enzyme defects that can be studied in humans sometimes rather than studying the gene mutation that is causing the enzyme to be defective in the first place it is easier to study the enzyme itself the gene product the approach depends on the disorder biochemical genetic studies may be done from a blood sample urine sample spinal fluid or other tissue sample depending on the disorder protein truncation studies another way to look at gene products rather than the gene itself is through protein truncation studies testing involves looking at the protein a gene makes to see if it is shorter than normal sometimes a mutation in a gene causes it to make a protein that is truncated shortened with the protein truncation test it is possible to “measure” the length of the protein the gene is making to see if it is the right size or shortened protein truncation studies can be performed on a blood sample these types of studies are often performed for disorders in which the known mutations predominantly lead to shortened proteins
