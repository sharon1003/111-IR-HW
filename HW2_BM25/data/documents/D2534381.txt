november 13 2014 at 839 am reply the actual wheels have not changed however the entire mechanism that holds the wheels has been significantly upgraded to provide better suspension and maneuverability sonja november 20 2014 at 1126 am reply hi juliei saw that the bee3 has a feature to extend the seat back and actual seat does the bee as well have this option thanks ellena november 23 2014 at 301 am reply hi sonja – the bee seat extends as wellalex december 16 2014 at 931 pm reply hi with reference to lena’s question – how can i tell if i’m buying a bugaboo bee3 and not a bugaboo frame with the bee3 canopy and seat liner am wondering the same question too your answer to her question doesn’t address her concern because if both frames look the same how do we verify we are getting the bee3 chassis ellena december 17 2014 at 239 am reply the bee3 is marked “bee3” on our site and you can be sure that you will be receiving the newer bee3 frame when you receive your actual stroller you will see right away if it is the newer frame by the wheels and underseat basket both of which have been improved tremendously if you’d like give our sales team a call and they can put your order together for you and give you a great deal min january 17 2015 at 422 pm reply thanks for the good info which one has got a bigger seat my boy is 15 month old but as big and tall as 2 years old i have a chameleon now but want to change to bee bee 3 or bee plus which one would be better for a big boy ellena january 19 2015 at 231 am reply hi min officially the seats of both the bee and the bee3 are identical in size so both options would work for you the maneuverability on the newer bee3 is superior so pushing a 3 year old in the bee3 will definitely be easier than pushing him in the bee teej february 23 2015 at 353 am reply can the seat cover on the bee3 be used on the bee at all or are they completely uncompatible would be nice to know if anyone has tried angela may 11 2015 at 906 pm reply we are planning to buy the bee3but we are wondering if it’s possible to use the seat of a bee plusbecause we have read on many reviews that the seat of bee plus is much better than the one on the bee3are they compatible ellena may 12 2015 at 326 am reply hi angela interesting that you’ve heard that the bee seat is preferable over the seat of the bee3 because we all don’t agree with that the new bee3 seat has a better harness and structure the bee3 seat is not available to purchase separately grace moisesmay 14 2015 at 1045 am reply hi is the maxi cosi seat adaptor for bee plus compatible with bee3 as well ellena may 14 2015 at 1048 am reply hi grace – all car seat adapters have remained the same from the bee to the bee3 sjune 12 2015 at 1039 am reply does the new bassinet
