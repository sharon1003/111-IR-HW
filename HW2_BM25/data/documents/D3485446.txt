why do supporters of genetically engineered foods insist on organics for their own families0october 09 2012 • 415828 views edition english previous next story ataglance many political supporters of genetically engineered ge foods are feasting on organics while promoting unlabeled ge foods for everyone else including mitt romney president obama and former presidents george w bush and bill clinton at present the race is necktoneck between romney and obama in terms of not doing anything to protect or promote safer more healthful organic foods for average americans instead both of them while on organic diets themselves promote untested ge foods for the masses according to a former white house executive chef laura bush was “adamant that in all cases if an organic product was available it was to be used in place of a nonorganic product” and mitt romney’s wife ann has publicly credited a combination of organic foods and holistic medicine for turning her health around after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998in a 2008 interview michelle obama is quoted as saying “you start reading the labels and you realize there’s highfructose corn syrup in everything everything that’s in a bottle or a package is like poison in a way that most people don’t even know”while the obama’s appear wellinformed about the health dangers of processed foods in general and genetically engineered foods specifically their personal belief system has not filtered into the food policies that affect the rest of the population on the contrary the president has appointed a number of former monsanto employees into key federal positions that wield nearabsolute power over agricultural issues while ignoring his preelection promise to “immediately” label genetically engineered foods once elected into office we have no real champions for food safety and labeling of genetically engineered foods within the federal government but right now we do have a great opportunity to change this situation by circumventing the federal system entirely and supporting california’s proposition 37 to label ge foods this ca law would have a national effect by dr mercola over the past few years an interesting pattern has emerged where political supporters of genetically engineered ge foods are feasting on organics while promoting unlabeled ge foods for everyone else most recently mother jones 1 discussed how presidential hopeful mitt romney – whose ties to monsanto go back to the late 1970s when ge crops were still in the rd phase – reportedly makes sure his own meals are nothing but organic according to peter alexander of msn today 2 on romney air or hair force one – as reuters steve holland like to call it – mitt romney has his own galley in forward cabin and while ive never been invited up front sources close to the campaign tell me the shelves are stocked with a wide variety of healthy fare kashi cereals hummus pita as well as organic applesauce everythings organic im told including the ingredients to romneys favorite peanut butter and honey sandwiches even more interesting in a 2002 article 3 about romneys wife ann she credits a combination of organic foods and holistic medicine for turning her health around after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998 the profile reads in part she was 49 at the time and the disease was progressing rapidly she says prompting the doctors to put her on steroids which made her so sick she could barely get out of bed they were killing me she says of the treatment you have bone loss they are so bad for youmrs romney was introduced to several practitioners of holistic medicine who persuaded her to adopt alternative therapies she now eats organic foods and very little meat she practices reflexology and undergoes acupuncture treatments she credits the lifestyle with turning her health aroundeveryone has to find their own way she says three years ago i was really really sick and not able to function at all a lot of the symptoms are now gonemrs romney isnt the only success story in which food played a center role in beating multiple sclerosis ms last year i posted an article about dr terry wahls who reversed ms after seven years of deterioration on the best conventional treatments available simply by changing her diet wouldnt it be a nice change of pace if our agricultural authorities not to mention our president could reach into their hearts and find the humanity to fight for everyones right to eat wholesome food that doesnt contain foreign dna builtin pesticides and an inordinate amount of synthetic chemicals so that diseases such as ms and cancer could be curtailed before they even get a foothold if ge foods are so great why wont the elite eat them while obama has been a huge supporter of big biotech during his term romney is just as tight with monsanto having actually successfully guided the company out of lawsuits with congress in the shameful aftermath of agent orange a monsanto creation which was supposed to be harmless to everything except vegetation and heinous chemical dumping incidents in missouri and alabama 4hes also in favor putting the  monsanto rider  provision in the 2012 farm bill – a rider that would prevent a federal court from putting in place courtordered restrictions on a ge crop even if the approval were fraudulent or involved bribery among other things unfortunately mitt romney is just one in a line of politicians who support and promote ge foods as being just as safe and natural as conventional foods while privately serving up nothing but organic for their own families president obama as his predecessors george w bush and bill clinton have all reportedly insisted on an organic diet mother jones writes 5whats my evidence that the clintons and bushes ate organic get this from someone who knows – walter scheib 6 who served as white house executive chef during the clinton and bush yearsfrom 1994 to 2005 i was the executive chef at the white house this offered me not only the personal honor of serving two unique and interesting first families but the professional challenge of fulfilling hillary clintons mandate of bringing contemporary american cuisine and nutritionally responsible food to the white house this meant that nearly all the product used was obtained from local growers and suppliers there was a small garden on the roof of the white house where produce was grown the ethic of the purchasing and the cooking at the white house under my direction and under the continuing direction of current obama white house executive chef cris comerford is one of respect for the pedigree of the product and manner it is grown gathered raised or caught the clinton and bush families dined regularly on organic foods both wagyu and grassfed beef were frequently used emphasis minescheib was again quoted in a 2009 article by think progress 7 stating that laura bush was adamant that in all cases if an organic product was available it was to be used in place of a nonorganic product meanwhile the article lists a number of atrocious food policies instituted by her husband who knows perhaps she was so adamant about organics because she knew the quality and safety of conventional food was rapidly going down the toilet guess who said everything thats in a bottle or package is like poison in a way that most people dont even knowthe obama white house may be even more progressive about healthful dining than previous presidents in a 2008 article about first lady michelle obama published in the new yorker 8 one morning during a roundtable at ma fischers a diner in milwaukee elizabeth crawford a recently divorced caterer with two children brought up the subject of the eating habits of american families i really really hope that barack will jump on that she said then having given thoughtful but boilerplate responses most of the morning michelle obama suddenly departed from her script it was the most animated i saw her on the campaign trail you know she said in my household over the last year we have just shifted to organic for this very reason i mean i saw just a moment in my nineyearolds life – we have a good pediatrician who is very focused on childhood obesity and there was a period where he was like mmm shes tipping the scale so we started looking through our cabinets you know youve got fast food on saturday a couple days a week you dont get home the leftovers good not the third day  so that whole notion of cooking on sunday is out  and the notion of trying to think about a lunch every day  so you grab the lunchables right and the fruitjuicebox thing and we think – we think – thats juice and you start reading the labels and you realize theres highfructose corn syrup in everything were eating every jelly every juice everything thats in a bottle or a package is like poison in a way that most people dont even knowyes highfructose corn syrup is one of the most atrocious ingredients in the american food supply today in terms of what it does to your health not only is fructose a major contributor to metabolic syndrome diabetes and obesity the vast majority of it is also derived from genetically engineered corn which has its own increasingly welldocumented ill health effects most recently the worlds first lifetime feeding study using monsanto ge corn found it caused massive breast tumors kidney and liver damage and other serious health problems michelle obama is certainly not the only one who has referred to highfructose corn syrup as a poison according to dr robert lustig excess fructose does act like a toxin in your body and dr don huber has spoken out about the twofold toxic effects of ge crops 1 due to the genetic alteration of the plant itself and 2 the glyphosate sprayed on ge roundup ready crops president obama aware of issue but doing nothing about it sadly while the obamas are undoubtedly well aware of the health dangers of processed foods in general and genetically engineered foods specifically their personal belief system has not filtered into the food policies that affect the rest of the population on the contrary the president has spent the last four years appointing one monsanto shill after another into key federal positions that wield nearabsolute power over agricultural issues mrs obamas efforts to promote organic foods which included a much publicized white house organic garden were also quickly tempered and toned down by a personal visit from the mid america crop life association an agribusiness media group who urged the first lady to give conventional agriculture equal time according to a 2009 politico article 9topping it all off the president has also completely ignored his preelection promise to immediately label ge foods should he win because americans should know what theyre buying well its become abundantly clear that big biotech and their political lackeys will not even allow us to make an informed decision on this issue by reading our own food labels and youd have to be supremely naïve to not question the absurd dichotomy between public policies on ge and organic foods and the private decisions made by those in charge and in the know obama promises to label gmos your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video000  101monsanto runs and regulates us agriculture in the first three years of the obama administration 10 different genetically engineered crops and even a genetically modified animal have been approved by the us department of agriculture usda according to food  water watch 10 all without a single shred of proof that these foods are actually safe for longterm consumption or in the case of todays children – lifetime consumption could this have anything to do with the fact that highly influential people within the usda were previous employees of or have other personal ties to monsanto the secretary of agriculture is tom vilsack a strong monsanto supporter selected by presidentelect obama in 2008 11 as governor of iowa vilsack frequently traveled in monsantos private jets and was named governor of the year by the biotechnology industry organization the director of the national institute of food and agriculture is roger beachy a former director of the monsanto danforth center the general counsel for the usda is ramona romero who came straight from du pont another major biotech company with ge crop patents where she held a number of key positions including corporate counsel for complex commercial and antitrust litigation and corporate counsel and manager of operations and partnering even the secretary of state hillary clinton has old ties to monsanto via the rose law firm getting the picture the us food and drug administration fda and other federal agencies are similarly stacked with former monsanto employees likewise when it comes to selecting which presidential candidate might be better for organic foods and our agriculture system both romney and obamas actions speak louder than words they do one thing privately and sell another agenda to the public neither of them is a champion for real food in the us and both of them cater and yield to the wills of multinational food and biotech companies monsanto vp now us food safety czar – whats wrong with this picture in 2009 president obama appointed former monsanto vp for public policy michael taylor as a senior adviser for the fda turning a deaf ear to the loud protests from consumer groups taylor is currently serving as the deputy commissioner for foods at the fda – a position that includes ensuring food labels contain clear and accurate information he also oversees strategy for food safety and planning new food safety legislation to say hes a fox guarding a hen house would be an understatement this sentiment is shared by most people who are even remotely aware of food safety issues at the time of taylors appointment ge expert jeffrey smith commented 12the person who may be responsible for more foodrelated illness and death than anyone in history has just been made the us food safety czar this is no joke now the opposition is gaining steam yet again with an online petition 13 calling for taylors removal president obama i oppose your appointment of michael taylor taylor is the same person who was food safety czar at the fda when genetically modified organisms were allowed into the u s food supply without undergoing a single test to determine their safety or risks this is a travesty the petition reads biotech companies are gaining power by taking over the government monsanto and their industry allies will not willingly surrender their stranglehold on the food supply they must be resisted and rolled back at every turn there is no doubt in my mind that gmos and the chemicalintensive agricultural model of which they are part and parcel pose a serious threat to the environment and our health yet government agencies not only turn a blind eye to the damage they are inflicting on the planet but actively work to further the interests of the biotech giants this is not surprising it is wellknown that there is a revolving door between regulatory agencies and private corporations this has allowed companies such monsanto to manipulate science defang regulations and even control the free press all from their commanding position within the halls of government consider for a moment that on paper the u s may have the strictest safety regulations in the world governing new food additives but has repeatedly allowed gmos and their accompanying pesticides such as roundup to circumvent these laws in fact the only legal basis for allowing ge foods to be marketed in the u s is the fda’s tenuous claim that these foods are inherently safe a claim which is demonstrably false documents released as a result of a lawsuit against the fda reveal that the agencys own scientists warned their superiors about the detrimental risks of ge foods but their warnings fell on deaf ears don’t be duped by industry shillsin a further effort to deceive the public monsanto and its cohorts spoonfeed scientists academics and journalists a diet of questionable studies that depict them in a positive light by hiring “thirdparty experts” biotech companies are able to take information of dubious validity and present it as independent and authoritative industry front groups also abound the genetic literacy project and the american council for science and health are both monsantofunded even web md a website that is often presented as a trustworthy source of independent and objective health information is heavily reliant on advertising dollars it is no coincidence that they promote corporatebacked health strategies and products there’s no better time to act than now — here’s what you can do the biotech giants have deep pocketbooks and political influence and are fighting to maintain their position of dominance it is only because of educated consumers and groups like the organic consumers association oca that their failed gmo experiment is on the ropes we thank all of the donors who helped oca achieve their fundraising goal i made a commitment to triple match all donations to oca during awareness week it is with great pleasure to present a check to this fantastic organization for 250000 at the end of the day we must shatter monsanto’s grip on the agricultural sector there is no way to recall gmos once they have been released into the environment the stakes could not be higher will you continue supporting the corrupt toxic and unsustainable food system that monsanto and its industry allies are working so hard to protect for more and more people the answer is no consumers are rejecting genetically engineered and pesticide laden foods another positive trend is that there has been strong growth in the global organic and grass fed sectors this just proves one thing we can make a difference if we steadily work toward the same goal one of the best things you can do is to buy your foods from a local farmer who runs a small business and uses diverse methods that promote regenerative agriculture you can also join a communitysupported agriculture csa program where you can buy a “share” of the vegetables produced by the farm so that you get a regular supply of fresh food i believe that joining a csa is a powerful investment not only in your own health but in that of your local community and economy as well in addition you should also adopt preventive strategies that can help reduce the toxic chemical pollution that assaults your body i recommend visiting these trustworthy sites for nongmo food resources in your country as well
