2015by honor whiteman in a new study researchers may have uncovered a promising  yet surprising  treatment for hair loss plucking the remaining hairs researchers found plucking 200 hairs from a 35 mm region of a mouses back led to the growth of 4501300 new hairs image credit chengming chuong led by prof chengming chuong of the keck school of medicine at the university of southern california the study reveals how individually plucking 200 hairs from the back of a mouse in a specific pattern led to the regeneration of up to 1300 hairs prof chuong and his team publish their findings in the journal cell  male pattern baldness accounts for around 95 of hair loss in men according to the american hair loss association by the age of 35 around two thirds of men in the us will have experienced some level of hair loss common causes of hair loss in women  who account for 40 of all hair loss sufferers  include female pattern baldness and traction alopecia which is hair loss caused by trauma to the hair follicles  skin organs that grow hair according to prof chuong and colleagues it is well established that damage to hair follicles can influence hair regeneration in the surrounding areas as such they hypothesized that hair follicle stimulation through hair plucking may lead to new hair growth and they set out to test this theory one by one the team plucked 200 hairs from the back of a mouse in a number of different patterns they found that plucking the hairs from an area more than 6 mm in diameter failed to regenerate new hairs plucking hairs from a region 35 mm in diameter however led to the regeneration of 4501300 new hairs and these new hairs even grew outside of the plucked area commenting on their findings prof chuong says it is a good example of how basic research can lead to work with potential translational value the work leads to potential new targets for treating alopecia a form of hair loss hair plucking triggers distress signals to encourage new hair growth through conducting molecular studies the researchers found that plucking hairs from the back of the mouse generated new hair growth through a process called quorum sensing put simply the damage to the hair follicles caused by hair plucking triggered the release of inflammatory proteins these proteins send a distress signal to immune cells calling them to the injury site next the team explains the immune cells express signaling molecules  such as tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfα at certain concentrations these signaling molecules encourage both damaged and undamaged hair follicles to grow new hair prof chuong says these findings may have wider implications it is possible that minor damage to other organs could stimulate some form of regeneration the implication of the work is that parallel processes may also exist in the physiological or pathogenic processes of other organs he adds although they are not as easily observed as hair regeneration talking to bbc news prof chris mason a professor of regenerative medicine at university college london in the uk said the idea of quorum sensing for hair regeneration is smart but it is unclear as to whether it could be an effective treatment for human hair loss thats the milliondollar question im not sure as it stands here youve got to have some hair to pluck he said could you tap into the pathway with a cream or injection that could well be possible  or maybe dont wait until youre totally bald in january medical news today reported on a study by researchers from the sanfordburnham medical research institute in la jolla ca
