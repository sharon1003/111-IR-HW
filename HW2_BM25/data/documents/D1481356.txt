brutus  it is notable for its occurrence in william shakespeare s play julius caesar where it is spoken by the roman dictator julius caesar to his friend marcus junius brutus at the moment of caesars assassination the phrases first known occurrences are said to be in two elizabethan plays an early play by shakespeare and an even earlier play that is now lost 1 the phrase is often used apart from the plays to signify an unexpected betrayal by a friend caesar utters these words in act iii scene 1 as he is being stabbed to death having recognized his friend and protégé brutus as one of the assassins there is however no evidence that the historic caesar spoke these words 2 3the name brutus a second declension masculine noun appears in the phrase in the vocative case and so the us ending of the nominative case is replaced by e 4context  editon march 15 the ides of march  44 bce the historic caesar was attacked by a group of senators including brutus who was caesars friend and protégé caesar initially resisted his attackers but when he saw brutus he reportedly responded as he died the historical caesars last words are not known with certainty the roman historian suetonius a century and a half after the incident claims caesar said nothing as he died but that others reported that caesars last words were the greek phrase  καὶ σὺ τέκνον  5 6 the phrase means you too child or you too young man 7 sometimes this is rendered in latin as tu quoque brute fili mi you too brutus my son plutarch also reports that caesar said nothing but merely pulled his toga over his head when he saw brutus among the conspirators 8in the play julius caesar 1599 caesar says  et tu brute then fall caesar 9 shakespeare was making use of a phrase already in use for example it is said by edmond malone to have appeared in a work that has been lost richard eedes s latin play caesar interfectus of 1582 it also occurs in shakespeares earlier play the true tragedie of richard duke of yorke and the death of good king henrie the sixth with the whole contention betweene the two houses lancaster and yorke of 1595 which is the earliest printed version of henry vi part 3 10 11interpretation  editit has been argued that the phrase can be interpreted as a curse or threat 12 one theory states that the historic caesar adapted the words of a greek sentence which to the romans had long since become proverbial the complete phrase is said to have been you too my son will have a taste of power of which caesar only needed to invoke the opening words to foreshadow brutus own violent death in response to his assassination 13 there is a poem by horace satires book i satire 7 written approximately 30 bc that mentions brutus and his tyrannicide in discussing that poem author john henderson considers that the expression et tu brute as he hyphenates it can be interpreted as a complaint containing a suggestion of mimetic compulsion 1references  edit a b henderson john 1998 fighting for rome poets
