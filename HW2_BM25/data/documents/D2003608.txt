review compliment send message follow fredric s31020181 checkin this was an outstanding meal authentic asian restaurants are not easy to find downriver and when i searched for a sushi restaurant ume was in my search the restaurant is in a nondescript strip mall on grosse ile in a relatively small space the menu has a number of sushi rolls and japanese entrees dont forget to check in for 10 off we ordered three rolls the cowboy fancy volcano and aries the cowboy role was unique fish tempura and spicy crab salad with a thin slice of seared filet mignon on top the combination worked incredibly well the fancy volcano was a california roll with baked scallops shrimp and crab meat and was presented with panko crumbs piled high with red roe on top again so incredibly tasty the aries roll is deep fried with tempura shrimp crab stick and avocado i find these kind of rolls hard to eat as the circumference is almost bigger than my mouth but the taste was excellent two complaints that were overwhelmed by the taste of the food the miso soup was tepid as was the tea the flavor of both was very good i like hot the most annoying was how slow the food was to arrive it was not bad service as our server was very good and friendly there are two sushi chefs and the place was busy they are artisans and it just takes a long time so if you are in a hurry id skip the place otherwise the restaurant is highly recommended al p voted for this review useful 1 funny 1 cool 1shelley s downriver detroit mi1 friend33 reviews9 photos share review embed review compliment send message follow

follow michelle w9272017we received a coupon for 10 off a 50 order and seeing the restaurant is new and in our neck of the woods we had to give it a try the restaurant is in a minimall type location based on the flyerand the pricesi dressed up a bit and honestly it has been a while since i have lol the pictures were a tad deceiving as i could have worn my new balance workout pants and a tshirtand it would have been fine the decor is cute but very small we went around 4 and it was dead needless to say i would not recommend going here trying to impress a date for the first time but this place is perfect if you want fast decent food now i am not a sushi connoisseur so i am not the best person to tell you exactly how great or not great sushi is all i can say is that i ordered 3 rolls two philly and one california all of them tasted fine to me my husband said the rice was too sticky more vinegar no idea the miso soup was good and the tuna app we had was great if you cant handle heat dont get the tuna appetizer the wait staff was attentive and friendly although they werent super educational on the menu but ive been spoiled by the kabob express customer service per my last review overall a good choice for lunch i did think it pricey but that seems to be the trend with sushi so i cant complain i would love to hear what our yelp sushi specialists have to say my husbands order two philly rolls one cali the tuna appetizer its got some heatal p voted for this review useful 1 funny cool alex h brownstown charter township mi0 friends1 review share review embed review compliment send
