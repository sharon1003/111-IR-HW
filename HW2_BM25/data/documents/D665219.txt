game on game of thrones is this really the last we’ll see of jon snowby joanna robinson june 14 2015 1055 pm courtesy of hbothere are bigtime spoilers for game of thrones season 5 episode 10 “mother’s mercy” i’ve never been more serious about a spoiler warning if you haven’t seen the finale yet proceed with caution if you have charge right in but don’t say we didn’t try to warn you because we really really did o k well that was a big deal it would appear that jon snow is dead and gone for good wouldn’t it given george r r martin’s tendency to kill off main characters it’s not the most inconceivable outcome and in an interview with entertainment weekly both kit harington and the show’s creators are very really adamant that jon snow is done but is that really the end of jon snow there has been an awful lot of prophecy built up around the character and martin has always refused to confirm he’s actually dead while that doesn’t make snow bulletproof it does mean the desire to see him resurrected is more than just wishful thinking here are the most popular theories behind his return wait so does this happen in the books yep you now know exactly as much as book readers do about the fate of jon snow in the books the last we saw of the poor commander he lay dying from multiple stab wounds olly doesn’t stab jon in the books—olly is a showinvented character—but otherwise it’s close enough the only difference between you show watchers and us book readers now when it comes to jon snow is that we’ve had four years since a dance with dragons came out to think of creative ways to bring back jon snow wanna hear them here we go jon snow could warg into his direwolf i mean it will seem like a bit of a copout next season if this ends up being the solution especially since they didn’t establish ghost as being anywhere near jon nor have we seen jon warg in the show but we have seen characters like bran and orell throw themselves into their animals so this could be a temporary solution for jon in the books the last word he says as he goes down is “ghost” which is why people generally buy the warg explanation kit harington alluded to the warg theory during a panel event earlier this year he told the audience “i’d like to be a warg i’d like to put myself inside a wolf” as you might imagine this got a lot of laughs show creator d b weiss then said “two words for you season 6” it all seems like a joke but maybe not and even if they’re not joking ”jon snow is a wolf now“ doesn’t sound like a permanent solution does it so what happens next melisandre could bring him back from the dead this is one of the more popular theories now that stannis is presumably dead melisandre is in search of a new messiah to champion and she’s been eyeballing jon snow all season do we know that melisandre can bring people back from the dead not specifically no but we do know that people who follow the lord of light aka r’hllor can back in season 3 melisandre met thoros of myr a red priest who had resurrected his friend beric dondarrion several times in the books thoros resurrects someone else important but in the show’s narrative it was necessary to establish that resurrections can and do happen in this universe melisandre looked rather scandalized by thoros’s antics but it’s a good thing the show went out of its way to link these two up they don’t meet in the books so we would know that melisandre had this option in her back pocket and hey her magic is running hot as she’s brimming with the power of shireen’s royal blood what do you mean she needs a new messiah well melisandre believed stannis was azor ahai reborn don’t remember who that is well if you have 16 minutes to spare you can watch this fantastic indepth video explaining the whole ahai myth if you want a shorter version thousands and thousands of years ago there was something called the long night in which the others aka white walkers laid waste to the realms of men during a long winter according to legend there was a hero who put a stop to the long night and he was called by many names throughout the fictional lands of westeros essos and beyond the prince that was promised the last hero the stallion who mounts the world azor ahai etc these are probably all the same savior figure and according to a widespread prophecy he’s destined to be reborn and save the world once more melisandre had been operating under the assumption that stannis baratheon was that chosen one born of smoke and salt so jon snow is melisandre’s own personal jesus jesus neo the chosen one the boy who lived the avatar the ringbearer the great lion the slayer the golden child it doesn’t really matter what you want to call it every epic yarn has one we don’t have to believe that jon snow is azor ahai just as long as melisandre does but hey maybe he is the prince that was promised what hints have there been that jon is azor ahai this gets a little complicated so bear with me one of the biggest efforts the show has made to indicate jon’s chosen one status was that business he did with his sword at hardhome like king arthur or godric gryffindor azor ahai has a legendary sword called lightbringer in the books samwell tarly says “i found one account of the long night that spoke of the last hero aka azor ahai slaying others with a blade of dragonsteel supposedly they could not stand against it” melisandre spoke of the legend of lightbringer back in season 2 saying “in the ancient books it is written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire” in the books though not the show when he saved lord commander jeor mormonts life from a wight attack at castle black jon snow set a fire that damaged longclaw’s hilt melting silver on the bears head pommel and burning the crossguard and grip mormont gave the sword to jon so the blade snow used on that white walker at hardhome longclaw was technically pulled from a fire the sword and melisandre’s fascination with jon snow have been the show’s biggest indications that he’s someone special in the books there are other signs melisandre says ”i pray for a glimpse of azor ahai and r’hllor shows me only snow“ apparently r’hllor has a sense of humor in the books jon dreams of being armored all in ice clutching a burning sword which he uses to kill his wildling girlfriend ygritte in the legend azor ahai forged his legendary sword by plunging it into the heart of his beloved wife nissa nissa finally azor ahai is supposed to be descended from aerys the mad king and rhaella targaryen if rumors about jon’s parentage are true aerys and rhaella could be his grandparents so there you have it jon snow the poor bastard of winterfell could very well be the prince that was promised so is jon snow now definitely the only person who could be azor ahai o k i know what you’re thinking if anyone is going to be a cool reincarnation of the savior of mankind it should be daenerys targaryen and it’s true dany has a lot of azor ahaiish qualities she was born in salt and smoke her tears drogo’s pyre she awoke stone dragons she sacrificed a loved one and she’s certainly of the aerysrhaella targaryen bloodline they are her parents so why isn’t daenerys azor ahai well she might be there’s a part of the prophecy that says “the dragon has three heads” and many take that to mean azor ahai will actually be three people—probably the three dragon riders you can read all about dragon riders here  so that means jon snow daenerys targaryen and oh yes probably tyrion lannister will together form the prophesied savior hey if we’re going for jesus analogies why not go for the whole trinity and jon and dany together form you guessed it a song of ice and fire so what will azor ahai do well according to legend azor ahai will wake dragons from stone  check  he will defend the realms of men against the white walkers  working on it  and he’ll likely pair up with the children of the forest to defeat the others that’s what happened last time and martin is really big on history repeating how convenient then that jon’s ”brother“ bran has been chilling with the c o t f all season presumably learning how to make magic grenades and tap into the mystical treeroot network if the efforts of azor ahai reborn and the c o t f fail the realms of man will fall no pressure jon and dany could anyone other than melisandre bring jon snow back sure have you thought about the night’s king he loves resurrecting people you can read all about that theory here if kit harington is coming back how are they going to keep this under wraps i have no idea like i said they’re being pretty clear with the “he’s gone” business in that entertainment weekly interview but on the other hand there are already rumors that he’s filming in belfast so it may be a seasonlong guessing game    until it’s not what is kit harington just not supposed to do press or anything until the premiere good luck hbo you have your work cut out for you we should touch on one last major book spoiler that could still happen in the show proceed with caution are they gone good is this why they never brought back lady stoneheart as long as there is a single second of airtime left in the game of thrones tv series i personally will cling to the hope that lady stoneheart aka catelyn stark will make an appearance but it makes sense that weiss and david benioff cut out thoros of myr bringing her back in order to maximize the impact of jon’s potential resurrection if you’ve already had one stark come back from the dead a second stark is sort of hohumoldhat but now once azor ahai is reborn could there still be room for catelyn to return maybe be still my stony heart get vanity fair’s hwd newsletter sign up for essential
