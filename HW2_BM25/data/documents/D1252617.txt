they are available in both pill and nasal forms however decongestants will not cure sinusitis nasal decongestants may actually worsen sinusitis by increasing sinus inflammation due to the lack of evidence for the benefit of nasal decongestants in treating sinusitis the fda ruled ordered manufacturers of overthecounter otc nasal decongestant products to remove from their labeling all references to sinusitis your doctor may still recommend that you take either an otc or prescription nasal decongestant to help relieve blockage symptoms associated with sinusitis if you think you have sinusitis check with your doctor before taking a decongestant do not try to treat sinusitis by yourself decongestants should not be used at all in infants and children under the age of 4 years and some doctors recommend not giving them to children under the age of 14 children are at particular risk for central nervous system side effects including convulsions rapid heart rates loss of consciousness and death expectorants expectorants are drugs that cause mucus to be coughed up from the lungs the most common type is guaifenesin which is found in many overthecounter otc cough syrups as well as prescription products expectorants used to be recommended for treatment of sinusitisassociated cough but some recent guidelines advise against their use like decongestants cough medicines should not be given to children younger than age 4 years according to the american college of chest physicians accp expectorants and cough suppressants do not help treat cough the accp recommends that adults instead take a decongestant or antihistamine to relieve cough the accp also recommends against otc cold and cough medicine for children ages 14 years and younger parents should talk with their child’s pediatrician for advice on treating cough specific antibiotics used for sinusitis penicillins amoxicillin amoxil polymox trimox wymox or any generic formulation has been the most widely prescribed antibiotic for acute sinusitis this penicillin is both inexpensive and at one time was highly effective against the s pneumoniae bacteria unfortunately bacterial resistance to amoxicillin has increased significantly both among s pneumoniae and h influenzae and penicillin is no longer as reliable as it once was amoxicillinclavulanate augmentin is a type of penicillin that works against a wide spectrum of bacteria an extended release form has been approved for treating adults with sinusitis infections that have become resistant to penicillin cephalosporins they are often classed by generation first generation includes cephalexin keflex cefadroxil duricef ultracef and cephradine velosef second generation include cefaclor ceclor cefuroxime ceftin cefprozil cefzil and loracarbef lorabid third generation include cefpodoxime vantin cefdinir omnicef cefditoren sprectracef cefixime suprax and ceftibuten cedex ceftriaxone rocephin is an injected cephalosporin these are effective against a wide range of bacteria cephalosporins are usually safe for patients with mild penicillin allergies rash but should be avoided in patients with highgrade penicllin allergies hives airway swelling collapse macrolides macrolides are often used to treat mildtomoderate bacterial sinusitis in patients who are allergic to penicillin some of the most common macrolids are azithromycin zithromax clarithromycin biaxin and roxithromycin rulid an extendedrelease form of azithromycin zmax is available as a single dose treatment for mildtomoderate acute bacterial sinusitis these antibiotics are also effective against many strains of s pneumoniae and m catarrhalis but macrolideresistance is common erythromycin is not effective against h influenzae macrolides have antiinflammatory actions which may have benefits for some patients with chronic sinusitis trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole bactrim cotrim septra is another firstline antibiotic for sinusitis it is less expensive than amoxicillin and particularly useful for patients with mild sinusitis who are allergic to penicillin it is no longer effective however against certain streptococcal strains it should not be used in patients whose infections occurred after dental work or in patients allergic to sulfa drugs allergic reactions can be very serious fluoroquinolones quinolones fluoroquinolones also simply called quinolones interfere with the bacterias genetic material so they cannot reproduce newer generation fluoroquinolones which include levofloxacin levaquin gatifloxacin tequin and moxifloxacin avelox are currently the most effective antibiotics against the common bacteria that cause sinusitis they are recommended for adults with moderate sinusitis who have already been treated with antibiotics within 6 weeks or who are allergic to betalactam antibiotics some of the newer fluoroquinolones only need to be taken once a day which make compliance easier some but not all quinolones cause photosensitivity s pneumoniae strains resistant to the quinolones have been uncommon in the u s but their numbers are increasing lincosamides lincosamides prevent bacteria from reproducing the most common lincosamide is clindamycin cleocin this antibiotic is useful against many s pneumoniae bacteria but not against h influenzae tetracyclines tetracyclines inhibit bacterial growth they include doxycycline tetracycline and minocycline they can be effective against s pneumoniae and m catarrhalis but bacteria that are resistant to penicillin are also often resistant to doxycycline tetracyclines have unique side effects among antibiotics including skin reactions to sunlight possible burning in the throat and tooth discoloration they should not be used by children or pregnant women corticosteroids for chronic sinusitis benefits of corticosteroid nasal sprays nasalspray corticosteroids most commonly called steroids are effective drugs for treating allergic rhinitis they also help in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and are sometimes used for acute sinusitis some studies have reported that when combined with antibiotics they speed recovery and improve healing rates of complicated or chronic sinusitis compared to antibiotics alone nasal spray steroids are safe and have the following benefits they reduce inflammation and mucus production they improve night sleep and daytime alertness in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis they appear to be beneficial in treating polyps in the nasal passages nasalspray brands corticosteroids available in nasal spray form include triamcinolone nasacort approved for children over age 6 mometasone furoate nasonex approved for use in patients as young as age 3 fluticasone flonase flounce approved for children over age 4 beclomethasone beconase vancenase flunisolide nasalide and budesonide rhinocort approved for children over age 6 side effects corticosteroids are powerful antiinflammatory drugs although oral steroids can have many side effects the nasalspray form affects only local areas and the risk for wide spread side effects is very low unless the drug is used excessively dryness burning stinging in the nasal passage sneezing headaches and nosebleed these side effects are uncommon but should be reported to your doctor immediatelyantifungals for chronic sinusitis scientists are investigating whether antifungal drugs may help treat chronic sinusitis one such drug amphotericin b sinu nase is currently in phase iii trials for patients who have had sinus surgery but are still
