president some took them at the end of their terms while others destroyed them franklin d roosevelt was the first to make them available to the public when he donated them to the national archives in 1939 as the franklin d roosevelt presidential library and museum but did so voluntarily 1 the watergate scandal and richard nixons subsequent resignation from office complicated the issue however in september 1974 richard nixon made an agreement with the head of the general services administration arthur f sampson to turn over most materials from his presidency including tape recordings of conversations he had made in the white house however the recordings were to be destroyed after september 1 1979 if directed by nixon or by september 1 1984 or his death otherwise alarmed that nixons tapes may be lost congress abrogated the nixon–sampson agreement by passing the presidential recordings and materials preservation act which was signed into law by president gerald ford in december 1974 it applied specifically to materials from the nixon presidency directing nara to take ownership of the materials and process them as quickly as possible private materials were to be returned to nixon as a result of the presidential recordings and materials preservation act president nixons white house papers and tapes were held by the national archives thus they could not be transferred to a

of empty exhibit space announced that the new exhibit was scheduled to open in july 2010 the nixon foundation objected to the proposed exhibit specifically the process by which the proposed exhibit
