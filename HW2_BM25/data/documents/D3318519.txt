and various ketones thinner mineral spirits benzene acetone trichloroethylene tetrachloroethylene and paint or varnish remover acetone toluene benzene dichloromethane solvents are a heterogeneous group of volatile hydrocarbons derived from oil and gas whose boiling point is low so that they evaporate on contact with air their importance and usage pattern determine their classification active solvents cosolvents latent solvents and diluents solvent characteristics uses and applications alcohols methanol colorless liquid characteristic odor soluble in acetone and esters dimlyburning flame miscible in water in all proportions used as an industrial solvent in the manufacture of formaldehyde methyl acetate and plasticizers as additives for gasoline as a solvent in the manufacture of cholesterol streptomycin vitamins and hormones as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol in general industry used as a solvent in making lacquers films plastics soaps textiles artificial leather paint removers varnish and antifreeze solutions isopropanol colorless liquid with odor characteristic of alcohol similar to ethanol but more toxic substitute for alcohol in cosmetic preparations significant

soluble in alcohol acetone and ether used especially as a vegetable oil extractor to perform polymerization reactions as a paint thinner as a solvent in the preparation of thinners as denatured alcohol as a raw material for organic synthesis in the development of thinners chlorines tetrachloroethylene colorless liquid with characteristic odor used as a solvent for degreasing metals in dry cleaning in the manufacture of soap methylene chloride volatile liquid colorless pleasing sweet smell slightly soluble in water but miscible with most organic solvents in practical terms not flammable or explosive in conditions of normal use used primarily as a solvent in the removal of paint and varnish during manufacturing other applications include the manufacture of agrochemicals and domestic cleaning aerosols glycol ethers butyl cellosolve colorless liquid with characteristic mild odor one of the glycol ethers with a high boiling point widely used as a retardant solvent for lacquers and leveler for color film completely soluble in water used as a solvent for nitrocellulose resins spray lacquers quickdrying lacquers varnishes used in textiles to prevent stains from weaving or imprinting as a solvent for mineral oils for suspension of soaps in a solution to help improve the emulsifying properties in general as an inert solvent retardant thinner and coupling agent mixes
