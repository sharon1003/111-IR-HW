editorial reviews product description private radio by billy bob thornton when sold by amazoncom this product will be manufactured on demand using cdr recordable media amazoncoms standard return policy will apply amazoncom you wouldnt expect the man behind sling blade to turn out a pedestrian album but billy bob thorntons country debut turns out to be surprising both for its risks and for its routine to his credit thornton with marty stuart producing bypasses radio formula for a different kind of connection with his listener veering from lengthy spoken verse to retro hillbilly deluxe but does the listener want to hear what he has to say in the opening song dark and mad thornton seems to telegraph the brooding danger of his most famous film role yet almost immediately he gets lost in ruminations so personal that he almost forgets theres an audience waiting to be involved past the kinky charm of forever a bluesy oneway telephone conversation in which he tells his main squeeze hes wearing the feathered pink panties she left in his car theres a love song to his wife thats 180 degrees from passion a revamped salute to john f kennedy and a nineandahalfminute piece of theatrical southern gothic about witnessing a disturbing sexual encounter as a child its a weird trip and totally unfocused as if he just recorded whatever came into his head but theres no denying thorntons outthere charisma or the croaky appeal of his arkansas twang alanna nash go unlimited start your 30day free trial stream private radio by billy bob thornton and tens of millions of other songs on all

highwaystuart dark blue musical shame walkmountain top customer reviews graymalkin50 out of 5 stars private radio a musthavefebruary 8 2004format audio cd verified purchase okay i admit it i bought this cd primarily out of curiosity ive been a billy bob fan since slingblade and read that he had a cd heard a few cuts here at amazon and bought both private radio and billy bobs later recording the edge of the world i must say that i prefer the former billy bob thornton comes across on private radio as a downtoearth working guy who no doubt grew up listening to rock  roll with some healthy doses of waylon willie johnny and merle the lyrics are honest and heartfelt and the music is as downhome foot stompin as you can get marty stuart on acoustic guitar and mandolin gregg stocki on drums and barry beckett on hammond b3 organ and wurlitzer piano how classic can ya get add the musicianship on selected cuts from randy scruggs hank singer and larry paxton and youve got a wellrounded album indeed the music runs from the smoky barroom reflections of your blue shadow and walk of shame to the intimate settin round the frontroom story billy bob tells as the intro to that mountain to bluesy forever to the narrative beauty at the back door to the rockin smoking in bed and in every cut billy bob bares his heart and soul i think its the unpolished hey yall lets get marty over here and cut a record intimate atmosphere that appeals most to me about private radio billy bob comes across as a man youd like to sit on the front porch with one summer evening and shares a few jokes stories and maybe pick a few songs with overall billy bobs lyrics reveal a downtoearth yet deep and complex man the music as real and varied as the characters he creates on the screen unpretensious real and honest heck just buy the cd youll dig it read more comment 3 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse amazon customer50 out of 5 stars five stars november 14

proven himself a screen writer actor and director now hes a songwriter and singer with this cd private radio thornton voices an entire range of human emotionsfrom depression to anger to fear to love to lust to humor the opening track dark and mad is a brooding tale of love gone awry the following song forever is somewhat funny telling of a man wearing pink panties and under the influence of merle haggard go figure angelina is of course about thorntons wife starlight lounge is a sleazy duet with holly lamar walk of shame is a very powerful tune telling of broken hearts and abusive relationships smoking in bed is simply funnever mind the obvious druginfluence your blue shadow is haunting and yet somehow familiar to us all that mountain is a song about knowing what you want to do and never doing it he was a friend of mine is an oldie about jfk private radio the title track is filled with depression and the hope that lies at the end of the tunnel beauty at the back door is simply a long story and yet you get wrapped up in it amazing the final track is a remake of the old tune lost highway billy bob thornton proves that he can sing as well as he can act try private radio on your radiocdcassette player whatever i promise that youll love it comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse kindle customer40 out of 5 stars billy bobs magical mystery tour great country blues march 26 2002format audio cdcountry music legend has it that songwriter steve goodman once claimed to have written the perfect country song you never even called me by my name he took it to his friend david allan coe but coe objected because the song had nothing about trains trucks being in jail or mama the songwriter added a verse with all four and the rest is country music history billy bob thorntons private radio covers all these requisite topics and more but from an alternative perspective for example  in thorntons renditions jail isnt the county drunk tank instead its the everyday jail created by poverty tribal knowledge and childhood traumas that are hard to shake private radio beauty at the back door your blue shadow  mama and trains make it onto the album too but this time mama hears the train in the distance but never makes it out of the holler to see it over that mountain perhaps the weakest link on this album is thorntons acknowledgmenthomage to his wife angelina jolie angelina its not that the song is particularly weak the lyrics are unique and sweet without being sugary however this tune has a subtle pop flavor that doesnt quite fit the rest of the album even though randy scruggs plays guitar and bass for the track its a likeable tune though and after a few listens youll find yourself humming the chorus at odd moments the final cut is a cover of hank williams lost highway an homage perfect in every detail right down to the steel guitar used for williams original version played once again in this recording by the legendary don helms with this album billy bob thornton shares a bit of his experiences both those growing up in arkansas and those he has out in the rest of the world when hes no longer strictly a country boy in particular these later experiences are common to all whether were former country folk or not from the one night stand to the blue shadows we carry of those in our past there is something here that will resonate for everyone marty stuart both produced this album and played guitar mandolin andor bass for a number of tracks his liner notes are particularly interesting and help to place the album in the context of its intent if you buy cds to function as musical wallpaper background music about which you dont have to think too hard this is not the album for you if all your country cds are hat acts or pop crossovers this is definitely not the album for you but if you like to mine for the subtext beneath your twang you wont be disappointed in this cd steve earle steve goodman and jerry jeff walker fans would probably also like the alternativeprogressive kind of countryblues music that thornton with the help of marty stuart has put on this album read more
