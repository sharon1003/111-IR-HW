periodical cicada frequently asked questions…a selection of answers to some commonly emailed questions about periodical cicadas when will the periodical cicadas appear in my area none are expected in 2006 the next emergence 17year brood xiii will occur in the upper midwest including chicago in late may through june of 2007 check out the brood maps on the main site for upcoming years even if the maps suggest that cicadas are going to emerge be in your area remember that cicada populations are patchy so they may be in woods nearby but not at your house etc periodical cicadas are only found east of the great plains when do the cicadas start to come out in the springtime – late april or may in the warmer states and may or early june in the cooler states the nonperiodical “annual cicada” species emerge from late june into late summer see the main site for explanations of periodical vs annual cicadas when exactly do they start to come out ie i’m planning a wedding in may help check out the cicada wedding guide at wwwcicadamaniacom how long will the cicadas be out in my yardneighborhoodcity about 46 weeks after they first start emerging most individual cicadas live only a few weeks but since they emerge over a period of two weeks or so the whole event lasts longer the serious noise will get going about a week and half after you first notice them and will last about two weeks more after that things get a lot quieter will cicadas chew up my plants no cicadas do not chew – they have no chewing mouthparts and they feed drink really more like aphids adult and nymphal cicadas feed on plant sap called xylem  the watery part of the plant sap  which they suck up through their proboscis feeding tube feeding by periodical cicadas does not seem to affect trees and shrubs very much because they take only a small fraction of the water passing through will cicadas hurt my perennialsannuals probably not cicadas have little interest in these plants except if any are woody you may see teneral newly emerged cicadas sitting on such plants or emerging on them but they will soon move up into the trees will cicadas hurt my young trees possibly adult cicadas singing and flying and feeding on young trees are very unlikely to do any damage however females do piercecut small branches on woody plants to insert their eggs and if too many cicadas do this the branches may weaken die andor break off the best way to prevent this is to cover such young plants with cheesecloth but before going to this trouble wait until you see how many cicadas are out in your immediate area female cicadas will not begin laying eggs until at least one week after they first emerge so there is no hurry cicadas do not usually move more than a few hundred meters to lay their eggs can the cicadas hurt me no cicadas don’t bite or sting defensively and they are not toxic or poisonous i saw lots of cicadas emerge but they all disappeared and i can’t hear any singing – where did they go newly emerged cicadas teneral cicadas take about five days of good weather before the males start singing tenerals move higher into the trees when they have hardened enough to climb many of the earlyemerging cicadas are eaten by birds as well – look for discarded wings on the ground under the trees i hear a loud repetitive noise at night is this cicadas singing no there are no cicadas in the u s that sing at night when magicicada populations are very dense some individuals may utter short bursts of sound during unusually hot nights but this behavior is not typical most noises at night are crickets katydids or frogs can cicadas see ie did it have to land on me  yes cicadas have very good vision they have five eyes two large red compound eyes on the sides of the head and three small ocelli simple eyes located in a triangle on the front of the head periodical cicadas simply don’t much care what they land on since in natural circumstances everything they land on is a tree don’t take it personally when periodical cicadas land on your headpetcar etc even the nymphs can see when they emerge from their burrows to metamorphose  they can head towards a tree or your leg  anything vertical  in the neardarkness from many meters away how loud are periodical cicadas this is not an easy question to answer since it depends where you are  even a 747 taking off sounds quiet if you are a mile away some of the louder choruses reach 90 decibels as perceived while standing under the tree individual periodical cicadas are actually not that loud as cicadas go why do i hear cicadas every year there are 150 or so species of cicada in the u s including species of okanagana diceroprocta cicadetta  neocicada cacama okanagodes  magicicada and other genera only the seven magicicada species have synchronized development and “periodical” emergences meaning that all individuals in a population are always the same age the rest of the species the socalled “annual cicadas” have unsynchronized development so some individuals mature in every year and we hear them every summer check out the main cicada pages to find out more about these annual species what purpose do they serve this question is tough to answer from a scientific point of view because biologists explain organisms as products of natural selection the evolutionary process in which traits that increase reproductive success tend to be preserved in future generations however in biology we do examine the effects that cicadas and other species have on each other and on their environment and this is related to what people often have in mind when they ask about the purpose of a given species periodical cicadas are exploited as a food source by a wide variety of species but only underground or microsymbiotic organisms can evolve to specialize on them since they appear aboveground so rarely the tunnels of nymphal cicadas aerate the soil and presumably influence soil ecology and tree growth the twig damage caused by female oviposition actually acts like a pruning for some trees stimulating future growth for many people periodical cicadas are a marvel of nature a source of many intriguing evolutionary puzzles…or for some just a nuisance
