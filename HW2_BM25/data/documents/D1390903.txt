calculating the distance to a lightning strike britannica editors  july 5 2012a flash of lightning brightens the sky and is followed seven seconds later by the ominous roar of thunder how far away was the lightning strike cloudtoground lightning discharge in a field from a cumulonimbus cloud credit © hemerathinkstock sound waves propagate through different materials at different speeds in air at a temperature of 70° f 222° c sound travels at a speed of about 1129 feet 344 meters per second which is roughly equivalent to onefifth of a mile in one second or one mile in five seconds or one kilometer in about three seconds counting the seconds between the strike and the arrival of the thunder and dividing the number of seconds by five gives us a rough estimate of the distance to the strike in miles dividing by three for a distance in kilometers so in the example above the strike would have been about 14 miles about 23 km away while not an exact science since humidity has slight effects on the speed of sound since actual temperature may be above or below 70° f and since the discharge of lightning is highly unpredictable this calculation does allow one to quickly estimate his or her distance from a storm top as shown in the chart the elapsed time between seeing a flash of lightning and hearing the thunder is roughly three seconds for each kilometre or five seconds for each mile bottom an observer’s relative distance from the main lightning channel and its secondary branches determines whether thunder is heard to start with a sudden clap or a softer rumbling credit encyclopædia britannica inc posted in environment facts that matter picture of the day science science  technology
