see i was a former 1er in empower network but knew i had to get out this video explains your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video all good let’s continue…empower network update on august 1 2017 dave wood announced that empower network no longer exists and would enter bankruptcy court dave wood update in early june 2017 dave wood was admitted to rehab according to his brother william he made some poor decisions and will step away from empower network for at least one year here is my original review the famed era of empower network was mostly 2012 and 2013 cofounders dave wood and dave sharpe were like tupac their message was unapologetic “don’t be a damned wussy and buy all the products” or “fight the forces of evil” they said it was genius and the people loved it i remember driving down for the san diego event and seeing lines out the door of people buying dave woodsharpe and “fight the forces of evil” shirts before the event even started i remember dave wood would hop on these “inner circle” calls every monday and make fun of the corporate lifestyle and then hype the best leaders in the company everyone got pumped i was pumped too as i was brainwashed from an oceanside hammock in el tunco el salvador listening to dave wood go off i wanted to be a part of the movement empower network was cult then it seems the mood changed they stopped updating their digital products i mean their products were “video vaults” education you gotta update these i loved the original empower network products i was coming up in marketing at that time still working for seocom and i was eating up the training fresh updated infoproducts that taught seo ppc solo ads – all by marketers who were making at least 15kmo on the internet so this was mid2014 or so they hyped this product blog relaunch called the “blog beast” and it completely tanked it offered zero value to the marketplace which sucked cause it was their flagship product at the time which also massively sucked for me because at this exact time i started to rank top 3 on google for “empower network” as i do till this dayafter the failed launch they kept adding “supplemental products” to the company instead of refreshing and updating their existing products so you had people dropping 500 1000 and 3500 for these digital products which people were mostly cool with – because you would get paid 100 commissions on those and then they kept launching additional products that paid limited commissions or no commissions at all“pull out your credit cards again and buy this too if you’re loyal to empower” they implied people kept buying stuff but then the message was lost“what does ‘getting all in’ even mean anymore dave” the masses wondered all of the sudden the ‘coolness factor’ was lost and then it was the beginning of a painful decline leaders start leaving then dave sharpe the cofounder bounces for “health reasons” dave wood goes through a divorce and another relationship then we learn wood and sharpe beefed for 2 years after sharpe’s departure and now you pretty much have a company that was founded 5 years ago starting from scratch today you hop on a dave wood call which i do from time to time cause i seriously miss the dude and he’s still dropping gems for the people but then he’s also launching or relaunching another product too translation manufacturing hype vintage network marketing i taught this in part 2 of my mlm piece which has now been read by over a million people one thing is for sure dave wood and his loyalty to empower network is undeniable he doesn’t quit through the highs and lows he is there for his people either way it’s been tough to watch and i hope the best for empower network even though i’ve moved on from my mlm ways—here is the rest of my original empower network review that will provide more context to those unfamiliar with the company empower network is an online network marketing company that sells internet marketing tools and training namely a blogging platform and a line of digital products that teach people how to make money on the internet then as a home based business opportunity you have the option to sell the products and receive commissions before starting empower network cofounder david wood endured years of approaching welldressed people in walmart 3ways home meetings and other traditional multilevelmarketing activities then he figured out a way to scale his businesses the internet way teams up with david sharpe and together they launch empower network on october 31 2011 one week later the company does 1 million in paid commissions and takes off a movement is started think newage mlm products empower network has five core products although new empower network “addons” like ipas 2 have bundled the products to add simplicity here are the five core kalatu blog 25mo web blogging platform and mobile app for i phoneandroid…i’d say it’s comparable to word press frameworks like genesis and thesis – the kalatu comes with 8 different themes and targets people in the network and affiliate marketing industry while also providing options for the small business and real estate spaces good product revolutionary hardly but a much better improvement from their original blogging platform you can get started for 9inner circle 100mo an archived audio library that feature empower network leaders delivering weekly mindsetinspirational calls since late ‘2011 lot’s of hype and redundancy you’ll hear dave sharpe’s addiction stories 50 times if you listened to all of them but some great gems in there to get your mind right top producer formula 500 learn the best skillsets and howto’s from empower network elite – this seems to be the old 15k formula team building formula 1000 the ultimate presentation about team duplication specifically for multilevel marketing teams mass influence formula 3500 power presentations on sales and persuasion produced by the bigleagues and elite compensation plan november 2015 update empower network rolls out a unilevel compensation plan it has a ton of ranks – it appears the comp plan primarily achieves manufactured urgencyhere is the old empower network compensation plan in thirty seconds you only earn commissions for products you’ve purchased if you aren’t qualified they pass up to the next person who is qualifiedyou get 100 payouts on all the products except master’s course where you get paid a 3000 commission for 3500 sale …however you pass up your 2nd 4th 6th sale and every fifth sale after that — on each product finally there is a 1999 monthly affiliate fee that you pay to sell the products you can see how the en comp plan was a little different from other digital mlms see zukul infinii and wealthy affiliate  recap so real quick…the good empower network is ‘big ticket’ earn up to 4625 per affiliate most of the tools and training are toptier and their sales funnel flatout works the bad some of their products desperately need upgrades and a lot of spammy ‘mefirst’ marketers promote it thanks for taking the time to read my empower network review like i said in the intro they had a good run somewhere along the way though the message became lost—in case you just scrolled to the bottom i decided to part ways with empower network in 2014 even though i was a 1er affiliate in the company i have since quadrupled my income travel the world and make more money than most doctors and lawyers in other words you might like this because it teaches the “good life” without mlm product relaunches and upsales
