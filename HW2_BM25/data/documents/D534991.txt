cellular respiration notes cellular respiration is the process of using oxygen in the mitochondria to chemically break down organic molecules such as glucose to release the energy stored in its bonds in the process molecules of water and carbon dioxide are released as waste products some of the energy is used to make adenosine triphosphate atp from adenosine diphosphate and phosphate atp is the main energy currency of cells below is the structural formula for atp from wikipedia notice the three phosphate molecules on the left to release energy one phosphate is removed leaving adp to store energy the phosphate is replaced and adp is restored to atp image source heterotrophs as well as autotrophs utilize cellular respiration to supply the energy to power cellular activities to understand cellular respiration one must understand the principles of photosynthesis why do you think that is so if you need more information about photosynthesis read dr michael j farabees useful online book about the topic one simple explanation is this through the process of photosynthesis the energy from sunlight is used to change water and carbondioxide into glucose with oxygen being tossed out as a waste byproduct animation source photosynthesis equation cellular respiration equation cellular respiration begins with a biochemical pathway called glycolysis this is a process in which one molecule of glucose is broken in half by enzymes in the cytoplasm producing 2 molecules of pyruvic acid and only 2 molecules of atp glycolysis releases a relatively small amount of the energy stored in glucose if oxygen is present glycolysis acts as the first step for 2 more processes the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain this series of reactions produces 36 molecules of atpall processes that require oxygen are described as aerobic cellular respiration is an aerobic process if sufficient oxygen is not present in the cell glycolysis is followed by a different pathway called fermentation fermentation does not produce much energy processes that do not require oxygen are anaerobic processes fermentation is an anaerobic process the following drawing depicts the events of fermentation notice that glycolysis is the first step in the process that results in 2 molecules of ethanol alcohol cellular respiration  aerobic processes you can draw an analogy between the process of cellular respiration in your cells and a car the mitochondria represent the engines of our cells where sugar is burned for fuel and the exhaust is co 2 and h 2 o note that in a car that burned fuel perfectly the only exhaust should theoretically be co 2 and h 2 o also there are 3 steps in the process of cellular respirationglycolysisthe krebs cycle andthe electron transport chain1 aerobic respiration â€“ occurs when the two pyruvic acid molecules from glycolysis are modified and diffuse into the mitochondria where the next two processes occura the krebs cycle also known as the citric acid cycle produces 2 atp molecules 10 energy carrier molecules and co 2 from each glucose molecule these energy carriers move on to the next stepb the electron transport chain is a series of chemical reactions that produces 34 atp molecules and h 2 o from the carrier molecules that were produced in the krebs cycle image source glucose is converted to pyruvate through a series of reactions that use 2 molecules of atp and produce 4 molecules for a net gain of 2 atp pyruvate enters the mitochondrion and is processed through the krebs cycle products from krebs diffuse through the inner mitochondrial membranes in the electron transport chain oxygen atoms accept hydrogen ions and form water to remove the hydrogen ions remember exploring the organelles that are found in a cell we learned about an organelle called the mitochondrionthe powerhouse of the cell heres how that organelle got its nickname the bulk of a cells atp is produced in the mitochondria image source to be energy efficient particles must move through the membrane with little energy expense electron transport produces an uneven charge on the mitochondria membrane this allows protons to move through the membrane by electrical charge attraction rather than by using energy protons now move through the membrane and are used by atp synthase enzyme to recycle adp molecules and phosphate molecules to produce atp2 anaerobic respiration  fermentation is an anaerobic process there are several forms of fermentation two of these forms are lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation lactic acid fermentation occurs in animal cells when there is no oxygen available pyruvic acid is converted into a waste product called lactic acid when lactic acid builds up in tissues it causes muscle soreness this causes the burning sensation in your muscles alcoholic fermentation occurs in some plants and unicellular organisms such as yeast and bacteria the process converts pyruvic acid into ethyl alcohol and a carrier compound giving off co2 which allows glycolysis to continue this process occurs when making bread beer and wine comparing energy yield aerobic respiration with oxygen can produce 36 atp molecules from each glucose molecule anaerobic respiration without oxygen only allows production of 2 atp molecules from each glucose molecule therefore aerobic respiration is significantly more efficient than anaerobic respiration3 energy and exercise cells normally contain small amounts of atp produced during glycolysis and cellular respiration at the start of a race muscle cells only contain enough atp for a few seconds of activity when running a long race muscle cells are producing most of their atp by lactic acid fermentation when the race is over the only way to get rid of the extra lactic acid is to acquire more oxygen this is known as an  oxygen debt  because oxygen must be paid back to the cells to remove the lactic acid the debt is paid as you continue to breathe deeply for several moments after the activity stops for longer races cellular respiration is the only way to generate a continuing supply of atp it releases energy more slowly than fermentation in this image glucose is converted first to pyruvate then to lactic acid this image was based on a diagram published at estrella mountain community college4 relationship between photosynthesis and respirationhave you answered the earlier question about why you need to understand the principles of photosynthesis to fully understand cellular respiration these two processes are the reverse of each other water carbon dioxide carbohydrates and oxygen cycle between these two processes energy moves through both processes in one direction click here for a pdf version of the chart belowreturn to top  previous
