estimates and they are all supposed to be estimates of longrun elasticity a little more than half of these is estimated using method a and the rest using a method b somewhere i read something like i think method b estimates something very different than method a because the estimates are much 5060 higher my knowledge of robust statistics is next to nothing so i only calculated the sample means and medians of both samples and i immediately saw the difference method a is very concentrated the difference between median and mean is very little but method b sample varied wildly i concluded that the outliers and measurement errors skew the method b sample so i threw away about 50 values about 15 that were very inconsistent with theory and suddenly the means of both samples including their ci were very similar the density plots as well in the quest of eliminating outliers i looked at the range of sample a and removed all sample points in b that fell outside it i would like you to tell me where i could find out some basics of robust estimation of means that would allow me to judge this situation more rigorously and to have some references i do not need very deep understanding of various techniques rather read through a comprehensive survey of the methodology of robust estimation i ttested for significance of mean difference after removing the outliers and the pvalue is 00559 t around 19 for the full samples the t stat was around 45 but that is not really the point the means can be a bit different but they should not differ by 5060 as stated above and i dont think they

practice of removing outliers is of dubious statistical credibility you can make data to give significance or lack of significance at any level by doing that are populations a and b which received measurements using methods a and b truly homogenous populations or is it possible that your methods have just given you different populations – adam o mar 3 12 at 1854there will be no further calculations or analysis to be done with the data both of the methods mentioned are consistent according to recent research so the populations should be homogenous but the data is not of great quality and it is clear some of the values in b are there by mistake the method is error prone they make absolutely no economic sense i know the removal is dubious that is why i am looking for something more rigorous and credible – ondrej mar 3 12 at 1910add a comment3 answers active oldest votesup vote12down voteaccepted are you looking for the theory or something practical if you are looking for books

for practical methods here are few robust methods of estimating the mean estimators of location is i guess the more principled term the median is simple wellknown and pretty powerful it has excellent robustness to outliers the price of robustness is about 25 the 5trimmed average is another possible method here you throw away the 5 highest and 5 lowest values and then take the mean average of the result this is less robust to outliers as long as no more than 5 of your data points are corrupted it is good but if more than 5 are corrupted it suddenly turns awful it doesnt degrade gracefully the price of robustness is less than the median though i dont know what it is exactly the hodgeslehmann estimator computes the median of the set a set containing values where are the observations this has very good robustness it can handle corruption of up to about 29 of the data points without totally falling apart and the price of robustness is low about 5 it is a plausible alternative to the median the interquartile mean is another estimator that is sometimes used it computes the average of the first and third quartiles and thus is simple to compute it has very good robustness it can tolerate corruption of up to 25 of the data points however the price of robustness is nontrivial about 25 as a result this seems inferior to the median there are many other measures that have been proposed but the ones above seem reasonable in short i would suggest the median or possibly the hodgeslehmann estimator p s oh i should explain what i mean by the price of robustness a robust estimator is designed to still work decently well even if some of your data points have been corrupted or are otherwise outliers but what if you use a robust estimator on a data set that has no outliers and no corruption ideally wed like the robust estimator to be as efficient at making use of the data as possible here we can measure the efficiency by the standard error intuitively the typical amount of error in the estimate produced by the estimator it is known that if your observations come from a gaussian distribution iid and if you know you wont need robustness then the mean is optimal it has the smallest possible estimation error the price of robustness above is how much the standard error increases if we apply a particular robust estimator to this situation a price of robustness of 25 for the median means that the size of the typical estimation error with the median will be about 25 larger than the size of the typical estimation error with the mean obviously the lower the price is the bettershare

thats also how it is defined in eg rs wilcoxtest  confinttrue function do you have sources for the definition where the diagonal is left out– caracal mar 5 12 at 13411 this is really excellent i have one nitpick however i would not use the phrase error term in your last paragraph as it is often used to mean something else i would use standard error of the sampling distribution or just standard error instead – gung ♦ mar 5 12 at 1705a very well structured and concise answer thank you an overview is what i needed i will read through the paper suggested by henrik and should be covered for long
