after decades of moral arguments reaching biblical proportions after long twisted journeys to the nations highest court and back the death penalty may be abandoned by several states for a reason having nothing to do with right or wrong money turns out it is cheaper to imprison killers for life than to execute them according to a series of recent surveys tens of millions of dollars cheaper politicians are learning during a tumbling recession when nearly every state faces job cuts and massive deficits so an increasing number of them are considering abolishing capital punishment in favor of life imprisonment not on principle but out of financial necessity its 10 times more expensive to kill them than to keep them alive though most americans believe the opposite said donald mc cartin a former california jurist known as the hanging judge of orange county for sending nine men to death row deep into retirement he lost his faith in an eye for an eye and now speaks against it what changed a mind so set on the ultimate punishment waste of time and money californias legendarily slow appeals system which produces an average wait of nearly 20 years from conviction to fatal injection — the longest in the nation of the nine convicted killers mc cartin sent to death row only one has died not by execution but from a heart attack in custody advertiseevery one of my cases is bogged up in the appellate system said mc cartin who retired in 1993 after 15 years on the bench its a waste of time and money said the 82yearold selfdescribed rightwing republican whose sonorous voice still commands attention the only thing it does is prolong the agony of the victims families in 2007 time and money were the reasons new jersey became the first state to ban executions since the u s supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 democratic gov jon corzine commuted the executions of 10 men to life imprisonment without parole legal costs were too great and produced no result lawmakers said after spending an estimated 42 million for each death sentence the state had executed no one since 1963 also eliminating capital punishment eliminated the risk of executing an innocent person out of 36 remaining states with the death penalty at least eight have considered legislation this year to end it — maryland nebraska colorado new mexico montana new hampshire washington and kansas — an uncommon marriage between eastern liberals and western conservatives built on economic hardship this is the first time in which cost has been the prevalent issue in discussing the death penalty said richard dieter director of the death penalty information center a data clearinghouse that favors abolition of capital punishment dna evidence the most recent arguments against it centered on the everincreasing number of convicts cleared by dna evidence some of the worst cases occurred in illinois in 2000 thengov george h ryan placed a moratorium on executions after 13 people had been exonerated from death row for reasons including genetic testing and recanted testimony ryan declared the system so fraught with error that it has come close to the ultimate nightmare the states taking of innocent life he commuted the sentences of all 167 death row convicts most to life imprisonment without parole his moratorium is still in effect across the country the number of prisoners exonerated and released from death row is more than 130 with thousands of appeals clogging the courts death penalty trials are more expensive for several reasons they often require extra lawyers there are strict experience requirements for attorneys leading to lengthy appellate waits while capable counsel is sought for the accused security costs are higher as well as costs for processing evidence — dna testing for example is far more expensive than simple blood analyses after sentencing prices continue to rise it costs more to house death row inmates who are held in segregated sections in individual cells with guards delivering everything from daily meals to toilet paper advertise in california home to the nations biggest death row population at 667 it costs an extra 90000 per inmate to imprison someone sentenced to death — an additional expense that totals more than 633 million annually according to a 2008 study by the states commission on the fair administration of justice the panel which agreed with california chief justice ronald m george that the states death penalty system was dysfunctional blamed exorbitant costs on delays in finding qualified public defenders a severe backlog in appellate reviews and a high rate of cases being overturned on constitutional grounds failures in the administration of californias death penalty law create cynicism and disrespect for the rule of law concluded the 117page report some prominent californians have asked gov arnold schwarzenegger to get rid of executions especially now as service cuts and tax increases are pegged to fill a 42 billion budget hole but it appears that the republican governor will not abandon capital punishment anytime soon meanwhile the nationwide number of death sentences handed down has declined over the past decade from 284 in 1999 to 111 in 2008 reasons differ significantly depending on whos providing them prodeath penalty activists say its because crime rates have declined and execution is a strong deterrent abolitionists say its because jurors and judges are reluctant to risk taking a life when future scientific tests could prove the accused not guilty executions too are dropping there were 98 in 1999 37 in 2008
