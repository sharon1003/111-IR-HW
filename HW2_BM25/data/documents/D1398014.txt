iron curtain bibliographythe term iron curtain was coined by the british author and suffragette ethel snowden in her book through bolshevik russia 1920 in her very early and negative critique of the bolshevik form of communism this british feminist referred to the iron curtain simply as the contemporary geographical border of bolshevik russia in 1919  ‘ we were behind the ‘ iron curtain ’ at last ’  at the end of the nazi regime in germany the minister of propaganda joseph goebbels used the term in a journal article and several times in his private diary in february 1945 and the minister of finance lutz graf schwerin von krosigk used it in a radio broadcast on may 2 1945 both nazi leaders argued that the soviet army is occupying one country after the other lowering an iron curtain immediately afterward on these occupied countries in order to commit war crimes without being observed and controlled by the outside world during the last months of the third reich both ministers regarded the iron curtain as a moving part of the ongoing occupation process by soviet troops within the territorial scope of the yalta agreements from 1943 this analogy with an iron curtain in a theater goebbels was in charge of german theaters and culture in this usage of the notion refers to the fact that events behind the theater curtain are not visible by the audience and somehow cut off from outside observation the british prime minister winston s churchill used the term in a diplomatic telegram to president harry s truman in may 1945 and in a public speech in the british parliament on august 16 1945 but the term was not popularized until the following year with churchill ’ s speech at westminster college in fulton missouri on march 5 1946 from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe warsaw berlin prague vienna budapest belgrade bucharest and sofia all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what i must call the soviet sphere all are subject in one form or another not only to soviet influence but also to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from moscow cannadine 1990 pp 303 – 304the iron curtain refers to the boundary that divided europe politically and militarily from the end of world war ii until the end of the cold war geographically the borderline ran from estonia in the north to yugoslavia in the south churchill ’ s famous 1946 address which is sometimes referred to as the “ iron curtain speech ” is regarded as marking the commencement of the cold war between the democratic western world and the communist eastern bloc with the soviet union as its political center between 1946 and 1989 the existence of this symbolic boundary forced many central and east european countries to join the communist bloc under the control of the soviet union these countries — bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland romania and until the 1960s albania — were labeled “ iron curtain countries ”the iron curtain was manned and defended militarily against the west by the warsaw pact which combined the soviet red army and troops from the new communist oneparty states after the end of world war ii it also served as a wall to prevent citizens of eastern bloc countries from migrating west in berlin the section of the iron curtain dividing west from east germany took the form of the berlin wall a long concrete wall separating berlin into democratic and communist parts many east germans lost their lives trying to escape over the wall to the west in other areas the iron curtain was constructed of nearly impenetrable steel fencing creating a long and narrow strip of noman ’ sland of untouched wildlife the iron curtain was finally lifted on june 27 1989 at the border between austria and hungary by the foreign ministers gyula horn hungary and alois mock austria fortythree years after churchill ’ s historic speech this first crack in the long border between the free world and the communist world was the beginning of the final collapse of communism in november and december 1989 and the first sign of the fall of the soviet union in 1991 the fall of the iron curtain coincided with the end of the cold war signifying the end of a crucial
