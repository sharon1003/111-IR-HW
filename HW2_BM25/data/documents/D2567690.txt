why sexual reproduction is better than asexual reproduction i feel like a good place to start is with an investigation to understand why sexual reproduction is better than asexual reproduction on the surface asexual reproduction seems to have a lot more positive attributes than sexual reproduction organisms that reproduce asexually pass on a duplicate of their genetic material and dont have to worry about the random outcome of allele frequencies from crossing over asexual reproduction occurs more quickly because the organism doesnt have to find a mate to reproduce so asexual organisms dont have to worry about impressing anybody all of these qualities that asexual reproducers possess are great if the environment they live in is unchanging but what happens if the environment decides to change like it inevitably does well if the asexual reproducers arent fit for the environment they die and so will the rest of their offspring because they inherited the exact same disabilities that the parent organism had this is one of the instances that sexual reproduction really comes in handy if the parent of seven offspring dies because they was not adapt for the changes that occurred in the environment then the offspring still have a chance for survival if they inherited a trait from the other parent that would help them survive in the changing environment another reason why sexual reproduction is so beneficial is that it is better at combating disease if a parent has a disease like huntingtons disease and that person reproduces with someone who doesnt have the disease there is a chance that when they reproduce the child will not have the disease if a person reproduced asexually then if they had huntingtons disease then they would continually pass that on from generation to generation link of original site of video posted by caitlin at 127 pm
