retirees in determining where they want to live and can vary widely across the country while seven states have no income tax and two tax only interest and dividend income several have a relatively low income tax rate across all income levels for example the highest marginal income tax rates in arizona kansas new mexico and north dakota are below 5 percent some states have a relatively low flat tax regardless of income with the three lowest indiana 34 percent michigan 425 percent and pennsylvania 307 percent for 2014 the illinois flat tax rate will be reduced from 5 to 375 percent in 2015 state

states with a state sales tax rate of 7 percent include indiana mississippi new jersey rhode island and tennessee california has a state sales tax rate of 75 percent local sales and use taxes imposed by cities counties and other special taxing jurisdictions such as fire protection and library districts also can add significantly to the rate state and local property taxes while property values have declined over recent years in many areas – that has not necessarily been the case for property taxes however many states and some local jurisdictions offer senior citizen homeowners some form of property tax exemption credit abatement tax deferral refund or other benefits these tax breaks also are available to renters in some jurisdictions the benefits typically have qualifying restrictions that include age and income of the beneficiary state estate taxes estate taxes also can influence where seniors want to retire rules vary from state to state as well as from federal estate tax laws for example 18 states impose a tax on estates valued below the 525 million federal threshold for 2013 512 million for 2012 only delaware hawaii and north carolina use the federal exclusionary amount however three states have no estate tax at all – kansas oklahoma and arizona“the american taxpayer relief act brings more clarity on the federal level that only estates above the 5 million mark indexed for inflation will be subject to the federal estate tax” said wolters kluwer cch estate planning analyst james c walschlager ma “however the threshold in some states can be below 1 million for state estate taxes which can impose additional planning challenges”about cch a part of wolters kluwer cch a part of wolters kluwer  cchgroupcom is a leading global provider of tax accounting and audit
