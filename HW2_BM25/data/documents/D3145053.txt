13 leading progressives inspired by the coincidence of the attacks occurring in the host city for an upcoming climate change conference have tried to exploit the anguish caused by terrorism to promote their global governance agenda in a classic instance of never letting a crisis go to waste these amoral snake oil salesmen from leading democrats to prince charles have insisted we acknowledge a link between global warming and terrorist violence at first we laughed at this nonsense regarding it as the height of desperate rhetoric gradually however even as we laughed the seemingly impossible was happening a ridiculous lie was evolving into a provable fact – far more provable than global warming itself has turned out to be it is time at last for the denialists to face facts and overcome their kneejerk cynicism there really is a link between global warming and terrorism a little contextsetting is in order progressivism all its theoretical euphemisms aside is and always has been modern tyrannys ideological mask in other words it is merely rationalized powerlust powerlust in any form recognizes no moral rule higher than the satisfaction of its aim no ultimate truth beyond the need to subjugate others men whose minds are oriented in this way are sociopaths this makes progressivism the most advanced and organized form of sociopathy – sociopathy as politics malicious lies and violent means therefore are to be expected from true progressives – the sociopaths of modern politics – not as anomalies or aberrations but as essential instruments in realizing their main themes to be used whenever local conditions present the opportunity the chief practical difference between despotic progressivism and democratic progressivism lies in the level of sophistication required in the lying and the degree of subtlety with which coercion may be applied or utilized in every case progressivism in practice means the exploitation of real or perceived crises to promote increased government authority and decreased individual liberty to be achieved by means of lies that if repeated often enough should supplant reality in the collective mind this is why progressive philosophy in all its academic forms insists on both the malleability of truth and the collectivity of thought – ie the rejection of reason and common sense these are the only conditions in which their political strategy can fully succeed progressivisms perennial effort to defy reason and common sense has borne fruit at last finally against all odds and logic two plus two equals five and two wrongs make a right specifically the globalists pathological lying about climate change the end is nigh and islamic fundamentalism nothing to do with islam has achieved that progressive alchemy in which falsehood itself is transformed into truth – not the ersatz truth of propaganda but real incontrovertible truth yes global warming really is related to terrorism in a recent interview u n secretarygeneral ban kimoon said the following  watch it here  when we do not address climate change properly it may also affect many people who are frustrated and who are impacted then there is some possibility that these young people who are jobless and who are frustrated may join these foreign terrorist fighters therefore we have to address all of this comprehensively what does ban mean by all of this in the final sentence seen in context he clearly means the nexus between the two threats climate change and terrorism when the sympathetic interviewer asks ban whether he is actually linking climate change with terrorism he deftly changes the subject with a non sequitur its not directly linking but there is a concern that – whether this may overshadow a climate change agreement i think we have to move on with the climate change agreement having accomplished his aim of suggesting a direct link between climate change and increased terrorism ban when asked to explain this link in effect pulls a what difference at this point does it make since he is not forthcoming let us try to identify his link that is not a link a little more clearly according to the leader of the united nations joblessness and frustration may provoke the young to join terrorist groups my history may be a little shaky here so please help me out during the dust bowl period of the great depression did millions of jobless frustrated young people go on beheading sprees seeking to wipe out christian and jewish infidels in the name of allah after world war ii when japan was a defeated broken nation having just suffered the devastation of two atomic bombs did this national frustration express itself in a mass movement bent on destroying historical monuments and establishing sharia law to promote islamic purity have you ever been jobless andor frustrated in your life i have and yet i can honestly say that not once during my periods of unemployment or frustration did i ever consider joining the foreign terrorist fighters how about you no and why not for the simplest reason of all to those of us still functioning on common sense you didnt believe in the global caliphate movement ban kimoons hypothesis of a nexus between climate change and terrorism has a missing premise obscured by the standard progressive refusal to identify islamic terrorism with islam – namely that warming temperatures will actually change peoples beliefs about radical islam making them more likely to join the militant islamist movement who designed the climate model to predict that according to the leading scientific advocates of climate change theory the global mean temperature has risen less than one degree celsius since 1880  lets imagine that the pace of warming is accelerating and that the mean temperature shall rise by a whole degree or two over say the next thirty or forty years at what point will this warming begin to melt free will and rational thought what exactly is the boiling point of moral principle where conscience and basic civility are suddenly transformed into the steam of radical islam until ban john kerry and other progressive crisisexploiters can provide their data on this point their attempts to link islamic terrorism a moral decision with climate a material fact will remain nonsense so does that mean there is no link between global warming and terrorism sadly no look at bans words of warning again there is some possibility that these young people who are jobless and who are frustrated may join these foreign terrorist fighters foreign terrorist fighters is the standard u n euphemism for islamic radicals he is talking about young people being radicalized by the weather he is warning in other words that the worlds nonviolent youth frustrated by the prospective economic effects of climate change might be turned by this frustration into terrorists in short he is exploiting legitimate fears of the spread of islamic terrorism to push the civilized world into accepting supranational governance according to socialist antiproperty redistributive regulations enforceable beyond the jurisdictions of all elected governments voting populations and national constitutions for years the warmists have attempted to promote their cause with dire warnings about impending cataclysmic results of climate change warnings that in many cases have already passed their best before dates or have been retracted very quietly so as to leave their original fearmongering effects intact the himalayas are about to melt the south pole is about to drown the southern hemisphere the worlds coastal cities are about to vanish santa claus is stranded on an ice floe etc but this newest dire warning is different telling us that mother nature is about to wipe us off the planet for our transgressions when there is no evidence to support such a claim is paternalistic propaganda reducing all pretenses of scientific objectivity to sand suggesting on the other hand that climate change is about to unleash new beheadings bombings and shouts of allahu akbar at your family christmas party is something else entirely put bluntly it is an attempt to frighten people into acquiescence with promises of deadly violence such a line of rhetoric is worse than mere propaganda first of all it promotes the fallacious root causes theory of terrorism the same theory that claims that if only the west had not exploited arab oil if only israel had not occupied this or that sacred islamic site there would be no muslim extremism it fosters the absurd notion that terrorism in the sense currently threatening the civilized world is just a gut reaction to personal hardship – like going postal – rather than a politicoreligious strategy undertaken in the name of islamic utopianism even more disturbingly however bans rhetoric indicates the depths to which democratic progressives are now prepared to sink to satisfy their powerlust in his ohsomoderate passiveaggressive voice the u n secretarygeneral is indirectly threatening an increase in terrorist violence if we do not allow our paternalistic betters to use their global administrative apparatus to control our economies regulate our workplaces and homes limit our transportation choices circumscribe our use and disposal of our possessions and even define the ultimate value of our lives our carbon footprint he has in effect coopted the terrorists cause seeking to manipulate the worlds population into submitting to a tyrannical bureaucracy by suggesting that if we fail to submit todays children will finally be driven by climate change to join these foreign terrorist fighters and kill us genuine progressives – the leaders theorists and chief spokesmen of this pseudophilosophy – are political sociopaths big lies systematic propaganda and where opportune the exploitation of violence and fear to further their ends are the basic tools of their trade the attempt to use the hellish reality of the growing global caliphate movement to scare populations into accepting regulatory tyranny is worse than irrational more than despicable it is an attempt to piggyback the global warming agenda on the global caliphate agenda literally exploiting real terror to further the ends of internationalist progressivism hence the imaginary link between global warming and terrorism is now real – a marriage of convenience between two hateful agendas only a sociopathic mind could dream up a scheme as revolting as this armslength terrorism let alone put it into practice as a coordinated unified strategy as the progressives have done over the past couple of weeks islamism thrives on the progressives refusal to acknowledge its religious basis and now progressives are openly demanding that we submit to global authoritarian powers under the threat of increased terrorist violence the world faces two dire threats at this moment both of which must be defeated if civilization is to continue global islamism and global progressivism they are linked and the nexus is becoming increasingly direct every day both threats must be fought with every weapon available the first step is to be honest about the quasireligious zealotry and lifedestroying aims that motivate both factions and to stop imagining we can subdue either of them with empathy compromise and root cause psychologizing
