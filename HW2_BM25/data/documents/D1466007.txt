welcome to ca ct theoretical and actual yields key terms excess reagent limiting reagent theoretical and actual yields percentage or actual yield skills to develop use stoichiometric calculation to determine excess and limiting reagents in a chemical reaction and explain why calculate theoretical yields of products formed in reactions that involve limiting reagents evaluate percentage or actual yields from known amounts of reactants theoretical and actual yields reactants not completely used up are called excess reagent and the reactant completely reacts is called limiting reagent this concept has been illustrated for the reaction2 na  cl 2  2 na clamounts of products calculated from the complete reaction of the limiting reagent is called theoretical yields whereas the amount actually produced of a product is the actual yield the ratio of actual yield to theoretical yield expressed in percentage is called the percentage yield actual yield percent yield   x 100 theoretical yield chemical reaction equations give the ideal stoichiometric relationship among reactants and products thus the theoretical yield can be calculated from reaction stoichiometry  for many chemical reactions the actual yield is usually less than the theoretical yield understandably due to loss in the process or inefficiency of the chemical reaction example 1methyl alcohol can be produced in a highpressure reaction co g  2 h 2 g  ch 3 oh l if 61 metric tones of methyl alcohol is obtained from 12 metric tones of hydrogen reacting with excess amount of co estimate the theoretical and the percentage yield hint  to calculate the theoretical yield consider the reaction co g  2 h 2 g  ch 3 oh l 280 40 320 stoichiometric masses in g kg or tons 320 ch 3 oh 12 tons h 2   96 tones ch 3 oh 40 h 2thus the theoretical yield from 12 metric tons 12x10 6 g of hydrogen gas is 96 tons the actual yield is stated in the problem 61 metric tons thus the percentage yield is61 tones  yield   x 100  64  96 tones discussion  due to chemical equilibrium or the mass action law the limiting reagent may not be completely consumed thus a lower yield is expected in some cases a loss during the recovery process causes even lower actual yield example 2a solution containing silver ion ag  has been treated with excess of chloride ions cl  when dried 01234 g of ag cl has recovered assume the percentage yield to be 987 how many grams of silver ions were present in the solution hint  the reaction and relative masses of reagents and product are ag  aq  cl  aq  ag cl s 107868  35453  143321the calculation107868 g ag  01234 g ag cl   009287 g ag   143321 g ag clshows that 01234 g dry ag cl comes from 009287 g ag  ions since the actual yield is only 987 the actual amount of ag  ions present is therefore009287 g ag    009409 g ag  0987discussion  one can also calculate the theoretical yield of ag cl from the percentage yield of 987 to be01234 g ag cl   01250 g ag cl 0987from 01250 g ag cl the amount of ag  present is also 009409 g skill developing problems in an analytical experiment you are asked to determine the amount of iodide ion i  in 1000 m l of a solution that does not contain any other ions that will form a precipitate with silver ions you have learned that ag  ions precipitate all the iodide ions in a solution in performing the experiment shall you treat ag no 3 as the excess reagent or limiting reagent molar mass or atomic weight ag 107868 i 126904 you should know where to find them skill  apply the concept of excess and limiting reagent for work you can add ag no 3 slowly until the clear portion of the solution gives no precipitate when a drop of ag no 3 solution is added this indicates that all the i  ions are consumed from the 1000 m l iodide solution you have added ag no 3 solution or solid how do you know that you have added excess amount of ag no 3 to precipitate the iodide ions skill  excess reagent can be tested for its presence and limiting reagent can be tested for its absence in an analytical experiment 01234 g of ag i was obtained from a 1000m l solution with excess silver nitrate how much in g iodide ions are present skill  calculate the amount of limiting reagent from the amount of products in an analytical experiment 01234 g of ag i was obtained from a 1000m l solution with excess silver nitrate what is the iodide concentration moll or m in the solution skill  calculate the concentration when the amount of solute is known the concept of concentration will be covered in the unit dealing with solution but you should be able to convert see the following relationship 01234 g ag i  00005256 mol  05256 milimol ag i or ag or iÂ© cchiehuwaterlooca
