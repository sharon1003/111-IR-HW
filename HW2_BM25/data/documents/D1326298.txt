959 pmi finished this 148 scale diorama in may of this year i tried my best to duplicate the famous diorama sheperd paine built for monogram models in 1975 which was featured in a four page color brochure included with the b17g kit hand painting the artwork on the nose was one item i was not able to reproduce several aftermarket details sets were used on the b17g about 75 of the total project time was spent on building and painting the airplane the ground work is sculptamold mixed with water and food coloring the concrete runway is sand sprinkled over white glue only a couple of the crew members had to be modified to match the original diorama the entire project took me six months to build which is about five and onehalf months longer than it took to build the original an article on building this diorama will be featured in an upcoming issue of fine scale modeler magazine i hope you enjoy the photos replyajlafleche member since december 2002from massachusetts posted by ajlafleche

it and kill the gunner you have a good point there good eyes the ball turret would have been crushed up into the belly and the turret mechanism would have punctured the top of the fuse and partially stuck out the gunner wouldnt have been in the ball turret during take offs and landings dueto the danger of a collapsed gear obviously if the gunner was wounded and trapped in there then its a diferent story as im sure hapenned many times other than that it looks pretty darn good too many models to build not enough time in a day reply chazzer member since january 2011posted by chazzer on

pmi dont know how i missed this onebut nice build13151015reply phillip1member since december 2010posted by phillip1 on tuesday march 08 2011 444 pmthanks for the kind words on my diorama they are appreciated concerning the ball turret i agree that if both main landing gear failed the turret would be crushed and the gunner killed if he was inside on this diorama only one main gear failed so as long as both remaining tires stay inflated the ball turret would suffer only minor damage one example i referenced is in squadronsignals book b17 flying fortress in color on page 28 they have a picture of a b17 madam shoo shoo that landed with one main gear failure the caption for the photo says the ball turret suffered no damage at all in the landing also in sheperd paines original diorama the ball turret on his plane was not crushed and he is a pretty good researcher on details like this since the plane in my diorame slid off the runway i would think the ball turret did suffer some damage from the grass and dirt this may have cracked some plexiglass and bent some framing but i still do not think it would have been crushed either way like mentioned above the ball turret gunner would not have been killed since he would not have been at that station during the landing the ball turret position was cramped and uncomfortable and the only time the gunners manned them was when the aircraft was in the combat zone the only situtation i can think of where the ball turret would be manned during a landing would be if the turret was damaged and could not rotate to line up the exit hatch with the fuselage my two cents worth anyway thanks phillip1replyplasticjunkie member since november 2008from central florida posted by plasticjunkie on tuesday march 08 2011 528 pmphillip1thanks

to build not enough time in a day reply dog tail red2member since february 2009posted by dog tail red2 on sunday march 13 2011 336 amthe ball turret is not necessarily going to get smashed in this type of crash the b17 still has one good gear so not all of the aircraft will be hitting the ground there may be enough clearance to save it also the turret mechanism is not going to puncture the roof more likely the ball will be crushed see

masterful piece of work in its own right it has all the elements of a good diorama interesting subject dynamism a touch of history it leaves the viewer asking questions what happened to bring about this result what acts of airmanship or heroism brought them home who survived and who died it encapsulates the time and place i doff my flying helmet in recognition of your work cheersbiggles reply

christmasphillip1replytelsono member since july 2006from san francisco caposted by telsono on thursday december 22 2011 259 pmsmeagol brings up a good point it was common practice to drop the ball turret if the aircraft was making a belly landing or had landing gear problems if not besides smashing the turret of course they would get the gunner out if they could the supporting structure of the ball turret connects to the aircraft frame and would cause the back to break this made the aircraft scrap metal a plane like you show would be consider salvageable otherwise i believe it was policy to jetison it if the landing was going to be tricky at best land or water remember that old amazing stories episode the mission where there was a ball turret gunner on a crippled b17 and the turret was

thursday december 22 2011 346 pmreasoned  it was keifer sutherland who played the ball gunner static for some reason i had thought it was mark hamill i had seen one of the models that they used to make the film it was displayed by a hobby shop in the fresno ca area the model had a wing span of almost 10 feet by my memory not sure of its present location as that was a good 15 years ago mike t
