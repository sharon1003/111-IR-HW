distribution to all partners in a complete liquidation of the partnership a partnership distribution is not taken into account in determining the partners distributive share of partnership income or loss if any gain or loss from the distribution is recognized by the partner it must be reported on his or her return for the tax year in which the distribution is received money or property withdrawn by a partner in anticipation of the current years earnings is treated as a distribution received on the last day of the partnerships tax year effect on partners basis p4a partners adjusted basis in his or her partnership interest is decreased but not below zero by the money and adjusted basis of property distributed to the partner see adjusted basis under basis of partners interest later effect on partnership p4a partnership generally doesnt recognize any gain or loss because of distributions it makes to partners the partnership may be able to elect to adjust the basis of its undistributed property certain distributions treated as a sale or exchange p4when a partnership distributes the following items the distribution may be treated as a sale or exchange of property rather than a distribution unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items distributed in exchange for any part of the partners interest in other partnership property including money other property including money distributed in exchange for any part of a partners interest in unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items under disposition of partners interest later this treatment doesnt apply to the following distributions a distribution of property to the partner who contributed the property to the partnership payments made to a retiring partner or successor in interest of a deceased partner that are the partners distributive share of partnership income or guaranteed payments substantially appreciated inventory items p4inventory items of the partnership are considered to have appreciated substantially in value if at the time of the distribution their total fair market value is more than 120 of the partnerships adjusted basis for the property however if a principal purpose for acquiring inventory property is to avoid ordinary income treatment by reducing the appreciation to less than 120 that property is excluded partners gain or loss p4partners gain or loss a partner generally recognizes gain on a partnership distribution only to the extent any money and marketable securities treated as money included in the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership any gain recognized is generally treated as capital gain from the sale of the partnership interest on the date of the distribution if partnership property other than marketable securities treated as money is distributed to a partner he or she generally doesnt recognize any gain until the sale or other disposition of the property for exceptions to these rules see distribution of partners debt and net precontribution gain later also see payments for unrealized receivables and inventory items under disposition of partners interest later example p5the adjusted basis of jos partnership interest is 14000 she receives a distribution of 8000 cash and land that has an adjusted basis of 2000 and a fair market value of 3000 because the cash received doesnt exceed the basis of her partnership interest jo doesnt recognize any gain on the distribution any gain on the land will be recognized when she sells or otherwise disposes of it the distribution decreases the adjusted basis of jos partnership interest to 4000 14000 âˆ’ 8000  2000 marketable securities treated as money p5generally a marketable security distributed to a partner is treated as money in determining whether gain is recognized on the distribution this treatment however doesnt generally apply if that partner contributed the security to the partnership or an investment partnership made the distribution to an eligible partner the amount treated as money is the securitys fair market value when distributed reduced but not below zero by the excess if any of the partners distributive share of the gain that would be recognized had the partnership sold all its marketable securities at their fair market value immediately before the transaction resulting in the distribution over the partners distributive share of the gain that would be recognized had the partnership sold all such securities it still held after the distribution at the fair market value in 1 for more information including the definition of marketable securities see section 731 c of the internal revenue code loss on distribution p5a partner doesnt recognize loss on a partnership distribution unless all the following requirements are met the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership exceeds the distribution the partners entire interest in the partnership is liquidated the distribution is in money unrealized receivables or inventory items there are exceptions to these general rules see the following discussions also see liquidation at partners retirement or death under disposition of partners interest later distribution of partners debt p5if a partnership acquires a partners debt and extinguishes the debt by distributing it to the partner the partner will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent the fair market value of the debt differs from the basis of the debt determined under the rules discussed in partners basis for distributed property later the partner is treated as having satisfied the debt for its fair market value if the issue price adjusted for any premium or discount of the debt exceeds its fair market value when distributed the partner may have to include the excess amount in income as canceled debt similarly a deduction may be available to a corporate partner if the fair market value of the debt at the time of distribution exceeds its adjusted issue price net precontribution gain p5a partner generally must recognize gain on the distribution of property other than money if the partner contributed appreciated property to the partnership during the 7year period before the distribution the gain recognized is the lesser of the following amounts the excess of the fair market value of the property received in the distribution over the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership immediately before the distribution reduced but not below zero by any money received in the distribution the net precontribution gain of the partner this is the net gain the partner would recognize if all the property contributed by the partner within 7 years of the distribution and held by the partnership immediately before the distribution were distributed to another partner other than a partner who owns more than 50 of the partnership for information about the distribution of contributed property to another partner see contribution of property under transactions between partnership and partners later the character of the gain is determined by reference to the character of the net precontribution gain this gain is in addition to any gain the partner must recognize if the money distributed is more than his or her basis in the partnership for these rules the term money includes marketable securities treated as money as discussed earlier under marketable securities treated as money effect on basis p5the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership is increased by any net precontribution gain recognized by the partner other than for purposes of determining the gain the increase is treated as occurring immediately before the distribution see basis of partners interest later the partnership must adjust its basis in any property the partner contributed within 7 years of the distribution to reflect any gain that partner recognizes under this rule exceptions p5any part of a distribution that is property the partner previously contributed to the partnership is not taken into account in determining the amount of the excess distribution or the partners net precontribution gain for this purpose the partners previously contributed property doesnt include a contributed interest in an entity to the extent its value is due to property contributed to the entity after the interest was contributed to the partnership recognition of gain under this rule also doesnt apply to a distribution of unrealized receivables or substantially appreciated inventory items if the distribution is treated as a sale or exchange as discussed earlier under certain distributions treated as a sale or exchange partners basis for distributed property p5partners basis for distributed property unless there is a complete liquidation of a partners interest the basis of property other than money distributed to the partner by a partnership is its adjusted basis to the partnership immediately before the distribution however the basis of the property to the partner cannot be more than the adjusted basis of his or her interest in the partnership reduced by any money received in the same transaction example 1 p5the adjusted basis of emilys partnership interest is 30000 she receives a distribution of property that has an adjusted basis of 20000 to the partnership and 4000 in cash her basis for the property is 20000 example 2 p5the adjusted basis of steves partnership interest is 10000 he receives a distribution of 4000 cash and property that has an adjusted basis to the partnership of 8000 his basis for the distributed property is limited to 6000 10000 âˆ’ 4000 the cash he receives complete liquidation of partners interest p5the basis of property received in complete liquidation of a partners interest is the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership reduced by any money distributed to the partner in the same transaction partners holding period p5a partners holding period for property distributed to the partner includes the period the property was held by the partnership if the property was contributed to the partnership by a partner then the period it was held by that partner is also included basis divided among properties p5if the basis of property received is the adjusted basis of the partners interest in the partnership reduced by money received in the same transaction it must be divided among the properties distributed to the partner for property distributed after august 5 1997 allocate the basis using the following rules allocate the basis first to unrealized receivables and inventory items included in the distribution by assigning a basis to each item equal to the partnerships adjusted basis in the item immediately before the distribution if the total of these assigned bases exceeds the allocable basis decrease the assigned bases by the amount of the excess allocate any remaining basis to properties other than unrealized receivables and inventory items by assigning a basis to each property equal to the partnerships adjusted basis in the property immediately before the distribution if the allocable basis exceeds the total of these assigned bases increase the assigned bases by the amount of the excess if the total of these assigned bases exceeds the allocable basis decrease the assigned bases by the amount of the excess allocating a basis increase p6allocate any basis increase required in rule 2 above first to properties with unrealized appreciation to the extent of the unrealized appreciation if the basis increase is less than the total unrealized appreciation allocate it among those properties in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation allocate any remaining basis increase among all the properties in proportion to their respective fair market values example p6euns basis in her partnership interest is 55000 in a distribution in liquidation of her entire interest she receives properties a and b neither of which is inventory or unrealized receivables property a has an adjusted basis to the partnership of 5000 and a fair market value of 40000 property b has an adjusted basis to the partnership of 10000 and a fair market value of 10000 to figure her basis in each property eun first assigns bases of 5000 to property a and 10000 to property b their adjusted bases to the partnership this leaves a 40000 basis increase the 55000 allocable basis minus the 15000 total of the assigned bases she first allocates 35000 to property a its unrealized appreciation the remaining 5000 is allocated between the properties based on their fair market values 4000 4000050000 is allocated to property a and 1000 1000050000 is allocated to property b euns basis in property a is 44000 5000  35000  4000 and her basis in property b is 11000 10000  1000 allocating a basis decrease p6use the following rules to allocate any basis decrease required in rule 1 or rule 2 earlier allocate the basis decrease first to items with unrealized depreciation to the extent of the unrealized depreciation if the basis decrease is less than the total unrealized depreciation allocate it among those items in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized depreciation allocate any remaining basis decrease among all the items in proportion to their respective assigned basis amounts as decreased in 1 example p6armandos basis in his partnership interest is 20000 in a distribution in liquidation of his entire interest he receives properties c and d neither of which is inventory or unrealized receivables property c has an adjusted basis to the partnership of 15000 and a fair market value of 15000 property d has an adjusted basis to the partnership of 15000 and a fair market value of 5000 to figure his basis in each property armando first assigns bases of 15000 to property c and 15000 to property d their adjusted bases to the partnership this leaves a 10000 basis decrease the 30000 total of the assigned bases minus the 20000 allocable basis he allocates the entire 10000 to property d its unrealized depreciation armandos basis in property c is 15000 and his basis in property d is 5000 15000 âˆ’ 10000 distributions before august 6 1997 p6for property distributed before august 6 1997 allocate the basis using the following rules allocate the basis first to unrealized receivables and inventory items included in the distribution to the extent of the partnerships adjusted basis in those items if the partnerships adjusted basis in those items exceeded the allocable basis allocate the basis among the items in proportion to their adjusted bases to the partnership allocate any remaining basis to other distributed properties in proportion to their adjusted bases to the partnership partners interest more than partnership basis p6if the basis of a partners interest to be divided in a complete liquidation of the partners interest is more than the partnerships adjusted basis for the unrealized receivables and inventory items distributed and if no other property is distributed to which the partner can apply the remaining basis the partner has a capital loss to the extent of the remaining basis of the partnership interest special adjustment to basis p6a partner who acquired any part of his or her partnership interest in a sale or exchange or upon the death of another partner may be able to choose a special basis adjustment for property distributed by the partnership to choose the special adjustment the partner must have received the distribution within 2 years after acquiring the partnership interest also the partnership must not have chosen the optional adjustment to basis when the partner acquired the partnership interest if a partner chooses this special basis adjustment the partners basis for the property distributed is the same as it would have been if the partnership had chosen the optional adjustment to basis however this assigned basis is not reduced by any depletion or depreciation that would have been allowed or allowable if the partnership had previously chosen the optional adjustment the choice must be made with the partners tax return for the year of the distribution if the distribution includes any property subject to depreciation depletion or amortization if the choice doesnt have to be made for the distribution year it must be made with the return for the first year in which the basis of the distributed property is pertinent in determining the partners income tax a partner choosing this special basis adjustment must attach a statement to his or her tax return that the partner chooses under section 732 d of the internal revenue code to adjust the basis of property received in a distribution the statement must show the computation of the special basis adjustment for the property distributed and list the properties to which the adjustment has been allocated example p6chin ho purchased a 25 interest in x partnership for 17000 cash at the time of the purchase the partnership owned inventory having a basis to the partnership of 14000 and a fair market value of 16000 thus 4000 of the 17000 he paid was attributable to his share of inventory with a basis to the partnership of 3500 within 2 years after acquiring his interest chin ho withdrew from the partnership and for his entire interest received cash of 1500 inventory with a basis to the partnership of 3500 and other property with a basis of 6000 the value of the inventory received was 25 of the value of all partnership inventory it is immaterial whether the inventory he received was on hand when he acquired his interest since the partnership from which chin ho withdrew didnt make the optional adjustment to basis he chose to adjust the basis of the inventory received his share of the partnerships basis for the inventory is increased by 500 25 of the 2000 difference between the 16000 fair market value of the inventory and its 14000 basis to the partnership at the time he acquired his interest the adjustment applies only for purposes of determining his new basis in the inventory and not for purposes of partnership gain or loss on disposition the total to be allocated among the properties chin ho received in the distribution is 15500 17000 basis of his interest âˆ’ 1500 cash received his basis in the inventory items is 4000 3500 partnership basis  500 special adjustment the remaining 11500 is allocated to his new basis for the other property he received mandatory adjustment p6a partner doesnt always have a choice of making this special adjustment to basis the special adjustment to basis must be made for a distribution of property whether or not within 2 years after the partnership interest was acquired if all the following conditions existed when the partner received the partnership interest the fair market value of all partnership property other than money was more than 110 of its adjusted basis to the partnership if there had been a liquidation of the partners interest immediately after it was acquired an allocation of the basis of that interest under the general rules discussed earlier under basis divided among properties would have decreased the basis of property that couldnt be depreciated depleted or amortized and increased the basis of property that could be the optional basis adjustment if it had been chosen by the partnership would have changed the partners basis for the property actually distributed required statement p6generally if a partner chooses a special basis adjustment and notifies the partnership or if the partnership makes a distribution for which the special basis adjustment is mandatory the partnership must provide a statement to the partner the statement must provide information necessary for the partner to figure the special basis adjustment marketable securities p7a partners basis in marketable securities received in a partnership distribution as determined in the preceding discussions is increased by any gain recognized by treating the securities as money see marketable securities treated as money under partners gain or loss earlier the basis increase is allocated among the securities in proportion to their respective amounts of unrealized appreciation before the basis increase previous page  table of contents  top of page  index  next page
