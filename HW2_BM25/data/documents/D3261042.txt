calf muscle pain calf muscle pain is a common problem that can make walking running and jumping difficult and painful calf pain may be due to injury underlying medical condition or a problem in the nerves or arteries in the lower leg meaning accurate diagnosis is vital whilst often something minor like a grade one muscle strain the problem may not actually be in the muscle itself and could be indicative of a serious problem such as a dvt so should always be treated with caution here we start by look at the structures that make up the calf region and then will go on to look at the most common causes of calf muscle pain that can affect the whole calf or cause lower or upper calf pain how the symptoms vary and how to spot a potentially serious problem the calf muscles the calf is the area on the back of the leg between the knee and the ankle it is made up of two muscles collectively known as the triceps surae triceps surae simply means “threeheaded calf muscle” it comprises of a pair of muscles gastrocnemius and soleus the gastrocnemius muscle has twoheads which arise from either side of the bottom of the femur just above the knee joint it is a superficial muscle meaning it forms the top layer just below the skin the soleus muscle runs deep to underneath gastrocnemius and arises from the top of the tibia just below the knee joint the two muscles join together around midcalf level to form the achilles tendon which twists and attaches the calf muscles to the back of the heel the triceps surae muscles work together to plantarflex the foot ie pull the foot downwards and stabilise the ankle they are particularly important in controlling and executing the pushoff phase of walking and running common causes of calf muscle pain these common causes of calf muscle pain can cause pain anywhere in the calf region1 calf tear if the calf muscles are suddenly overstretched some or all of the fibres may be torn known as a calf strain or rupture this is the most common cause of calf muscle pain it usually happens whilst playing sports such as basketball tennis and running where the person suddenly pushes off from a stationary position or has to change direction quickly which places a huge force through the muscle the location of pain will depend on where the tear is upper calf pain usually indicates damage near the junction between the muscle tendon and muscle belly and mid calf pain indicates a tear in the muscle belly and there are three grades of calf muscle strain depending on the severity of the injury pain is usually instant and may be accompanied by swelling andor bruising although with a mild sprain symptoms might take a few hours to develop if the muscle is completely ruptured walking will be very difficult it can take anywhere from a few days to a few months for symptoms to settle down completely in the calf strain section we look at the typical causes and symptoms as well as the best treatment options and how to make a full recovery2 calf cramps commonly referred to as charley horse in north america these are when involuntary spasms occur in the lower leg causing calf muscle pain cramp may last for just a few seconds but in worst cases may continue on and off for a number of days they are often caused by an imbalance of vitaminsminerals muscle fatigue diet dehydration and muscle imbalance whilst in most cases they arent caused by anything too serious they can be extremely painful cramp typically causes upper calf pain but the pain may be felt elsewhere in the calf too the best treatments for calf cramps are exercises particularly stretches massage good diet and supportive footwear in the calf cramps section we look at what is going on when the calf muscle cramps why it happens and youll find loads of top tips on how to treat and prevent cramp3 deep vein thrombosis dvta deep vein thrombosis can be a very serious cause of calf pain it is the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein usually in the calf or thigh a dvt requires immediate medical attention as it reduces the blood flow to the foot and there is the risk that the blood clot could break off and travel through the bloodstream to the heart or lungs which can cause a heart attack or pulmonary embolus the common signs of a dvt are pain redness warmth and swelling in the calf region and the pain often gets worse if your dorsiflex your foot pull your toes up towards you dvt’s often develop after surgery or periods of inactivity eg plane journeys and there can be a genetic link4 muscle imbalance muscle weakness and tightness is a common cause of calf muscle pain weak muscles will tire quickly if you are on your feet for prolonged periods of time so it is important to work on both strength and endurance if the calf is tight it is prone to damage from increased tension making stretching exercises vital exercises are the best way to combat this and it important to get the right balance of strengthening and stretching exercises  visit the calf strengthening and calf stretching exercises sections for a whole range of exercises that will help combat this5 trapped nerve compression of the nerves of the lower leg can cause pain in the calf pins and needles and numbness in the calf region the compression may be coming from the lower back where the nerve originates from or at any point along the nerve itself trapped nerves are usually accompanied by changes in sensation such as pins tingling or numbness and pain often spreads any symptoms of nerve compression should be checked out by your doctor you can find out more in the nerve pain section on our sister site common causes of upper calf pain1 bakers cyst a bakers cyst is a common cause of upper calf pain caused by inflammation of the popliteal bursa fluid filled sac that sits behind the knee joint it can cause calf muscle pain particularly if the cyst bursts resulting in the fluid tracking down the leg into the back of the calf a bakers cyst often presents as a squashy lump behind the knee similar to an orange that may go up and down in size bakers cysts are commonly associated with knee injuries and arthritis but can occur for other reasons in the bakers cyst section we look at the typical causes symptoms and treatment options as well as how to prevent recurrence causes of lower calf pain1 achilles tendonitis inflammation or degeneration of the achilles tendon commonly causes lower calf muscle pain the achilles tendon is approximately six inches long connecting the calf muscles to the heel the achilles is extremely strong but not very flexible making it prone to damage especially if the calf muscles are weak and tight achilles tendonitis usually causes pain in the calf or heel and there may be thickening in the tendon the tendon has a poor blood supply so recovery can take months treatment usually involves exercises orthotics rest from aggravating activities and injections find out more about this common cause of lower calf muscle pain including causes and treatment options in the achilles tendonitis section on our sister site2 peripheral vascular disease pvdalso known as peripheral artery disease this is when there is a narrowing in the arteries which slows blood flow it is commonly associated with smoking diabetes high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure in severe cases the foot and lower leg may change colour – this warrants immediate medical attention to find out more about these common causes of calf muscle pain including symptoms diagnosis and treatment options choose from the links above safety
