government structures monarchy a government that has a single person who is generally considered the ruler by the title and birthright titles include czar king queen emperor caesar etc power is absolute and is either taken through conquest or passed down to family members without regard for ability or appropriateness society is formed around feudal groups or tribes in which the ruling family delegates power and authority based upon the desires of a single individual power struggles are common a monarchy is based upon a class system where those of a certain birthright are perceived to be of superior intellect and strength to those not of the same family line the resources and wealth of a country is generally preserved solely for the hedonistic and selffulfilling desires of the reigning monarch with little regard for the general population or its welfare the inhabitants of a country under a monarch are alive to serve the monarch in contrast the inhabitants of a republic are served by the their leaders in theory constitutional monarchy constitutional monarchy or limited monarchy is a form of government established under a constitutional system which acknowledges a hereditary or elected monarch as head of state as opposed to an absolute monarchy where the monarch is not bound by a constitution and is the sole source of political power the process of government and law within a constitutional monarchy is usually very different from that in an absolute monarchy most constitutional monarchies take on a parliamentary form where the monarch may be regarded as the head of state but the prime minister who derives power directly or indirectly from elections is head of government constitutional monarchy is similar to the republic system where instead of an hereditary king as its head it has a president elected every so many years in both these cases the king or the president have little power but power is vested in the parliament under the guide of the prime minister who is elected from time to time the republics of united sates and that of france are a variation on the theme where more power is vested in the president dictatorship generic term used to describe any government controlled by a single individual and giving the people little or no individual freedom typically a person who rules by threat of force people who are loyal to a dictatorship swear allegiance to the person first and the country second fascism theocracies monarchies and communism can all be dictatorships a republic cannot be a dictatorship marxism the theory of government based on the ideals of karl marx and frederick engels in the book the communist manifesto written in the 1800s marxism advocates the workers proletariats and petitebourgeoisie rise up and overthrow businesses and government and take control themselves marxism advocates a classless society in which everything is shared and owned by all in its true form it follows the mandates of a direct democracy in which the mob or general population rules and allocates resources based upon the will of the majority with equal consideration given to all without exclusions or privileges to any it is an antibiblical system communism or applied marxism severe government interference in economics practically absolute centralized planning by the government one party rule and stresses that there should be only one class of people this differs from socialismdemocracy which allows for individual differences a form of marxism has been tried in russia and china with disastrous results socialism a form of mild communism with limited government interference in business activity as opposed to the above but more than in capitalism certain areas of an individuals life are controlled and representation tend to be parliamentary in nature in other words people vote for a particular party and the party elects the leaders of the country the notable difference from communism is that there is more than one political party citizenship democracy is defined as government of the masses authority derived through mass meeting or any other form of direct expression attitude toward property is communistic meaning property rights are negated and ownership is by the people or state in a true democracy the result is mobocracy or a government where the lower classes of a nation control public affairs without respect to law precedents or vested rights controlling public affairs without respect to law precedents or vested rights attitude toward law is that the will of the majority shall regulate based upon deliberation passion prejudice or impulse without restraint or regard to consequences of the action a true democracy has been shown to results in demogogism a country run by the passions and prejudices of the majority license agitation discontent and anarchy democracy is about the people and their power the power or authority exercised in a democracy is derived directly or indirectly from the represented people in one of two forms direct democracy this is where everyone is given the opportunity to participate in making all policy decisions in countries and large organizations direct democracy is rarely utilized because it would be cumbersome and inefficient no decisions would ever be reached representative democracy this approach entails people voting to elect representatives in a free and fair electoral system to make policy for them under a wide range of checks and balances to help ensure leadership accountability republic a political system in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who can elect people to represent them a form of government whose head of state is not a monarch the head of state in a republic is usually a president the republic differs from a citizenship democracy in that the power of the government is limited by a constitution set of principles citizenship republic is defined by a government where authority is derived through election by the people of public officials perceived as best fitted to represent them attitude toward law is the administration of justice in accord with fixed principles and established evidence with a strict regard to consequences a greater number of citizens and extent of territory may be brought within its compass avoids the dangerous extreme of either tyranny or mobocracy a government where the lower classes of a nation control public affairs without respect to law precedents or vested rights results in statesmanship liberty reason justice contentment and progress in all areas of arts science thought and civil liberties republics are the preferred structured base for government throughout europe and the americas the citizenship is a representative democracy limited by checks and balances called constitution a constitution nonetheless based on the tenets of men and not by gods in fact god is generally out in a citizenship republic and the nation is secular righteous republic the righteous republic is first last and always “one nation under god” the bible says “blessed is the nation whose god is the lord”  psa 3312  but such is impossible under democracy for by definition democracy envisages a pluralistic society with all sorts of religious beliefs where the god of christians is not the god of islamists nor that of buddhists and so on the righteous republic differs from the republic in that every single law in its constitution find its support in the word of god the constitution of a righteous republic is the bible the favourite word in a righteous republic is just that “righteousness” the key verse to this system is pro 1434 “righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people” it is “one nation under god”it is all different in a democracy in a democracy man is all that matters not god the secular republic is “one nation under man” in a system where the majority rules and that majority follows the dictates of the fallen heart of man the resulting dictum is inverted and becomes “sin exalts a nation but righteousness is a disgrace to any nation”there does not exist a single righteous republic on the earth all the earths republics are secular gods government“and he said to them when you pray say our father which are in heaven hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done as in heaven so in earth ”  luk 112 your will be done as in heaven so in earth  this is the government that god prescribes on earth the same as in heaven in heaven there is a sovereign king with absolute dominion on all creation he commands and all obey most willingly moreover the king is a father and the government has a patriarchal form the government that god prescribes for the earth is theocratic a patriarchal system directly under him the most high god the word theocracy originates from the greek θεοκρατία theokratia meaning the rule of god or gods law theocracy is a form of government in which god is recognized as the supreme ruler theocracy is a form of government in which divine power governs an earthly human state implementing theocratic theonomic laws theocracy should be distinguished from the secular forms of government that have a state religion or are merely influenced by theological or moral concepts and monarchies held by the grace of god kind of thing theocracy may be monist in form where the administrative hierarchy of the government is identical with the administrative hierarchy of the religion or it may have two arms but both under god theocracy is a form of government in which only god and his law is sovereign however whilst in heaven we have a righteous and just king god almighty on earth we have fallen man whose every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually  gen 65 a perfect match with the heavenly government cannot be had and so man has devised all sorts of government to free himself of god therefore any form of human government has to have valid forms of checks and balances to avoid the enslaving of people and above all it has to be under god which is not very often the case in conclusion all form of government on the earth are lacking something and not making the mark and coming short of the kingdom of god and all in dire need of the grace of god moreover it must be remembered that god is the absolute sovereign of his creation and all types of government that have existed and will exist have come into existence by his will to serve the purpose that he has established before the foundation of creation for his pleasure rev 411 for this reason god in his word commands us to pray for the government we have in place be it good or bad “1 let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from god and those that exist have been instituted by god 2 therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what god has appointed and those who resist will incur judgment 3 for rulers are not a terror to good conduct but to bad would you have no fear of the one who is in authority then do what is good and you will receive his approval”  rom 1313all governments do not necessarily means that are ideal for god but are ordained by him to serve his purpose nevertheless like for slavery we are to take every opportunity to free ourselves from an oppressive government “were you a slave when called do not be concerned about it but if you can gain your freedom avail yourself of the opportunity ”  1co 721in conclusion we say that the perfect form of government is the one that matches the one in heaven but failing that any other form of government would serve us providing they are truly under god and do his will if the government and the people do not do the will of god eventually he will raise evil nations to scourge us as he is doing right now “for see i raise up the chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs”  hab 126
