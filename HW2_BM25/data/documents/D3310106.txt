bicycles stack exchange is a question and answer site for people who build and repair bicycles people who train cycling or commute on bicycles join them it only takes a minute sign up heres how it works anybody can ask a question anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top best bicycle for a moderate to extremely hilly suburbsup vote7down votefavorite1ive moved to an area thats notoriously hilly i had gained a lot of weight but managed to ride it off by cycling in a well built but extremely faulty and wastefully heavy chinese bike the gears gave me the hell those shitty gears that force you to turn them like a motorbike and riding up a hill was extremely difficult ive busted it up by now so this time i plan on asking some experts on which bike i should get im slightly over weight smoked a bit stopped so need to get in shape i live in a hilly area so gears matter i dont trust bike stores here please just need general over all advice on what type of equipment should be loaded up on my future bike to make my ride easiergears hillsshare improve this questionedited dec 17 15 at 1249anatolyg483 1 8 21asked dec 15 15 at 1307biggy small ryeda34 1 1 51given the range of answers youve got already the touring vs hybrid question is an important one ie drop vs flat bars you will see people with strong opinions on both sides of the debate all i would suggest is that if youre going to spend a lot of money on a dropbar bike which seems to be less forgiving on fit you try to borrowhire one of about the right size first to see if the concept suits you – chris h dec 15 15 at 1537gidday and welcome t se bicycles remember we dont do specific product recommendations here the advise youve received will help focus more specifically on a style of bike and go from there – criggie dec 15 15 at 2045why dont you trust bike stores near you while there are good ones and bad ones out there they truly are your best friend when looking at a bike acquisition if you buy online no matter how grand the bike is unless you can step up and perform serious hardcore maintenance youre setting yourself up for expensive work down the roadperformed by a bike store – kennah dec 18 15 at 2050add a comment4 answers active oldest votesup vote5down voteaccepted if youre after just a rough outline ive listed the below type of bike do you think youll ride onroad or offroad too ie would you need a road bike or a mountain bike it is possible to get a hybrid bike which is essentially just a mountain bike without shocks and roadappropriate tyres gears most modern bikes these days will have gearing of up to 11sp on the cassette in the rear youll also often have the choice of up to 3 chainrings ion the front smallest ring in the front and largest gear in the back makes for easier hillclimbing brakes if it is very hilly and youll want to have good stopping ability disc brakes would definitely be a good call most importantly when you sit on or ride the bike it should feel right and it must be comfortable most bike shops will let you do a test ride go around the block a couple of times and make sure you are comfortable and can work the gearings easily dont spend more than you want to it is really easy to spend many thousands and thousands of s on a bike set a budget and stick to it as far as possibleshare improve this answeranswered dec 15 15 at 1321ro ka392 1 1311 for disk brakes but a big caveat bad disk brakes are bad my bogstandard shimano vbrakes with koolstop dual compound pads are miles better than the tektro cable disk on my wifes ebike ive done a nonscientific test with similar weight braking front only – chris h dec 15 15 at 1531fully agree but bad components are bad components either way  good disc brakes are debatably better than most vbrakes and callipers – ro ka dec 15 15 at 1542yes but ime bad vbrakes need frequent tweaking but can be set to stop the bike quickly and quietly with decent pads good vbrakes with decent pads need little attention bad disk brakes are noisy and ineffective and feel like theres an adjustment missing this assumes alloy rims of course – chris h dec 15 15 at 2016ive had bad cable discs too and as noted in my answer upgraded them to hydraulic discs for 100 or so with great results i totally agree that the tektro cable discs are marginal thats what i had really no better than vbrakes maybe not even as good i upgraded my tektro mechanicals to a shimano m395 hydraulic brake set under 100 left on the original discs and the result was perfect for my needs and a huge improvement – developer63 dec 16 15 at 8451chris h i have hydraulic disc brakes and a few other rides setup with high quality road calipers and cantis as well the discs suck in the rain sram they howl and resonate the road calipers with kool stops on aluminum wheels kill it in all city riding conditions the only time i would take the discs is when they are dry and perfectly clean in which case the modulation is incredible power is about the same as the road calipers on aluminum – ebrohman dec 18 15 at 127show 2 more commentsup vote3down vote to get up a hill easily you need a low gear the critical number is the ration of the smallest front chain ring to the largest rear cog road bikes around me seem to have standardized on 5034 compact front gears and 1128 on the rear giving a ratio of 3428 or about 121 shimano makes an 1132 cassette which would reduce the ratio to 3432 or 106 we did the changeout on my wifes bike and she loves it we had to change the rear derailleur as well to get enough range touring bikes often have much lower gearing this one which i know nothing about except that i looked up the gearing has 483626 on the front and 1134 on the rear 2634 is about 0765 which should get you up anythingshare improve this answeranswered dec 15 15 at 1513ross millikan1559 5 15for road bikes you can usually choose between a compact or a doubletriple compact is 5034 and double could be up to 5539 triple could be 483626 to 553930 all of these can have anything from a 1121 to a 1232 on the rear – ro ka dec 15 15 at 1523ro ka i know you can get a range but this is what i see mostly – ross millikan dec 15 15 at 15291so according to your answer bicycle gears arent as easy as i thought them to be its not all about the shift down for hills and shift up for straight roads ill study up and hopefully have a better knowledge of all these ratios everyones talking about thank you all – biggy small ryeda dec 15 15 at 1840biggy small ryeda i think it is better to think about gear selection as maintaining your pedal cadence you use low gears any time you are going slow hills are one cause of going slow but so are cycling lazily chatting with someone going on a ride with a slow group and starting up from stop signs you use higher gears when you are moving faster – ross millikan dec 16 15 at 1615good answer  for anyone who isnt chris froome the right gearing is going to be one of the most important choices – bent spoke cycle repair feb 9 16 at 1050show 1 more commentup vote3down vote your suburban riding scenario seems to call for a bike that would be a good commuter type bike on mixed city and suburban streets with excellent hillclimbing abilities and able to handle occasional brief off road ventures during a ride eg riding through unpaved parking lots the two primary suitable options would be hybridsport hybrid bikes and nonsuspension mountain bikes you could go the skinny tire road bike route but i would only go there if you plan to go on group rides with groups that ride at road bike speeds typically averaging 15mph or above on flat roads first choice option 1 sport hybrid aka fitness bike i would recommend a sport hybrid type of bike with a somewhat upright riding position and low gearing for climbing hills and one that has dropouts on the frame for attaching racks because of the hills i also recommend hydraulic disc brakes not cable discs for best stopping power and safety whats key here is that bike is equipped with discs if it comes with cableactuated discs its simple to replace the cable with hydraulic brakes for around 100 for a shimano hydraulic brake set just make sure to match to the size of the discs on the bike eg 160mm discs if you get a bike without disc brakes its likely it wont have the necessary frame dropouts to accept disc brakes its generally too expensive to try to retrofit a nondisc model to accept disc brakes brands like trek giant kona marin specialized and others have numerous choices in this category i personally chose a 5 year old used trek 7500 fx as my commuter which was a rare 7500fx model that had factory discs the 75 fx model in treks current line with discs would be a good baseline comparison for looking at other manufacturers hybrids the giant escape 1 hybrid another poster mentioned would also fall into this general category and fits most of the criteria but that model often may not come with disc brakes for your scenario i would avoid nondisc brake models cofirst choice option 1a nonsuspension mountain bike 29er you could also go with a 29er mountain bike ie one with the 29inch wheels as long as you stay away from any sort of shocks and suspension or at worst front shocks with a lockout then simply equip it with road tires instead of knobby mtb tires 32c width is a typical choice for a commuter bike the advantage of a 29er mountain bike for you is that they are highly likely to already come with gearing suitable for any hills you are likely to encounter they are also highly likely to come equipped with disc brakes good name brand mountain bikes will also tend to be durable enough to stand up to a certain level of commuter abuse this is also the type of bike that will be closest to ridiculously heavy but still probably lighter than your chinese bike an example of an interesting 29er option would be the northrock 29er mountain bike costco sold for a while a couple years ago if you could pick one up on craigslist for 300 or so and swap on hydraulic brakes for 125 or so and street tires 50 or sodoq youd probably be very happy with that setup iirc correctly the front shock has a lockout feature i have one of those exact bikes i use as a mountain bike and its my bestfeeling fastestriding mountain bike and my 1 bike for xc trails i sold a similar specialized 29er mtb i had because the northrock rode faster and felt better for me option 3 cyclocross bike while i dont claim special expertise on cyclocross bikes this type of bike could also be a fit for how you ride essentially they are ruggedized road bikes that typically come with hydraulic disc brakes its worth looking at some bike shops and asking them to show you cyclocross bikes option 4 touring bike its also worth looking at bikes that are billed as touring bikes there will be some overlap between these and sporthybrid commuters touringspecific bikes will typically have more features to support carrying racks camping gear etc on the bike brakes as i mentioned above i am a big fan of the hydraulic disc brakes you can typically stop the bike with a twofinger pull of the brake lever even on a steep downhill its fine to buy a bike with mechanical discs but for your own safety absolutely upgrade the brake levers lines and calipers with a hydraulic set asap vbrakes can work ok but i feel safer especially on hills with the stopping power of hydraulic discs drivetrain personally i would suggest a shimano 9speed rear drive train in this type of bike because i dont see huge advantages of 10 and 11 speed drivetrains for commuter bikes you could even go with 8 speed rear drive train the northrock bike i mentioned has an 8speed drive train 8 and 9 speed parts are readily available and good value and will be for years to come in general for the front drive train you will most likely want a bike with a triple crankset ie 3 front gearschainrings the smallest chainring on the inside will be the one you will use when riding up steep hills however in newer bikes many fitness models will come with a front double chainring and 10 or 11 speed rear drivetrain these could be acceptable choices but youll have to pay more attention to gear ratios and learn about things like gear inches to know for sure trek changed the 75 fx model to a double starting with the 2012 model year from 2012 on the 74 fx model with discs still has a triple chainring and would be the baseline comparison bikegearing other answers spoke to gear ratios thats important but i wont repeat that info here if you went with the 29er mountain bike option that would certainly have suitable gearing for climbing hills in practice a sporthybrid will most likely have a suitable gear ratio too do get familiar enough with gear ratios so you can verify what works for you on the hills you ride the gearing you need depends on the steepness of the hill most often measured in grade 10 grade is considered quite a fairly steep hill and supersteep would be 20 sounds like you have hills of 1020 grade a 2010 trek 75 fx front chainring has 26 teeth on the easiest front gear lower  is easier and a 26 teeth easiest rear gear higher  is easier in rear a typical road bike say a 2010 specialized allez elite could have a 34 tooth easiest gear in front and a 27 tooth easiest gear in the rear the example trek 75 fx is going to be a better easier hill climber for you because of the easier gear in front 26 front teeth for the trek vs 34 front teeth for the allez the two bikes rear easiest gears are within 1 tooth trek 26 allez 27 and there is a slight advantage to the allez but nowhere near enough to offset the huge front chainring gearing advantage of the trek 26 teeth vs 34 teeth for the allez so the trek will be the much easier climber than the allez for steep step hills despite the trek being slightly heavier at about 23 lbs compared to the the allez at about 21 lbs with lower gears for hills youll need to pedal faster but at a reasonable effort level for example you might have a pedaling cadence of 90 rpm at a moderatechallenge effort level and wind up going uphill about 5 mph just a little faster than walking speed thats perfectly okyoure steadily making it up the hill without feeling like your heart is about to explode or feeling that youll have to stop and walk the bike its also worth mentioning that the length of the crank arm affects the difficulty of pedaling up a hill as well typical crank arms are 165175mm long i suggest using searching the web including this site for gear inches and learning how to calculate them to compare different gear ratios and crank lengths for gearing geeks there are online calculators at httpsheldonbrowncomgears and httpwwwgearcalculatorcom that can help you compare different bikes to keep gearing simple if you get a bike with a triple front chainring youll probably be fine on all your hills if you are considering a bike with a double front chainring then you will want to learn the gear inches calculations be awaregearing can often be easily changed after purchase keep in mind if you find a bike you otherwise love that does not have low enough gears to climb your hills often its possible to install lower gears for a reasonable price for example a shimano 9speed drive train with 1128t rear cassette gearing might be able to be swapped out with an 1132t rear cassette without changing any other parts the 32t low gear could easily make all the difference for you on some hills this is an it depends matter consult a good bike mechanic or ask here with info on the specific bike and current drive train components plus the gearing change you would like to make other components for your hilly commuter scenario the options i mentioned should do well its possible to spend ridiculous amounts on wheels upgraded drive trains etc but i dont think you need to and you can upgrade as you go in general on the sport hybrid bikes if the parts are shimano deore sora tiagra or comparable level parts eg from sram thats probably the a good place to be for 29er mountain bikes shimano alivio and above would be a good place to be shifters in my opinion theres no particular reason to care a great deal between grip shifters and rapid fire thumb lever type shifters however you will most likely be looking at bikes with the rapid fire type shifters in combination with disc brakes and they are normally considered higher end so you may as well go with the flow and look for those types of shifters new or used if you have a good idea of what youre looking for you can find some great deals on good bikes on craigslist and other sites you can often find a bike that was built within the last 78 years that meets about all of what i laid out and is in good condition and is a great value it can be a roll of the dice however find a good local bike shop and even if a used bike you got has some issues they often have excellent and friendly mechanics who will fix the issues at a reasonable price where you still come out ahead if you find a new bike you like that meets what i laid out or your more refined criteria at a bike shop absolutely go for it youre probably looking at bikes in the 6001000 price range fit if you buy new a good bike shop will of course fit you properly to the bike in the used bike arena you will need to learnasyougo the models frame sizes and adjustments eg matching seat height handlebar angles etc to your body type leg length and riding style preferences that fit you best you can probably find a bike shop that will help you with finetuning fit adjustments on a used bike in the course of them doing other work on your bike there are a lot of useful resources on bike fit on the internet use them and your local bike shops to make sure you get this part right for whatever bike you choose i hope that gives you some practical options for focusing your search i recommend the sporthybridfitness type of bike as your overall best choice and suggest as your starting comparison benchmark using trek 75 fx models from the last 57 years look at some of those then look at similar models from other name brand manufacturers giant kona specialized marin cannondale fuji and the numerous other brands that were originally sold through local bike shops after looking at that category youll probably develop a pretty good idea of what you want and can target a small set of used bike yearsmodelsfeatures or buy a new bike that matches what you want good luckshare

if a large range of gears are what ones looking for my commuter its a 11sp roadie came out with sram rival22 compact with 1132 and is starting to become a really popular option i swapped for 1128 because i have a flat commute and preferred the closer shift i dont know much about campy but know people who swear by them – ro ka dec 16 15 at 1002thanks developer63 for the extremely informative and detailed answer how ever i feel like i should emphasise on the fact that the area i reside in and ride my bike around has extremely steep and long roads that lead you to the closest straight area imagine san francisco but worse ive tried some of the bikes youve talked about it was a 9speed japanese gears with disc brakes an aluminium frame a rapid fire shifter and thin tyres what i wanted to know is which characteristic of the bike made my uphill climb easier was it its reduced weight better gears or thinner tyres – biggy small ryeda dec 16 15 at 1836biggy small ryeda the primary answers to that are low enough gearing and lighter bike thinner tires a little less so plus you can easily change to skinnier or wider tires to suit your needs ive updated my answer with some specifics using the trek 2010 75 fx gearing as a baseline people report that bike as being about 23 lbs mountain bikes typically weigh in around 30 lbs that extra 57 lbs lighter makes a noticeable difference when climbing hills – developer63 dec 16 15 at 1936ro ka absolutely agree about the sram wi fli type gearing as a great option i have their 1132t cassette on my road bike double 5339 i had to work too hard to get up 15 hills even with an 1128 on the back had to also put on a new medium cage shimano rear derailleur to accommodate the bigger cogs in the back – developer63 dec 16 15 at 1956add a commentup vote1down vote im a beginner and i have a giant escape 1 hybrid it has 27 gears and gets me up every hill i want admittedly it took me a good long while to build up enough fitness to do the steep hills but that wasnt the bikes problemif you are looking for a fitness bike i would suggest looking at something similar  a hybrid which has mountain bike gears with road tyres the larger the number of gears the better trust me i use them allas for what equipment to add i would suggest padded cycling shorts a water bottleholder and a helmet you really dont need anything else to start if you are going to be miles away from anywhere then taking a simple tool kit and a spare innertube probably wouldnt hurt but ive had my bike for 6 months and have never had a puncture yetshare improve this answeranswered dec 15 15 at 1358gordon copestake893 2 9 20the actual number of gears will not make a difference in difficulty your easiest 3032 and hardest 5012 will be the same whether you have 1 or 31 gears in between the benefit of more gears comes not with easy of pedalling but with ease of shifting with more gears the difference between the individual ones become smaller – ro ka dec 15 15 at 1519i ride something similar for commuting in a hilly city up to to 14 on my old commute as ro ka says though its the range shimano do some 8 speed 1132 cassettes which arent at all expensive 8speed is lowend now combined with 283848 chainrings and 700c tyres the hills you will be able to climb will be limited by how slow you can balance the bike vs your lungs – chris h dec 15 15 at 1529fair point on the range not the number being the key but the range tends to come for free when there are a large number – gordon copestake dec 15 15 at 1631gordon not true if you have a 2x11 with 1125rear and 3953 front im being facetious but for the uninitiated it needs describing explicitly chris h great answer for affordable solution but also consider walking the steepest hills  – bent spoke cycle
