do this too my inclinometer has started to slowly leak out the oil fluid inside after pulling it out ive realised a hairline crack on the back which is the cause i was wondering if anyone has experienced replacing the oil fluid inside with a suitable alternative and how you have gone about it ive heard that perhaps using glycerine is a good alternative or perhaps valve oil used for lubricating brass musical instruments as anybody tired these or come up with a better alternative i look forward to your comments 2 301108arrow senior member join date nov 2007posts 379we cut a disc of the right size from an ice cream container lid then into a bead of araldite that was carefully placed around the rim on the back of the inclinometer we set the disc into place taking care that no araldite oozed into the body of the inclinometer itself once it had dried we placed another layer of araldite on the back around the area where the disc and the inclinometer surround met finally a light smear of silicone over the back covering all the araldite and forming a skin we then filled the inclinometer with paraffin oil although glycerine was our next choice had we not been able to get any paraffin oil finally a rubber plug from clark rubber in the top of the body to seal it all up this repair has lasted almost 2 years with no sign of leakage ie telltale air bubbles you need to leave a little bit of air space in the top of your inclinometer to allow for temperature related fluid expansion on a previous repair on another vehicle we filled it right to the limit and soon had a leak because the expansion eventually pushed the back off on doing that one a second time like ive just mentioned and leaving a bit of air space which you cant see as its hidden by the inclinometer housing surrounds there have been no more leaks there either last edited by arrow 301108 at 0718 pm  3 301108difflocker junior member join date nov 2008location wa  kalgoorlieposts 6hi boydy79 i just realised today that my inclinometer is leaking as well i didnt know at the time that it was coming from the inclinometer until i read your post this evening an oily type solution can be seen leaking down the right side of the centre console and leaking on to the carpet i noticed there is a dark stain on the carpet on up the side where the carpet meets up to the console just forward of the drivers foot rest the pajero is parked in the sun all day so it makes sense about the oil expanding or the crack in the inclinometer expanding and releasing the oil i have only just purchased my 1999 nl pajero only recently so i guess the joys of buying a second hand car and the unknown are to be expected 4 011208alex86valued member join date jul 2007location here and there posts 1958such a common problem it just happens over time 1 owner or 10 mitsu never did anything about it also put my inclinometer in a glad bag when reinstalling it back into the dash so that any fluid that may end up leaking out will hopefully be caught by the bag mounting screws puncture it a little rather than all thru the console 99 nl escape manual  bullbar roofrack cargo barrier d697lt tough dogs dual batts

something useful  ie water tempafm or something the inclinometer is the most useless wanky piece of junk out there 6 011208bitsamissin member join date jul 2007location melbourne posts 134heres a simple fix guys  httpwww4x4wirecommitsubishiteinclinometer 7 011208arrow senior member join date nov 2007posts 379hmmm simple as it seems that fix doesnt appear to address why the thing leaked in the first place 99 of the time it is the rear face of the inclinometer which develops hairline and sometimes larger cracks if you dont replace that damaged rear face then you are wasting your time 8

about 5 or so years the only thing noticeable was the ever increasing air bubble in the top it still seemed to work empty not that it was ever used
