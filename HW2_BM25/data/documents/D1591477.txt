revisiting thurman munsons hall of fame case 37 years after his death mlb ap photograham womack contributorgrahamdude published on aug 2 2016less than two years after his death in a plane crash on aug 2 1979 thurman munson debuted early on the baseball hall of fame ballot since 1954 players have had to wait five years after retirement to become eligible for cooperstown through the baseball writers association of america it’s generally a good rule allowing emotions to cool and hall of fame voters to gather perspective on a player’s career before making their decision in a few instances the writers have waived the fiveyear rule roberto clemente drew 393 of a possible 424 votes in a special election in march 1973 months after his death flying relief supplies to victims of a nicaragua earthquake darryl kile rod beck and cory lidle have all also appeared on hall of fame ballots sooner than five years after their untimely deaths a show of respect mostly for players who otherwise wouldn’t have approached cooperstown more ranking the 25 worst baseball hall of fame selections ever when munson debuted on the ballot it seemed like he would have been closer in votes to clemente than kile beck or lidle after all with respect to gary carter carlton fisk or ted simmons the former new york yankees captain might have been the best catcher of the 1970s after johnny bench even without giving him special allowance for the shortness of his career munson rates as one of the best catchers since world war ii somehow munson drew just 155 percent of the vote out of the gate for cooperstown and it only got worse with the writers after there’s a curious effect sometimes when a notable player debuts on the hall of fame ballot and falls far short of cooperstown seemingly relieved of not having to vote for him anymore writers abandon their case en masse munson’s one of the first examples it’s happened with steve garvey and don mattingly since on the anniversary of his death though munson’s case might merit another look and with recent changes to the hall of fame era committee structure munson’s family and supporters could have reason for new hope cooperstown chances 35 percent why over the recent induction weekend the hall of fame board of directors unveiled a series of changes to its era committee system ostensibly designed to help get more players since 1970 in the hall of fame previously the hall of fame maintained committees for three different periods — preintegration era covering 18711946 golden era covering 19471972 and expansion era covering 19732016 — which each voted once every three years the structure slowed the rate of inductions for the veterans committee and seemed destined for change munson’s family and supporters could celebrate that under the new era committee structure munson will fall into a modern baseball committee spanning 197087 that meets twice every five years what this means is that in a 15year period munson will come up for consideration six times instead of the five under the previous structure it’s a small victory but with hall of fame committees candidates need all the small victories they can get more does billy martin still have a chance at the baseball hall of fame so what else does munson have going for his case sabermetrically munson was undoubtedly one of the best catchers of his era here’s how he rates among all catchers since the end of world war ii by the statistic wins above average johnny bench 465gary carter 398mike piazza 357carlton fisk 351yogi berra 34ivan rodriguez 331gene tenace 279joe mauer 263thurman munson 254bill freehan 211of the players in front of munson bench carter piazza fisk and berra are all in the hall of fame and rodriguez could be soon mauer may or may not get in depending what he does with his bat while he mans first base the rest of his career though he at least has an interesting case brewing gene tenace meanwhile might be among the most underrated players in baseball history baseball researcher pete palmer said via email that tenace was the besthitting catcher on a per game basis until piazza munson’s in good company historically narrowing to his era he rates even better by comparison in the years munson played 1969 to 1979 the only catcher better by wins above average was johnny bench “munson is an outstanding ballplayer and would hit 300 in the national league but don’t embarrass nobody by comparing them to johnny bench” his manager sparky anderson said in 1976 it’s true imagine if bench hadn’t been active during munson’s career he might have fared much better with hall of fame voters in 1981 was munson better than ted simmons who didn’t make the list above the mediocre second half of simmons’ career hurts him for wins above average but that’s just one measure of a player bill deane former senior research associate at the hall of fame and a big simmons supporter pointed out that through their age32 seasons simmons had 254 win shares while munson had 206“had he lived i dont think munson would have added much to his résumé” deane said via email “he was clearly in decline in 197879 and was talking about retiring so he could spend more time with his family simmons had two more productive seasons after 32 before becoming a hangeron finishing with 315 ws i think the 315206 is a pretty good approximation of their relative hof credentials”that said munson has more to offer than analytics christopher hahn notes that munson might be one of the best playoff performers in baseball history hitting 357 lifetime in the postseason and helping make the yankees one of the best teams of the late 1970s hahn considers george steinbrenner’s naming of munson as captain in 1976 the greatest decision of his ownership saying in a recent email “without thurman in 1977 and 1978 it is conceivable that the yankees could have gone all the way from 1962 to 1996 between world championships”baseball researcher and hall of fame enthusiast adam darowski noted an unusual facet of munson’s career “what i like about munson is he was almost exclusively a catcher” darowski said via email “he didnt move off the position thats rare and incredibly valuable i think hes one of the 1013 best catchers ever which is a ranking that should certainly place him in the hall”perhaps voters got hung up on the shortness of munson’s career with just 11 seasons and 1558 hits the 1981 hall of fame ballot also abounded with talent featuring a dozen future honorees as of this writing including bob gibson harmon killebrew and juan marichal and catcher’s an underrepresented position in cooperstown munson has his supporters so do simmons bill freehan and elston howard among others every mlb team’s worst regularseason memory
