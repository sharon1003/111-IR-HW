pemphigus in dogs pemphigus is the general designation for a group of autoimmune skin diseases involving ulceration and crusting of the skin as well as the formation of fluidfilled sacs and cysts vesicles and pus filled lesions pustules some types of pemphigus can also affect the skin tissue of the gums an autoimmune disease is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that are produced by the system but which act against the bodys healthy cells and tissues  just as white blood cells act against infection in effect the body is attacking itself the severity of the disease depends on how deeply the autoantibody deposits into the skin layers the hallmark sign of pemphigus is a condition called acantholysis where the skin cells separate and break down because of tissuebound antibody deposits in the space between cells there are four types of pemphigus that affect dogs pemphigus foliaceus pemphigus erythematosus pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus vegetans in the disease pemphigus foliaceus the autoantibodies are deposited in the outermost layers of the epidermis and blisters form on otherwise healthy skin pemphigus erythematosus is fairly common and is a lot like pemphigus foliaceus but less afflictive pemphigus vulgaris on the other hand has deeper and more severe ulcers because the autoantibody is deposited deep in the skin pemphigus vegetans which affects only dogs is the rarest form of pemphigus and seems to be a gentler version of pemphigus vulgaris with somewhat milder ulcers symptoms and types foliaceus scales crust pustules shallow ulcers redness and itching of the skin footpad overgrowth and cracking fluidfilled sacscysts in the skin or vesiclesthe head ears and footpads are the most commonly affected this often becomes generalized over the body gums and lips may be affected swollen lymph nodes generalized swelling depression fever and lameness if footpads are involved however patients often are in good health otherwise variable pain and itchy skin secondary bacterial infection is possible because of cracked or ulcerated skin erythematosus mainly the same as for pemphigus foliaceus lesions are usually confined to the head face and footpads loss of color in lips is more common than with other pemphigus forms vulgaris the most serious of the pemphigus types more severe than pemphigus foliaceus and erythematosus fever depression anorexia may occur if the animal has mouth ulcers ulcers both shallow and deep blisters crusted skin affects gums lips and skin may become generalized over the body the underarm and groin areas are often involved itchy skin and pain secondary bacterial infections are common vegetans pustule groups join to form larger patches of oozing lesions mouth is not usually affected few symptoms of general illness fever depression etc causes autoantibodies the body creates antibodies that react to healthy tissue and cells as though they are pathogenic diseasedexcessive sun exposure certain breeds appear to have a hereditary predisposition diagnosis your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog including a blood chemical profile a complete blood count a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel patients with pemphigus will often have normal bloodwork results you will need to give a thorough history of your dogs health and onset of symptoms possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition should also be reported to your veterinarian eg exposure to sun a skin exam is crucial a skin tissue sample will be taken for examination  biopsy  and pustule and crust aspirates fluid should be wiped onto a slide to diagnose pemphigus a positive diagnosis is achieved when acantholytic cells ie separated cells and neutrophils white blood cells are found a bacterial culture of the skin may be used for identification and treatment of any secondary bacterial infections and antibiotics will be prescribed in the event that there is a secondary infection present treatment your dog will need to be hospitalized for supportive care if it is severely affected by the condition steroid therapy may be prescribed briefly to bring the condition under control if corticosteroid and azathioprine therapy is prescribed your dog will be switched to a lowfat diet since these medications can dispose animals to pancreatitis your veterinarian will treat your dog with the drugs that are specifically suited to the form of pemphigus it has living and management your veterinarian will schedule followup appointments to see your dog every one to three weeks standard bloodwork will be performed at each visit to check for progress once your dogs condition has gone into remission it may be seen once every one to three months the sun can worsen this condition so it is important to protect your dog from excessive exposure to the sun
