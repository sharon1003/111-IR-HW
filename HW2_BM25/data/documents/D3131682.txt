as they can to pay your bill so they can charge fees i have always paid on time and paid substantially more than the min payment so my pay my payment record is clean i have had many problems with trying to use their automotive system throughout the years this last issue was the final straw that broke the camel’s back i paid using the only checking account i have had in 25 year and completed the transaction writing down the confirmation number next statement shows my payment returned along with a 25 fee and 995 interest fee i called to see out why for some reason their computer system had changed one number and my checking account number could not be found it took 1 hour to work it out  the payment was processed  the fees taken off a few weeks later i called to check on my account guess what the 25 fee and the 999 interest fee was still there i talked to 3 more customer service people and none of them would reverse the charges so i cancelled my credit card for my loyalty and 17 years of holding an angel card was not worth 35 to them i meant that little i was treated rudely and will never ever use their credit card ever again i suggest that if you want to buy nothing from them pay with cash or use any other type of credit card out there  do not use their angel card for you will be hit with fees even if it is not your fault and you will be treated horribly view more

salesman and i paid it off and didnt want the temptation of charging in it again then they sent me this thirty dollars off and said i cant use it because i cancelled my account i didnt have to use a credit card to be able to use it then all they care about is getting you to spend as much money as possible i mean the sales people were helpful but it took me forever to find one who actually knew

discontinues a fragrance without warning especially because they assume you will love their new ones they did this several years ago with fruity and bright and are now messing with fresh and clean a few months ago they were having one of their buy 2 get one free so i did i purchased several body mists and body lotion i literally bathe in it so its not like it sits on my shelf for months i opened my last bottle and there was a totally different fragrance in the bottle although it was marked clean and fresh the travel bottles never smell like the large size either i brought it back tonight and exchanged it and bought 2 additional i tested all three and purchase a travel size shame on me for not testing the travel because guess what it is a different scent is there any type of quality assurance do they clean their machines before making a new fragrance now i am going to have to go back also they discontinued the body lotion for the same fragrance why keep the scent if you are not keeping the entire line ridiculous getting very frustrated with them and wondering if quality is a concern at all view more helpful be the first one to find this review helpful michelle of hollywood

their customer service so instead i decided to shop online initially i used the free shipping on purchases over 50 but during checkout i decided i wanted the items sooner than later so i opted to pay for 3 day shipping here i am on day 6 with no package arriving yet and the lady from live chat was no more friendly than the associates in the store here i can buy underwear and bras from walmart and

2018i recently purchased a victoria secret bra online thinking i could take advantage of a sale well the bra arrived and had an odor to it similar to a chemical adhesive smell although i laundered the bra the smell was still apparent i have been a long term victoria secrets bra purchaser at the brick  mortar locations however i am simply appalled by the smell and the quality it is not safe to purchase victoria secret garments online it gives the impression of poor quality design and counterfeit production which is not up to the normal victoria secret standard such poor quality and putrid

feb 12 2018growing up with vs creates loyalty to certain products im so upset how so many things become discontinued without warning women have a signature perfume they love all their lives why would you discontinue your best fragrance but yet keep the worst stinky ones divine was best ever strawberries and champagne best ever gone gone with no warning you blow up email through with promotional bullcrap but you cant warn whats being taken away so fans can stockpile what kind of customer loyalty is that then an entire clothing line disappears there goes pretty dresses i do like the pink line

helpful rebecca of escondido ca verified reviewer verified buyer original review feb 8 2018on december 19 2017 i purchased two gift card for 7000 each at the vs in escondido ca i placed each gift card in christmas cards and i gave them to my nieces on december 25th a few days later my nieces tried to redeem these cards and the cards had zero balances my receipt shows that the transaction at the vs store correctly added the 7000 to each card however the cards were redeemed on december 21st at a vs store in ontario ca  82 miles from my house i have never been to ontario the gift cards were in my house next to my christmas tree from december 19th until my nieces opened their cards on christmas morning after spending weeks contacting vs and my bank and after vs completing an investigation vs states that they are not liable for the loss of the money on my two gift cards and they are not going to do anything to return the money to me or my nieces one of the customer service representatives at vs said that someone likely took a picture of the card at the counter with the gift card numbers and waited until there was money loaded onto the card then redeemed the card in ontario the fact that they will not return the money to me is terrible i will never do business with victorias secret ever again they are horribleview more helpful 6 people found this review helpful christopher of st

money out of your pocket getting a angel card was a big mistake that i could ever done to myself i got a payment overdue because of some idiot over vs said they sent an billing statement way before the due date guess what the statement came 15 days after the assessment fee got applied including interest i called to get help of this particular situation only found out that they can’t do anything about that and the representative has no responsibility and ability to this problem at all this guy keep blaming the postal office fault to why the mail didn’t come in instead like other company try to help you waive it and solve your actual problem at hand i got into a fight with them before he sent me to their manager who said she doesn’t handle any of these problems and tried to forward me to someone else you know this company pack tons of retards when their manager don’t even know to solve the problem i rested my case here i would recommend never make a mistake doing business with them

jennifer of nashua nh verified reviewer original review jan 13 2018i recently went into victorias secret to purchase some bras having a bit of extra money i figured i would indulge and get myself some nice bras bad idea i purchased 4 bras all underwire bras in different styles on every single bra the underwire is far too long and extends upward closer to my armpit area than any other brand of bras i own i spent over 100 on bras and cant wear any of them without getting a sore from the outer edge of the underwire id also like to note that i was measured by the victorias secret staff members and purchased the suggested size so it cant be the fact that i simply purchased the wrong size bra get it together guys youre supposed to be quality not just a regretful purchase i have attached photos of a black bra from victorias secret and a white bra of another brand that is very comfortable on top of it to show the difference in wire length helpful be the first one to find this review helpful luka

this review helpful tess of warriewood other verified reviewer verified buyer original review dec 21 2017extremely bad customer service i have ordered 23 weeks ago three items from a special they were running i wanted to have the sports bra for a while now and because they were running a special i decided to buy a set as i have never bought myself a matching set first the order didnt came through but it was deducted from my pay pal account later i tried it again and it did came through and i was refunded for the other order after some days on the 13th of december i received a message saying my order was being processed and that i would receive an email when my package is ready on the 18th i still didnt receive an email so i clicked on the button to check my order status and it said “were sorry we do not recognize either the order number or the email address you have provided please reenter the information” after i send an email about this i received an email saying that it does show in their system and that my order should be delivered by the end of january the third and they provided me with a tracking number but all the links they provided didnt work and it still didnt show my order so i contacted them again as a response i received some steps i had to follow but these were the same steps i already did also they said it worked for them so it didnt seem to bother them that their system doesnt work for their customers eventually i received a shipping confirmation on the 21st of december but it only shows 2 products and not the bra which was the reason i purchased in the first place so i contacted them about this as it showed a message saying that i may receive several shipments to complete the fulfillment of my order so i asked them if i receive the bra later or what is going on as a respond i got that due to a processing error the sports bra was no longer available and could not be shipped with my order as initially expected as a result they processed a refund for this item through a third party and that i have to allow 7 to 10 business days for processing and 1 to 2 billing cycles for the credit to appear on my monthly statement furthermore i received a link to browse for an alternate selection and if so i have to place a new order this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life i bought this as a set so i expect at least a full refund of all items or a very good compensation for the many problems i experienced i had to find out myself that one item was missing from the shipment summary the item was still visible in my order

continue to make shopping fun with their constant promotions as well as free gifts coupons rewards and discounts i especially love shopping online as there are almost no other websites that will let you enter more than one offer code like vs does vs is smart and continues to be a sought after brand so much so that even used items can have good resale value so its worth the investmentone of my favorite retail locations to shop at is their mall location in boise idaho now this is also my home city so that may be a factor but they give me the royal treatment every time the girls are so sweet friendly and accommodating and i sometimes have complicated transactions to take advantage of whatever current promos they are running and usually at least a couple of online returns as well also i should mention their store is also well organized and clean i always walk out with a smile on my face when i shop there i have visited multiple vs locations over the years and have definitely come across the rude cashiers with attitudes coupon nazis dirty unorganized stores etc but no company is perfect and i am just glad i happen to live in idaho near this location where i never have to deal
