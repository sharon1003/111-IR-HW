test weight conversion charts for canadian grains the test weight conversion charts are based on accumulated data over crop years representing changes in growing environment and crop varieties the data is limited only by the number of samples available for inclusion the test weight conversion charts are updated to reflect changes in dominant crop varieties and environmental conditions affecting crop quality conversion charts for some crops such as triticale are not available due to a lack of data or where official inspection does not include test weight as a gradedetermining factor such as for peas and lentils determine test weight to determine test weight follow the procedures in official grain grading guide  chapter 1 â€“ determining test weight conversion charts amber durum wheat barley buckwheat corn flaxseed hulless barley oats rye soybean sunflower seed confectionery sunflower seed oil wheat background information on the derivation of the test weight conversion chartg05 ldetermined using the operational test weight methodology outlined in the canadian grain commission official grain grading guide the method incorporates a cox funnel 05 l container hardwood striker and digital electronic scalekgh lderived from g05 l incorporating canadian grain commission developed regression equations to predict the approximate kgh l as would have been determined by standard schopper chondrometer methodologylbavery bu lba buderived by dividing the determined approximate kgh l by 1247 the value 1247 represents the arithmetic relationship between the lb british dry bushel and kgh l1 british bushel  03637 hectolitre1 kg  1000 grams1 lb  45359 gramskgh l  04535903637  1247 lbbu arithmetic conversionnote allowing for grain compaction the canadian grain commission determined approximate kgh l by definition takes into account the compaction of grain conversion to approximate lbbu from this number will result in the lbbu figure also allowing for grain compaction therefore referred to as averylbwinchester bu lbw buderived by multiplying the g05 l measurement by 01552 the value 01552 represents the arithmetic relationship between g05 l and lb winchester bushel1 lb  45359 grams05 l  500 cm 3win bushel  35 200 cm 3  70405 litre container the arithmetic multiplier then is 70445359  01552note not allowing for grain compaction the u s winchester bushel 1244 feet 3 is smaller than the british or imperial bushel 12843 feet 3  the lb winchester bushel is an arithmetic conversion which does not allow for grain compaction contacts for more information on test weight please contact statistics and business information date modified 20140812
