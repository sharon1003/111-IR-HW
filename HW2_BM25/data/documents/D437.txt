conceptual physics chapter 25april 12 2016 by shaahid5249240the time it takes for one back and forth motion of a pendulum is called period list the two things that determine the period of a pendulum1 length of the pendulum 2 acceleration of gravity tf a longer pendulum has a longer periodtrue tf a shorter pendulum swings with a greater frequencytrue tf mass does not affect the period of the pendulumtrue tf all pendulums swing at the same ratefalse what is simple harmonic motionthe backandforth vibratory motion of a swinging pendulum tf a sine curve is a pictorial representation of a wavetrue which of the following describes the source of all waves a temperature change a change in pressure something that vibrates an electrical currentsomething that vibrates cresthigh point on a wave troughlow point on a wave amplitudedistance from a midpoint to a crest wavelengthdistance between successive identical parts of a wave frequencyvibrations per unit of time hertzunit of frequency tf as the frequency of a vibrating source increase the period increasesfalse describe the wave that forms and what is transmitted when a stone is dropped in a pond a wave is produced that moves out from the center in an expanding circle the wave transmits energy but not matter sound waves are a  that travels through airdisturbance tf sound waves carry energytrue tf air is the medium that sound waves travel throughtrue tf sound waves are a disturbance that moves through the airtrue tf air molecules are carried along with sound wavestrue tf the speed of a wave depends on the medium through which it travelstrue the speed of sound in air is about  ms to  ms300 to 350 tf sound travels faster in air than in waterfalse which of the following wave properties are related speed frequency direction wavelengthspeed frequency wavelength describe how to calculate the speed of a wave you multiply the wave’s wavelength by its frequency which of the following equations is used to calculate a wave’s speed v lamdap v lamdat v lamdaf v lamdaav lamdaf the greek letter  is often used to represent wavelengthlamda tf the equation for calculating the speed of a wave does not apply to light wavesfalse describe how wavelength and frequency are related for sound waves they are inversely related which best describes a transverse wave the medium does not vibrate the medium vibrates at the right angles to the direction the wave travels the medium vibrates in the same direction the wave travels a sound wave the medium vibrates at the right angles to the direction the wave travels which is an example of a transverse wave waves in the strings of instruments radio waves light waves sound waveswaves in the strings of instruments radio waves light waves describe the motion of the particles in a medium when a longitudinal wave passes through it the particles oscillate parallel to or along the direction of the wave what is an example of a longitudinal wavesound imagine the image of the girl with the spring and the spring is moving like a snake wavey what kind of wave it thattransverse imagine the image of the girl with the spring and the spring is kind of straight what kind of wave it thatlongitudinal an  is a regular arrangement of places where wave effects are increased decreased or neutralizedinterference pattern constructive interferencewhen the crests overlap and effect add together destructive interferencewhen the crests overlap troughs and effects are reduced out of phasewhen the crests and troughs overlap to produce zero amplitude in phasewhen crests of one wave overlap the crests of another wave describe when wave interference occurs interference occurs when waves from different sources arrives at the same place simultaneously tf wave interference only occurs with transverse wavesfalse tf a wave that appears not to move is likely to be a standing wavetrue the points on a standing wave where no motion occurs are called nodes tf antinodes seem not to movefalse tf antinodes occur midway between nodestrue tf antinodes location is of the largest amplitudetrue tf antinodes location is of zero amplitudefalse standing waves occur because of interference describe the conditions necessary – in terms of wavelength – for a standing wave to form in a rope attached to a wall they form when half wavelength or a multiple of a half wavelength fits exactly into the length of the vibrating medium tf standing waves can form in both transverse and longitudinal wavestrue tf a moving wave source does not affect the frequency of the wave encountered by an observerfalse describe the doppler effectthe apparent change in frequency due to motion of the source or receiver tf doppler effect occurs when a wave source moves toward an observertrue tf doppler effect occurs when an observer moves toward a wave sourcetrue tf doppler effect occurs when a wave source moves away from an observertrue tf doppler effect occurs when an observer moves away from a wave sourcetrue tf a higher frequency results when a wave source moves toward an observertrue two fire trucks with sirens on speed toward and away from an observer as shown below imagine that identify which truck speeding toward the listener or away produces a higher than normal siren frequency and which produces a lower than normal siren frequencyhigher – truck speeding toward the listener lower – truck speeding away the blue shift and red shift refer to how the doppler effect affects  waveslight an  in frequency is called a blue shiftincrease a  in frequency is called a red shiftdecrease tf bow waves form a vshaped wake in back of the moving sourcetrue bow waves form when the wave source moves  than the wave speedfaster tf the crests of bow waves overlap at their edgestrue which below describes how increasing the speed of the wave source above the wave speed affects the shape of the bow waves that is formed the bow wave is unchanged the bow wave has a narrower v shape the bow wave have a wider v shape the bow wave forms a straight line the bow wave has a narrower v shape a shock wave is called a cone which below describes the conditions needed for a shock wave to form an object moves at the speed of sound the wave speed equals the object’s speed the wave speed equals the object’s speed an object moves faster than the speed of sound an object moves faster than the speed of sound what is a sonic boom a sonic boom is the sharp crack heard when the shock wave that sweeps behind a supersonic aircraft reaches the listener why don’t we hear a sonic boom from a subsonic aircraft because the sound wave crests reach our ears one at a time and are perceived as a continuous tone tf a sonic boom is formed only at the moment an object breaks through the sound barrierfalse vibrationthe source of all wave motion periodthe time needed for a wave to make one complete cycle interferencewhen two or more waves are at the same place at the same time as the sound of a car’s horn passes and recedes from you the pitch of the horn seems to decrease the amplitude of a particular wave is 40 m the toptobottom distance of the disturbance is 80 m if you double the frequency of a vibrating object its period halves a child swings back and forth on a playground swing if the child stands rather that sits the time for a toandfro swing is lengthened the doppler effect occurs when a source of sound movesaway andor toward you the frequency of the second hand on a clock is160 hz two waves arrive at the same place at the same time exactly in step with each other eave wave has an amplitude of 25 m the resulting wave has an amplitude of  50 m a certain ocean wave have a frequency of 007 hertz and a wavelength of 10 meters what is the wave’s speed070 ms a cork floating in a pool oscillates up and down three complete cycles in 1 second as a wave passes by the wave’s wavelength is 2 meters what is the wave’s speed6 ms  advertisements share this twitter facebook like be the
