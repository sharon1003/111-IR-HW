high efficiency low emission coal moving the current average global efficiency rate of coalfired power plants from 33 to 40 by deploying more advanced offtheshelf technology could cut two gigatonnes of co2 emissions deploying high efficiency low emission hele coalfired power plants is a key first step along a pathway to nearzero emissions from coal with carbon capture use and storage ccus hele technologies are commercially available now and if deployed can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the entire power sector by around 20 what does improving efficiency mean improving efficiency increases the amount of energy that can be extracted from a single unit of coal a one percentage point improvement in the efficiency of a conventional pulverised coal combustion plant results in a 23 reduction in co2 emissions what can be achieved moving the current average global efficiency rate of coalfired power plants from 33 to 40 by deploying more advanced offtheshelf technology could cut two gigatonnes of co2 emissions now while allowing affordable energy for economic development and poverty reduction two gigatonnes of co2 is equivalent to indias annual co2 emissions running the european unions emissions trading scheme for 53 years at its current rate or running the kyoto protocol three times over in addition to significant benefits from reduced co2 emissions these modern high efficiency plants have significantly reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides nox sulphur dioxide so2  and particulate matter pm beyond the climate benefits of reduced co2 emissions reduction in these pollutants is of additional importance at the local and regional level to address air quality and related health concerns in summary hele technologies platform for accelerating coal efficiency resources photo is provided by jpower epdcwca report considers the benefits of hele coal technologies against nonhele and renewables read the power of high efficiency coal here hele technologies improvements in the efficiency of coalfired power plants can be achieved with technologies including supercritical  ultrasupercritical technology new pulverised coal combustion systems – utilising supercritical and ultrasupercritical technology – operate at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures and therefore achieve higher efficiencies than conventional pcc units and significant co2 reductions supercritical steam cycle technology has been used for decades and is becoming the system of choice for new commercial coalfired plants in many countries research and development is under way for ultrasupercritical units operating at even higher efficiencies potentially up to around 50 the introduction of ultrasupercritical technology has been driven over recent years in countries such as denmark germany and japan in order to achieve improved plant efficiencies and reduce fuel costs integrated gasification combined cycle igccan alternative to achieving efficiency improvements in conventional pulverised coalfired power stations is through the use of gasification technology igcc plants use a gasifier to convert coal or other carbonbased materials to syngas which drives a combined cycle turbine more information can be found on the gasification section fluidised bed combustion fluidised bed combustion fbc is a very flexible method of electricity production – most combustible material can be burnt including coal biomass and general waste fbc systems improve the environmental impact of coalbased electricity reducing sox and nox emissions by 90 a database of cleaner coal technologies – which includes detailed descriptions of each technology – is available on the iea clean coal technologies website emission reductions by policies  actions bn tonnes co2 equivalentannual emissions are cumulative emissions divided by the relevant period the estimate for the current emissions avoided under the montreal protocol is eight billion tonnes of c02e the annual figure for the collapse of the ussr refers to the years 19921998 ☨ cars and light trucks sources the economist 2014 and iea 2013platform for accelerating coal efficiency pacegiven the huge potential offered by improving efficiencies the world coal association has published a concept paper on a global platform for accelerating coal efficiency pace the vision of pace would be that for countries choosing to use coal the most efficient power plant technology possible is deployed the overriding objective would be to raise the global average efficiency of coalfired power plants and so minimise co2 emissions which will otherwise be emitted while maintaining legitimate economic development and poverty alleviation efforts pace would be an international publicprivate partnership in addition to governments and corporations it would also partner with other nonstate actors such as nongovernmental organisations think tanks and research institutes who can contribute knowledge and support in achieving paces vision and objectives it would work at both local and international levels more about paceresources link wca hele technology explainer link wca coal and air quality factsheet link
