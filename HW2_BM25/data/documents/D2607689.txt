a brief history of heat heat treatment of ruby  sapphireby richard w hughes the history of gem treatments is as old as the gem trade itself like much gemological one of the earliest references to gem treatments is found in plinys history of the world the following is a selection…moreover i have in my library certain books by authors now living whom i would under no circumstances name wherein there are descriptions as to how to give the color of smaragdus emerald to crystallus rock crystal and how to imitate other transparent gems for example how to make a sardonychus sardonyx from a sarda carnelian in part sard in a word to transform one stone into another to tell the truth there is no fraud or deceit in the world which yields greater gain and profit than that of counterfeiting gems pliny 23–79 ad from ball 1950 p 195another early work mentioning gem treatments is that of an anonymous egyptian whose writings have survived in the form of two papyri believed to date from the third or fourth centuries ad nassau 1984 the second known as the stockholm papyrus or papyrus graecus holmiensis details methods of counterfeiting and treating gems below is but a small sample19 production of ruby the treating of crystal rock crystal so that it appears like ruby take smoky crystal and make the ordinary stone from it take and heat it gradually in the dark and indeed until it appears to you to have the heat within it heat it once more in goldfounders waste take and dip the stone in cedar oil mixed with natural sulphur and leave it in the dye for the purpose of absorption until morning 53 corroding and opening up of stones grind alum and melt it carefully in vinegar put the stones therein boil it up and leave them there over night rinse them off however on the following day and color them as you wish by use of the recipes for coloring er caley 1927 the stockholm papyrus heat treatment of corundums has been mentioned in a number of early works particularly by arabs teifaschi in his treatise on gems from about 1240 ad had this to say in sarandib sri lanka and its environs ruby is treated by fire people take pebbles from the earth and crush and compress them into a mass with the aid of water this mixture is daubed completely around a dry stone then the whole thing is placed on a rock with other rocks set down around it dry firewood is thrown on top lit and blown upon with bellows the blowing is applied along with more wood till any black overtones on the ruby have disappeared the amount of fire and the application of wood depends on the extent of the blackness present people know this by experience they heattreat stones for at least one hour and at most twenty days and nights then they carefully extract the ruby its blackness having disappeared the ruby is not heat treated a second time after one treatment its color can neither improve nor diminish teifaschi ca 1240 ad into french by clémentmullet nd ca 1982 into english by sersen 1991in the sixth book of his natural magick john baptist porta ca 1535–1615 of naples discusses various methods of counterfeiting and adulterating precious stones most interesting is the following description of heat treatment how to make a stone white on one side and red or blew on the other i have seen precious stones thus made and in great esteem with great persons being of two colours on one side a saphire and on the other a diamond and so of divers colours which may be done after this manner for example we would have a saphire should be white on one side and blew on the other or should be white on one side and red on the other thus it may be done plaister up that side which you would have red or blew with chalk and let it be dryed then commit it to the fire those ways we spoke of before and the naked side will lose the colour and turn white that it will seem a miracle of nature to those that know not by how slight an art it may be done john baptist porta natural magick 1658compare the previous two accounts to that from nineteenth century sri lanka below which describes the heat treatment of ruby also quoted by tennent 1859…the tinge of blue which is frequently found in the stone giving it the name of neelakantia is easily removed by burning the process is simple and is as follows – the stone is enclosed in a thick coating of chunam lime that which is used by the natives with their betelleaves and then exposed to a strong heat the operation is repeated until the whole of the blue tinge is removed but care should be taken to subject only such stones as are perfectly free from cracks to this for one with cracks if subjected to heat is said to crumble down in pieces jf stewart 1855 from am  j ferguson 1888the above are but a few of the historical mentions of corundum treatments far from a recent discovery ruby and sapphire heat treatment has been practiced for centuries possibly dating back to roman times but todays dramatic facelifts are a far cry from the subtle changes of the past it was the discovery that sri lankas geuda sapphires could be revitalized via heat that opened the floodgates the result has been that virtually all rubies and sapphires traded today have at some point been exposed to the heat of an oven indeed certain pieces which would have been worthless a mere two decades ago can today be transformed into gems worth tens of thousands of dollars modern heat enter the geuda who was first to discover the potential of the geuda and when did it happen no one knows for certain when but it was not until the 19th century that ovens capable of reaching the necessary temperatures 1500°c became available in answering the question of who the most convincing account is that related to the author by an oldschool paris dealer who wishes to remain anonymous according to this source modern heat treatment was developed by professor and madame bron of company grasset and bron rue chantepoulet geneva although not confirmed it is suspected that the brons were involved in production of geneva ruby a forerunner of verneuil synthetic corundum apparently one result of their experiments with the fusion of natural ruby fragments was the secret of hightemperature corundum treatment the first stones heated allegedly originated from the pailin mines in cambodia treated sapphire rough was given for cutting to lapidaries in the jura mountains of europe at least by 1920 and possibly as early as 1915 because the rough was being obtained from the thaicambodian border area the brons had contact with people there at one point a thai was hired to help with the work and the secret then spread prof bron eventually died but madame bron continued her husbands work well into the 1950s not without a good deal of guilt too for according to my source she realized that the family business had committed fraud on a grand scale coldham 1992 gives a slightly different version of the tale according to him two cambodian students came to stay at the swiss gentlemans house a thencommon practice among wealthy frenchspeaking cambodians during their stay they learned of the process and upon their return to cambodia passed the secret on to dealers in the sapphire fields coldham also mentions a london dealer who bought quantities of both silky and nonsilky australian sapphire in the late 1960s cut stones were then sold back to australia by the same london dealer due to his experience as a cutter coldham realized that the volume of clean rough going to london could not account for the volume of cut stones coming back to australia he later learned that the london dealer and the swiss gentleman had close business associations an interesting aside to the above is given in an article from 1916 which reported it is noteworthy that there has been a strong demand for dark violetblue stones these stones are so dark that they appear quite opaque in dull weather and can only be identified on a cloudless day in the larger sizes up to 3 oz in weight stones of this colour sell for as much as £5 per oz although they yield a black stone when cut locally and it is suspected that the germans have some method whereby they can modify the colour it may be suggested that this is probably done by the simple method of heating the stone many minerals such as for instance smoky zircon have their colour modified and their transparency greatly increased after having been heated to redness and a specimen of anakie sapphire examined at the imperial institute showed a greatly increased transparency as a result of this treatment anonymous 1916 sapphiremining industry of anakie queensland in 1966 robert crowningshield described a blue sapphire reportedly from thailand that displayed a very weak spectrum and a greenish white sw uv fluorescence later he reported on a fine natural blue sapphire of 18 cts that displayed a zoned greenish white fluorescence under sw uv crowningshield 1966 1970 while crowningshield mentioned nothing of heat treatment today we know that such reactions are common in heattreated sapphires particularly those from sri lanka it is highly likely that these were early examples of heated sapphires beesley 1982 from this point on the facts are known in the 1970s someone in thailand began applying the process to lowgrade sri lankan material on a large scale by the latter part of that decade large numbers of heattreated sri lankan sapphires were streaming out of thai ovens in the early days of what amounted to the great geuda rush rough could be had for a song and fortunes were amassed
