contractions 2 baseline fhr 3 baseline variability 4 presence of accelerations 5 periodic or episodic decelerations 6 changestrends in the fhr pattern over time info on the efm tracing 3cm  1 min dark line to dark line is 1 min light line to light line is 10 sec amplitude or bpm is in increments of 10 top tracing is fhr bottom tracing is uterine contractions coordinate topbottom tracings w a straight line or ruler to see how they correlate fetal wellbeing is demonstrated by variability and accelerations fhr baseline fhr rounded to the nearest increment of 5 bpm in a 10min segment excluding accelerations decelerations marked variability or segments with a difference of 25 bpm or more need 2 minutes of baseline out of the 10min strip fhr bpm parameters bradycardia  110 bpm normal range 110160 bpm tachycardia  160 bpmfhr variability the fluctuations in the fhr baseline that are irregular in amplitude and frequency goodfhr variability classifications  absent no variability detectable badfhr variability classifications  minimal less than or equal to 5 bpm may become badfhr variability classifications  moderate 6  25 bpm most babies are here  normalfhr variability classifications  marked greater than 25 bpm indicates maybe a struggling babyfhr sinusoidal pattern bad smooth sinewavelike undulating pattern with a cycle frequency of 35 bpm lasting at least 20 minutes fhr sinusoidal pattern causes fetal anemia narcotics chronic abruption may lead to fetal anemia narcotics may be temporary and wear off fhr accelerations good abrupt increase of at least 15 bpm from the baseline onset to peak is less than 30 seconds lasts at least 15 seconds but no more than 2 minutes associated with fetal movement fhr acceleration parameters for a baby of 32 weeks gestation abrupt increase from the baseline of at least 10 bpm onset to peak is less than 30 seconds lasting at least 10 seconds but no more than 2 min types of decelerations  ways to describe decels periodic associated w contractions episodic not associated w contractions early ok late bad variable bad prolonged bad intermittent or recurrent fhr late decelerations bad symmetrical gradual decrease in the fhr usually associated with uterine contractions onset to nadir is 30 seconds nadir occurs after the peak of the contraction fhr late decelerations  1 thing to remember associated w poor oxygenation  poor perfusion of the placenta badfhr early decelerations ok symmetrical gradual decrease in fhr associated w uterine contractions onset to nadir is 30 seconds nadir occurs at the peak of the contraction mirror image upper and lower tracings when lined up w a rulerfhr early decelerations  1 thing to remember indicates fetal head compression normal fhr variable decelerations bad abrupt drop in the fhr below the baseline may or may not be associated w uterine contractions onset to nadir 30 seconds decrease of  15 bpm lasting at least 15 sec but no more than 2 min these criteria must be met to call them variable decelsfhr variable decelerations  1 thing to remember indicates cord compression badfhr prolonged deceleration bad decrease of at least 15 bpm or more lasting 2 minutes or longer but no more than 10 min indicates hypoxemia fhr prolonged deceleration  1 thing to remember indicates hypoxemia badfhr baseline change lower prolonged deceleration longer than 10 minutes aka decrease in fhr lasting more than 10 minutes caused by narcotics given to mom for labor pain or magnesium sulfate given to mom for preeclampsia fhr intermittent decelerations occur with less than 50 of the contractions in a 20 minute segment fhr recurrent decelerations occur with more than 50 of the contractions in a 20 minute segment uterine activity  normal 5 or less contractions in a 10 minute period averaged over 30 minutes uterine activity  tachysystole greater than or equal to 5 contractions in a 10 minute period averaged over 30 minutes bad means poor o2 to baby uterine contraction monitoring  1 thing to remember strength of the contraction is monitored by a uterine contraction physically moving the external button up and down may not adequately portray amplitude on a fluffy woman any movement or turning in bed by the woman will cause sharp spikes on the tracing how often to review the fhr monitoring strip during uncomplicated labor 1st stage q30min 2nd stage q15 min how often to review the fhr monitoring strip during complicated or induced labor 1st stage q15 min 2nd stage q5 min fhr pattern classifications class i normal indicates normal acidbase status baseline rate 110160 moderate variability may have early decels and accelerations are ok too fhr pattern classifications class ii indeterminate not predictive of abnormal acidbase status insufficient data to categorized tracing does not meet criteria for class i or iiifhr pattern classifications class iii abnormal indicates abnormal acidbase status absent variability w recurrent late or variable decelerations and abnormal baseline hr bradycardia sinusoidal pattern absent variability alone puts a strip in this class interventions for indeterminate or abnormal tracings position change  lateral preferred iv fluid bolus esp w epidural decrease or turn off oxytocin or remove cervidil to slow contractions o2 at 10lmin by nonrebreather mask modify pushing
