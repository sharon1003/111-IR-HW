association as noted in the previous page researchers are usually interested in relationships between variables when two variables are related we say that there is association between them for example consider the height x and weight y of a sample of school children tall children tend to be heavier so high values of x are associated with high values of y the correlation coefficient describes the amount of linear association between two such numerical variables causal relationships in some data sets it is possible to conclude that one variable has a direct influence on the other this is called a causal relationship for example  a scientist in a dairy factory tries four different packaging materials for blocks of cheese and measures their shelf life the packaging material might influence shelf life but the shelf life cannot influence the packaging material used the relationship is therefore causal a bank manager is concerned with the number of customers whose accounts are overdrawn half of the accounts that become overdrawn in one week are randomly selected and the manager telephones the customer to offer advice any difference between the mean account balances after two months of the overdrawn accounts that did and did not receive advice can be causally attributed to the phone calls if two variables are causally related it is possible to conclude that changes to the explanatory variable x will have a direct impact on y noncausal relationships not all relationships are causal in noncausal relationships the relationship that is evident between the two variables is not completely the result of one variable directly affecting the other in the most extreme case  two variables can be related to each other without either variable directly affecting the values of the other the two diagrams below illustrate mechanisms that result in noncausal relationships between x and y if two variables are not causally related it is impossible to tell whether changes to one variable x will result in changes to the other variable y for example the scatterplot below shows data from a sample of towns in a region the positive correlation between the number of churches and the number of deaths from cancer is an example of a noncausal relationship  the size of the towns is a lurking variable since larger towns have more churches and also more deaths clearly decreasing the number of churches in a town will not reduce the number of deaths from cancerresearchers usually want to detect causal relationships
