no while it is obvious that an impressive amount of historical and scholarly research was undertaken by the filmmakers much of the plot is fiction the fiction does however appear to be inspired by actual historical events as will be shown in the appropriate sections below in this sense the film is perhaps best seen as a collage or artistic representation of ancient history as opposed to an accurate chronological reconstruction of events it also appears that scott attempts to present not just a reconstruction of empirical facts but also desires to present to us his vision of the culture of ancient rome the spirit of its time and the psychological outlook characteristic of its period in other words its zeitgeist and for the psychology of the characters their mentalite on that note ridley scottmuch to his credit has gone further than any filmmaker before him only fellini in the satyricon has attempted to do this before and in so doing scott while historiographically imperfect avoids many of the annoying anachronisms of psychology present in such films as spartacus cleopatra and ben hur clearly director scott and screenwriter david franzoni understand that history is more than a regurgitation of empirical data and that to understand a society one must be able to do more than recite names and dates one must also attempt to understand the psychology and culture of its characters hence the film emphasizes maximuss worship of his family and ancestors his obsessive compulsion for virtue and duty and the stoical elements ever present in his character what was marcus aurelius really like marcus aurelius was as well as emperor from 161 to 180 ce a stoic philosopher he really did wage battles along the frontier as depicted in the film and is remembered by historians of his time as a competent ruler whom they favour his name in full was imperator caesar marcus aurelius antoninus augustus and these are the titles to which he would have been referred not the anachronistic sire and my lord as in the film his work the meditations although more a compilation of existing stoical thought than a work of great originality remains a highly readable classic in philosophy an interesting fact omitted in the film was that his adoptive brother and husband to daughter lucilla lucius verus was made coemperor with marcus in the time of the republic rome was not ruled by emperors but rather by two consuls these consuls with equal power were to guard against dictatorship so perhaps marcus really did have republican inclinations as attested to in the film or perhaps this was a machiavellian maneuver undertaken in an attempt to avoid the fate of the perceived dictator julius caesar this was the first time in history that the roman empire had two joint emperors of formally equal constitutional status and powers although in reality marcus was clearly the ruler of rome what was commodus really like if the ancient sources can be trusted commodus was even more bizarre in real life than he was in the film commodus whose full name was caesar marcus aurelius commodus antoninus augustus was proclaimed caesar at age 5 and joint emperor coaugustus at the age of 17 in 177 ce by his father marcus aurelius reality was very different than the film in this instance commodus was as depicted in gladiator present with his father during the danubian wars and yes this is where marcus aurelius died as for the actual circumstances of his fathers death see below historians from the time of commodus have not been kind to him as aristocratic intellectuals they were not amused by his crude antics hence our present day historiography still reflects rightly or wrongly this ancient bias his father possessing the virtues seen as noble by the literate aristocracy was and often still is regarded as a great man while his son was hated by the senate and ridiculed by historians yet it is said that the army and the lower classes loved him cassius dio a senator and historian who lived during the reign of both commodus and his father wrote in regards to the accession of commodus that our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust as affairs did for the romans of that day indeed some historians even question his sanity commodus in his own time was accused of being a megalomaniac he renamed rome colonia commodiana the colony of commodus and renamed the months of the year after titles held in his honour namely lucius aelius aurelius commodus augustus herculeus romanus exsuperatorius amazonius invictus felix and pius the senate was renamed the commodian fortunate senate and the roman people were given the name commodianus historian aelius lampridius tells us that commodus lived rioting in the palace amid banquets and in baths along with 300 concubines gathered together for their beauty and chosen from both matrons and harlots by his orders concubines were debauched before his own eyes and he was not free from the disgrace of intimacy with young men defiling every part of his body in dealings with persons of either sex commodus went so far as to declare himself the new founder of rome a new romulus in attempting to boast a new golden age of rome he was clearly emulating his father but the effect was to make him the laughing stock of the aristocratic class did commodus really kill his father maybe some sources suspect that he did the fact that he was present at the time made a hasty peace with the enemy and a quick retreat back to rome in a victory triumph has fueled speculation the official story is that marcus aurelius died of plague did commodus really fight as a gladiator yesin this case the truth is even stranger than the fiction commodus claimed to be descended from the god hercules and even began to dress like him wearing lion skins and carrying a club the historian herodian wrote that in his gladiatorial combats he defeated his opponents with ease and he did no more than wound them since they all submitted to him but only because they knew he was the emperor not because he was truly a gladiator he also fought wild beasts dio cassius wrote that commodus killed five hippopotami at one time he also killed two elephants several rhinoceroses and a giraffe with the greatest of ease herodian tells us further that commodus had a special platform constructed which encircled the arena from which he would display his skills as a hunter he is recorded to have killed one hundred leopards with one hundred javelins as a theatrical treat he would slice the heads off of ostriches with crescentheaded arrows which would then run around the amphitheater headless dio cassius reveals that senators were made to attend these spectacles and that on one occasion commodus killed an ostrich and displayed the severed head in one hand his sword dripping with blood in the other thus implying that he could treat them the same way did commodus really die in the arena no however he was assassinated and by an athlete there were numerous plots and attempts upon his life but the one which finally succeeded was carried out by a wrestler named narcissus while commodus was in his bath the plot was orchestrated by his closest advisors and apparently even included his mistress marcia it occurred on the last day of the year 192 it was believed that commodus planned to kill the consulselect and be sworn in as consul himself this he reportedly was going to do dressed as a gladiator in his lion skins this was the final outrage his fate was sealed commodus ruled for 12 years a much longer period than alluded to in the film dio cassius wrote that commodus was a greater curse to the romans than any pestilence or any crime was the republic restored after the death of commodus no the film is wrong on this count a republic is a system of government which does not have a hereditary monarch an emperor is a monarch the united states is a republic and england is not rome was not founded as a republic as was stated by a senator who should have known better in the film legend has it that rome was originally ruled by etruscan kings the first king was romulus the kings were overthrown in a revolution which was sparked by the rape of lucretia in 509 bce by sextus tarquin the son of the seventh and last king tarquinius superbus dictators and kings were thereafter despised by romans hence the ideological adulation of a republican system of government which was a central theme of both roman history and the movie after commodus was murdered the senate met before daybreak and declared sixtysix year old pertinax who was the son of a former slave emperor pertinax thus became emperor on january 1st but he was murdered by a group of soldiers the following march after less than three months in power what was maximus really like maximus decimus meridius his full name is stated only once in the film is a fictitious characteralthough he did not exist he seems to be a composite of actual historical figures in the film maximus was marcus aurelius general there was in fact a general by the name of avidius cassius who was involved in the military campaign shown in the film and upon hearing a rumor of marcus aurelius death declared himself emperor he however was assassinated by his own soldiers it is true that there was in the later empire a general by the name of maximus who appears to have had revolutionary intentions he is most likely an inspiration as well maximus also reminds one of the emperor diocletian remember that in the film marcus aurelius names maximus as his heir diocletian who ruled rome from 284 to 305 ce was born in the lower classes like maximus he eventually became his emperors trusted favourite and bodyguard and later became a general finally he was named heir and thus became emperor commodus in reality was not murdered in the arena by maximus he was however murdered by a wrestler so the character maximus while fictitious is not that farfetched he appears to be collage of other real historical figures as for his personality he was definitely a stoic as evidenced by his sense of obligation to the state and concern for duty and virtue this makes sense given his admiration for marcus aurelius who was a stoic philosopher one difficulty is even though many romans and not just christians believed in an afterlife stoics usually did not so this is problematic with regards to his character in the film did senator gracchus really exist no the ideology which he represents is however somewhat authentic senator gracchus appears to be based upon tiberius and gaius gracchus during the republic these two brothers were one after the other plebeian tribunes not senators they were champions of the common people and paid the cost with their lives tiberius gracchus was elected tribune of the people in 133 bce and fought for reforms of benefit to the plebeians he was murdered by opponents his brother gaius was elected tribune of the people in 123 bce and attempted the continuation of popular reforms he was also murdered it is problematic that in the film gracchus was a senator in the sense that it was the senatorial class which opposed gauis and tiberius and even participated in their murder the political infrastructure of ancient rome evolved over time and was actually more complex than portrayed in the film other important political entities along with the senate were the plebeian tribunate as well as the comitia centuriata these along with two consuls who would rule jointly are the basic republican institutions so cherished by romans and which emperors would claim to restore did lucilla really plot against her brother yes commodus really did have a sister lucilla and she hated her brother lucilla was at one time married to lucius verus as her son tells maximus in the film what is not said is that verus was coemperor with marcus aurelius lucilla conspired against commodus and attempted to have him assassinated in 182 ce commodus banished lucilla to the island of capreae as punishment and ordered her execution shortly after so unlike the film portrayal commodus actually outlived lucilla incidentally it was his other sisters not lucilla that he reputedly had sexual relations with did women really fight in the arena yes some criticism by film reviewers has been levied towards scott for having a female gladiator however the ancient sources are clear they did in fact exist tacitus for instance wrote that nero staged a number of gladiatorial shows equal in magnificence to their predecessors though more women of rank and senators disgraced themselves in the arena petronius in the satyricon wrote of female charioteers dio cassius explained how some women performed as venatores that is gladiators who fought wild beasts the emperor domitian staged games in which women battled pygmies women were forbidden from gladiatorial performances shortly after the time of commodus by the emperor alexander severus in 200 ce whats with the tattoo worn by maximus s p q r the letters of the tattoo worn by maximus was an abbreviation for an oft used latin phrase whose english translation is the senate and people of rome the latin word for tattoo was stigma and our modern meaning of stigmatize as a pejorative has clearly evolved from the latin it was slaves gladiators criminals and later soldiers who were tattooed as an identifying mark upper class romans did not partake in tattooing which they associated with either marginal groups or foreigners such as thracians who were known to tattoo extensively the emperor caligula is said to have forced individuals of rank to become tattooed as an embarrassment in late antiquity the roman army consisted largely of mercenaries they were tattooed in order that deserters could be identified the sixth century roman physician aetius wrote thatstigmates are the marks which are made on the face and other parts of the body we see such marks on the hands of soldiers to perform the operation they use ink made according to this formula egyptian pine wood acacia and especially the bark one pound corroded bronze two ounces gall two ounces vitriol one ounce mix well and sift first wash the place to be tattooed with leek juice and then prick in the design with pointed needles until blood is drawn then rub in the ink the christian emperor constantine ca 325 ad decreed that individuals condemned to fight as gladiators or to work in the mines could be tattooed on the legs or the hands but not on the face because the face which has been formed in the image of the divine beauty should be defiled as little as possible in 787 pope hadrian the first prohibited tattooing altogether due to its association with superstition paganism and the marginal classes visit timeline ancient romeambers curiosity genuine ancient artifacts real roman coins and lots of other
