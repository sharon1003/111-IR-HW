types of tissues epithelial connective muscle and neural epithelial tissue covers exposed surfaces lines internal passageways and chambers and forms glands connective tissue fills internal spaces provides structural support for the other tissues transports materials within the body and stores energy preserves muscle tissue specialized for contraction neural tissue carries information from one part of the body to another in the form of electrical impulses epithelia layers of cells that cover internal and external surfaces glands structures that produce fluid secretions they are either attached to or derived from epithelia epithelia characteristics cellularity polarity attachment avascular and regenerative epithelial tissue functions provide physical protection control permeability provide sensation and provide specialized secretions cell adhesion molecules transmembrane proteins that interconnect large areas of opposing cell membranes intercellular cement a thin layer of proteoglycans that contain polysaccharide derivatives know as glycosaminoglycans hyaluronan most notable intercellular cement cell junctions specialized areas of the cell membrane that attach a cell to another cell or to extracellular materials three types of cell junctions tight junction gap junction and desmosome hemi and buttonlumen the epithelium that lines tubes such as intestinal tract the apical surfaces of cells that line the space inside the tube a passagewaylamina lucida closest to epithelium and contains glycoproteins and a network of fine protein filamentslamina densa closest to connective tissue attached by hemidesmosomesgerminative cells stem cellssimple squamous epithelium reduces friction controls vessel permeability performs absorption and secretion  alveoli of lungs kidney tubules endothelia lining of heart and blood vesselsstratified squamous epithelium provides physical protection against abrasion pathogens and chemical attack  skin mouth throat esophagus rectum anus and vaginasimple cuboidal epithelium limited protection secretion absorption  glands ducts kidney tubules thyroid glandstratified cuboidal epithelium protection secretion absorption  lining of some ducts raretransistional epithelium permits expansion and recoil after stretching  urinary bladder renal penis ureterssimple columnar epithelium protection secretion absorption  lining of stomach intestine gallbladder uterine tubes and collecting ducts of kidneyspseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium protection secretion  lining of nasal cavity trachea and bronchi portions of male reproductive tractstratified columnar epithelium protection  small areas of the pharynx epiglottis anus mammary glands salivary gland ducts and urethraexocrine gland produce secretions which are discharged onto an epithelial surface by ductsendocrine gland produce secretions that are released directly into the surrounding interstital fluid by ducts3 modes of secretions merocrine apocrine holocrine merocrine secretion released by exocytosis most common secretion mucus and salivary glands apocrine secretion involves the loss of cytoplasm as well as the secretory product milk production breaks away holocrine destroys gland cell entire cell becomes packed with the secretory product and then bursts sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles3 types of secretions serous mucous mixed exocrine glands serous glands secrete a watery solution that contains enzymes parotid salivary glands mucous glands secrete mucins that hydrate to form mucus sublingual salivary glands and submucosal glands of small intestines connective tissue some cells and mostly matrix three classifications of connective tissue connective tissue proper fluid connective tissue and supporting connective tissue calcified matrix of bone connective tissue proper made up of loose and dense connective tissue which includes adipose and tendons fluid connective tissue distinctive populations of cells suspended in a watery matrix that contains dissolved proteins includes blood and lymph supporting connective tissues has less diverse cell population and a matrix containing much more densely packed fibers protect soft tissues and support weight of part or all of the body cartlidge and bone cartilage has matrix of firm gel whose characteristics vary with the predominant type of fiber fibroblasts most abundant permanent residents of connective tissue proper only cells that are always present secrete hyaluronanmacrophages large amoeboid cells scattered throughout the matrix engulf pathogens andor damaged cells that enter tissues free can migrate and fixed spend long periods in tissue brainmicroglial and liverkuppfer frontline defense adipocytes adipose cells contain a single enormous lipid droplet the nucleus other organelles and cytoplasm are squeezed to one side mesenchymal cells stem cells that are present in connective tissue respond to local injury or infection by dividing differentiate into fibroblasts macrophages or other connective tissue cells melanocytes synthesize and store the brown pigment melanin also abundant in connective tissue of the eye and the dermis of the skin differs among individuals mast cells small mobile connective tissue cells that are common near blood vessels cytoplasm of mast cell is filled with histamine allergic reaction and heparin anticoagulantblood thinnerlymphocytes migrate throughout body traveling through connective and other tissues increase in areas of damage some may develop into plasma cells that produce antibodies streptococcus pyogenes flesh eating bacteria staphylococcus aureus staph infection plasma cells antibodies factory areolar tissue blood vessels nerves lymphatics in loose connective tissue ties epithelium to rest of tissues ground substance most of its volume and absorbs shock adipose tissue heat loss reducer cushion and padding has fibroblasts and blood vessels reticular tissue has seperate layers provides supporting framework in liver spleen lymph nodes and bone marrow dense connective tissues more fibers than ground substance more matrix than cells collagenous tissues because made up mostly of collagen collagen fibers long straight and unbranched most common fibers in connective tissue proper flexible tendons and ligaments reticular fibers branching interwoven framework that is tough yet flexible stabilize the positions of an organs blood vessels nerves and other structures parenchyma elastic fibers contain protein elastin branched and wavy elastic ligaments are dominated by elastic fibers rare but have important functions such as interconnecting vertebrae between vertebrae in spinal column and penis loose connective tissue packing materials of the body fill spaces between organs cushion and stabilize specialized cells in many cells support epitheliaaponeurosis a tendinous sheet that attaches a broad flat muscle to another muscle or to several bones of the skeletondense irregular connective tissue interwoven meshwork in no consistent pattern forms thick fibrous layer called capsule provides strength to resist forces applied from many directions helps prevent overexpansion of organs such as the urinary bladderdense regular connective tissue parallel collagen fibers provides firm attachment conducts pull of muscles reduces friction between muscles stabilizes relative positions of bones plasma watery mixture in the blood liquid of blood erythrocyte red blood cell accounts for almost half of the volume of blood responsible for transport of oxygen leukocytes white blood cellsplatelets fragments of cells in blood that help clot blood cytoplasm break apart to create lymphocytes become plasma cells monocytes stem cell for macrophages basophil contains histamines eosinophil associated with inflammation supporting connective tissue cartilage or bones chrondroitin sulfates polysaccharide derivatives in firm gel matrix of cartilage chrondrocytes cartlidge cells only cells in cartilage matrix lacunae small chambers that chrondrocytes occupy in cartilage and osteocytes in bone antiangiogenesis factor chemical produced by chrondrocytes that prohibits blood vessel growth3 types of cartilage hyaline elastic and fibrocartilage hyaline cartilage provides stiff but somewhat flexible support reduces friction between bony surfaces located between tips of ribs and bones of sternum forming part of nasal septum elastic cartilage provides support but tolerates distortion without damage and returns to normal shape auricle of external ear epiglottis auditory canal fibrocartilage resists compression prevents bonetobone contact limits relative movement pads within knee joints between pubic bones of pelvis intervertebral discs osseous tissue bone osteocytes bone cells canaliculi long slender passageways that form a branching network for the exchange of materials between blood vessels and osteocytes periosteum a layer composed of fibrous outer and cellular inner layer that cover bone surfaces mucous membranes also called mucosae line passageways and chambers that communicate with the exterior including those in the digestive respiratory reproductive and urinary tracts simple and stratified squamous or transistional epithelial depending on location lamina propria the areolar tissue component of a mucous membrane4 types of membrane mucous serous cutaneous synovial serous membranes line the sealed internal subdivisions of the ventral body cavity cavities that are not open to the exterior consists of mesothelium supported by areolar tissue3 types of serous membranes pleura peritoneum pericardium pleura lines the pleural cavities and cover the lungs peritoneum lines the peritoneal cavity and covers the surfaces of the enclosed organs pericardium lines the pericardial cavity and covers the heart parietal portion of serous membrane lines the surface of a cavity visceral portion of serous membrane serosa covers the outer surfaces of visceral organs cutaneous membrane skin covers the surface of the body consists of statified epithelium and a layer of areolar tissue reinforced by underlying dense irregular connective tissue synovial membrane lines joint cavities of articulations differences in synovial membrane and true epithelium synovial develops within a connective tissue no basal lamina gaps of up to 1mm may separate adjacent cells fluid and solutes are continuously exchanged between the synovial fluid and capillaries in the underlying connective tissue fasciae connective tissues layers and wrappings that support and surround organs3 types of fasciae layers superficial fascia deep fascia and subserous fascia superficial fascia subcutaneous layer or hypodermis layer of areolar tissue and fat that separates the skin from underlying tissues and organs provides insulation and padding lets skin and underlying structures move independently deep fascia a dense irregular connective tissue the arrangement of fibers help the tissue resist forces applied from many directions subserous fascia a layer of areolar tissue that lies between the deep fascia and the serous membranes that line body cavities therefore movements of muscles and muscular organs do not severely distort the delicate lining3 types of muscle tissue skeletal cardiac and smooth skeletal muscle tissue multinucleate striated voluntary muscle produces new fibers by the division of satellite muscle cardiac muscle tissue striated involuntary muscle relies on pacemaker cells for regular contractions also has cardiocytes cardiocytes cells of cardiac muscle tissues smooth muscle tissue nonstriated involuntary muscle cells can divide and regenerate after injury has occurred neural tissue conducts electrical impulses which convey information from one area of the body to another cells are neurons or neuroglia several kinds of neuroglia exist neuroglia basic functions include supporting neural tissue and helping supply nutrients to neurons neuron has a cell body dendrites and an axon or nerve fiber axon carries information to other cells inflammation isolates the injured area while damaged cells tissue components and any dangerous microorganisms are cleaned up regeneration the repair process that restores normal function
