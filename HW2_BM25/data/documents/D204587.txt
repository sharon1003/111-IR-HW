undisputed colour rendering of the dannebrog at about the same time valdemar iv of denmark displays a cross in his coat of arms on his danælog seal  rettertingsseglet dated 1356 the image from the

the kings of denmark in the 14th century begin displaying the cross banner in their coats of arms is unknown caspar paludanmüller 1873 suggested that it may reflect a banner sent by the pope to the danish king in support of the baltic countries 8 adolf ditlev jørgensen 1875 identifies the banner as that of the knights hospitaller which order had a presence in denmark from the later 12th century

knieper ’s heroic tapestries of danish kings from 1585 king erik menved storming a castle note the two danish flags original located at kronborg castle there is a record suggesting that the danish army had a chief banner  hoffuitbanner in the early 16th century such a banner is mentioned in 1570 by niels hemmingsøn in the context of a 1520 battle between danes and swedes near uppsala as nearly captured by the swedes but saved by the heroic actions of the bannercarrier mogens gyldenstierne and peder skram the legend attributing the miraculous origin of the flag to the campaigns of valdemar ii of denmark r 1202–1241 were recorded by christiern pedersen and petrus olai in the 1520s hans svaning s history of king hans from 1558–1559 and johan rantzau s history about the last dithmarschen war from 1569 record the further fate of the danish hoffuitbanner according to this tradition the original flag from the battle of lyndanisse was used in the small campaign of 1500 when king hans tried to conquer dithmarschen in western holstein in north germany  the flag was lost in a devastating defeat at the battle of hemmingstedt on 17 february 1500 in 1559 king frederik ii recaptured it during his own dithmarschen campaign in 1576 the son of johan rantzau henrik rantzau also writes about the war and the fate of the flag he notes that the flag was in a poor condition when returned contemporary records describing the battle of hemmingstedt make no reference to the loss of the original dannebrog although the capitulation state that all danish banners lost in 1500 were to be returned in a letter dated 22 february 1500 to oluf stigsøn king john describes the battle but does not mention the loss of an important flag in fact the entire letter gives the impression that the lost battle was of limited importance in 1598 neocorus wrote that the banner captured in 1500 was brought to the church in wöhrden and hung there for the next 59 years until it was returned to the danes as part of the peace settlement in 1559 henrik rantzau in 1576 records that the flag after its return to denmark was placed in the cathedral in slesvig slesvig historian ulrik petersen 1656–1735 confirms the presence of such a banner in the cathedral in the early 17th century and records that it had crumbled away by about 1660 maritime flags  editthe size and shape of the civil ensign  koffardiflaget  for merchant ships is given in the regulation of june 11 1748 which says a red flag with a white cross with no split end the white cross must be 1⁄ 7 of the flags height the two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be 6⁄ 4lengths of those the proportions are thus 313 vertically and 3145 horizontally this definition are the absolute proportions for the danish national flag to this day for both the civil version of the flag  stutflaget  as well as the merchant flag  handelsflaget  both flags are identical a regulation passed in 1758 required danish ships sailing in the mediterranean to carry the royal cypher in the center of the flag in order to distinguish them from maltese ships due to the similarity of the flag of the sovereign military order of malta according to the regulation of june 11 1748 the colour was simply red which is common known today as dannebrog rød  dannebrog red  the only available red fabric dye in 1748 was made of madder root which can be processed to produce a brilliant red dye used historically for british soldiers jackets a regulation of may 4 1927 once again states that danish merchant ships have to fly flags according to the regulation of 1748 the first regulation regarding the splitflag dates from march 27 1630 in which king christian iv orders that norwegian defensionskibe armed merchants ships may only use the splitflag if they are in danish war service in 1685 an order distributed to a number of cities in slesvig states that all ships must carry the danish flag and in 1690 all merchant ships are forbidden to use the splitflag with the exception of ships sailing in the east indies west indies and along the coast of africa in 1741 it is confirmed that the regulation of 1690 is still very much in effect that merchant ships may not use the splitflag at the same time the danish east india company is allowed to fly the splitflag when past the equator it is obvious that some confusion must have existed regarding the splitflag in 1696 the admiralty presented the king with a proposal for a standard regulating both size and shape of the splitflag in the same year a royal resolution defines the proportions of the splitflag which in this resolution is called kongeflaget the kings flag as follows the cross must be 1⁄ 7 of the flags height the two first fields must be square in form with the sides three times the cross width the two outer fields are rectangular and 1 1⁄ 2the length of the square fields the tails are the length of the flag these numbers are the basic for the splitflag or orlogsflag today though the numbers have been slightly altered the term orlogsflag dates from 1806 and denotes use in the danish navy from about 1750 to early 19th century a number of ships and companies which the government has interests in received approval to use the splitflag in the royal resolution of october 25 1939 for the danish navy it is stated that the orlogsflag is a splitflag with a deep red  dybrød  or madder red  kraprød  colour like the national flag no nuance is given but in modern days this is given as 195u furthermore the size and shape is corrected in this resolution to be the cross must be 1⁄ 7 of the flags height the two first fields must be square in form with the height of 3⁄ 7 of the flags height the two outer fields are rectangular and 5⁄ 4 the length of the square fields the tails are 6⁄ 4 the length of the rectangular fields thus if compared to the standard of 1696 both the rectangular fields and the tails have decreased in size national flag  editdanish soldiers return to copenhagen after the battle of fredericia 1849 a danish victory against schleswig in the first schleswig war 1894 painting by otto bacheused as maritime flag since the 16th century the dannebrog was introduced as regimental flag in the danish army in 1785 and for the militia landeværn in 1801 from 1842 it was used as the flag of the entire army 10in parallel to the development of romantic nationalism in other european countries the military flag increasingly came to be seen as representing the nation itself during the first half of the 19th century poems of this period invoking the dannebrog were written by b s ingemann n f s grundtvig oehlenschläger chr winther and h c andersen 10 by the 1830s the military flag had become so popular as unofficial national flag and its use by private citizens was outlawed in a circular enacted on 7 january 1834 in the national enthusiasm sparked by the first schleswig war during 1848–1850 the flag was still very widely displayed and the prohibition of private use was again repealed in a regulation of 7 july 1854 for the first time allowing danish citizens to display the dannebrog but not the swallowtailed splitflag variant 11 special permission to use the splitflag was given to individual institutions and private companies especially after 1870  citation needed on 10 april 1915 the hoisting of any other flag on danish soil was prohibited 12 in 1886 the war ministry introduced a regulation indicating that the flag should be flown from military buildings on thirteen specified days including royal birthdays the date of the signing of the constitution of 5 june 1849 and on days of remembrance for military battles in 1913 the naval ministry issued its own list of flag days from 1939 the yearbook hvemhvadhvor included a list of flag days origin legend  editdannebrog falling from the sky during the battle of lyndanisse june 15 1219 painted by christian august lorentzen in 1809 original located at statens museum for kunst denmark a tradition recorded in the 16th century traces the origin of the flag to the campaigns of valdemar ii of denmark r 1202–1241 the oldest of them is in christiern pedersen s  danske krønike  which is a sequel to saxo ’s gesta danorum written 1520–23 here the flag falls from the sky during a russian campaign of valdemars pedersen also states that the very same flag was taken into exile by eric of pomerania in 1440 the second source is the writing of the franciscan monk petrus olai peder olsen of roskilde died c 1570 this record describes a battle in 1208 near a place called  felin  during the estonia campaign of king valdemar ii the danes were all but defeated when a lambskin banner depicting a white cross falls from the sky and miraculously leads to a danish victory in a third account also by petrus olai  dubious – discuss in danmarks tolv herligheder twelve splendours of denmark in splendour number nine the same story is retold almost verbatim with a paragraph inserted correcting the year to 1219  citation needed now the flag is falling from the sky in the battle of lyndanisse also known as the battle of valdemar danish volmerslaget  near lyndanisse tallinn in estonia of june 15 1219 it is this third account that has been the most influential and some historians  who have treated it as the primary account taken from a lost source dating to the first half of the 15th century in olais account the battle was going badly and defeat seemed imminent however the danish bishop anders sunesen on top of a hill overlooking the battle prayed to god with his arms raised which meant that the danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed when he raised his arms the danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall the estonians turned the danes back attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the danes surged forward again at a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat he needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the danes were about to lose dannebrog miraculously fell from the sky and the king took it showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the danes won the battle the possible historical nucleus behind this origin legend was extensively discussed by danish historians in the 19th to 20th centuries jørgensen 1875 argues that bishop theoderich was the original instigator of the 1218 inquiry from bishop albert of buxhoeveden to king valdemar ii which led to the danish participation in the baltic crusades jørgensen speculates that bishop theoderich might have carried the knight hospitallers banner in the 1219 battle and that the enemy thought this was the kings symbol and mistakenly stormed bishop theoderich tent he claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle 9 the danish churchhistorian l p fabricius 1934 13 ascribes the origin to the 1208 battle of fellin not the battle of lyndanisse in 1219 based on the earliest source available about the story fabricius speculated that it might have been archbishop andreas sunesøn s personal ecclesiastical banner or perhaps even the flag of archbishop absalon under whose initiative and supervision several smaller crusades had already been conducted in estonia the banner would then already be known in estonia fabricius repeats jørgensens idea about the flag being planted in front of bishop theodoriks tent which the enemy mistakenly attacks believing it to be the tent of the king a different theory is briefly discussed by fabricius and elaborated more by helge bruhn 1949 bruhn interprets the story in the context of the widespread tradition of the miraculous appearance of crosses in the sky in christian legend specifically comparing such an event attributed to a battle of 10 september 1217 near alcazar where it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky to bring victory to the christians 14in swedish national historiography of the 18th century there is a tale paralleling the danish legend in which a golden cross appears in the blue sky during a swedish battle in finland in 1157  citation neededvariants  editthe danish flag at the medal ceremony for the mens team pursuit at the 2008 summer
