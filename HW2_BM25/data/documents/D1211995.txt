via american special opscomphotosever since the osama bin laden raid america has gone bonkers for u s navy seals and military special operators in general skip to the units the special operations command or socom is scheduled for spending and personnel increases while the rest of the military looks to be making cuts end strength goals indicate that americas entire crop of military operators will top off at 70000 in fact the number of operators has doubled since 911 and their budget tripled — from 35 billion to 105 billion the trend will likely continue as the u s is in the middle of a shift to smaller footprint type operations putting 100 thousand troops and countless private support personnel on the ground in any given country — sometimes referred to as nation building — is a costly strategy putting a boot or two on osama bin ladens door arguably cost more in political currency — pakistan wasnt too happy — than actual currency though it was the seals who performed that raid in abbottabad its worth noting there are quite a few more spec ops units in the u s than just seals — green berets and marine snipers etc — so we here at business insider have made things easy by assembling a comprehensive list of all the spec ops units we could find with help from the extensive descriptions on american special opscom  view as one page slides division marine reconvia american special opscomphotosmarine reconnaissance teams provide intelligence for active small unit operations on the battlefield those with marine sniper quals can also provide accurate demoralizing small arms fire from a distance marine recon is arguably in the top five of all special operators — capable of harassing an entire enemy battalion for long periods of time tracking enemy units for larger american forces or conducting wellorchestrated raids on highvalued targets these guys are the gems in the crown of the united states marine corps air force special operations weathermanvia american special opscomphotosno its not a joke they can literally forecast the weather above a fight kill the enemy and direct artillery — simultaneously the official mission of the u s air force field weatherman is as a groundlevel smallunit meteorologist who provides accurate forecasts for the purpose of air asset deployment bombs and stuff usmc air naval gunfire liaison company — anglicovia american special opscomphotosthe air naval gunfire liaison company is another group that often finds itself in the shadow of sexier special operations units like the seals a single anglico marine can coordinate a hellish rain of fiery artillery and airstrafing fire on the enemy though whereas all a seal can do is pull a trigger typically they dont deploy as individuals but like any spec ops group in teams of four or five a typical anglico team team leader captain or navy lieutenant any ground mos  typically jtac joint terminal attack controllerqualified artillery officer team chief sergeant typically qualified as jfo joint fires observer and as a jtac radio chief corporal or sergeant junior radio operator private first class  lance corporal fire support man  scout observer private first class  lance corporal usmc amphibious recon platoonsvia american special opscomphotosamphibious recon platoons draw their personnel from battalion recon units and typically support direct action force reconnaissance operations as well as naval fleet operations they hold all the same certs generally speaking of recon marines because they are recon marines the only difference are their tasks to determine characteristics of beaches available for landing and report the information to the commander at sea by hydrographic reconnaissance of water near the shore line by examining terrain in immediate vicinity of beach by noting beach defenses such as wire mines and other obstacles troops in immediate vicinity other defenses air force combat controllersvia american special opscom combat controllers are among the most elite in the military top 10 easy these guys are independent operators like marine recon except with more air assets they are experts at stealth insertion well behind enemy lines and are often just a disembodied voice for other ground troops like seals as they provide air support coordination theyre often on the ground picking targets in americas bombing campaigns

combined applications group is their old name some call them delta but that was never an official name either these guys are the absolute tip of the spear — matt bissonnette one of the seals on the bin laden raid mentioned them in his book no easy day as if they were gods they are also the only group of special operators outside of seal team 6 st6 where direct close contact with the enemy is a guarantee upon acceptance regardless of whether america is officially at war or not they recruit from the nations highest special operations units only twice a year to include st6 these are just a couple initial tests they have to pass a timed 18mile ruckmarch at night in which the candidate must carry 35 pounds in their rucksack a timed 40 mile route while carrying a 45 pound ruck sack over rough steep terrain then they have a rigorous battery of psychological tests if after those tests theyre found to qualify they attend a sixmonth training course if they pass the course they cease to exist its said they work handinhand with the nations highest paramilitary and intelligence agencies us navy sealsvia american special opscomphotosseal stands for sea air and land special operators thus the word seals there are eight teams of navy seals 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 and 10 despite having a number seal team 6 is not counted in the numbered teams theyre commonly called rainbow because they break personnel down into subsections under four colors — red blue gold and silver with a special gray squadron the boat squad prospective navy seals attend a course called basic underwater demolitionseal or buds total seal training consists of preparation school 4  12 weeks at the naval special warfare preparatory school indoctrination test 3 weeks of physical tests buds 25 weeks week 3 hell week 135 hours of continuous physical demand post grad 28 weeks at seal qualification course which includes all specialized training courses to produce combat ready navy seal the final test killing the enemy and coming home seal team six — rainbowvia american special opscomphotosat navy seal balls ive heard its common to hear seals ask each other are you a number or a color the colors are or possibly used to be red blue gold and silver theyre a firm number 2 under army cag seal team 6 the colored seals are those who do off the grid or black operations directly under joint special operations command and so by a short chain the president under the designation naval special operations development group or devgru these seals have three primary missions counter terrorism since 2001 seal team six has been focused on operations in and around afghanistan the unit is also able to carry out preemptive ct operations close protection devgru sometimes provide security for vips for instance devgru provided afghanistan president hamid karzai with close protection in the early days of his presidency special reconnaissance devgru operators especially those trained as snipers are experts at reconnaissance surveillance and intelligence gathering operation fleet antiterrorism security teams — fastvia american special opscomphotosfast teams get a bum rap from a lot of other special operations units in large part for them being comprised of regular straightleg infantry grunts in other words nonetheless they perform a special set of tasks their most common mission is to deploy and reinforce american diplomatic missions and embassies the marines within fleet antiterrorism security teams are skilled in counter surveillance physical security urban combat techniques close quarter combat cqb martial arts force reconnaissance marinesvia american special opscomphotosmarine corps force reconnaissance otherwise known as force recon are a companysized about 200 recon and directaction element that falls directly under the marine expeditionary force commander or the naval strike group commander depending on whether theyre aboard a ship or on land because of their direct line to a commander force recon often finds itself in the position of performing lets say highly sensitive special operations — making recon a bit of a misnomer the sheer amount of training and the scope of their operations put them in a close heat with numbered seals for the numberthree rank as top operators there are a number of courses they attend some of which are marine corps combatant diver course — navy diving salvage and training center naval support activity panama city florida survival evasion resistance and escape school — navy remote training sites nas north island ca or nas brunswick me army airborne

special operations command — marsocvia american special opscomphotosthough marsoc marines tend to be former recon or infantry any marine with the guts to give it a shot and the muscle to match can end up as an operator for special operations command socom the unit marsoc falls beneath they also remain somewhat of a sore spot among marines — common among complaints are that anyone can try out they dont fall under traditional marine command structures they think theyre special etc the indoctrination for marsoc is quite rigorous assessment and selection preparation and orientation course — a 21day course that is basically just practice for the real initial test assessment and selection — a 19day course which weeds out anyone unable to complete the grueling 7month training evolution to become marsoc upon graduation students will attend a course broken down into four phases phase 1 — communications and combat medicine — the culmination of this phase is completion of the survival evade resist escape school phase 2 — amphibious operations tactics weapons and special reconnaissance phase 3 — urban operations marksmanship close quarters battle and urban combat phase 4 — eight weeks of irregular warfare training followed by the culminating exercise the maritime raid force — mrfvia american special opscomphotospiracy is such a problem the navy decided to take the best of its personnel throw them in highspeed boats and set them on some pirates the maritime raid force is basically a bunch of really good really aggressive triggerpullers who fearlessly hit pirates hard right in the mouth its essentially the navys all star team for countering pirates — a hodgepodge of navy and marine personnel seals marine snipers and recon who often draw off knowledge from the amphibious reconnaissance platoon to conduct counterpiracy and interdiction operations though they dont conduct a wide array of special operations their targeted and highly trained nature earns them a spot on the bi list the different occupational specialties in the mrf are assault element navy seals or recon marines  security element infantry marines snipers support element radio intel forward air controllers etc aviation close air support marine personnel typically supersede naval pilots in this task coast guard maritime safety and security teams — msstvia american special opscomphotosyes the coast guard has special operations these operators fall under the deployable operations group and attend training in advanced tactical boat operations and antiterrorism force protection at the joint maritime training center at camp lejeune north carolina camp lejeune is also home to most east coast marines though not super high on the special list theyre elite nature means they have to be

opscomphotospararescue jumpers insert well behind enemy lines in order to rescue lost personnel typically pilots just a tick less cool than their combat controller brethren simply because their main mission is to rescue not to attack — they fall just outside the top 5 nonetheless they have to be ready to fight off hundreds of enemy fighters by means of clever guerrilla warfare traps and specialized small unit tactics certainly they cant expect a prima donna pilot to adequately defend himself so theyre well trained and super aggressive pararescuemen training covers parachute training

opscomphotosrangers are the armys elite light infantry shocktroops — airborne qualified and tough as nails they can either support higher units — like army delta — or conduct raids on the enemy themselves assuming a recruit enters the army with a contract to be a ranger itll take about a year of training to go from civilian to basically trained army ranger as the armys shock troops they do conduct special operations but oftentimes those ops fall in line with what regular marine infantry does — in this way they are elite but certainly not close to the top dogs courses and qualifications

naval bases particularly those in possession of nuclear technology aside from attending marine designated marksman and close quarters battle training these marines also attend naval demolition breaching courses not unlike navy seals all put together their main job is to assault a wellfortified room and take back u s property — not a wide range of special operations but still specialized there are 3 elements to a recapture tactics team squad breachers skilled in various methods of entry including using explosives shooters trained in close quarters battle cqbdesignated marksmen sharpshooters typically armed with m14 designated marksmen rifles with high powered scopes and silencers special activities division — central intelligence agencyvia american special opscomphotosthe special activities division in the cia is comprised of only a few hundred people for good reason — their main mission is complete deniable operations if rainbow six is black operations then sad is the shadow cast by those operations the agency can and does recruit from within for these positions sending agents through the actual military pipeline to get organically trained agents they also hire former seals green berets and marine recon they break down into three branches ground branch sad ground branch operatives are experts in field craft surveillance small arms hostage rescue cqb and advanced driving many former army special forces soldiers and delta force operators find their way into ground branch maritime branch as the name suggests sad maritime branchs focus is on amphibious operations and as such tends to recruit ex seals and force recon marines as its operators air branch sads aviation wing marine scout snipersvia american special opscomphotosscout snipers are subject matter experts on identification of high valued targets visual reconnaissance and ingress and egress without detection from enemy occupied territory oh yeah and they can shoot hair off a ticks behind from a kilometer away theyre not super elite in that the military will use them for raids but their expertise at recon and shooting highvalued targets in the face puts them squarely into the realm of special operations their 85 week initial training consists of marksmanship and field craft running running more running students also learn how to sketch terrain read targets through a spotter scope and hit targets at known distances stalking students learn how to enter a contested area unnoticed scout that area and exit unnoticed — meanwhile trained hardened sniper instructors scan the area with high powered binoculars looking for the students unknown distance range students fire at targets upward of a kilometer away without being told exactly what the distance or elevation is the marines must accurately range and hit their own targets navy special warfare combatcraft crewmen — swccvia american special opscom when the seals are in a bind they call swcc combat crewman provide highly

seals and force recon depending on whos doing the talking notably green berets have some of the toughest initial training in the entire military at the risk of drawing the ire of seals and marine
