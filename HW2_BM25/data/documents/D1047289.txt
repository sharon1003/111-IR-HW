dr gunter blobel nobel prize winner for physiologymedicine a chat revealing discoveries about the cell and how they can help cure disease january 18 2000 web posted at 5 pm edt cnn  dr gunter blobel who won the nobel prize for medicine for pioneering research on the inner workings of the cell joined cnncom on tuesday december 21 1999 dr blobel discussed his discoveries which have shed new light on diseases such as cystic fibrosis and laid the foundation for bioengineering drugs such as insulin and growth hormones dr blobel heads the laboratory of cell biology at rockefeller university he joined the chat from his laboratory in new york cnncom provided a typist and the following is an edited transcript of the chat chat moderator welcome dr gunter blobelgunter blobel im very pleased to be with you chat moderator please tell us about your work that won a nobel prize gunter blobel we all consist of cells which contain about a billion molecules of proteins and proteins are building blocks called amino acids a protein may consist of 100 amino acids or a thousand amino acids or even more depending upon the sequence of the amino acids the protein has a distinct function in the cell so proteins are constantly being degraded some proteins only live for 10 or 20 minutes some of them live for months these proteins in order to function properly have to be sent to various addresses in the cell its very much like a letter with a message and you have to send it to the right person because that person will then understand the message if you send it to the wrong address it will reach a person who will not understand the message a protein therefore has to be sent to the proper address in the cell to function properly each protein has a builtin zip code that consists of anywhere from 5 to 40 amino acids of a distinct sequence or arranged in distinct sequences these sequences make up the zip code now if you put a zip code on a letter the letter doesnt go anywhere alone it needs the postal service to send the letter to the right address we have also identified the postal service the machines that read the zip codes they are very complicated they not only read the zip codes but they are able to target the protein to the proper compartment or address in the cell after addressing it to a compartment the protein has to cross a membrane it does so by using its zip code which opens a specific channel in the membrane to let the protein across once the protein is across the membrane in the compartment it may have to undergo further traffic and it has additional zip codes to get it to compartments downstream so if you send a letter for example to chicago it arrives in chicago it has to be sent to a specific location in chicago this system is also used to stitch the protein like a thread into a piece of cloth into the socalled bilayer of molecules of the membrane question from bilbo under what circumstances would the body send a protein to the wrong address gunter blobel well if the zip code is mutated then it cannot be sent to the right address lets suppose the zip code for chicago is 12345 and instead of having 12345 you have 12245 it will not go to chicago so instead of numbers put in amino acids there are 20 distinct amino acids question from pace have scientists really been able to recreate amino acids in a lab using electricity and water wouldnt this give much more credit to evolutionist theories gunter blobel amino acids have been created long ago in a test tube by using physical methods but this is really a question that addresses evolution rather than the work that we have done question from bilbo so what happens to the extra proteins if they dont make it do they hang out in limbo until they die gunter blobel yes very often they are degraded when they dont reach their correct address if this is a protein that is absolutely essential the cell will get sick and as a result the person will get sick chat moderator how does this discovery help people gunter blobel there are two immediate applications one is in industry many proteins are used as medicines for instance insulin is a protein so is growth hormone and many other growth factors are proteins previously these proteins were made from animals and isolated from tissues in slaughterhouses now you can make these proteins in bacteria using recombinant dna and you can equip the protein with a zip code so that the protein is transported out of bacteria that facilitates its purification very much so that now and in the future essentially all proteins that are medically important for therapy will be produced using these methods for example last year alone a protein called arythropoetin which stimulates the production of red blood cells was being sold at the rate of 2 billion annually so youre talking about a very large industry already these are the commercial applications the other important aspect is that we now learn that some diseases have a faulty protein traffic pattern at their basis it is only now that people are beginning to look at that a bit more carefully an example is cystic fibrosis here a protein that has to go to the plasma membrane the membrane that surrounds the cell does not go there instead it remains in an intracellular membrane called the endoplasmic reticulum this is one very important example of how a protein refuses to go to the right address in the cell because of a mutation in its sequence there are many other examples which would take a long time to list here this sort of research is only beginning question from whistler what carries the protein to its predetermined cell location gunter blobel in most cases its by guided diffusion and as i mentioned before channels are opened by the zip code to let the protein across specific cellular membranes sometimes in many cases there are containers involved in the transport the protein is packaged into a container and then the container is shipped on tracks over fairly large distances using motors this is particularly important in the nervous system where you have cells which can be one meter long and have one meter long processes which are very thin which you can only see in the microscope the processes of many of these nerve cells which go from the spinal cord lets suppose into your toes or your foot are bundled together this is why they are one meter long chat moderator what was it like to win the nobel prize gunter blobel as you know its a very great honor the nobel prize is the highest award you can win its a very great honor it also brings new obligations for me i like to explain science and i like to teach therefore chats like these are very important to me because it is only when scientists explain to the public what they are doing that the public can be expected to support further research question from sparky what are your plans vis a vis your prize money gunter blobel well i will donate the prize money all of it i will not keep a single cent to the city of dresden in germany which was destroyed in wwii in particular it is for two buildings one is a church which is of great artistic value it is perhaps the most important church north of the alps that church is being rebuilt its called frauenkirche the other part of the money is going to the rebuilding of the synagogue also in dresden chat moderator why have you chosen this town gunter blobel well i grew up near dresden and i got my education there then when i was 18 i left and i have never returned anything to this community so im very proud that i can do it now but another important thing is that i saw dresden when i was eight years old before it was destroyed i saw it a few days before it was bombed it was one of the most beautiful cities that i have ever seen so that even though i was only eight years old i have pretty good memories i founded an organization in the united states which is a charity organization called friends of dresden donations to friends of dresden are tax deductible even before i won the nobel prize we were able to raise 15 million for the reconstruction of the church we need 10 million to make what is called the american wing of the church the reconstruction of the synagogue will cost about 5 million the reconstruction of the frauenkirche will cost 200 million question from nobellium for young people what would you do to encourage them to study the sciences biology and chemistry do you have any suggestions gunter blobel its very exciting now to be in biology it is also very exciting to be in chemistry physics or mathematics these sciences will play an increasingly important role in our society there is a revolution going on particularly in biology and so all i can tell my young friends is to study and to study and to study chat moderator thank you dr blobel for joining us today gunter blobel it as a great pleasure participating in this chat room and i wish all of you the best of luck cnn chat
