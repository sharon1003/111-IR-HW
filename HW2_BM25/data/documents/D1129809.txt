thankfully only got a warning my assumption is that if i were to get pulled over again it would be automatically a ticket once the officer sees i have been issued a warning once no matter what his intent when he pulled me over or how slight my infraction anyone know how long that warning will be active will it ever drop out of the system or has it been added to the dreadedpermanent record rainy

10080most police departments have an internal computer system this is used to record contacts of people with that particular department while in most places it is considered an open public record the only way to see such info is to go inside the station and request to see it this means that if you get stopped  warned and they put it on their computer only officers from that particular department are going to be advised of the previous warning if youre stopped again other departments wont have such info because it wasnt them that stopped  warned you info on warnings usually are not shared because its a petty contact also it wont show up on your driving record as it wasnt a conviction of anything just a warning i believe we keep contact information on our computer for 10 years except traffic warnings which remain for 1 year but only if it was a written warning verbal warnings are not entered reply with quote 6 10062005 1146 amuncle beer guest join date may 1999location nac 8104j

just remember the info in that computer will only be contacts made by that particular department there has been some changes since this zombie was laid to rest fist of all contact information now can

contact with you even if it was just a warning ill be able to see it on my data terminal if i pull you over later for about 30 days this capability previously did not exist the warning does not go n your state driving record so please dont misread what im saying secondly what youll see if you go into a agency and look at their public information computer has changed drastically and not for the better due to a misinterpretation of a court case 2013 iirc a lot of jurisdictions are redacting blacking out pertinent information on their reports available to the public this makes the reports useless so if you want to know why there was a police car at your neighbors house it may say what address they were at and why but it will be blacked out who they spoke to and had contact with this is absolutely freaking ridiculous if its a traffic accident eventually you can get the info on a state accident report and if there is an arrest you can get the information by going to the court house and looking at the file but for a lot of areas just simple contacts at the local pd are blacked out this like i said is due to a misinterpretation of a court ruling its not the decision of the law enforcement agencies doing this but the local city attorneys or county corporation counsels and not all jurisdictions are doing this so ymmv i got tired of coming up with lastminute desperate
