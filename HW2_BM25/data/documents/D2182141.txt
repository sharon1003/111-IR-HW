will accommodate the duvet more easily that said many home machines will be large enough front loading machines are the better option here – they tend to have a hollow drum that allows for plenty of room for the duvet to move about some top loading machines have an agitator in the middle of the drum which can make things a little tougher but it can be done settings  detergent for washing a duvet

retain some detergent and soapy water so an extra rinse cycle should be enough to make sure it’s completely fresh and clean drying a duvet when you get your duvet out of the machine don’t be alarmed
