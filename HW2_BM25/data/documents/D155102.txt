 – deleted 599 points 4 years ago colors on the moon are dominantly controlled by variations in iron and titanium content the mare regions have low reflectance because they contain relatively high amounts of iron oxide fe o some mare basalts contain unusually high amounts of titanium oxide ti o2 in addition to iron oxide making for even lower reflectance ti o2 also shifts the color of the mare from red to bluepermalink embed save – jccwrt 380 points 4 years ago to kind of further this a little these are very light shades of red and blue and are almost indistinguishable fron shades of gray to the human eye however cameras can pick up on this subtle color difference by boosting the saturation of the photos they produce in the case of change 3 im not sure if they were boosting the saturation on purpose useful for science operations or if they simply hadnt dialed their camera in for lunar lighting conditions yet edit actually you can make a very rough chemical map of the moon yourself pretty easily just take a camera outside tonight and snap a picture of the moon you can then turn up the saturation and viola youll notice the mare are mostly reddish the lavas there have iron in them while the highlands are mostly blue the rocks there are titaniumrichpermalink embed save parent  deleted 4 years ago 51 children – ragingasshole 16 points 4 years ago trying to pose the

depending on regionpermalink embed save parent – jccwrt 41 points 4 years ago depends on the location you probably wouldnt see it with your naked eye colors are pretty hard to find on the moon to the point where apollo 17 astronauts got really excited to see pale orange dirtpermalink embed save parent – scubaguybill 42 points 4 years agoto the point where apollo 17 astronauts got really excited to see pale orange dirt for those of you wondering as apollo 17 astronaut dr harrison schmitt the only geologist to land on the moon was turning to return to the lm his foot kicked up some lunar soil revealing a pale orange tuff if you listen to the audio he starts getting excited as soon as he sees it because it simply and conclusively answered a longstanding question about the moons geology the presence of tuff on the moon indicated that the moon  at one point or another  had active volcanoespermalink embed save parent – agvann 4 points 4 years ago how different would volcanoes be on a moon with weak gravity and virtually no atmosphere would ejecta from eruptions just be fired off into spacepermalink embed save parent – scubaguybill 16 points 4 years ago they differ in that as you suspected ejecta can reach much greater altitudes because of the lower gravity and atmospheric resistance io is a particularly good example of this and one we can witness in action some of the eruptions on io propel material and gas to 300mi above its surface which for reference is 70 miles higher than the iss orbits above the earth here is an animation of a volcanic plume on io that reached an altitude of 210mipermalink embed save parentload more comments 1 reply – professorrumbleroar 7 points 4 years ago youd need a pretty good camera for that though wouldnt you anytime i try to take moon pictures they turn out weird because the moon is so bright compared to everything else and it just becomes a bright blurpermalink embed save parent – jccwrt 13 points 4 years ago it helps having a camera where you can set the exposure times but i think you can mitigate that somewhat if you cant control that by letting the camera focus on the moon first the camera will attempt to set the exposure time to prevent it from blowing out and if you can brace yourself against something sturdy you can minimize blurringpermalink embed save parent – sarcastic panda 11 points 4 years ago heres what i do when i want to take pictures of the moon i hope this helps what you will want to do is set your camera to aperture priority mode point it at the moon focus and shoot youll want to see the exposure time now its going to be a big white ball in the sky at this point so to fix that we need to adjust the exposure time put your camera into manual mode keep your aperture the same and adjust your exposure time youre going to want to make it at least two stops faster so if your camera shot the moon at 1250th of a second your next one should be 1750th or 11000th of a second this should give you a clearer picture of the moon you can also try and adjust your exposure compensation and deliberately underexpose your shot a final word of note unless you have a decent zoom lens at least 300mm you probably arent going to get a dramatic shot of the moon heres one i took 2 years ago when i was just starting out that was with a 200mm not exactly a lot of detailpermalink embed save parent – georgemcbay 12 points 4 years ago this is good advice the primary takeaway being the moon is very bright compared to everything else in the sky except for the sun so to get a realistic looking nighttime capture of the moon you want a short exposure time but cameras on automatic modes will freak out because everything other than the moon looks so dark so you have to outsmart the camera and do things semimanually or use exposure compensation this may be getting too photonerdy but aperture size and iso level also make a pretty big difference in what exposure time value youd want to use for further information and comparison of how the moon might look quite different with different settings here is a photo i took of the moon with a 400mm lens on a crop sensor camera and then the image was further cropped so the equivalent 35mm focal length is something in the area of 800mm1000mm after stacking those two cropshttpwwwgmcbaycommoon1jpg the settings for that photo were 1400th of a second f56 iso 200 400mm then cropped by both the sensor and image cropped in lightroom later compare that to this photohttpwwwgmcbaycommoon2jpg the settings for that one were 15 seconds shot on a tripod of course f28 14mm iso 640 as you can see the moon is blown out and lensflared which is fine for artistic purposes this shot was mostly to catch the geminid meteor the moon was kind of photobombing but the combined result looks nice if not realistic to what your eye would seepermalink embed save parent – deleted 4 points 4 years ago fun fact i learned while shooting photos for a living the correct exposure for the moon at night is the same as shooting a portrait in broad daylight  stopped down to f16 and 1iso on the shutter speed the good old sunny 16 rule if you think about it the moon is in broad daylight were just standing in a big shadow when we take the picture i always thought that was neatpermalink embed save parent – professorrumbleroar 5 points 4 years ago thats what i mean though is that someone needs a camera with those capabilities in order to get a shot where the saturation can be changed very helpful otherwise and i will definitely use those tips in the future when i have a dslr which i currently do notpermalink embed save parent – sarcastic panda 1 point 4 years ago depending on the type of pointandshoot camera you have you might be able to play with those settings i know a lot of the newer smartphones actually have exposure compensation settings so you can use one of those a lot of the pointandshoots ive seen in the last two years are really

moon and trying to do a longer exposure try using spot metering on the moon itself or doing the exposure manuallypermalink embed save parent – aftersteveo 2 points 4 years ago you just need a camera with full manual controls the more full the moon is the faster exposuresmaller aperture youll need to turn it from a bright blob into something that more accurately represents the colorpermalink embed save parent – deleted 1 point 4 years ago any camera with psam modes would be able to do it by manually setting the exposure to something faster than what full auto comes up with spot metering on the moon itself would also work in p rogram mode the built in matrix metering on most cameras will blow a moon exposure as you are referencingpermalink embed save parent – esshall 1 point 4 years ago

to the black of the night sky but this is a visual illusion if you look at photos of the apollo astronauts on some photos they appear unbelievably bright against the moon when they are in shadow to the extent that conspiracy theorists thought that were some hidden extra light shining on them source in reality the moon is just a dark grey colour and the astronauts look bright by comparison the albedo reflectivity of the moon is approximately the same as a ploughed field or asphalt source how dark would you describe the soil of a ploughed field dark grey or light grey alternatively something purely black has an albedo or 0 something purely white has an albedo of 10 the moon has an albedo of 012 source in addition there are some areas that are grey with with a yellow or green or red tinge

question to build a base on the moon and use the resources on itpermalink embed save parent – jccwrt 11 points 4 years ago not really practical right now to use those resources youd have to send a refinery to the moon so in effect youd be building a moonbase so you could build a moonbase easier to start with the basics and then expand capacity as for helium3 its a fusion fuel and practical

save parent – jccwrt 8 points 4 years ago nah the mass that wed move would be insignificant compared to the mass of the earth its easy to think of skyscrapers and roadways being big and heavy but remember we have nearly 6500km of solid rock and iron below our feetpermalink embed save parent – dswartze 4 points 4 years ago do note that surprisingly large amounts of dust and things are constantly being picked up by the earth every day then theres also all the stuff we send away from the earth without returning presumably any sort of permanent facilities on the moon will be built with the cost of large amounts of stuff brought from earth first well also start sending more and more things further away as well the earth also loses mass naturally although im pretty sure its less than it gains from that dust as particles in the upper atmosphere can get bumped or given some extra energy sending them off into space increasing the mass of the earth a significant amount could increase gravitational forces making things like buildings not be able to support themselves anymore making them collapse tides could get all screwed up and a smaller gravitational influence from the moon could increase the earths wobbling screwing seasons up and moving the polar regions to a much warmer place and make hot places cold i suppose with enough added mass we could get the moon to crash into the earth or even turn the earth into a black hole but in a practical sense the answer to your question is no the mass of the earth is far too large for us to really be able to change it simply by mining the moonasteroidsother planets plus even if we could and its hard to stress just how much it would need to be it would happen so slowly that if anything bad looked like it was going to happen we could just start slinging stuff out into spacepermalink embed save parent – dasmaster 3 points 4 years ago another fun thought is that speaking from a viewpoint of our solarsystem the moons
