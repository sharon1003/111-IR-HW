scenario where youre gainfully employed but spending your nights and weekends working on a side project its just something youve been mashing together in your free time with a few friends at work now pretend to visit yourself five years into the future and see that your little side project turned into one of the biggest communications technologies of the last 100 years this is the history of twitter twitter began as an idea that twitter cofounder jack dorsey  jack had in 2006 dorsey had originally imagined twitter as an smsbased communications platform groups of friends could keep tabs on what each other were doing based on their status updates like texting but not during a brainstorming session at the podcasting company odeo jack dorsey proposed this sms based platform to odeos cofounder evan williams  ev  evan and his cofounder biz stone  biz by extension gave jack the goahead to spend more time on the project and develop it further in its early days twitter was referred to as twttr at the time a popular trend sometimes to gain domain name advantage was to drop vowels in the name of their companies and services software developer noah glass  noah is credited with coming up with the original name twttr as well as its final incarnation as twitter to recap some of the key early players in twitters history are jack dorsey noah glass biz stone and evan williams many would agree thats also the appropriate order of involvement the first tweet jack sent the first message on twitter on march 21 2006 950pm it read just setting up my twttr during the development of twitter team members would often rack up hundreds of dollars in sms charges to their personal phone bills while the initial concept of twitter was being tested at odeo the company was going through a rough patch faced with the brutal reality that apple had just released its own podcasting platform which essentially killed odeos business model the founders decided to buy their company back from the investors jack dorsey biz stone evan williams and other members of odeo staff facilitated the buyback by doing this they acquired the rights to the twitter platform there is some controversy surrounding how this all took place its questionable whether odeo investors knew the full scope of the twitter platform also key members of the twitter development team were not brought on to the new company most notably noah glass as a formality obvious corporation obviouscorp was created after the investor buyback of odeo in order to house twitter growing growing and still growing twitter was now on the cusp of its biggest growth spurt the 2007 south by southwest sxsw interactive conference saw a huge explosion of twitter usage more than 60 thousand tweets were sent per day at the event the twitter team had a huge presence at the event and took advantage of the viral nature of the conference and its attendees as a side note i joined twitter a month later at the very first web 20 expo w2e in san francisco after noticing attendee tweets streaming over a big display in the lobby i excitedly spent all day trying to figure out how to get my words in lights i never did not that day anyway its safe to say that twitter had its fair share of growing pains during its formative years twitters user base grew at astounding rates and quite frequently the service would be over capacity when this occurred an illustration by artist yiying lu yiying lu appeared on the screen the illustration featured a whale being lifted out of the water by eight birds to safety the twitter team used this image because they thought it symbolized the acknowledgment of the problem and that they were working on it this error page went viral within the twitter community and soon was dubbed the fail whale is it a 140 character limit or 280 character limit at one point you may have questioned why you can only tweet 280 characters the reason for such a specific limitation is that twitter was originally designed as an sms mobile phonebased platform in its early days 140 characters were the limit that mobile carriers imposed with sms protocol standard so twitter was simply creatively constrained as twitter eventually grew into a web platform the 140character limit remained as a matter of branding in 2017 however twitter decided that the 140character limit was no longer relevant in the smartphone age and it increased the tweet limit to 280 characters over minor protestations most tweets the company explained hover around 50 characters when people needed more characters they simply sent more tweets the character increase was designed to help twitter users spend less time condensing their thoughts and more time talking user innovation as twitters user base started growing a funny thing started to happen users were creating new jargon and different ways to use the service think of it as innovation born out of necessity initially users had no way of replying or shouting out one another on twitter some users would include an  symbol before their username to identify another user within a tweet this became such a prevalent way to acknowledge another user that the twitter team added the functionality natively to the twitter platform the same thing happened with hashtags which are now an integral part of the twitter ecosystem this userdriven functionality is also true for how retweets were created users wanted a way to repost a message from a twitter user while including credit to the user who originally tweeted it users started to add rt before sending the message signaling to their followers that the following tweet was a report in august 2010 this functionality was officially added to the platform in six years twitters user base has grown to over 200 million active monthly users and most recently in march 2013 jack and biz were awarded the patent they applied for way back in 2007 that secures the entire twitter ecosystem was this page helpful
