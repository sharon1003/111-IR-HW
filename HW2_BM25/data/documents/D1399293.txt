chemistry the chemistry of alcohol in the body alcohol is absorbed directly into the blood stream through the lining of the mouth and the tissue that lines the stomach and small intestine food water and fruit juice help to slow this absorption carbonated beverages speed the absorption of alcohol which means that the drinker feels the effects sooner once alcohol or ethanol the chemical in alcoholic beverages is in your bloodstream it is carried to the brain and all the organs of your body within 90 seconds the affects of alcohol vary according to the individual’s sex body size amount of body fat the amount of alcohol consumed the situation and the amount of food in the stomach ten percent of the alcohol consumed is eliminated through sweat breath and urine the liver begins working immediately to counteract the remaining toxic effects of alcohol on average the liver metabolizes or breaks down alcoholethanol at a rate of one half an ounce per hour 12 an ounce equals 14 grams a standard drink contains 12 grams of ethanol that means the average person can metabolize about one standard drink per hour however some people’s livers metabolize alcohol more slowly when the amount of alcohol consumed exceeds the liver’s ability to break down the alcohol the concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream the proportion of alcohol to blood in the body increases increased blood alcohol concentrations higher proportions of alcohol to blood impair thought processes and coordination and slow automatic functions such as breathing excessive blood alcohol concentration can lead to coma or possibly death nothing will speed the rate at which the liver is able to process alcohol only the passage of time  at least one hour per drink consumed  will make a drunk person sober the chemistry of alcohol in the brain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters relay information in the brain each neurotransmitter binds to a particular receptor to create a response although variations in the receptors can affect the response a neuron’s response to information it receives depends on complex interactions of potentially conflicting messages that arrive simultaneously alcohol is a depressant which means it slows down the brain and body it slows the function of the brain in two ways first it limits the actions of the neurotransmitter glutamate which usually excites activity in the brain second it elevates the activity of the inhibiting neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid gaba alcohol’s pleasurable effects and addictiveness are caused when alcohol increases the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine which is related to pleasure in an area of the brain that is associated with all types of addictions stimulates the activity of opioid peptides which increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol activates serotonin receptors this impacts serotonin’s many functions including the regulation of mood sleep body temperature and appetite and many others initiates neuroadaptation — changes caused by the brain attempting to function normally in the presence of alcohol
