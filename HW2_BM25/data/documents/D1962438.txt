materialism as evidenced by the characters in the tale and the pardoner himself the prologue or the introduction of the pardoners tale reveals his true character the pardoner uses his ties as a church to manipulate people into giving him ill gotten funds he tells false tales and displays false artifacts just to fuel his avarice the pardoner makes a lucrative living preaching mockeries in his sermon for it frees the pelf and his purpose is to win and not to redeem people of sin the pardoner himself is an embodiment of irony and contradiction by not only his practice of corruption but his tale being a moving parable that would strike shame within a person the main characteristic of his personality and his tale is summed in his biblical statement in latin radix malorum est cupiditas translated as the love of money is the root of all evil his irony derives from his wealthybeggar status corruption of the church and his tale denouncing all of his practices the tales three main characters of three young men drinking at local tavern and stumble upon the rumors of a thief named death that began killing ruthlessly around a local village the three men then swear to kill this traitor death and made an oath to live and die for one another their oath begins the theme of irony as later these men who wished to protect each other like brothers all lay dead being murdered by one another over illgotten fortune their oath also calls to kill and murder death death being an unstoppable inevitable way life cannot be defied and it is humorist thought that they challenged a natural factor of life though they pledged to rid death from the people when they meet an old man they ask why he is even bothering to live need writing help get feedback on grammar clarity concision and

younger souls after the small talk the old man says that death waits near a tree though the three men find no incarnate or symbol of death all three of their lives end at that spot irony comes in many shades and positions and the contradiction continue to flip in this story irony comes in when the protagonists find not death under the tree but a pile of golden florins and no longer was it death they sought but the finest luxuries of life the reckless youth had found not their death just yet but ironically the promise of a better richer life the three began to sprout secret thoughts of undermining their so called brothers of the treasure the youngest began harbor thoughts the devil sent of to have all the treasure to myself alone meanwhile and yet again ironically the other two agree to stab the younger one to his death and split the money between them soon the site of their promises had ironically become their site of death and their bodies now represent the image of their foe death himself after the pardoner finished his tale he continued to ask for a shilling or a groat only for donations of materialistic goods the pardoner makes money by hiding his secret desires of worldly goods and imposing the rhetorical statement of what possession is worth more than salvation the pardoners tale has the moral to humble any man of any stature and question the value of wealth over personal virtues while he sells out his own morals money is the root of all evil but it is an inconvenience not to have any and while the church attempts to avoid the temptation of excessive wealth the contradictions of man thwart the common perception of morals the pardoners tale is a demonstration from chaucer that though man may lie liars speak truths and that the manipulation of words can be all the benefit to any persons motives
