flexibility and openness however you bring up a good point about the apps not only for i phone but especially when deciding on the tablet experience i feel that googles long term aspirations are to move apps from residing on your device to residing on the internet in other words accessing all of your apps through a web browser using todays technology would equate to an even less polished experience than what we currently have on android i will admit that google has done a better job in closing the gap than i wouldve ever envisioned its hard to match what apple is able to achieve by controlling the hardware and software aspects of the device experience andrew t roach • 3 years ago really for an i phone user the only smart option would be a nexus or gpe device no bloatware no
