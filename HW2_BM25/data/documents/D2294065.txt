current and future treatments for ibsdirritable bowel syndrome ibs is a multifactorial disorder marked by recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel function it affects between 10 and 20 percent of people in the developed world about onethird of whom have ibs associated with diarrhea ibsd certain factors that alter gastrointestinal function can contribute to ibs symptoms including stress prior gastroenteritis changes in the gut microbiome and bile acids and shortchain fatty acids which may stimulate serotonin 5ht release and increase colonic permeability and motility still the underlying cause of ibs in many cases remains unknown michael camilleri m d of mayo clinic in rochester minn says the ultimate goal is a better understanding of the mechanisms behind this syndrome so we can foster individualized specific treatment for ibs patients so far that goal remains unrealized the only drug currently approved for ibsd is alosetron a 5ht3 antagonist that may relieve abdominal pain and slow colonic and small bowel transit alosetron was withdrawn from the market for safety reasons in 2000 and was reintroduced in 2002 with a more restricted indication today incidence rates of adverse events including ischemic colitis and complications of constipation are similar to those before the drug was withdrawn nonibs medications for ibsdgiven the limited number of drugs marketed specifically for ibsd other medications are often used to treat symptoms they include loperamide this synthetic muopioid agonist decreases intestinal transit while increasing intestinal water and ion absorption in a small placebocontrolled study loperamide improved pain stool consistency urgency and overall subjective response but it must be carefully titrated for individual patients to avoid constipation bile acid binders roughly 30 percent of people with ibsd have diagnosed bile acid malabsorption and for this subset of patients bile acid sequestration may relieve the cholerrheic effect of bile acids some evidence suggests that certain genetic variants may influence response to the bile sequestrant colesevelam a medication that may be preferable to cholestyramine antidepressants tricyclic agents such as amitriptyline and imipramine were initially prescribed to ibs patients with significant depression today they are frequently used to treat patients with severe or refractory ibs symptoms and may have analgesic and neuromodulatory benefits in addition to their psychotropic effects in one trial nearly 70 percent of patients receiving 10 mg of amitriptyline experienced a complete loss of ibs symptoms compared with 28 percent of those on placebo probiotics of increasing interest in many gastrointestinal disorders single or combination probiotics have been investigated for ibsd in several small trials in these studies bloating and distension improved but not diarrhea mast cell stabilizers and 5aminosalicylic acid 5asagastroenteritis precedes ibsd in about 25 percent of people two antiinflammatory agents have been used for this subset of patients mast cell stabilizers such as disodium cromoglycate and ketotifen and 5asa which has shown mixed results for ibsd in four small trials new drugs for ibsdcurrently under development or in clinical trials these drugs are more likely than others to play a role in the future management of ibsd serotonin synthesis inhibitors lx1031 is a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor that reduces local 5ht synthesis and 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5hiaa excretion unlike previous 5ht inhibitors lx1031 does not cross the bloodbrain barrier thereby reducing the risk of depression and central nervous system disorders a randomized placebocontrolled phase ii clinical trial in 155 patients showed reductions in urinary 5hiaa and blood 5ht as well as improvements in pain and stool consistency ramosetron in two placebocontrolled parallelgroup studies of 1000 patients with ibsd this selective 5ht3 antagonist increased selfreported global assessment of relief of ibs symptoms constipation occurred in roughly 5 percent of participants â€” less than the rate observed with alosetron spherical carbon adsorbent ast120 is a preparation consisting of spherical carbon particles that adsorb bacterial toxins inflammatory mediators and bile acid products and prevent them from entering systemic circulation in a phase ii randomized controlled eightweek trial of ast120 in 115 patients improvements in pain and bloating were shortlived and there was no significant improvement in stool consistency benzodiazepine receptor modulator the benzodiazepine receptor modulator dextofisopam binds to benzodiazepine receptors in the brain not the gi tract without a sedating effect in animal studies it exhibited the potential to reduce colonic motility and visceral sensitivity in response to stress further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of action safety and efficacy in humans peripheral kagonist asimadoline a kappaopioid agonist is being evaluated in clinical trials so far it has shown a good safety profile and reduced pain urgency and stool frequency in ibsd patients in spite of ongoing studies dr camilleri says several challenges must be met in order to achieve therapeutic advances including significant advances in research to understand the pathophysiology and clinical phenotyping of diverse patients with ibsd interest and investment by the pharmaceutical companies to develop the next generation of compounds and greater definition of study endpoints by regulatory agencies to identify a clear path for approval and marketing of those medications for more information camilleri m current and future pharmacological treatments for diarrheapredominant irritable bowel syndrome expert
