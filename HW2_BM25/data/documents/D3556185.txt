strip his stars of their vanity rendering them nearly unrecognizable in monsters ball which daniels produced halle berrys unglamorous turn as a widow who falls in love with the racist prison guard who executes her husband earned her an academy award watching daniels latest film precious based on the novel push by sapphire which opens next friday audiences will have a hard time recognizing some of the films stars comedian monique pop star mariah carey and rocker lenny kravitz who play roles far removed from their glitzy hollywood personas playnullsomebody who does makeup for me said this is a mariah carey nightmare you have everything that you hate going on right now carey told reporters at the toronto film festival but it was cool because a lot of people say they dont recognize me in the film they dont know its me and to me that was a great gift that daniels gave me to be able to really go that far away from who i am like berry carey monique and kravitz are winning kudos for their performances and theres even talk of an oscar nomination for carey and monique the real star of precious is newcomer gabourey sidibe who plays the title role claireece precious jones an obese illiterate harlem teen who is abused by her mother mary monique and raped by her father who has impregnated her for the second time precious has been abused both by her mother and her father and kept down for most of her life shes struggling to learn how to read shes struggling to take control of her children and shes struggling to have a real life sidibe told peter travers host of abc news nows popcorn sidibes own life  born in brooklyn raised in harlem by an rb singing mother  couldnt be farther from that of her character when i was looking for precious i interviewed 400 girls daniels told travers i saw gabbys audition tape and she starts talking like this white girl from california despite her nightmare existence precious fantasizes about a different life and is offered the chance at one when she meets alternative school teacher ms rain paula patton a social worker carey and delivery room nurse john kravitz in the end the film is about hope a belief in yourself daniels explained to travers if precious can triumph over all these adversities then i can we all have precious moments precious said sidibe is not a hollywood creature shes a real person were all a part of her i recognized her i recognized her in my friend in my family in people we dont want to be friends with two influential backers of the film oprah winfrey and tyler perry both of whom were abused as children recognized precious in themselves and signed on as executive producers i watched all the things that precious a 16yearold girl in the film went through i watched her mother be unusually cruel to her and i realized at that moment that a large part of my childhood had just played out before my eyes perry producer of such hit films as madeas family reunion wrote on his web site it hit me so hard i sat there in tears realizing that somehow by the grace of god i made it through when i finished watching that movie i literally had to breathe winfrey told reporters at the toronto film festival i didnt cry until the card came up with for precious girls everywhere and that hit a nerve and i recognized myself in that character most of all i recognized that i have seen the precious girls of the world and they have been invisible to me according to perrys web site he and winfrey are donating their profits from the film to charity meanwhile perry and winfrey along with daniels and the cast hit the festival circuit where they racked up several awards and spoke about the process of being transformed for this bleak and ultimately heartwarming drama carey had to leave her pop diva persona at the door i brought in all my wigs for the character and daniels was like no its not happening she told reporters at the toronto film festival makeupless her hair mousy brown and limp with a faint mustache above her upper lip carey was nearly incognito as ms weiss a toughlove social worker she even adopted a long island accent for the role though shes in only a few scenes carey has one of the most intense moments a meeting with precious and her mother in which she probes mary about how she allowed the abuse to occur my character is not really a likeable person but she does bring this to the surface i had to really stay strong as an actor and i had to thank lee for giving me that chance and letting us really be free with that scene carey said in toronto i feel like it was a great chance for me to exercise and me to work and i feel like we connected on such a level we were crying between scenes it was emotional for us kravitz didnt have to work as hard to transform himself into john the male delivery room nurse who befriends precious without his rockers edge hes quite believable as john no stranger to casting musicians daniels who calls kravitz one of his best friends plans to work with kravitz again hes going to be working with me on the next thing that im doing daniels told rolling stone about a musical he has in the works so i thought it was a way for him to see how it was that i worked and i think that this movie with lenny will prepare me and him to work together better on the next movie view cohost sherri shepherd has a light moment with kravitzs character in the film but for the most part the comedian plays it straight in this drama though it was a stretch for her lee daniels called and i auditioned for that part shepherd recalled in a los angeles times interview i came in and improvised my scene and made lee laugh like he was cracking up but then he came over and said i dont want anything funny you are a woman in pain people know you for all your teeth and your smile and those boobs  i dont want any of that i said lee i dont know how to do anything else but he pushed me and thank god it worked another funnywoman monique known for her bawdy humor turned brutal in her portrayal of mary precious mother the comedian recalled for a reporter at the sundance film festival in january what daniels said when he first called her about the role monique this could f up your career i said sign me up she said he said i need you to be a monster and that was it be a monster i need people to hate that character she continued i remember when we first got the script and my husband looked at that he said this is what people get oscars for monique added we laughed now here we are monique has taken some lumps in the press for being a noshow at festivals since sundance reportedly because her demands to be paid by festival organizers have been rebuffed when people say you care more about money than winning an oscar well what does an oscar mean an oscar means more work when you win it and that means more money monique told the new york daily news in response to the allegations i couldnt eat that oscar everybody needs money baby thats how we survive right back on the set tensions between monique and precious on film did not translate off screen when he said cut we were done sidibe explained to peter travers i know very well who gabby is and who precious is and those lines never got blurred when the camera stopped rolling sidibe and monique would hug sing and joke with each other we had to love each other every day was a party we had fun sidibe said we didnt take ourselves seriously making this film daniels elaborated to travers i told my crew laugh at every given turn make me laugh through this dark journey the cast grew close as a result mariah was putting on gabbys makeup monique was at crafts services lenny was helping with costumes noted daniels we really were a family because we understood the dna of
