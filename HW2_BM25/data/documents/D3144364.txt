neuss his father was a goldsmith later a printer schwann studied at the dreikönigsgymnasium in cologne and then at bonn where he met physiologist johannes peter müller 1contributions it was during the four years spent under the influence of müller at berlin that schwanns most valuable work was done müller was at this time preparing his great book on physiology and schwann assisted him in the experimental work required schwann observed animal cells under the microscope noting their different properties schwann found particular interest in the nervous and muscular tissues he discovered the cells that envelope the nerve fibers now called schwann cells in his honor schwann discovered the striated muscle in the upper esophagus and initiated research into muscle contraction since expanded upon greatly by emil du boisreymond and others müller directed schwanns attention to the process of digestion and in 1837 schwann isolated an enzyme essential to digestion which he called pepsin 1schwann became chair of anatomy at the belgian catholic university of leuven in 1839 here he produced little new scientific work the exception being a paper establishing the importance of bile in digestion he nonetheless proved to be a dedicated and conscientious professor 2in 1848 his compatriot antoine frédéric spring convinced him to transfer to the university of liège also in belgium at liège he continued to follow the latest advances in anatomy and physiology without himself contributing he became something of an inventor working on numerous projects including a human respirator for environments where the surroundings are not breathable 2in his later years schwann found growing interest in theological issues three years after retiring schwann died in cologne on 11 january 1882 bronze statue of theodor schwann at the entrance of the institute of zoology university of liege belgium cell theory in 1837 matthias jakob schleiden viewed and stated that new plant cells formed from the nuclei of old plant cells while dining that year with schwann the conversation turned on the nuclei of plant and animal cells schwann remembered seeing similar structures in the cells of the notochord as had been shown by müller and instantly realized the importance of connecting the two phenomena the resemblance was confirmed without delay by both observers and the results soon appeared in schwanns famous microscopical researches into the accordance in the structure and growth of animals and plants in which he declared that all living things are composed of cells and cell products 3 this became cell theory or cell doctrine in the course of his verification of cell theory schwann proved the cellular origin and development of the most highly differentiated tissues including nails feathers and tooth enamel schwann established a basic principle of embryology by observing that the ovum is a single cell that eventually develops into a complete organism in 1857 pathologist rudolf virchow posed the maxim omnis cellula e cellula —that every cell arises from another cell by the 1860s cell doctrine became the conventional view of the elementary anatomical composition of plants and animals schwanns theory and observations became the foundation of modern histology 1vitalism and germ theory schwann was the first of johannes peter müller s pupils to break with vitalism and work towards a physicochemical explanation of life schwann also examined the question of spontaneous generation which led to its eventual disconfirmation in the early 1840s schwann went beyond others who had noted simply the multiplication of yeast during alcoholic fermentation as schwann assigned the yeast the role of primary causal factor and then went further and claimed it was alive embattled controversy ensued as eminent chemists alleged that schwann was undoing scientific progress by reverting to vitalism  citation neededafter publishing anonymous mockery in a journal of their own editorship  who published the mockery clarification needed they published a purely physicochemical if also hypothetical explanation of the interaction resulting in fermentation as both the rival perspectives were hypothetical and there was not even an empirical definition of life to hold as a reference frame the controversy—as well as interest itself—fell into obscurity unresolved pasteur began fermentation researches in 1857 by approximately just repeating and confirming schwanns yet pasteur accepted that yeast were alive thus dissolving the controversy over their living status and then pasteur took fermentation researches further  citation neededin retrospect the germ theory of pasteur as well as its antiseptic applications by lister can be traced to schwanns influence 1notes a
