american revolution he served as president of the second continental congress and was the first and third governor of the commonwealth of massachusetts he is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the united states declaration of independence so much so that the term john hancock has become a synonym in the united states for ones signature 2before the american revolution hancock was one of the wealthiest men in the thirteen colonies having inherited a profitable mercantile business from his uncle he began his political career in boston as a protégé of samuel adams an influential local politician though the two men later became estranged hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and great britain in the 1760s he became very popular in massachusetts especially after british officials seized his sloop liberty in 1768 and charged him with smuggling those charges were eventually dropped he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned hancock was one of bostons leaders during the crisis that led to the outbreak of the american revolutionary war in 1775 he served more than two years in the continental congress in philadelphia and he was the first to sign the declaration of independence in his position as president of congress he returned to massachusetts and was elected governor of the commonwealth serving in that role for most of his remaining years he used his influence to ensure that massachusetts ratified

was born on january 23 1737 3 in braintree massachusetts in a part of town that eventually became the separate city of quincy 4 he was the son of col john hancock jr of braintree and mary hawke thaxter widow of samuel thaxter junior who was from nearby hingham as a child hancock became a casual acquaintance of young john adams whom the reverend hancock had baptized in 1735 5 6 the hancocks lived a comfortable life and owned one slave to help with household work 5after hancocks father died in 1744 john was sent to live with his uncle and aunt thomas hancock and lydia henchman hancock thomas hancock was the proprietor of a firm known as the house of hancock which imported manufactured goods from britain and exported rum whale oil and fish 7 thomas hancocks highly successful business made him one of bostons richest and bestknown residents 8 9 he and lydia along with several servants and slaves lived in hancock manor on beacon hill the couple who did not have any children of their own became the dominant influence on johns life 10after graduating from the boston latin school in 1750 hancock enrolled in harvard college and received a bachelors degree in 1754 11 12 upon graduation he began to work for his uncle just as the french and indian war 1754–1763 had begun thomas hancock had close relations with the royal governors of massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war 13 john hancock learned much about his uncles business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm hancock worked hard but he also enjoyed playing the role of a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes 14 15from 1760 to 1761 hancock lived in england while building relationships with customers and suppliers upon returning to boston hancock gradually took over the house of hancock as his uncles health failed becoming a full partner in january 1763 16 17 18 he became a member of the masonic lodge of st andrew in october 1762 which connected him with many of bostons most influential citizens 19 when thomas hancock died in august 1764 john inherited the business hancock manor two or three household slaves and thousands of acres of land becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies 20 21 the household slaves continued to work for john and his aunt but were eventually freed through the terms of thomas hancocks will there is no evidence that john hancock ever bought or sold slaves 22growing imperial tensions after its victory in the seven years war 1756–1763 the british empire was deeply in debt looking for new sources of revenue the british parliament sought for the first time to directly tax the colonies beginning with the sugar act of 1764 23 the earlier molasses act of 1733 a tax on shipments from the west indies had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling which was seen as a victimless crime not only was there little social stigma attached to smuggling in the colonies but in port cities where trade was the primary generator of wealth smuggling enjoyed considerable community support and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin nationality routes and content of their illicit cargoes this included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised and much to the frustration of the british authorities when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed for instance edward randolph the appointed head of customs in new england brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 to the end of 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted alternatively merchants sometimes took matters into their own hands and stole illicit goods back while impounded 24the sugar act provoked outrage in boston where it was widely viewed as a violation of colonial rights men such as james otis and samuel adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in parliament they could not be taxed by that body only the colonial assemblies where the colonists were represented could levy taxes upon the colonies hancock was not yet a political activist however he criticized the tax for economic rather than constitutional reasons 23around 1772 hancock commissioned john singleton copley to paint this portrait of samuel adams hancocks early political mentor 25hancock emerged as a leading political figure in boston just as tensions with great britain were increasing in march 1765 he was elected as one of bostons five selectmen an office previously held by his uncle for many years 26 soon after parliament passed the 1765 stamp act a tax on legal documents such as wills that had been levied in britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies producing riots and organized resistance hancock initially took a moderate position as a loyal british subject he thought that the colonists should submit to the act even though he believed that parliament was misguided 27 within a few months hancock had changed his mind although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs 28 hancock joined the resistance to the stamp act by participating in a boycott of british goods which made him popular in boston after bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the stamp act hancock was elected to the massachusetts house of representatives in may 1766 29hancocks political success benefited from the support of samuel adams the clerk of the house of representatives and a leader of bostons popular party also known as whigs and later as  patriots  the two men made an unlikely pair fifteen years older than hancock adams had a somber puritan outlook that stood in marked contrast to hancocks taste for luxury and extravagance 30 31 apocryphal stories later portrayed adams as masterminding hancocks political rise so that the merchants wealth could be used to further the whig agenda 32 historian james truslow adams portrayed hancock as shallow and vain easily manipulated by adams 33 historian william m fowler who wrote biographies of both men argued that this characterization was an exaggeration and that the relationship between the two was symbiotic with adams as the mentor and hancock the protégé 34 35townshend acts crisis after the repeal of the stamp act parliament took a different approach to raising revenue passing the 1767 townshend acts which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the american customs board the british government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial american merchants had been smuggling smugglers violated the navigation acts by trading with ports outside of the british empire and avoiding import taxes parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government 36colonial merchants even those not involved in smuggling found the new regulations oppressive other colonists protested that new duties were another attempt by parliament to tax the colonies without their consent hancock joined other bostonians in calling for a boycott of british imports until the townshend duties were repealed 37 38 in their enforcement of the customs regulations the customs board targeted hancock bostons wealthiest whig they may have suspected that he was a smuggler or they may have wanted to harass him because of his politics especially after hancock snubbed governor francis bernard by refusing to attend public functions when the customs officials were present 39 40on april 9 1768 two customs employees called tidesmen boarded hancocks brig lydia in boston harbor hancock was summoned and finding that the agents lacked a writ of assistance a general search warrant he did not allow them to go below deck when one of them later managed to get into the hold hancocks men forced the tidesman back on deck 41 42 43 44 customs officials wanted to file charges but the case was dropped when massachusetts attorney general jonathan sewall ruled that hancock had broken no laws 45 39 46 later some of hancocks most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to british authority in the colonies and credit hancock with initiating the american revolution 47liberty affair the next incident proved to be a major event in the coming of the american revolution on the evening of may 9 1768 hancocks sloop liberty arrived in boston harbor carrying a shipment of madeira wine when custom officers inspected the ship the next morning they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine just one fourth of the ships carrying capacity 48 49 50 hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo 49 51 they did not have any evidence to prove this however since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded 52 48portrait of hancock by john singleton copley c 1765one month later while the british warship hms romney was in port one of the tidesmen changed his story he now claimed that he had been forcibly held on the liberty while it had been illegally unloaded 53 54 55 on june 10 customs officials seized the liberty bostonians were already angry because the captain of the romney had been impressing colonists and not just deserters from the royal navy an arguably illegal activity 56 a riot broke out when officials began to tow the liberty out to the romney which was also arguably illegal 57 58 the confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the liberty were mistaken for a press gang 59 after the riot customs officials relocated to the romney and then to castle william an island fort in the harbor claiming that they were unsafe in town 60 54 whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that london would send troops to boston 61british officials filed two lawsuits stemming from the liberty incident an in rem suit against the ship and an in personam suit against hancock royal officials as well as hancocks accuser stood to gain financially since as was the custom any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor the informer and the crown each getting a third 62 the first suit filed on june 22 1768 resulted in the confiscation of the liberty in august customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in rhode island the following year 63 64 65the second trial began in october 1768 when charges were filed against hancock and five others for allegedly unloading 100 pipes of wine from the liberty without paying the duties 66 67 if convicted the defendants would have had to pay a penalty of triple the value of the wine which came to £ 9000 with john adams serving as his lawyer hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice admiralty court which had no jury and did not always allow the defense to crossexamine the witnesses 68 after dragging out for nearly five months the proceedings against hancock were dropped without explanation 69 70 71although the charges against hancock were dropped many writers later described him as a smuggler 72 the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned hancocks guilt or innocence and the exact charges against him wrote historian john w tyler in 1986 are still fiercely debated 73 historian oliver dickerson argued that hancock was the victim of an essentially criminal racketeering scheme perpetrated by governor bernard and the customs officials dickerson believed that there is no reliable evidence that hancock was guilty in the liberty case and that the purpose of the trials was to punish hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property 74 opposed to dickersons interpretation were kinvin wroth and hiller zobel the editors of john adamss legal papers who argued that hancocks innocence is open to question and that the british officials acted legally if unwisely 75 lawyer and historian bernard knollenberg concluded that the customs officials had the right to seize hancocks ship but towing it out to the romney had been illegal 76 legal historian john phillip reid argued that the testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct the incident 77aside from the liberty affair the degree to which hancock was engaged in smuggling which may have been widespread in the colonies has been questioned given the clandestine nature of smuggling records are scarce 78 if hancock was a smuggler no documentation of this has been found john w tyler identified 23 smugglers in his study of more than 400 merchants in revolutionary boston but found no written evidence that hancock was one of them 79 biographer william fowler concluded that while hancock was probably engaged in some smuggling most of his business was legitimate and his later reputation as the king of the colonial smugglers is a myth without foundation 39  showv t e riots and civil unrest in the history of the united states 1607–1865massacre to tea party paul reveres 1768 engraving of british troops arriving in boston was reprinted throughout the colonies 80the liberty affair reinforced a previously made british decision to suppress unrest in boston with a show of military might the decision had been prompted by samuel adamss 1768 circular letter which was sent to other british american colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to the townshend acts lord hillsborough secretary of state for the colonies sent four regiments of the british army to boston to support embattled royal officials and instructed governor bernard to order the massachusetts legislature to revoke the circular letter hancock and the massachusetts house voted against rescinding the letter and instead drew up a petition demanding governor bernards recall 81 when bernard returned to england in 1769 bostonians celebrated 82 83the british troops remained however and tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in the killing of five civilians in the boston massacre of march 1770 hancock was not involved in the incident but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of the troops meeting with bernards successor governor thomas hutchinson and the british officer in command colonel william dalrymple hancock claimed that there were 10000 armed colonists ready to march into boston if the troops did not leave 84 85 hutchinson knew that hancock was bluffing but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town and so dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to castle william 84 hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting the troops withdrawn 86 85 his reelection to the massachusetts house in may was nearly unanimous 87 88this portrait of hancock was published in england in 1775 89after parliament partially repealed the townshend duties in 1770 bostons boycott of british goods ended 90 politics became quieter in massachusetts although tensions remained 91 hancock tried to improve his relationship with governor hutchinson who in turn sought to woo hancock away from adamss influence 92 93 in april 1772 hutchinson approved hancocks election as colonel of the boston cadets a militia unit whose primary function was to provide a ceremonial escort for the governor and the general court 94 95 in may hutchinson even approved hancocks election to the council the upper chamber of the general court whose members were elected by the house but subject to veto by the governor hancocks previous elections to the council had been vetoed but now hutchinson allowed the election to stand hancock declined the office however not wanting to appear to have been coopted by the governor nevertheless hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute to avoid hostile crowds in boston hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town now he agreed to allow the general court to sit in boston once again to the relief of the legislators 96hutchinson had dared to hope that he could win over hancock and discredit adams 97 to some it seemed that adams and hancock were indeed at odds when adams formed the boston committee of correspondence in november 1772 to advocate colonial rights hancock declined to join creating the impression that there was a split in the whig ranks 98 but whatever their differences hancock and adams came together again in 1773 with the renewal of major political turmoil they cooperated in the revelation of private letters of thomas hutchinson in which the governor seemed to recommend an abridgement of what are called english liberties to bring order to the colony 99 the massachusetts house blaming hutchinson for the military occupation of boston called for his removal as governor 100even more trouble followed parliaments passage of the 1773 tea act on november 5 hancock was elected as moderator at a boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported the tea act was an enemy to america 101 hancock and others tried to force the resignation of the agents who had been appointed to receive the tea shipments unsuccessful in this they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in boston harbor hancock was at the fateful meeting on december 16 where he reportedly told the crowd let every man do what is right in his own eyes 102 103 hancock did not take part in the boston tea party that night but he approved of the action although he was careful not to publicly praise the destruction of private property 104over the next few months hancock was disabled by gout which would trouble him with increasing frequency in the coming years by march 5 1774 he had recovered enough to deliver the fourth annual massacre day oration a commemoration of the boston massacre hancocks speech denounced the presence of british troops in boston who he said had been sent there to enforce obedience to acts of parliament which neither god nor man ever empowered them to make 105 the speech probably written by hancock in collaboration with adams joseph warren and others was published and widely reprinted enhancing hancocks stature as a leading patriot 106revolution begins parliament responded to the tea party with the boston port act one of the socalled coercive acts intended to strengthen british control of the colonies hutchinson was replaced as governor by general thomas gage who arrived in may 1774 on june 17 the massachusetts house elected five delegates to send to the first continental congress in philadelphia which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the coercive acts hancock did not serve in the first congress possibly for health reasons or possibly to remain in charge while the other patriot leaders were away 107 108gage soon dismissed hancock from his post as colonel of the boston cadets 109 in october 1774 gage canceled the scheduled meeting of the general court in response the house resolved itself into the massachusetts provincial congress a body independent of british control hancock was elected as president of the provincial congress and was a key member of the committee of safety 110 the provincial congress created the first minutemen companies consisting of militiamen who were to be ready for action on a moments notice 110 111wary of returning to boston hancock was staying at this house in lexington when the revolutionary war began 112on december 1 1774 the provincial congress elected hancock as a delegate to the second continental congress to replace james bowdoin who had been unable to attend the first congress because of illness 110 113 before hancock reported to the continental congress in philadelphia the provincial congress unanimously reelected him as their president in february 1775 hancocks multiple roles gave him enormous influence in massachusetts and as early as january 1774 british officials had considered arresting him 114 after attending the provincial congress in concord in april 1775 hancock and samuel adams decided that it was not safe to return to boston before leaving for philadelphia they stayed instead at hancocks childhood home in lexington 112 115gage received a letter from lord dartmouth on april 14 1775 advising him to arrest the principal actors and abettors in the provincial congress whose proceedings appear in every light to be acts of treason and rebellion 116 117 118 on the night of april 18 gage sent out a detachment of soldiers on the fateful mission that would spark the american revolutionary war the purpose of the british expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in concord according to many historical accounts gage also instructed his men to arrest hancock and adams if so the written orders issued by gage made no mention of arresting the patriot leaders 119 gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting hancock and adams since other leaders would simply take their place and the british would be portrayed as the aggressors 120 121although gage had evidently decided against seizing hancock and adams patriots initially believed otherwise from boston joseph warren dispatched messenger paul revere to warn hancock and adams that british troops were on the move and might attempt to arrest them revere reached lexington around midnight and gave the warning 122 123 hancock still considering himself a militia colonel wanted to take the field with the patriot militia at lexington but adams and others convinced him to avoid battle arguing that he was more valuable as a political leader than as a soldier 124 125 as hancock and adams made their escape the first shots of the war were fired at lexington and concord soon after the battle gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would lay down their arms and return to the duties of peaceable subjects—with the exceptions of hancock and samuel adams singling out hancock and adams in this manner only added to their renown among patriots 126president of congress dorothy quincy by john singleton copley c 1772with the war underway hancock made his way to the continental congress in philadelphia with the other massachusetts delegates on may 24 1775 he was unanimously elected president of the continental congress succeeding peyton randolph after henry middleton declined the nomination hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons 127 128 he was experienced having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in massachusetts his wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates while his association with boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals his position was somewhat ambiguous because the role of the president was not fully defined and it was not clear if randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence 129 like other presidents of congress hancocks authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer 130 he also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork 131 132in congress on june 15 1775 massachusetts delegate john adams nominated george washington as commanderinchief of the army then gathered around boston years later adams wrote that hancock had shown great disappointment at not getting the command for himself this brief comment from 1801 is the only source for the oftcited claim that hancock sought to become commanderinchief 133 in the early 20th century historian james truslow adams wrote that the incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between hancock and washington but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that the incident or the estrangement ever occurred according to historian donald proctor there is no contemporary evidence that hancock harbored ambitions to be named commanderinchief quite the contrary 134 hancock and washington maintained a good relationship after the alleged incident and in 1778 hancock named his only son john george washington hancock 135 hancock admired and supported general washington even though washington politely declined hancocks request for a military appointment 136 137when congress recessed on august 1 1775 hancock took the opportunity to wed his fiancée dorothy dolly quincy the couple was married on august 28 in fairfield connecticut 138 139 john and dorothy would have two children neither of whom survived to adulthood their daughter lydia henchman hancock was born in 1776 and died ten months later 140 their son john was born in 1778 and died in 1787 after suffering a head injury while ice skating 141 142while president of congress hancock became involved in a longrunning controversy with harvard as treasurer of the college since 1773 he had been entrusted with the schools financial records and about £15000 in cash and securities 143 144 in the rush of events at the onset of the revolutionary war hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to harvard before leaving for congress 144 in 1777 a harvard committee headed by james bowdoin hancocks chief political and social rival in boston sent a messenger to philadelphia to retrieve the money and records 145 hancock was offended but he turned over more than £16000 though not all of the records to the college 146 147 148 when harvard replaced hancock as treasurer his ego was bruised and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held despite pressure put on him by bowdoin and other political opponents 149 150 the issue dragged on until after hancocks death when his estate finally paid the college more than £1000 to resolve the matter 149 150hancock served in congress through some of the darkest days of the revolutionary war the british drove washington from new york and new jersey in 1776 which prompted congress to flee to baltimore maryland 151 hancock and congress returned to philadelphia in march 1777 but were compelled to flee six months later when the british occupied philadelphia 152 hancock wrote innumerable letters to colonial officials raising money supplies and troops for washingtons army 153 he chaired the marine committee and took pride in helping to create a small fleet of american frigates including the uss hancock which was named in his honor 154 155signing the declaration hancock was president of congress when the declaration of independence was adopted and signed he is primarily remembered by americans for his large flamboyant signature on the declaration so much so that john hancock became in the united states an informal synonym for signature 156 according to legend hancock signed his name largely and clearly so that king george could read it without his spectacles but the story is apocryphal and originated years later 157 158hancocks signature as it appears on the engrossed copy of the declaration of independence contrary to popular mythology there was no ceremonial signing of the declaration on july 4 1776 157 after congress approved the wording of the text on july 4 the fair copy was sent to be printed as president hancock may have signed the document that was sent to the printer john dunlap but this is uncertain because that document is lost perhaps destroyed in the printing process 159 dunlap produced the first published version of the declaration the widely distributed dunlap broadside hancock as president of congress was the only delegate whose name appeared on the broadside although the name of charles thomson secretary of the continental congress but not a delegate was also on it as attested by implying that hancock had signed the fair copy this meant that until a second broadside was issued six months later with all of the signers listed hancock was the only delegate whose name was publicly attached to the treasonous document 160 hancock sent a copy of the dunlap broadside to george washington instructing him to have it read to the troops in the way you shall think most proper 161hancocks name was printed not signed on the dunlap broadside his iconic signature appears on a different document—a sheet of parchment that was carefully handwritten sometime after july 19 and signed on august 2 by hancock and those delegates present 162 known as the engrossed copy this is the famous document on display at the national archives in washington d c 163return to massachusetts in john trumbull s famous painting the declaration of independence hancock as presiding officer is seated on the right as the drafting committee presents their work in october 1777 after more than two years in congress president hancock requested a leave of absence 164 165 he asked george washington to arrange a military escort for his return to boston although washington was short on manpower he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany hancock on his journey home 166 167 by this time hancock had become estranged from samuel adams who disapproved of what he viewed as hancocks vanity and extravagance which adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader when congress voted to thank hancock for his service adams and the other massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution as did a few delegates from other states 130 168back in boston hancock was reelected to the house of representatives as in previous years his philanthropy made him popular although his finances had suffered greatly because of the war he gave to the poor helped support widows and orphans and loaned money to friends according to biographer william fowler john hancock was a generous man and the people loved him for it he was their idol 169 in december 1777 he was reelected as a delegate to the continental congress and as moderator of the boston town meeting 170hancock rejoined the continental congress in pennsylvania in june 1778 but his brief time there was unhappy in his absence congress had elected henry laurens as its new president which was a disappointment to hancock who had hoped to reclaim his chair hancock got along poorly with samuel adams and missed his wife and newborn son 171 on july 9 1778 hancock and the other massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the articles of confederation the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign and the articles would not be ratified until 1781 172hancock returned to boston in july 1778 motivated by the opportunity to finally lead men in combat back in 1776 he had been appointed as the senior major general of the massachusetts militia 173 now that the french fleet had come to the aid of the americans general washington instructed general john sullivan of the continental army to lead an attack on the british garrison at newport rhode island in august 1778 hancock nominally commanded 6000 militiamen in the campaign although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders it was a fiasco french admiral destaing abandoned the operation after which hancocks militia mostly deserted sullivans continentals 174 175 hancock suffered some criticism for the debacle but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact 176 177 he was a charter member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1780 178after much delay the new massachusetts constitution finally went into effect in october 1780 to no ones surprise hancock was elected governor of massachusetts in a landslide garnering over 90 of the vote 179 in the absence of formal party politics the contest was one of personality popularity and patriotism hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the second continental congress james bowdoin his principal opponent was cast by hancocks supporters as unpatriotic citing among other things his refusal which was due to poor health to serve in the first continental congress 180 bowdoins supporters who were principally welloff commercial interests from massachusetts coastal communities cast hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace 181hancock governed massachusetts through the end of the revolutionary war and into an economically troubled postwar period repeatedly winning reelection by wide margins hancock took a handsoff approach to governing avoiding controversial issues as much as possible according to william fowler hancock never really led and never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth 182 hancock governed until his surprise resignation on january 29 1785 hancock cited his failing health as the reason but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and wanted to get out of office before the trouble came 183 hancocks critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations 184 historian james truslow adams wrote that hancocks two chief resources were his money and his gout the first always used to gain popularity and the second to prevent his losing it 185 the turmoil that hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as shayss rebellion which hancocks successor james bowdoin had to deal with after the uprising hancock was reelected in 1787 and he promptly pardoned all the rebels 186 187 hancock was reelected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life 188final years hancocks memorial in bostons granary burying ground dedicated in 1896 189when he had resigned as governor in 1785 hancock was again elected as a delegate to the continental congress known as the confederation congress after the ratification of the articles of confederation in 1781 congress had declined in importance after the revolutionary war and was frequently ignored by the states congress elected hancock to serve as its president but he never attended because of his poor health and because he was not interested he sent congress a letter of resignation in 1786 190in an effort to remedy the perceived defects of the articles of confederation delegates were first sent to the annapolis convention in 1786 and then to the philadelphia convention in 1787 where they drafted the united states constitution which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection hancock who was not present at the philadelphia convention had misgivings about the new constitutions lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government 191 in january 1788 hancock was elected president of the massachusetts ratifying convention although he was ill and not present when the convention began 192 hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates but as the convention was drawing to close he gave a speech in favor of ratification for the first time in years samuel adams supported hancocks position 193 even with the support of hancock and adams the massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168 hancocks support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification 194 195hancock was put forth as a candidate in the 1789 u s presidential election as was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office he instead made his wishes known indirectly like everyone else hancock knew that george washington was going to be elected as the first president but hancock may have been interested in being vice president despite his poor health 196 hancock received only four electoral votes in the election however none of them from his home state the massachusetts electors all voted for another massachusetts native john adams who received the secondhighest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president 197 although hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election he continued to be popular in massachusetts 197his health failing hancock spent his final few years as essentially a figurehead governor with his wife at his side he died in bed on october 8 1793 at 56 years of age 198 199 by order of acting governor samuel adams the day of hancocks burial was a state holiday the lavish funeral was perhaps the grandest given to an american up to that time 200 201legacy despite his grand funeral hancock faded from popular memory after his death according to historian alfred f young boston celebrated only one hero in the halfcentury after the revolution george washington 202 as early as 1809 john adams lamented that hancock and samuel adams were almost buried in oblivion 203 in boston little effort was made to preserve hancocks historical legacy his house on beacon hill was torn down in 1863 after both the city of boston and the massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it 204 according to young the conservative new elite of massachusetts was not comfortable with a rich man who pledged his fortune to the cause of revolution 204 in 1876 with the centennial of american independence renewing popular interest in the revolution plaques honoring hancock were put up in boston 205 in 1896 a memorial column was finally erected over hancocks essentially unmarked grave in the granary burying ground 189no fulllength biography of hancock appeared until the 20th century a challenge facing hancock biographers is that compared to prominent founding fathers like jefferson and john adams hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians to use in interpreting his life as a result most depictions of hancock have relied on the voluminous writings of his political opponents who were often scathingly critical of him according to historian charles akers the chief victim of massachusetts historiography has been john hancock the most gifted and popular politician in the bay states long history he suffered the misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through the judgments of his detractors tory and whig 206hancocks famous signature on the stern of the destroyer uss john hancock hancocks most influential 20thcentury detractor was historian james truslow adams who wrote negative portraits of hancock in harpers magazine and the dictionary of american biography in the 1930s 207 adams argued that hancock was a fair presiding officer but had no great ability and was prominent only because of his inherited wealth 33 decades later historian donald proctor argued that adams had uncritically repeated the negative views of hancocks political opponents without doing any serious research 208 adams presented a series of disparaging incidents and anecdotes sometimes partially documented sometimes not documented at all which in sum leave one with a distinctly unfavorable impression of hancock 209 according to proctor adams evidently projected his own disapproval of 1920s businessmen onto hancock 208 and ended up misrepresenting several key events in hancocks career 210 writing in the 1970s proctor and akers called for scholars to evaluate hancock based on his merits rather than on the views of his critics since that time historians have usually presented a more favorable portrait of hancock while acknowledging that he was not an important writer political theorist or military leader 211many places and things in the united states have been named in honor of john hancock the u s navy has named vessels uss hancock and uss john hancock a world war ii liberty ship was also named in his honor 212 ten states have a hancock county named for him 213 other places named after him include hancock massachusetts hancock michigan hancock new hampshire hancock new york and mount hancock in new hampshire 213 john hancock university is named for him 214 as was the john hancock financial company founded in boston in 1862 it had no connection to hancocks own business ventures 215 the financial company passed on the name to the john hancock tower in boston the john hancock center in chicago as well as the john hancock student village at boston university 216see also biography portal massachusetts portal
