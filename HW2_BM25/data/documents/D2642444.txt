customer reviews d chapman20 out of 5 stars good material not so good writing march 31 2013format hardcover verified purchase if you want a good book on this subject read one of nassim talebs books he covers much of the same material and he writes better  after reading this book i am convinced that truly unexpected events are very rare what is mostly going on is that decision makers ignore obvious trends and fail to make contingency plans for lowprobability events then they say stuff like no one could have foreseen the attacks of 911 or it was not possible to anticipate the financial crisis tom clancy was writing books about 911type events 20 years before it happened and lots of people on wall street were talking about the financial crisis before the news media noticed meredith whitney comes to mind i think that the real problem in creating policy with regard to lowprobability events is that the public allows incompetent people to say golly gosh nobody could possibly have predicted that and get away with it anyway i cannot recommend this book on the grounds of poor writing style read more comment 5 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse eternal

hardcoverprediction is very hard yogi berra supposedly remarked especially about the future its hard to argue with that but even skeptics must admit that such events as the collapse of the soviet union the east asian economic crisis of the late 1990s or the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 came as a shock even to most experts yet for all its difficulty forecasting matters no one whether in government or business wants to be blindsided by oil shocks declining stocks environmental crises global pandemics natural disasters or any of the other nasty surprises that chance sometimes delivers can anything be done or must humanity merely watch the wheel of fortune spin hoping for the best according to this modest book something can be done even when specific predictions are hard if not impossible leaders can plan for surprise by developing scenarios boning up on history overcoming cognitive biases and learning to think about the types of significant disruptions that could arise while this uneven collection of articles is understandably short on conclusions get abstract predicts it will help you think about the unthinkable read more comment 5 people found this helpful was
