answer by col young confidence votes 40kecotourism is tourism involving travel to areas of natural or ecological interest typically under the guidance of a naturalist for the purpose of observing wildlife and learning about the environment advantages well established ecotourismhas minimal impact on the environmentbuilds awareness and respect for the local culture and environmentoffers positive experiences for allemploys and benefits local peopleeducates visitors by an onsite visit about the local political social and environmental issues money from the tourists go back into the conservation of the area a wildlife habitat for example is protected visitors carry new ideas back to influence their own environment disadvantages badly managed ecotourism if the site is badly managed there can be problems ofovercrowding constructionspollution of the habitatunlimited numbers of tourists the site becoming a honey pot area the site becomes overvisited traffic congestion erosion where cars park illegally footpath erosion soil loss tourists dont understand or care what ecotourism really is criticism as greenwashing where the environment is used as a bait to attract tourists examples include establishing a huge energy intensive hotel in a splendid jungle setting with no understanding of sustainable development or the correct provision for the disposal of waste and sewage etc examples include establishing a tourist resort which displaces the local people and illegally keeps endangered animals in cages to attract visitors natures sacred paradise if the site is correctly managed many of the disadvantages will not appear a one promise of ecotourism is it increases the monetary value of standing vs logged degraded extinct biological systems and thereby hopefully encourages the preservation of biological diversity the problem is that some kinds of ecotourism do not contribute much to the local economy meaning that they can enrich a few people while leaving others left out of the loop in this case for those left out there is still little incentive to engage in conservation so the fulfillment of the promise depends on the details of how an ecotourism business is established  whether its communityowned or owned by just a few individuals another promise of ecotourism is that it is supposed to bring people closer to nature and thus instill a greater desire to protect it it is very difficult to define ecotourism however so not all ecotourist activities do this equally well for example is offroading ecotourism is swimming with captive dolphins in an artificial lagoon ecotourism is trekking through a rainforest in a small group ecotourism they may all be but they probably impart different impressions of nature and the desire to preserve it but what can we do about this a ever heard of the term greenwash its the dissemination of misleading information by an organization to conceal its abuse of the environment in order to present a positive public image a term that is used to describe the actions of a company government or other organization which advertises positive environmental practices while acting in the opposite way they destroy forestland to build a hotel in middle of a jungle and sayecotourism you should know what true ecotourism is in the name of ecotourism most governments give us a greenwash78 people found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no
