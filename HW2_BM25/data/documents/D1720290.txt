accuracyhbrida · 1 decade ago0 0 comment if you want to make a 150 model of a full size object just divide the full size measurement by 50 if you want to model firetruck that is 40 feet long divide it by 50 40 feet  50  8 feet 8 feet x 12 inches per foot  96 inches you can change all measurements to inches first 40 ft x 12 inches per foot  480 in 480 in  50  96 inches you get the same answer either way tom s · 1 decade ago0 0 comment hi to help you to understand what a scale and a scale model is you need to know what it is a scale model is a representation or copy of an object that is larger or smaller than the actual size of the object being represented very often the scale model is smaller than the original and used as a guide to making the object in full size scale models are built or collected for many reasons professional modelmakers often create models for the below professions for engineers who require scale models to test the likely performance of a particular design at an early stage of development without incurring the full expense of a fullsized prototype for architects who require architectural models to evaluate and sell the look of a new construction before it is built for filmmakers who require scale models of objects or sets that cannot be built in full size for salesmen who require scale models to promote new products such as heavy equipment and automobiles and other vehicles hobbyists or amateur modelmakers make diecast models injection molded model railroads remote control vehicles wargaming and fantasy collectibles model ships and ships in bottles for their own enjoyment scale models can also be objects of art either being created by artists or being rediscovered and transformed into art by artists a scale is a way to express something that is too big or too small into something we can relate to in our measurement of things usually is represented in the english system as 1 by some unit of inches  or centimeter in the metric system  for our purposes the english inches is used here this is a reduction meaning the scale model is going to be smaller than the world object it represents however if it read 41 or 4 to 1 than it a enlargement meaning that the scale modeldrawing or plans is going to larger than the real world object it represent this is done to show detail or to help make something that is very small like a wristwatch gear okay with that out of the way so let see what this mean for example a 187 scale means that for every 1 inch on the ruler or on a scaled drawing plan or a 187 scale model means that it will be 87 inches on the real world object size for example a 1 87 model of a train water tower measures 2 inches high how big or high is the real world train tower be answer  our scale model train water tower is 2 inches so 2 87  174 inch of the real world train tower or 17412  145 feet or 14 feet 6 inch high a real world forest ranger lookout tower measures 150 feet high and you want make a 1174 scale model of it how big will the scale model of it be answer 150 feet 12  1800 inches  this is done to get into real world inches now our scale is 1 scale inch of model equals 174 real world inches so do the following  1800174  103448 inches or 10 and 516 inches so our scaled model of a forest ranger lookout tower will be 103448 inches tall let say a house is 40 by 60 feet long and we are are make a 112 scale model of it  how big will the scale model of the house be  okay we know the house is 40 feet by 60 feet so 4012  480 real world inches and 6012  720 real world inches and 48012  40 scaled inch or 40 inches on the ruler or 3 ft 4 inches 72012  60 scale inches or 60 inches on the ruler or 5 ft so our scale house will be 40 inches by 60 inches or 3 ft 4 inches by 5 ft notice something anytime you have a 112 scale the feet become the same as the inches and vice vera for the scaled object to the real world object for example a 3 foot rod will be 3 inches on the scale model of it or 2 inches on a scaled beam in 112 scale will be a 2 foot real world beam and that all there is to it  for other type of scale sizes visit this website httpenwikipediaorgwikiscalemodel for 150 scale first thing to do is convert any feet and inches measurements to real world inches for example a real world house measures 60 ft long by 49 and 12 ft wide what is the the 150 scale model measurement of it okay first things first 60  12  720 real world inches 4912  1212  588  6  594 real world inches now 72050  144 inches on the ruler or about 14 and 38 inches 59450  1188 inches or about 11 and 78 inches so the 150 scale model of the house will be 14 and 38 inches long by 11 and 78 inches wide okay now let say a 150 train model measure 125 inches long by 10 inches wide how big and wide is the real world train okay first thing to do is the following  125  50  625 inches 10  50  500 inches 625 12  5208333 or 52 ft and 1 inch long 50012  41666 or 41 ft and 8 inch wide and that all there is to to it hope this helpiroc70 · 1 decade ago0 0 comment mmmmm perhaps you should convert to metric move the decimal two places to the left and double then convert back to imperial feet and inches another option is to use a calculator like this to convert feet and inches to metric feet think 1 foot 6 inches is 15 metric feet then divide that by 50 and convert back httpwwwonlineconversioncomlengthcommonhtm joan j · 1 decade ago0 0 comment that is a good question i would convert them to metric and divide by 50 easiest way you will probably need some time of
