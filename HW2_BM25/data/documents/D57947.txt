become member the giant book recommended breeders chihuahua spaying  neutering what exactly is neutering when a male chihuahua is neutered this will be a procedure in which their testicles are removed the sac that holds the testicles will remain the insides of the sac will be removed there is usually swelling when this is first done so a dog owner may not see much of a difference as the sacs are swollen and still look full as time goes by this swelling will decrease and just small areas of skin will remain at the base of the chihuahuas penis your dog will be given anesthetics to sleep while this is done and stitches will be put on the area in which the cuts are made what is spaying when you have your chihuahua spayed to prevent any chances ofpregnancy  this is equivalent to a female woman having a hysterectomy in most cases both the ovaries and uterus will be removed some vets only remove the ovaries though it is recommended to have both removed to prevent cancer under anesthesia a small incision will be made in the abdomen the entire procedure takes between 20 to 40 minutes most dogs can leave the clinic the same day recommended age to have a chihuahua spayed some veterinarians recommend spaying before the first heat there are many benefits to spaying early when done before the first heat it greatly reduces the risk of mammary tumors studies have shown that if it is done after the 2nd cycle the risk for tumors increases if a female enters in and out of 4 seasons before the procedure she will have a 1 in 4 chance of this type of cancer for this reason the age to have a chihuahua spayed is between 8 weeks old and 3 months this breed may enter puberty anytime between the age of 4 months to 7 months therefore the 3 month mark is a safe age reasons for delaying this would be if the chihuahua is undersized and struggling with weight issues in those cases one may want to put this on hold to give the puppy time to gain enough weight to be better able to handle the anesthesia and the operation as a whole recommended age to have a chihuahua neutered the best age to neuter a chihuahua is between the age of 8 weeks and 6 months there are reasons for this limited studies have shown that neutering a male at a very young age 6 weeks old or earlier has shown to cause the legs to develop slightly longer than normal and cause slightly less muscular development additionally some studies have shown that early neutering caused some issue with the joints however it should be noted that this only affected large breed dogs and therefore this would not affect the chihuahua at all alternatively it is believed that is an owner waits until a dog is passed the 6 month mark behaviors are already established to such a degree that neutering a male may not bring about all of the benefits that one would normally expect for this reason it is recommended to neuter a male chihuahua during the 2 month to 6 month window in this way you are avoiding any possible concerns that are linked to very early age procedures while having it done before behavior patterns set in spay recovery for female dogs in good health  without unforeseen complications recovery is usually surprising fast a female chihuahua will recover in 7 to 10 days during the fist 24 hours the dog may be sleepy andor have a reluctance to eat due to possible nausea caused by the anesthesia there may be slight swelling and some redness it will be important to keep the incision site clean and check it once a day for the first week sometimes absorbable andor surgical glue is used to keep the incision closed for others skin stitches will be removed after 1 week for all dogs a checkup will be performed after 7 days if you see any redness or swelling around the stitches this should be reported to your dogs veterinarian right away as it may point to the beginning of an infection neuter recovery a male chihuahua will need 10 to 14 days for the skin sutures to heal during this time running and otherexercise should be avoided slow to moderate walking on leash can be done in addition the dog should not be given a bath since the area should remain dry to prevent bacterial infection after this 10 to 14 day period the stitches will be removed by the veterinarian while some dogs show signs of pain and discomfort many do extremely well and show very little signs of discomfort the veterinarian may send an owner home with prescribed pain medication or may ask the owner to call in if there appears to be a need pros of neutering there are good and valid reasons to neuter a male dog some people feel that it is wrong to take away a dogs reproductive urges however dogs do not mate for reasons of pleasure mating is a pure canine instinct and very often leads to unplanned puppies that may be difficult to take care of other important advantages are decreased aggression decreased roaming tendencies increased concentration  studies have shown that fixed dogs have a longer attention span applicable for house and command training and continued obedience throughout the dogs lifedue to not being constantly distracted by pheromone stimuli eliminates hernias reduced risk of perianla tumors tumors stimulated by testosterone that develop around the anusfewer prostrate issues  80 of unneutered male dogs develop prostate issues including enlargement cysts and infections pros of spaying there are excellent reasons to have your female chihuahua spayed the most important being the prevention of cancer the reasons to spay a chihuahua are eliminates the chance of ovarian cancer decreases the risk of mammary tumors particularly if done before the 1st heat it stops the heat cycle from occurring  which involves mood swings possible discomfort discharge increased shedding and of course being receptive to males and able to become pregnant eliminates the possibility of pregnancy  which for the chihuahua breed can be risky this is due to increased risk of needing a csection also hypocalcamia and eclampsia are two dangerous pregnancy related issues risks of spaying and neutering most veterinarians agree that the benefits outweigh the risks however there are some possible risks that every owner needs to consider known risks• urinary incontinence for females there is a known increased rate of urinary incontinence weak bladder with spayed females of female dogs that are spayed approximately 20 will develop incontinence sometime during their lifetimes incontinence can develop shortly after the procedure or many years later many vets suggest that waiting until the age of 3 months will cut down on the chance of later developing this possible risks  for these listed possible risks many veterinary experts admit that there is not enough supporting research to conclude if any of these risks are valid• cardiac tumors there is much debate on this topic at the time of this writing essentially just 1 study by ware and hopper  journal of veterinary internal medicine marchapril 1999 concluded that spaying and neutering increased the risk of cardiac tumors 4 times greater for females and only slighter greater for males• increased rate of other cancers again there is much debate about this some studies show that spaying and neutering prevent cancers others studies show it increases the risk specifically some studies have concluded that spayneutering increases osteosarcoma a type of bone cancer bladder and prostate cancer a 2002 study showed prostate cancer was 4 times more likely to develop with neutered males a 2007 study showed both were 3 to 4 times more likely and lymphoma studies show a very slight risk of increase for spayed females• delay in growthplate closure this refers to growth plates closing later than normal leading to possible increase of bone fractures it may also lead to a dog growing a bit larger than heshe would otherwise just as many vets agree than those that disagree it is generally accepted that growth plates may close a bit later 12 to 18 months later though this equals a difference of just millimeters seen on xrays myths about spaying and neutering1 neutering a dog will automatically make him depressed lose strength or decrease his activity level this is a myth studies have shown that male dogs do not act out any mating behavior unless they are moved by their own hormones in reaction to a female dog that is in heat when neutered it does not trouble a dog that he cannot mate as the urge is gone a male dog will behave normally in all regards of activity and in having endurance to exercise2 a dog will automatically become overweight andor lazy this is a myth when given the appropriate amount of food and exercised properly dogs will not have any noticeable changes in weight or activity how much it costs to have a chihuahua spayed or neutered the prices will vary however spaying is more expensive than neutering because it is a much more complicated surgery there are many clinics that will offer payment plans or low cost plans since reputable veterinarians understand the important health reasons to have this done through the aspca low cost programs may be accessible neutering a chihuahua can range from 40 to 75 usd via a reduced rate program and up to 150 without spaying a female chihuahua can range from 50 to 100 usd via a reduced cost program and up to 200 without reader qaquestion i have a female chihuahua puppy 8 months old and 425 lbs my veterinarian suggested waiting to spay her until she is a year old he said she might go into heat but he would rather wait until later what should i do everything i read says she should be spayed before she goes into heat owner kim chihuahua mo answer hi kim you are absolutely correct that your dog should be spayed before her first heat cycle unless she has health issues or is underweight at 425 lbs and 8 months old she is in the normal expected weight range the veterinary medical field advances at a rapid pace and the newest advice from all top veterinary experts is to spay before the first heat your dogs veterinarian may be old school in his thinking that he should wait until the 1 year mark as you most likely already know spaying a female dog greatly reduces the chances of mammary cancer and eliminates chances of developing ovarian and uterine cancer spaying before the 1st heat reduces those odds even more
