editthe best known approximations to π dating to before the common era were accurate to two decimal places this was improved upon in chinese mathematics in particular by the midfirst millennium to an accuracy of seven decimal places after this no further progress was made until the late medieval period some egyptologists 2 have claimed that the ancient egyptians used an approximation of π as 22⁄ 7 from as early as the old kingdom 3 this claim has met with skepticism 4 5babylonian mathematics usually approximated π to 3 sufficient for the architectural projects of the time notably also reflected in the description of solomons temple in the hebrew bible  6 the babylonians were aware that this was an approximation and one old babylonian mathematical tablet excavated near susa in 1936 dated to between the 19th and 17th centuries bce gives a better approximation of π as 2583125 about 05 percent below the exact value 7 8 9 10at about the same time the egyptian rhind mathematical papyrus dated to the second intermediate period c 1600 bce although stated to be a copy of an older middle kingdom text implies an approximation of π as 256⁄ 81 ≈ 316 accurate to 06 percent by calculating the area

known approximation accurate to three decimal places accuracy 2·10 −5  13the chinese mathematician liu hui in 263 ce computed π to between 3141 024 and 3142 708 by inscribing a 96gon and 192gon the average of these two values is 3141 866 accuracy 9·10 −5  he also suggested that 314 was a good enough approximation for practical purposes he has also frequently been credited with a later and more accurate result π ≈ 39271250  31416 accuracy 2·10 −6  although some scholars instead believe that this is due to the later 5thcentury chinese mathematician zu chongzhi 14 zu chongzhi is known to have computed π between 31415926 and 31415927 which was correct to seven decimal places he gave two other approximations of π π ≈ 227 and π ≈ 355113 the latter fraction is the best possible rational approximation of π using fewer than five decimal digits in the numerator and denominator zu chongzhis result surpasses the accuracy reached in hellenistic mathematics and would remain without

incommensurable irrational 17middle ages  editby the 5th century ce π was known to about seven digits in chinese mathematics and to about five in indian mathematics further progress was not made for nearly a millennium until the 14th century when indian mathematician and astronomer madhava of sangamagrama founder of the kerala school of astronomy and mathematics discovered the infinite series for π now known as the madhava–leibniz series 18 19 and gave two methods for computing the value of π one of these methods is to obtain a rapidly converging series by transforming the original infinite series of π by doing so he obtained the infinite series comparison of the convergence of two madhava series the one with √ 12 in dark blue and several historical infinite series for π s n is the approximation after taking n terms each subsequent subplot magnifies the shaded area horizontally by 10 times click for detailand used the first 21 terms to compute an approximation of π correct to 11 decimal places as 3141 592 653 59 the other method he used was to add a remainder term to the original series of π he used the remainder termin the infinite series expansion of π ⁄ 4 to improve the approximation of π to 13 decimal places of accuracy when n  75 jamshīd alkāshī kāshānī a persian astronomer and mathematician correctly computed 2 π to 9 sexagesimal digits in 1424 20 this figure is equivalent to 17 decimal digits aswhich equates to he achieved this level of accuracy by calculating the perimeter of a regular polygon with 3 × 2 28 sides 2116th to 19th centuries  editin the second half of the 16th century the french mathematician françois viète discovered an infinite product that converged on π known as viètes formula the germandutch mathematician ludolph van ceulen  circa 1600 computed the first 35 decimal places of π with a 2 62 gon he was so proud of this accomplishment that he had them inscribed on his tombstone 22in cyclometricus 1621 willebrord snellius demonstrated that the perimeter of the inscribed polygon converges on the circumference twice as fast as does the perimeter of the corresponding circumscribed polygon this was proved by christiaan huygens in 1654 snellius was able to obtain seven digits of π from a 96sided polygon 23in 1789 the slovene mathematician jurij vega calculated the first 140 decimal places for π of which the first 126 were correct 24 and held the world record for 52 years until 1841 when william rutherford calculated 208 decimal places of which the first 152 were correct vega improved john machin s formula from 1706 and his method is still mentioned today  citation neededthe magnitude of such precision 152 decimal places can be put into context by the fact that the circumference of the largest known object the observable universe can be calculated from its diameter 93 billion lightyears to a precision of less than one planck length at 16162 × 10 −35 meters the shortest unit of length that has real meaning using π expressed to just 62 decimal places the english amateur mathematician william shanks a man of independent means spent over 20 years calculating π to 707 decimal places this was accomplished in 1873 with the first 527 places correct he would calculate new digits all morning and would then spend all afternoon checking his mornings work this was the longest expansion of π until the advent of the electronic digital computer threequarters of a century later  citation needed20th and 21st centuries  editmain article chronology of computation of π § the age of electronic computers from 1949 onwardsin 1910 the indian mathematician srinivasa ramanujan found several rapidly converging infinite series of π includingwhich computes a further eight decimal places of π with each term in the series his series are now the basis for the fastest algorithms currently used to calculate π see also ramanujan–sato series from the mid20th century onwards all calculations of π have been done with the help of calculators or computers in 1944 d f ferguson with the aid of a mechanical desk calculator found that william shanks had made a mistake in the 528th decimal place and that all succeeding digits were incorrect in the early years of the computer an expansion of π to 100 000 decimal places 25 78 was computed by maryland mathematician daniel shanks no relation to the abovementioned william shanks and his team at the united states naval research laboratory in washington d c in 1961 shanks and his team used two different power series for calculating the digits of π for one it was known that any error would produce a value slightly high and for the other it was known that any error would produce a value slightly low and hence as long as the two series produced the same digits there was a very high confidence that they were correct the first 100265 digits of π were published in 1962 25 80–99 the authors outlined what would be needed to calculate π to 1 million decimal places and concluded that the task was beyond that days technology but would be possible in five to seven years 25 78in 1989 the chudnovsky brothers correctly computed π to over 1 billion decimal places on the supercomputer ibm 3090 using the following variation of ramanujans infinite series of π in 1999 yasumasa kanada and his team at the university of tokyo correctly computed π to over 200 billion decimal places on the supercomputer hitachi sr8000mpp 128 nodes using another variation of ramanujans infinite series of π in october 2005 they claimed to have calculated it to 124 trillion places 26records since then have all been accomplished on personal computers using the chudnovsky algorithm in 2009 fabrice bellard computed just under 27 trillion digits and from 2010 onward all records have been set using alexander yees ycruncher software as of november 2016 the record stands at 22459157718361  π e ×10 12 digits 27 the limitation on further expansion is primarily storage space for the computation 28in november 2002 yasumasa kanada and a team of 9 others used the hitachi sr8000 a 64node supercomputer with 1 terabyte of main memory to calculate π to roughly 124 trillion digits in around 600 hours in august 2009 a japanese supercomputer called the t2k open supercomputer more than doubled the previous record by calculating π to roughly 26 trillion digits in approximately 73 hours and 36 minutes in december 2009 fabrice bellard used a home computer to compute 27 trillion decimal digits of π calculations were performed in base 2 binary then the result was converted to base 10 decimal the calculation conversion and verification steps took a total of 131 days 29in august 2010 shigeru kondo used alexander yees ycruncher to calculate 5 trillion digits of π this was the world record for any type of calculation but significantly it was performed on a home computer built by kondo 30 the calculation was done between 4 may and 3 august with the primary and secondary verifications taking 64 and 66 hours respectively 31in october 2011 shigeru kondo broke his own record by computing ten trillion 10 13 and fifty digits using the same method but with better hardware 32 33in december 2013 kondo broke his own record for a second time when he computed 121 trillion digits of π 34in october 2014 sandon van ness going by the pseudonym houkouonchi used

interruptions 105 days to complete 36practical approximations  editdepending on the purpose of a calculation π can be approximated by using fractions for ease of calculation the most notable such approximations are 22⁄ 7 accuracy 2·10 −4 and 355⁄ 113 accuracy 8·10 −8  nonmathematical definitions of π  editof some notability are legal or historical texts purportedly defining π  to have some rational value notably the  indiana pi bill  of 1897 which stated the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as fivefourths to four which would imply  π  32  and a passage in the hebrew bible that implies that imputed biblical value  editsee also molten sea it is sometimes claimed that the hebrew bible implies that  π equals three based on a passage in 1 kings 723 and 2 chronicles 42 giving measurements for the round basin located in front of the temple in jerusalem as having a diameter of 10 cubits and a circumference of 30 cubits the issue is discussed in the talmud and in rabbinic literature 37 among the many explanations and comments are these rabbi nehemiah explained this in his mishnat hamiddot the earliest known hebrew text on geometry ca 150 ce by saying that the diameter was measured from the outside rim while the circumference was measured along the inner rim this interpretation implies a brim about 0225 cubit or assuming an 18inch cubit some 4 inches or one and a third  handbreadths  thick cf nkjv and nkjv  maimonides states ca 1168 ce that π can only be known approximately so the value 3 was given as accurate enough for religious purposes this is taken by some 38 as the earliest assertion that π is irrational another rabbinical explanation  by whom  year needed invokes gematria in nkjv the word translated measuring line appears in the hebrew text spelled qwh קַוה but elsewhere the word is most usually spelled qw קַו the ratio of the numerical values of these hebrew spellings is 111⁄ 106 if the putative value of 3 is multiplied by this ratio one obtains 333⁄ 106  3141509433 – giving 5 correct digits which is within 110000 of the true value of π for this to work it must be assumed that the measuring line is different for the diameter and circumference there is still some debate on this passage in biblical scholarship  not in citation given 39 40 many reconstructions of the basin show a wider brim or flared lip extending outward from the bowl itself by several inches to match the description given in nkjv 41 in the succeeding verses the rim is described as a handbreadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup like the flower of a lily it received and held three thousand baths nkjv which suggests a shape that can be encompassed with a string shorter than the total length of the brim eg a lilium flower or a teacup indiana bill  editthe socalled  indiana pi bill  of 1897 has often been characterized as an attempt to legislate the value of pi rather the bill dealt with a purported solution to the problem of geometrically  squaring the circle  42the bill was nearly passed by the indiana general assembly in the u s and has been claimed to imply a number of different values for π although the closest it comes to explicitly asserting one is the wording the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as fivefourths to four which would make π  165  32 a discrepancy of nearly 2 percent a mathematics professor who happened to be present the day the bill was brought up for consideration in the senate after it had passed in the house helped to stop the passage of the bill on its second reading after which the assembly thoroughly ridiculed it before tabling it indefinitely development of efficient formulae  editmain article list of formulae involving πpolygon approximation to a circle  editarchimedes in his measurement of a circle created the first algorithm for the calculation of π based on the idea that the perimeter of any convex polygon inscribed in a circle is less than the circumference of the circle which in turn is less than the perimeter of any circumscribed polygon he started with inscribed and circumscribed regular hexagons whose perimeters are readily determined he then shows how to calculate the perimeters of regular polygons of twice as many sides that are inscribed and circumscribed about the same circle this is a recursive procedure which would be described today as follows let p k and p k denote the perimeters of regular polygons of k sides that are inscribed and circumscribed about the same circle respectively thenarchimedes uses this to successively compute p 12 p 12 p 24 p 24 p 48 p 48 p 96 and p 96 43 using these last values he obtains it is not known why archimedes stopped at a 96sided polygon it only takes patience to extend the computations heron reports in his metrica about 60 ce that archimedes continued the computation in a now lost book but then attributes an incorrect value to him 44archimedes uses no trigonometry in this computation and the difficulty in applying the method lies in obtaining good approximations for the square roots that are involved trigonometry in the form of a table of chord lengths in a circle was probably used by claudius ptolemy of alexandria to obtain the value of π given in the almagest circa 150 ce 45advances in the approximation of π when the methods are known were made by increasing the number of sides of the polygons used in the computation a trigonometric improvement by willebrord snell 1621 obtains better bounds from a pair of bounds gotten from the polygon method thus more accurate results were obtained from polygons with fewer sides 46viètes formula published by françois viète in 1593 was derived by viète using a closely related polygonal method but with areas rather than perimeters of polygons whose numbers of sides are powers of two 47the last major attempt to compute π by this method was carried out by grienberger in 1630 who calculated 39 decimal places of π using snells refinement 46machinlike formula  editfor fast calculations one may use formulae such as machinstogether with the taylor series expansion of the function arctan  x  this formula is most easily verified using polar coordinates of complex numbers producing note also that  x y   239 13 2  is a solution to the pell equation x 2 −2 y 2  −1 formulae of this kind are known as machinlike formulae machins particular formula was used well into the computer era for calculating record numbers of digits of π 25 but more recently other similar formulae have been used as well for instance shanks and his team used the following machinlike formula in 1961 to compute the first 100000 digits of π 25and they used another machinlike formulaas a check the record as of december 2002 by

following machinlike formulæ were used for this k takano 1982  f c w störmer 1896 these approximations have so many digits that they are no longer of any practical use except for testing new supercomputers 49 properties like the potential normality of π will always depend on the infinite string of digits on the end not on any finite computation miscellaneous approximations  edithistorically base 60 was used for calculations in this base π can be approximated to eight decimal significant figures with the number 382944 60 which is the next sexagesimal digit is 0 causing truncation here to yield a relatively good approximation in addition the following expressions can be used to estimate πaccurate to three digitsaccurate to three digits karl popper conjectured that plato knew this expression that he believed it to be exactly π and that this is responsible for some of platos confidence in the omnicompetence of mathematical geometry—and platos repeated discussion of special right triangles that are either isosceles or halves of equilateral trianglesaccurate to four digits 50accurate to four digits or five significant figures 51an approximation by ramanujan

quotient of a modular form namely the dedekind eta function and where the argument involves the discriminant d  3502 has h − d  16 the continued fraction representation of π can be used to generate successive best rational approximations these approximations are the best possible rational approximations of π relative to the size of their denominators here is a list of the first thirteen of these 55 56of all of these is the only fraction in this sequence that gives more exact digits of π ie 7 than the number of digits needed to approximate it ie 6 the accuracy can be improved by using other fractions with larger numerators and denominators but for most such fractions more digits are required in the approximation than correct significant figures achieved in the result 57summing a circles area  editnumerical approximation of π as points are randomly scattered inside the unit square some fall within the unit circle the fraction of points inside the circle approaches π4 as points are added pi can be obtained from a circle if its radius and area are known using the relationship if a circle with radius r is drawn with its center at the point 0 0 any point whose distance from the origin is less than r will fall inside the circle the pythagorean theorem gives the distance from any point  x  y to the center mathematical graph paper is formed by imagining a 1×1 square centered around each cell  x  y  where x and y are integers between − r and r squares whose center resides inside or exactly on the border of the circle can then be counted by testing whether for each cell  x  y the total number of cells satisfying that condition thus approximates the area of the circle which then can be used to calculate an approximation of π closer approximations can be produced by using larger values of r mathematically this formula can be written  1r0r in other words begin by choosing a value for r consider all cells  x  y in which both x and y are integers between − r and r starting at 0 add 1 for each cell whose distance to the origin 00 is less than or equal to r when finished divide the sum representing the area of a circle of radius r by r 2 to find the approximation

several of them pi fast by xavier gourdon was the fastest program for microsoft windows in 2003 according to its author it can compute one million digits in 35 seconds on a 24 ghz pentium 4 63 pi fast can also compute other irrational numbers like e and √ 2 it can also work at lesser efficiency with very little memory down to a few tens of megabytes to compute well over a billion 10 9 digits this tool is a popular benchmark in the overclocking community pi fast 44 is available from stus pi page pi fast 43 is available from gourdons page quick pi by steve pagliarulo for windows is faster than pi fast for runs of under 400 million digits version 45 is available on stus pi page below like pi fast quick pi can also compute other irrational numbers like e √ 2 and √ 3 the software may be obtained from the pihacks yahoo forum or from stus pi page super pi by kanada laboratory 64 in the university of tokyo is the program for microsoft windows for runs from 16000 to 33550000 digits it can compute one million digits in 40 minutes two million digits in 90 minutes and four million digits in 220 minutes on a pentium 90 mhz super pi version 11 is available from super pi 11 page notes
