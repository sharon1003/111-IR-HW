wish to set up a coffincasketdomes manufacturing venture i have a registered company known as full stop funeral assist supposed to be based in johannesburg as the main office for the past six months i have been unsuccessful in sourcing funding from the local financial institutions despite the adequate collateral being offered one of the reasons for not willing to finance this venture has been viewed as unprofitable i am an ex banker of more than 25 years in banking i differ with that reason totally people are dying all over the world every other second just like births take place every other second this is a business which would never be affected by an economic downturn my reason for writing my story is to seek funding or some advice on how i can source the required funding i disagree with those who say that it is not a profitable venture i do not understand from which school of banking they have come from i turn to believe that apart from the unrealistic stringent lending criteria there is more to it which i wish to refrain from mentioning outright in the light of the funding required amount and the excessive collateral being offered leehollan wevers said on december
