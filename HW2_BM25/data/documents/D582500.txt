masonry blocks unfired clay masonry blocks insulated concrete form icf masonry blocks concrete blocks though history records the use of concrete blocks by the romans greeks and even egyptians some of the twotonne blocks that make up the pyramids are believed to be a primitive form of concrete moderntype blocks were first cast albeit in modest quantities in around the middle of the nineteenth century in 1827 joseph aspidin devised the basic mix that we would still recognise today the mix cast in wooden moulds consisted of powdered limestone and clay mixed with water in the early twentieth century block manufacturing became an established industry the earliest blocks manufactured in the uk were made using cement mixed with locally available aggregates – often waste products of industrial processes such as breeze cinders retrieved from gasworks and coke ovens – from the french ‘braise’ meaning ‘hot coals’ and clinker blast furnace slag these early lightweight blocks were popular as internal partition walls because of their easeofuse and cheapness but it was only as a result of the development of cavity walls and the advent of mass housing programmes of the postwar years that the industry dramatically expanded cavity walling became adopted in the 1920s led by housebuilders costains because although slightly more expensive to build the perceived advantage was that the technique successfully overcame the problem of water penetration that traditionally plagued solid masonry wall construction early cavity walls used brick in both leaves but as the economics of using a cheaper substitute became apparent concrete block largely replaced brick as the inner leaf from the 1950s onwards today the immense versatility of concrete blocks is demonstrated in their use throughout a building from its foundation walls through cavity walls monolithic walls partition walls separating walls and as a component of ‘beam and block’ flooring concrete blocks’ advantageous properties are reflected in their myriad of variations of strength insulating and soundreducing properties types of concrete block dense lightweight aerateddense aggregate block in use from the 1940s onwards dense aggregate blocks are very much the workhorse of the construction industry their distinctive properties of durability and strength make them an ideal and costeffect solution for all types of loadbearing walls dense aggregate concrete blocks are manufactured from cement sand and aggregates • typical thermal conductivity 070 – 128 wm kdurable reusable particularly where lime mortars have been used high thermal mass high strength products available with recycled aggregate use of virgin aggregates and sand causes land or marine degradation and resource depletion nonrenewable materials use of cement contributes to global warming poor insulating properties lightweight aggregate block produced in greater volume but less strong than dense blocks lightweight blocks are used in both internal and external walls where loading is slightly more restricted or as infill blocks in beam and block flooring their main advantage over dense aggregate blocks comes from a combination of higher insulating properties and a lighter unit weight the lighter block enables time and material cost savings through easier handling and larger units units the same size as other block types lightweight blocks are manufactured from cement together with one of a variety of natural or manmade expanded aggregates including granulated  foamed blastfurnace slag expanded clay or shale furnace bottom ash fba pulverised fuel ash pfa or the less common pumice a volcanic material  the density of the aggregate is generally proportional to the strength of the block  so for example ‘superlightweight’ aggregates such as expanded clay and pumice used for their excellent thermal performance feature a relatively low compressive strength • typical thermal conductivity 025  060 wm kmoderate thermal mass but higher than aircrete makes use of secondary aggregates good insulating properties durable reusable particularly where lime mortar has been used good workability products available with recycled aggregate use of virgin clay causes land degradation and resource depletion high embodied energy involved in the production of some aggregates use of cement contributes to global warming aerated concrete or ‘aircrete’ block first produced in sweden in 1923 and used in the uk since the 1960s when they were known as ‘cellular’ or ‘gas’ concrete blocks aerated concrete or ‘aircrete’ blocks are the lightest of the family of concrete blocks aerated blocks are distinguished by their capacity to perform a dual structural  insulation function though limited to structural applications in lowrise construction and partitions as well as a component of curtain walling in higher buildings aerated blocks can perform a similar range of functions as dense and lightweight blocks the blocks are made from cement lime sand pulverised fuel ash pfa and water pfa is mixed with sand and water to form a slurry this is then heated before being mixed with cement lime and a small amount of aluminium sulphate powder the aluminium reacts with the lime to form bubbles of hydrogen as the mixture expands into a ‘cake’ the hydrogen is diffused and replaced by air when the mixture is partially set it is cut to block size and transferred to an autoclave where it is high pressure steamcured to develop strength • typical thermal conductivity 009  020 wm kmoderate thermal mass uses industrial waste pfa as a prime constituent very good insulating properties based on volume aerated blocks contain around 25 less embodied energy than other concrete blocks good workability lighter weight saves energy in transportation reasonable sound absorption properties reusable if dismantled carefully particularly if lime mortar has been used nonrenewable materials prone to impact damage use of aluminium adds embodied carbon use of cement contributes to global warming the environmental impact of concrete blocks global warming the major environmental impact caused in the manufacturing of concrete blocks derives from the use of cement the manufacture of cement is responsible for between 5 – 7 depending on source of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions 40 of the total cement emissions are due to the use of fossil fuels usually coal to heat the cement kilns to 1500°c and the remaining 60 is from the transformation of limestone at high temperatures ‘decarbonation’ aggregates extraction most aggregates derive from landbased sources though approximately 20 of sand and gravel is dredged from the seabed the quarrying processing and transportation of land aggregates contributes to the depletion of resources degradation of the landscape and the consumption of water and energy marine extraction continues to provoke debate over the longterm effect of offshore dredging particularly on coastal erosion fisheries and other marine life mitigation of environmental impact cement substitutes• the most effective alternative to cement is ground granulated blast furnace slag ggbs which can typically replace up to 50 of portland cement in a concrete mix • pulverised fuel ash pfa is now routinely used as a cement substitute – 15 being the optimum in maintaining the compressive strength of aggregate blocks and 50 in aerated blocks recycled aggregates ra and recycled concrete aggregates rcaproducts are available on the market that incorporate recycled aggregate to replace virgin quarried aggregate driven in part by the aggregates levy introduced in 2002 to reduce the environmental impact of quarrying the concrete industry is looking instead to utilising some of the 30m tonnes per year of construction and demolition wastes cdw produced in the uk a specific type of ra is recycled concrete aggregate rca the performance of which is superior to recycled aggregates generally and enables replacement of up 20 of virgin aggregates in concrete secondary aggregates secondary aggregates are the byproducts of other extraction or industrial operations secondary aggregates including such like as colliery spoil china clay waste foundry sands and blast furnace slags when used in concrete reduce the demand on natural aggregates whilst simultaneously diverting significant quantities of waste from landfill alternatives to concrete honeycomb clay block honeycomb clay blocks often known as ‘ziegel’ have been a common component of wall construction in europe for many years the blocks can be used both as the inner leaf in cavity walls or as a single skin for external loadbearing construction as well as their use in walls clay honeycomb blocks can be used in many of the same applications as concrete blocks the blocks are formed with a cellular structure of vertical perforations that reduces the material quantity as well as weight whilst providing an increased thermal performance
