significant drug interactions with celecoxib table 3 clinically significant drug interactions with celecoxib drugs that interfere with hemostasis clinical impact celecoxib and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding the concomitant use of celecoxib and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis casecontrol and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an nsaid may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an nsaid alone intervention monitor patients with concomitant use of celebrex with anticoagulants eg warfarin antiplatelet agents eg aspirin selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snris for signs of bleeding see warnings and precautions  aspirin clinical impact controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of nsaids and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of nsaids alone in a clinical study the concomitant use of an nsaid and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of gi adverse reactions as compared to use of the nsaid alone see warnings and precautions  in two studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with osteoarthritis and established heart disease respectively celecoxib 200400 mg daily has demonstrated a lack of interference with the cardioprotective antiplatelet effect of aspirin 100325 mg intervention concomitant use of celebrex and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding see warnings and precautions  celebrex is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection ace inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and betablockers clinical impact nsaids may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers arbs or betablockers including propranolol in patients who are elderly volumedepleted including those on diuretic therapy or have renal impairment coadministration of an nsaid with ace inhibitors or arbs may result in deterioration of renal function including possible acute renal failure these effects are usually reversible intervention during concomitant use of celebrex and aceinhibitors arbs or betablockers monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained during concomitant use of celebrex and aceinhibitors or arbs in patients who are elderly volumedepleted or have impaired renal function monitor for signs of worsening renal function see warnings and precautions  when these drugs are administered concomitantly  patients should be adequately hydrated assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter diuretics clinical impact clinical studies as well as postmarketing observations showed that nsaids reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics eg furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients this effect has been attributed to the nsaid inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis intervention during concomitant use of celebrex with diuretics observe patients for signs of worsening renal function in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects see warnings and precautions  digoxin clinical impact the concomitant use of celecoxib with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the halflife of digoxin intervention during concomitant use of celebrex and digoxin monitor serum digoxin levels lithium clinical impact nsaids have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance the mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15 and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20 this effect has been attributed to nsaid inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis intervention during concomitant use of celebrex and lithium monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity methotrexate clinical impact concomitant use of nsaids and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity eg neutropenia thrombocytopenia renal dysfunction celebrex has no effect on methotrexate pharmacokinetics intervention during concomitant use of celebrex and methotrexate monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity cyclosporine clinical impact concomitant use of celebrex and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporines nephrotoxicity intervention during concomitant use of celebrex and cyclosporine monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function nsaids and salicylates clinical impact concomitant use of celecoxib with other nsaids or salicylates eg diflunisal salsalate increases the risk of gi toxicity with little or no increase in efficacy see warnings and precautions  intervention the concomitant use of celecoxib with other nsaids or salicylates is not recommended pemetrexed clinical impact concomitant use of celebrex and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexedassociated myelosuppression renal and gi toxicity see the pemetrexed prescribing information intervention during concomitant use of celebrex and pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 m lmin monitor for myelosuppression renal and gi toxicity nsaids with short elimination halflives eg diclofenac indomethacin should be avoided for a period of two days before the day of and two days following administration of pemetrexed in the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and nsaids with longer halflives eg meloxicam nabumetone patients taking these nsaids should interrupt dosing for at least five days before the day of and two days following pemetrexed administration cyp2c9 inhibitors or inducers clinical impact celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome p450 cyp 2c9 in the liver coadministration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit cyp2c9 eg fluconazole may enhance the exposure and toxicity of celecoxib whereas coadministration with cyp2c9 inducers eg rifampin may lead to compromised efficacy of celecoxib intervention evaluate each patients medical history when consideration is given to prescribing celecoxib a dosage adjustment may be warranted when celecoxib is administered with cyp2c9 inhibitors or inducers see clinical pharmacology  cyp2d6 substrates clinical impact in vitro studies indicate that celecoxib although not a substrate is an inhibitor of cyp2d6 therefore there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by cyp2d6 eg atomoxetine and celecoxib may enhance the exposure and toxicity of these drugs intervention evaluate each patients medical history when consideration is given to prescribing celecoxib a dosage adjustment may be warranted when celecoxib is administered with cyp2d6 substrates see clinical pharmacology  corticosteroids clinical impact concomitant use of corticosteroids with celebrex may increase the risk of gi ulceration or bleeding intervention monitor patients with concomitant use of celebrex with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding see warnings and precautions  warnings  precautions rheumatoid arthritis slideshow take the ra quiz jointfriendly exercises slideshow warningsincluded as part of the precautions section precautionscardiovascular thrombotic events clinical trials of several cox2 selective and nonselective nsaids of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular cv thrombotic events including myocardial infarction mi and stroke which can be fatal based on available data it is unclear that the risk for cv thrombotic events is similar for all nsaids the relative increase in serious cv thrombotic events over baseline conferred by nsaid use appears to be similar in those with and without known cv disease or risk factors for cv disease however patients with known cv disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious cv thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment the increase in cv thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses in the apc  adenoma prevention with celecoxib trial the hazard ratio for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death mi or stroke was 34 95 ci 14 – 85 for celebrex 400 mg twice daily and 28 95 ci 11 – 72 with celebrex 200 mg twice daily compared to placebo cumulative rates for this composite endpoint over 3 years were 30 20671 subjects and 25 17685 subjects respectively compared to 09 6679 subjects with placebo treatment the increases in both celecoxib dose groups versus placebotreated patients were mainly due to an increased incidence of myocardial infarction see clinical studies  to minimize the potential risk for an adverse cv event in nsaidtreated patients use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course even in the absence of previous cv symptoms patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cv events and the steps to take if they occur there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events associated with nsaid use the concurrent use of aspirin and an nsaid such as celecoxib increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal  gi events see gastrointestinal bleeding ulceration and perforation  status post coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery two large controlled clinical trials of a cox2 selective nsaid for the treatment of pain in the first 1014 days following cabg surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke nsaids are contraindicated in the setting of cabg see contraindications  postmi patients observational studies conducted in the danish national registry have demonstrated that patients treated with nsaids in the postmi period were at increased risk of reinfarction cvrelated death and allcause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment in this same cohort the incidence of death in the first year postmi was 20 per 100 person years in nsaidtreated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in nonnsaid exposed patients although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year postmi the increased relative risk of death in nsaid users persisted over at least the next four years of followup avoid the use of celebrex in patients with a recent mi unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent cv thrombotic events if celebrex is used in patients with a recent mi monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia gastrointestinal bleeding ulceration and perforation nsaids including celecoxib cause serious gastrointestinal gi adverse events including inflammation bleeding ulceration and perforation of the esophagus stomach small intestine or large intestine which can be fatal these serious adverse events can occur at any time with or without warning symptoms in patients treated with celebrex only one in five patients who develop a serious upper gi adverse event on nsaid therapy is symptomatic upper gi ulcers gross bleeding or perforation caused by nsaids occurred in approximately 1 of patients treated for 36 months and in about 24 of patients treated for one year however even shortterm nsaid therapy is not without risk risk factors for gi bleeding ulceration and perforation patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease andor gi bleeding who used nsaids had a greater than 10fold increased risk for developing a gi bleed compared to patients without these risk factors other factors that increase the risk of gi bleeding in patients treated with nsaids include longer duration of nsaid therapy concomitant use of oral corticosteroids aspirin anticoagulants or selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors ssris smoking use of alcohol older age and poor general health status most postmarketing reports of fatal gi events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients additionally patients with advanced liver disease andor coagulopathy are at increased risk for gi bleeding complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 078 at nine months for all patients in the class trial and 219 for the subgroup on lowdose asa patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 140 at nine months 306 when also taking asa see clinical studies  strategies to minimize the gi risks in nsaidtreated patients use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration avoid administration of more than one nsaid at a time avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding for such patients as well as those with active gi bleeding consider alternate therapies other than nsaids remain alert for signs and symptoms of gi ulceration and bleeding during nsaid therapy if a serious gi adverse event is suspected promptly initiate evaluation and treatment and discontinue celebrex until a serious gi adverse event is ruled out in the setting of concomitant use of lowdose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis monitor patients more closely for evidence of gi bleeding see drug interactions  hepatotoxicity elevations of alt or ast three or more times the upper limit of normal uln have been reported in approximately 1 of nsaidtreated patients in clinical trials in addition rare sometimes fatal cases of severe hepatic injury including fulminant hepatitis liver necrosis and hepatic failure have been reported elevations of alt or ast less than three times uln may occur in up to 15 of patients treated with nsaids including celecoxib in controlled clinical trials of celebrex the incidence of borderline elevations greater than or equal to 12 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal of liver associated enzymes was 6 for celebrex and 5 for placebo and approximately 02 of patients taking celebrex and 03 of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of alt and ast inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity eg nausea fatigue lethargy diarrhea pruritus jaundice  right upper quadrant tenderness and “flulike” symptoms if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if systemic manifestations occur eg eosinophilia rash etc  discontinue celebrex immediately and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient hypertension nsaids including celebrex can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cv events patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors thiazide diuretics or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking nsaids see drug interactions  the rates of hypertension from the class trial in the celebrex ibuprofen and diclofenactreated patients were 24 42 and 25 respectively see clinical studies  monitor blood pressure  bp during the initiation of nsaid treatment and throughout the course of therapy heart failure and edema the coxib and traditional nsaid trialists collaboration metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately twofold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in cox2 selectivetreated patients and nonselective nsaidtreated patients compared to placebotreated patients in a danish national registry study of patients with heart failure nsaid use increased the risk of mi hospitalization for heart failure and death additionally fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with nsaids use of celecoxib may blunt the cv effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions eg diuretics ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs see drug interactions  in the class study see clinical studies  the kaplanmeier cumulative rates at 9 months of peripheral edema in patients on celebrex 400 mg twice daily 4fold and 2fold the recommended oa and ra doses respectively ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily and diclofenac 75 mg twice daily were 45 69 and 47 respectively avoid the use of celebrex in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure if celebrex is used in patients with severe heart failure monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure renal toxicity and hyperkalemia renal toxicity longterm administration of nsaids has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion in these patients administration of an nsaid may cause a dosedependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and secondarily in renal blood flow which may precipitate overt renal decompensation patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function dehydration hypovolemia heart failure liver dysfunction those taking diuretics aceinhibitors or the arbs and the elderly discontinuation of nsaid therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state no

inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis primarily via inhibition of cyclooxygenase2  cox2  celecoxib is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro celecoxib concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation since celecoxib is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues pharmacodynamics platelets in clinical trials using normal volunteers celebrex at single doses up to 800 mg and multiple doses of 600 mg twice daily for up to 7 days duration higher than recommended therapeutic doses had no effect on reduction of platelet aggregation or increase in bleeding time because of its lack of platelet effects celebrex is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis it is not known if there are any effects of celebrex on platelets that may contribute to the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events associated with the use of celebrex fluid retention inhibition of pge2 synthesis may lead to sodium and water retention through increased reabsorption in the renal medullary thick ascending loop of henle and perhaps other segments of the distal nephron in the collecting ducts pge2 appears to inhibit water reabsorption by counteracting the action of antidiuretic hormone pharmacokinetics celecoxib exhibits doseproportional increase in exposure after oral administration up to 200 mg twice daily and less than proportional increase at hgher doses it has extensive distribution and high protein binding it is primarily metabolized by cyp2c9 with a halflife of approximately 11 hours absorption peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hrs after an oral dose under fasting conditions both peak plasma levels cmax and area under the curve auc are roughly doseproportional up to 200 mg twice daily at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in cmax and auc see food effects  absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted

10 to 20 under fasting conditions at doses above 200 mg there is less than a proportional increase in cmax and auc which is thought to be due to the low solubility of the drug in aqueous media coadministration of celebrex with an aluminum and magnesiumcontaining antacids resulted in a reduction in plasma celecoxib concentrations with a decrease of 37 in cmax and 10 in auc celebrex at doses up to 200 mg twice daily can be administered without regard to timing of meals higher doses 400 mg twice daily should be administered with food to improve absorption in healthy adult volunteers the overall systemic exposure auc of celecoxib was equivalent when celecoxib was administered as intact capsule or capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce there were no significant alterations in cmax tmax or t½ after administration of capsule contents on applesauce see dosage and administration  distribution in healthy subjects celecoxib is highly protein bound 97 within the clinical dose range in vitro studies indicate that celecoxib binds primarily to albumin and to a lesser extent α1acid glycoprotein the apparent volume of distribution at steady state vssf is approximately 400 l suggesting extensive distribution into the tissues celecoxib is not preferentially bound to red blood cells elimination metabolism celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via cyp2c9 three metabolites a primary alcohol the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate have been identified in human plasma these metabolites are inactive as cox1 or cox2 inhibitors excretion celecoxib is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism with little   3 unchanged drug recovered in the urine and feces following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug approximately 57 of the dose was excreted in the feces and 27 was excreted into the urine the primary metabolite in both urine and feces was the carboxylic acid metabolite 73 of dose with low amounts of the glucuronide also appearing in the urine it appears that the low solubility of the drug prolongs the absorption process making terminal halflife t½ determinations more variable the effective halflife is approximately 11 hours under fasted conditions the apparent plasma clearance clf is about 500 m lmin specific populations geriatric at steady state elderly subjects over 65 years old had a 40 higher cmax and a 50 higher auc compared to the young subjects in elderly females celecoxib cmax and auc are higher than those for elderly males but these increases are predominantly due to lower body weight in elderly females dose adjustment in the elderly is not generally necessary however for patients of less than 50 kg in body weight initiate therapy at the lowest recommended dose see dosage and administration and use in specific populations  pediatric the steady state pharmacokinetics of celecoxib administered as an investigational oral suspension was evaluated in 152 jra patients 2 years to 17 years of age weighing ≥ 10 kg with pauciarticular or polyarticular course jra and in patients with systemic onset jra population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the oral clearance unadjusted for body weight of celecoxib increases less than proportionally to increasing weight with 10 kg and 25 kg patients predicted to have 40 and 24 lower clearance respectively compared with a 70 kg adult ra patient twicedaily administration of 50 mg capsules to jra patients weighing ≥ 12 to ≤ 25 kg and 100 mg capsules to jra patients weighing  25 kg should achieve plasma concentrations similar to those observed

also evaluated in the class trial kaplanmeier cumulative rates for investigatorreported serious cardiovascular thromboembolic adverse events including mi pulmonary embolism deep venous thrombosis unstable angina  transient ischemic attacks and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents demonstrated no differences between the celebrex diclofenac or ibuprofen treatment groups the cumulative rates in all patients at nine months for celebrex diclofenac and ibuprofen were 12 14 and 11 respectively the cumulative rates in nonasa users at nine months in each of the three treatment groups were less than 1 the cumulative rates for myocardial infarction in nonasa users at nine months in each of the three treatment groups were less than 02 there was no placebo group in the class trial which limits the ability to determine whether the three drugs tested had no increased risk of cv events or if they all increased the risk to a similar degree endoscopic studies the correlation between findings of shortterm endoscopic studies with celebrex and the relative incidence of clinically significant serious upper gi events with longterm use has not been established serious clinically significant upper gi bleeding has been observed in patients receiving celebrex in controlled and openlabeled trials see warnings and precautions and clinical studiesa randomized doubleblind study in 430 ra patients was conducted in which an endoscopic examination was performed at 6 months the incidence of endoscopic ulcers in patients taking celebrex 200 mg twice daily was 4 vs 15 for patients taking diclofenac sr 75 mg twice daily however celebrex was not statistically different than diclofenac for clinically relevant gi outcomes in the class trial see clinical studies  the incidence of endoscopic ulcers was studied in two 12week placebocontrolled studies in 2157 oa and ra patients in whom baseline endoscopies revealed no ulcers there was no dose relationship for the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers and the dose of celebrex 50 mg to 400 mg twice daily the incidence for naproxen 500 mg twice daily was 162 and 176 in the two studies for placebo was 20 and 23 and for all doses of celebrex the incidence ranged between 2759 there have been no large clinical outcome studies to compare clinically relevant gi outcomes with celebrex and naproxen in the endoscopic studies approximately 11 of patients were taking aspirin  ≤ 325 mgday in the celebrex groups the endoscopic ulcer rate appeared to be higher in aspirin users than in nonusers however the increased rate of ulcers in these aspirin users was less than the endoscopic ulcer rates observed in the active comparator groups with or without aspirin medication guide rheumatoid arthritis slideshow take the ra quiz jointfriendly exercises slideshow
