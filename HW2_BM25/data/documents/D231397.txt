nemecanemecoregoniancom the oregonianoregon live prior to the start of the primetime top 40 showcase at jefferson high school this weekend event coordinator reggie walker address oregons top basketball players for whatever reason the spotlight isnt as bright on oregon basketball talent as it was five 10 20 years ago he said i want to change that because i believe oregon has every bit as much talent as it did before oregons top 40 prospects may have tuned out the message anxious to get to work in front of the college coaches in attendance but they certainly showed walkers message was a fair analysis jefferson junior kamaka hepa one of the nations top post players and an oregon ducks and oregon state beavers target starred in an event that showcased the areas top talent photo gallery from prime time top 40 showcase after stretching and warmups the 40 prospects on hand were split into four teams playing three games each in a rotation before an allstar game concluded the days events heres a breakdown of the top players4 pf kamaka hepa jefferson 2018  the 6foot9 210pound post player is already among the top 50 prospects in the country for the 2018 recruiting class and he showed why over the weekend hepa is incredibly fluid as an athlete and was the best passer at the camp his midrange game is fully developed and he is a nightmare in the high post for opposing defenses whether it was blocking shots or facilitating some of the prettiest passes of the weekend hepa provided several highlightworthy plays his weakness hepa has a nice touch around the basket but doesnt go up strong and is a below average rebounder for his size hepa needs to increase his strength and learn to bang down low with the big boys reggie walker on hepa kamaka as a player hes special but hes an even better person hes a leader a coach on the floor not selfish almost to a fault hes got a chance to be really special all the highmajors that are recruiting him keep telling us the blue bloods are going to be recruiting him soon which will be crazy to see as a player hes got to get more physical get a little bit more dog in him to really reach his true ceiling hes special pgsg marcus tsohonis jefferson 2019  one of the top combo guards on the west coast the 6foot4 160pound prospect is a future highmajor recruit having already added a scholarship offer from the usc trojans tsohonis is a sound basketball player  good shooter quick active hands solid passer however he still needs to show he can be a consistent ballhandler programs will value him significantly higher if he shows he can handle the basketball and become a better passer he has also developed the bad habit of scissorkicking his legs either for flash or to draw contact unclear and it throws off his shot its a habit he needs to break tsohonis has lots of time to develop as a pure point guard if he can do that he could develop into one of the top 50 recruits in the country reggie walker on tsohonis marcus has got a chance to be a bigtime player he has a pac12 offer already hes got to solidify being a true point guard and a leader pgsg ty rankin grant 2019  hepa and tsohonis were known commodities coming into the camp but grants ty rankin isnt quite as well known yet the 6foot2 point guard has a muscled mature body and didnt try to over showcase himself in roundrobin action rankin displayed a high basketball iq while being a strong facilitator and a quality outside shooter he has a good chance of being a highmajor prospect given his combination of strength and skill at the guard spot walker on rankin ty has got a chance to be really special hes got a strong body already and is learning how to playmake he really shoots it well and is a tireless worker what puts him over the top is going to be his work ethic pg braden olsen west linn 2017  stuck behind payton pritchard and a seniorheavy squad braden olsen is one of the more underrated basketball players in the state of oregon injuries have kept him from emerging but hes a quality talent and has a chance to break out as a senior walker on olsen braden has come a long way he was injured last year and played in the shadow of all the seniors west linn had hes come out of his shell and will have a big leadership role this year excited to see what he does this year sgsf roberto gittens henry foss washington 2017  an athletic freak gittens still has to work on developing his basketball skills but his jump shot has improved from last year the 6foot5 wing is one of the most underrecruited players in the northwest and hes shown that at the les schwab invitational where he has become a fan favorite walker on gittens man roberto is a monster hes one of my favorite players that ive watched over the last decade we were fortunate to have him come to this event two years in a row i think hes very underrated hes a highmajor everything  person player i love roberto sfpf lucas wilson churchill 2017  the 6foot5 springy bowling ball of a player is jawdroppingly athletic making plays above the rim you dont expect from an athlete with his muscular frame wilson wasnt the most skilled player at the event but his work ethic tenacity and athleticism allowed him to shine on one of oregons biggest hoops stages walker on wilson freak athletic freak i just found out hes playing football which is a good idea by him hes the most athletic kid in oregon for sure maybe in the entire northwest hes got to be sfpf teagan quitoriano sprague 2018  the physical 6foot6 athlete is a likely pac12mountain westtype football target at tight end which means his basketball career may fall by the wayside in college however hes got a chance to be a heavily recruited hoops prospect as well as he refines his skills walker on quitoriano i love teagan hes one of my favorite players in the state he plays so hard and the ball just always seems to find him in terms of rebounding he can shoot the 3 and hell guard anybody and is not afraid of anyone he plays football and is a bigtime football prospect but basketballwise hes got a lot of wccbig sky interest pg aaron deloney grant 2019  deloney didnt shine in the camp injured hand but he didnt complain and showed high basketball iq and good fundamentals behind his shot hes definitely a prospect to watch develop over the next two years walker on deloney i love ad too hes got a chance to be really good he workds really hard hes a leader on the court floor general and is becoming a better shooter his hand is banged up right now so hes not showcasing his true skill but hes a good player  andrew nemec anemecoregoniancom  andrew nemec view comments
