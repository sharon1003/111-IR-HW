my mother is almost 86 and has been diagnosed with alzheimersdementia she is taking both aricept donepezil and namenda memantine most of the time she is very lucid and together she knows who we are and can carry on a conversation occasionally she says things that are very strange and obviously not based in reality we know that sometimes these hallucinations or delusions have been caused by a urinary tract infection or dehydration is this the progression of the disease a mental health professional has suggested that at these times mom may be suffering from delirium we want to understand what is going on with mom so we can be as helpful and supportive as possible can you help us with this also what is the best way for us to interact with mom when she is in this place in her head thankshallucinations and delusions may be a symptom of the alzheimers dementia or they could represent delirium delirium is generally caused by an illness such as urinary infection or pneumonia electrolyte disturbance medication or some other significant change in health status any new changes in behavior need to be evaluated by a physician particularly hallucinations and delusions or changes in level of consciousness if the person is really hard to wake up or not sleeping for days the cause s of delirium need to be found and treated stable or occasional isolated events are probably not delirium so if there is a change in behavior or level of consciousness take her to a doctor if it is not a change i would deal with the departures from reality in the most kind and compassionate way you can which is usually to go along with it and not argue or try to convince her that her belief or perception is wrong arguing will usually just make everyone upset last updated 5122008
