the virginia border to get to corolla you must drive north on twolane n c highway 12 from dare county passing through southern shores duck and the sanderling community before crossing the line into currituck county currituck outer banks is made up of two distinct areas – the southern portion often referred to entirely as corolla and the northern portion usually called the fourwheeldrive area it is common nowadays for people to refer to the whole southern portion of the currituck outer banks as “corolla” though historically that name was only used for the very small village near the lighthouse corolla is not a town there are no incorporated towns in the whole of currituck county but it’s the name of the only post office on the currituck outer banks so it works well as the moniker for the whole area fast development comes to corolla ncuntil the development boom of the 1980s only 30 years ago corolla was littleknown and littletraveled and was often referred to as north carolina’s last beach frontier that’s all changed today corolla has grown quite rapidly and it is a top vacation destination on the east coast the establishment of rental properties and a few hotels has brought vacationers which has in turn brought all the amenities of a modern vacation — shopping centers restaurants movies grocery stores a golf course tennis swimming pools galore attractions recreational opportunities and as always the beach corolla’s location is a little out of the way but it’s not really remote the only issue with traveling to corolla is that it’s essentially at a dead end there’s only one way in and out and that’s on a twolane highway with as many as 50000 people vacationing here per week in the height of the summer season you can imagine that traffic is awfully sluggish on summer weekends at rental changeover time it can take a couple of hours to travel only 10 miles or so along the northern outer banks on saturday and sunday afternoons in july and august people are making efforts to solve this problem regularly scheduled air service is available to corolla some rental companies offer alternative checkin days and times and many locals are pushing to establish a bridge across the currituck sound the bridge would eliminate the need to travel through the congested areas of southern shores and duck to get to corolla as it would connect to the currituck mainland should this bridge ever come to fruition and surely it will someday it will shave at least an hour off the trip to corolla highend developments and shopping characterize corolla ncthe corolla area consists mostly of planned development communities or subdivisions — pine island palmer’s island the currituck club ocean sands whalehead buck island monterey shores corolla light village at ocean hill and others these subdivisions are vacation oriented the larger ones offer amenities like pools tennis courts bike paths beach accesses shuttles and other recreational opportunities for their guests corolla’s housing and shopping areas are spread out over about 20 miles and there is no exact center for this reason if you want to do anything besides go to the beach

pine island racquet club golf at the currituck club and horse tours see the section on horses below a daytrip to corolla nccorolla is the perfect location for a daytrip but we recommend going during the week in the summer months traffic is too bad on the weekends in the summer it takes about an hour or maybe a little less to reach the northern end of corolla from the nags headkill devil hills area it’s about 20 minutes from duck you can hit all three attractions – the currituck beach lighthouse the whalehead club and the outer banks center for wildlife education – in about two and a half hours after lunch you’ll still have time for a wild horse tour corolla wild horses north of corolla about 70 or so wild horses live in the natural habitat of the outer banks the bay chestnut sorrel and black wild horses are a beautiful sight feasting on salt hay and coarse grasses and drinking rainwater that collects in swales how did these horses get to the outer banks it is widely believed that the corolla wild horses like those on ocracoke island and shackleford banks farther south have been living on the northern outer banks for more than 400 years since the era of early spanish and english exploration of the new world it is unknown exactly how the horses arrived on this coast but most believe it was by way of spanish or english explorers or both spanish conquistadors explored coastal north carolina in the early 1500s bringing with them horses sheep cows and pigs that were bred in the spanish colony of puerto rico but they abandoned their livestock when they ran into conflict with the native americans later english explorers brought spanishbred horses and livestock on their voyages to roanoke island between 1584 and 1590 some say the horses could have also swum ashore from shipwrecks scientific and genetic studies have proven that the horses have genetic connections to spanish mustangs in fact they are some of the purest descendants of the spanish mustangs because of their isolation on the remote outer banks you can watch these wild horses if you travel up to the fourwheeldrive area oftentimes you can spot them if you drive around on your own but the best way to see them is to take a wild horse tour the tour companies know exactly where to find the horses and can give you lots of information about them as well as point out interesting sites along the way you can take tours in fourwheeldrive suburbans on kayaks on electric atvs or — get this — on fourwheeldrive electric segways one note however it is the law that you do not approach or feed these horses and enforcement is strict for the safety of these magnificent animals its for your protection toothey are wild not domesticated the currituck mainland across the currituck sound from the outer banks is the currituck mainland if you’re driving in from the north heading to the currituck outer banks you’ll pass through the currituck mainland before crossing over into dare county and then heading back into currituck county on the outer banks most people zip through the currituck mainland on their way to and from the beach but if you take your time when traveling through this area you won’t be disappointed this is beautiful country the heritage of the currituck mainland is agricultural and much of the area continues to be cultivated for corn soybeans wheat cotton vegetables peaches and grapes there are several wineries in currituck county as you pass through the area on u s highway 158 you’ll find numerous roadside stands offering a variety of fresh local produce do not pass through here without stopping at a stand to stock up on sweet corn tomatoes strawberries melons squash and all the other produce that’s inseason when you’re visiting if you want to taste the local wine you can take the ferry to knotts island or stop at sanctuary vineyards in jarvisburg also along the highway you’ll find antiques shops and downhome restaurants including some of the best eastern north carolina barbecue around monstertruck fans may be surprised to see the home of the grave digger right alongside u s highway 158 there’s a little museum and shop so make a stop if you’re interested in this hometown hero mainland currituck county is changing from its smalltown feel and agricultural roots however sandwiched between the outer banks and the metropolitan area of hampton roads virginia currituck is catching spillover growth and development from those two areas and is now one of the fastestgrowing counties in north carolina signs of change are everywhere but the county is doing its best to balance rapid growth with the area’s culture and heritage “currituck” is an algonquin indian word that means “land of the wild goose” and the county hopes to keep its waters marshes woods and wildlife intact an interesting geographical feature of currituck county is that the intracoastal waterway runs through the county and separates the southern mainland from the northern mainland marinas and restaurants serve the pleasure and commercial vessels that travel up and down the waterway knotts island wineries yet another area of currituck is knotts island to get there you have to take a short ferry ride across the currituck sound you can also drive there from virginia but we recommend the ferry ride from currituck knotts island is worth a visit because it is home to a winery that is open to the public for tours and tastings martin vineyards also has an orchard where you can pick apples or peaches in season also of interest on knotts island is the mackay
