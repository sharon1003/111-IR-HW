melatonin not a magic bullet for sleep know the facts before taking melatonin posted feb 22 2011sharetweetemailmoremany of you have made a new year’s resolution to get more and better sleep i hope you are having great success but i want to address a topic i am asked about repeatedly and it may be something many of you have tried or considered in your quest for a better night’s sleep is melatonin good to take to help with my sleep so exactly what is melatonin melatonin is a hormone it is not an herb a vitamin or a mineral hormones are naturally produced by your body as you need them which means it is very unlikely that someone has a melatonin deficiency while melatonin could be considered natural in most cases it doesn’t come from the earth there are exceptions of foods that contain melatonin in them but this is a different type of melatonin than what is produced in your brain  your melatonin levels can be tested with a blood test urine test or saliva test if you are concerned that you may actually be melatonin deficient ask your doctor about testing melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and sends a signal to regulate the sleepwake cycle in the sleep center of the brain interestingly melatonin is also produced in the retina the skin and the gi tract but this is not the melatonin what affects your biological sleep clock this is the really important thing you should understand about melatonin melatonin is a sleep and body clock regulator not a sleep initiator melatonin works with your biological clock by telling your brain when it is time to sleep melatonin does not increase your sleep drive or need for sleep melatonin is called the “vampire hormone” because it is produced primarily in darkness and inhibited by light the levels of your melatonin increase in the middle of the night and gradually fall as the night turns to morning so exposure to light before bed can push your biological clock in the wrong direction  making melatonin ineffective melatonin treats circadian rhythm disorders where you sleep the right amount of minutes but your body clock is at the wrong time shift work sleep disorders and early morning awakenings – all things that deal with the timing of your need to sleep melatonin is not considered an effective treatment for insomnia melatonin in pill form does not function like your body’s naturally produced melatonin it affects the brain in bursts and rapidly leaves the system instead of the slow build up and slow washout that your body’s naturally produced melatonin experiences the correct dosage of melatonin can be a problem according to research conducted at mit the correct dosage of melatonin for it to be effective is 0310 mg many commercially available forms of melatonin are in 3 to 10 times the amount your body would need in fact there is some evidence that higher doses may be less effective in europe melatonin at very high doses has been used as a contraceptive melatonin can have side effects melatonin 23mg or higher has reported side effects of headaches nausea nextday grogginess hormone fluctuations vivid dreams and nightmares melatonin may also have some issues with safety while melatonin is available overthecounter otc in the us and canada melatonin is available only by prescription or not at all in some countries in the us melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement not a medication so until recently melatonin has not been subject to the same purity rules and standards as prescription medications there are new fda rules that went into effect in june of 2010 that require all dietary supplements to comply with “good manufacturing practices gmp” which includes compliance in manufacturing standards and labeling so what does all this mean if you want to try melatonin as a supplement melatonin has been shown to be safe in healthy people when used for up to 3 months at the correct dosage over the counter otc melatonin when taken several hours before sleep melatonin can shift the biological clock earlier making a better environment for falling asleep and waking up on time when taken in the correct dose 031 mg it can be effective for shift workers and people with circadian rhythm disorders however most melatonin sold over the counter is packaged in doses ranging from 1 mg to 10 mg with most doses containing double or triple the amount that is needed to be effective for the population that will benefit from its use other possible uses for melatonin as an antioxidant melatonin acts upon free radicals it may reduce damage caused by parkinson’s disease and can have an anti aging effect in the elderly it has shown some promise in managing a type of insomnia called early morning awakenings  but this area needs more study and does not take into account medications that may interact with melatonin caution should be taken when using melatonin it should be used under the guidance of a doctor and sleep professional it should be used at the correct dosage it should be taken about 90 minutes before lights out it should be used for a short time less than 3 months it should never be used in combination with other sleep inducing medications it should never be used with alcohol it should never be used with children younger than 18 years there are possible interaction effects and could change the effectiveness of your current medication regimen there are new and exciting experiments with patches for delivery of melatonin for use by shift workers and others who have work environments that put their regular circadian clocks to the test tart cherries contain a natural melatonin and there is research to show that drinking tart cherry juice can help with insomnia there are vitamins and minerals  like vitamin d the b vitamins folic acid and calcium that have been shown to help with both energy and relaxation at the end of the day no pun intended your first line of defense for sleep problems good health and good sleep hygiene make it a habit to prepare your body and your mind at the end of every day to get the rest you need try that first before you start looking for something else and when you do look be careful michael j breus ph dthe sleep
