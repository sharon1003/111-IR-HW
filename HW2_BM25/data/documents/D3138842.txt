blog 325610431the home inspector easy fix for split boots on plumbing vent flashings by reuben saltzman september 8 2015 — 543am text sizeemail printmore check out the photo below do you see the problem the white pipe sticking up out of the roof is a plumbing vent the rubber boot at the base of the plumbing vent is part of the flashing kit for this vent and the boot has dried out and split heres another photo of a split rubber boot taken from the same roof at a different location in preparation for this blog post i hopped up on my own roof and took a look at the flashing on my own plumbing vents i bet you can guess what i found i ought to inspect my own roof more often this is what happens to those cheap rubber boots over time they seem to last about 1015 years here in minnesota heres water damage at a bathroom ceiling not mine which resulted from this defect ive always recommended replacing the plumbing vent flashing when i find this defect but i recently came across a plumbing vent flashing repair device that looked like a cross between a twopiece plumbing vent cap and darth vaders helmet its called a permaboot ® its a simple product that can be easily installed in minutes and comes with a lifetime warranty home depot sells them for 1884 which is more than twice the price of the traditional flashing pictured at the beginning of this post but i think its worth the price they come in 1½ 2 3 and 4inch sizes but for the record the smallest vent that youre supposed to have sticking up through your roof is 2 inches the concern with smaller vents is that they could get blocked with frost too easily the only potential installation issues that i can foresee with this product are with plumbing vents that are too short or too tall plumbing vents should ideally stick up out of the roof about one foot and this is what is required by code here in minnesota see 47152530  the taller the vent the greater potential to get blocked with frost the shorter the vent the greater the potential to get blocked by snow if you have a plumbing vent thats too tall for a permaboot simply cut it down if you have a plumbing vent thats too short make it taller i think this is a great product and im going to start recommending them when i find split boots author reuben saltzman  structure tech home inspectionsps  i think darth vader helmet is a better
