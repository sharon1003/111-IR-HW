apple  security  privacy6 digits are better than 4 i os 9 to boost passcode security posted on june 10th 2015 by graham cluley as usual the worlds technology press watched in anticipation at apples keynote speech at wwdc this week anxious to turn any titbits of information about upcoming new products and features into news stories and although there were plenty of new features announced for the upcoming upgrade to os x — dubbed el capitan — perhaps the security news which will impact the most i phone and i pad users is that apple will be beefing up security on i devices running i os 9 by requiring users to upgrade from a 4digit passcode to one containing 6 digits two extra digits can that really add a whole lot more security well actually yes you see a six digit passcode has one million possible combinations instead of 10000 here is how apple describes the development in their i os 9 preview sixdigit passcodes the passcode you use on your touch idenabled i phone and i pad will now have six digits instead of four if you use touch id its a change youll hardly notice but with one million possible combinations — instead of 10000 — your passcode will be a lot tougher to crack even if you were up against someone determined enough to use a brute force black box to guess your i phones pin it is far less likely to be considered a practical option once there are a million combinations however good as a six digit passcode is my recommendation remains that you should use a complex alphanumeric passphrase in combination with touch id to secure your precious i phone or i pad just make sure that its not a passphrase that you tell anyone else or that could be easy to guess or crack if you like the sound of the additional security benefits that a longer passphrase could give you over a four or indeed six digit numerical code go to to settings  touch id  passcode on devices with touch id or settings  passcode on other devices once there make sure that you have disabled simple passcode to let you set a longer passphrase including letters and symbols as well as numbers if you are particularly paranoid you may wish to enable the erase data passcode setting which should ensure that your phone will be wiped after 10 failed attempts to crack the code apples decision to boost passcode security couldnt come at a more appropriate time thumbing the companys nose at increasing demands from governments for tech firms to weaken security and water down encryption apples move shouldnt be shrugged off it underscores that the company is keen to be seen taking the security and privacy of its customers more seriously googlegraham cluley about graham cluley graham cluley is an awardwinning security blogger researcher and public speaker he has been working in the computer security industry since the early 1990s having been employed by companies such as sophos mc afee and dr solomons he has given talks about computer security for some of the worlds largest companies worked with law enforcement agencies on investigations into hacking groups and regularly appears on tv and radio explaining computer security threats graham cluley was inducted into the info security europe hall of fame in 2011 and was given an honorary mention in the 10 greatest britons in it history for his contribution as a leading authority in internet security follow him on twitter at gcluley  view all posts by graham cluley →this entry was posted in apple security  privacy and tagged i os i os 9 passcode bookmark the permalink
