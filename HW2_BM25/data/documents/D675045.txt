recipesfailproof crepes  a crepe party may 3 2016 jump to comments i know what most people think of crêpes — they’re difficult they require planning ahead they’re fussy cough french  they rip easily the first one always goes in the trash — but i respectfully disagree especially about that last bit it goes in the nearest mouth in fact i think think that a great big stack of crêpes and a few easy fixings are the best thing that can happen to brunch hear me out the batter takes 120 seconds to assemble including the 30 to melt the butter in the microwave you can prepare the batter 1 hour or 4 days before you need it it doesn’t mind rushing or neglect cooked crêpes are basically magic — you can stack them hot or cold they don’t stick to each other it’s like some sort of pancake voodoo they reheat like a charm so don’t you dare spend the morning frying crêpes make them all the day before and be amazed that the difference once rewarmed is undetectable some people like nutella and berries with breakfast other people like ham and cheese crêpes are the ideal foundation for both the vast majority of things that taste good on crêpes require little more prep than chopping if that — fruit or jam cheese dollops of ricotta or yogurt or cured meats these too are meant to be prepared ahead if you like to sleep in on brunch mornings as much as me think taco bars are fun this is the fancy brunch equivalent until you can put sprinkles on tacos i implore you just say no crêpes are going to win this round if you’re besieged by tearing flimsy exasperating to make crêpes i think you’re due for a new recipe like mine my goto crêpe recipe is four ingredients in one bowl everything in at once no fuss what makes it easier than most is that it’s has a tiny bit more heft to it and a little less terrifyingly fragile laciness which is to say it’s completely headachefree to cook an ideal housing for any fillings you can dream up and nobody — and certainly nobody you’d want over for brunch — will be the wiser which brings me to my two rules for putting out a great crêpe bar this sunday perhaps  first as we discussed make all of your crêpes in advance and rewarm them when needed — if you’re standing over a hot skillet when people arrive there’s a 99 chance you are not going to enjoy your party finally there are like a million ways to make crêpes taste good and do not even try to make 10 of them do not make yourself crazy i vote for two sweet and two savory ideas or at most three of each many ideas listed below the recipe and really not more than one to two of them should require any work beyond chopping people who really want a sweet crêpes are almost certainly going to see the chocolate spread option and stop looking the remaining handful will always be happy with berries and cream for the savory one vegetarian and one with meat think of it like a good restaurant menu i feel positively stressed when a menu is too long i desperately want the chef to just tell me which 5 things she makes best and let me choose from there let’s be that chef one year ago crispy broccoli with lemon and garlic two years ago blue sky bran muffins three years ago spring vegetable potstickers four years ago bacon egg and leek risotto five years ago ribboned asparagus salad with lemon six years ago blue cheese scallion drop biscuits and creamed chard and spring onions and avocado salad with carrot ginger dressing seven years ago pickled grapes with cinnamon and black pepper and pasta with fava tomatoes and sausage buttermilk ice cream and black bread eight years ago jim lahey’s pizza bianca and brownie rollout cookies nine years ago tequila lime chicken  green onion slaw and for the other side of the world six months ago chocolate peanut and pretzel brittle15 years ago smoked whitefish dip with horseradish25 years ago spinach and egg pizzettes35 years ago apple cider caramels45 years ago homesick texan carnitas failproof crêpes yield 11 to 12 9inch crêpes3 tablespoons 45 grams unsalted butter plus more for buttering pan 1 14 cup 295 ml milk and sometimes a splash more 4 large eggs 1 cup 125 grams allpurpose flour two pinches of salt in the bottom of a large bowl melt your butter halfway then stir until fully melted this keep it from getting so hot that it will prematurely cook the eggs add milk eggs flour and salt and whisk to combine it’s going to be a little lumpy it’s going to be okay cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour and up to 4 days until needed when ready to cook cover a large plate or platter with a layer of paper towels remove plastic from batter bowl and whisk to remove any remaining lumps quick directions for the confident heat skillet over mediumlow butter skillet ladle in 14 cup batter roll around cook until golden underneath flip repeat adjusting heat and rebuttering skillet as needed detailed directions for the nervous heat a skillet a nonstick will give you the fewest headaches i use this discontinued one over mediumlow when hot lightly butter it ladle in 14 cup batter this amount for a 910inch and tilt and roll the pan until the bottom is covered if this is extremely difficult cover because the batter is too thick whisk in another splash of milk if a stubborn hole won’t easily fill with batter add a drop on top of it to fill it in it will all be the same in the end cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side until faintly golden underneath if this happens too quickly reduce heat to low use a long thin spatula i swear by a flexible fish spatula as well as a small offset for this an all things in the kitchen that can really get under the crêpe through the middle and lift and flip it over spatula not long enough put one in each hand use the first one to lift as much as possible and the second one to get under the crêpe further and finish the job if it folds or crinkles don’t fret it’s surprisingly easy to stretch out wrinkles and shimmy the crêpe back flat if it tears it likely would have benefitted from another 20 seconds cooking time to better firm up underneath cook on the second side for 20 to 30 seconds then slid out onto prepared platter repeat with remaining batter i do not need to rebutter a good nonstick between crêpes only every 3 or 4 crêpes even warm can be stacked and they will not stick to each other to store wrap stack of crêpes in plastic foil or place in an airtight container in the fridge overnight to rewarm arrange in a baking dish overlapped is fine covered with foil and warm in a 250 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes serve with a couple sweet and
