precipitation the precipitation every year in the tundra is very low which is another factor that discourages plant growth in the tundra the tundra gets about 10 inches every year about the same as the desert and most is snow which is surprisingly helpful for plants and forms an insulated layer above the permafrost so they can grow also the permafrost is what is believed to be what prevents the growth of most plant life so the insulated layer actually lets the plants be able to grow there during the short summers temperature temperatures in the arctic tundra can go down to almost 60째f the hottest time of the year can average to between 50째f32째f an average temperature that goes any higher than 32 degrees fahrenheit exists for only as few as 55 days an year the average annual temperature is only 10 to 20째f according to the chart on the right the tundra has the lowest temperature out of all the biomes for nearly the whole year and its temperatures are still at its highest temperature while others are going down
