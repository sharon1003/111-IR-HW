science  mathematics physics what would happen if you put lava on water and explain please  okay what would happen if you put lava on water would it make obsidian because on minecraft it makes obsidian but im not sure f it makes obsidian if you would actually do it so could any one tell me please and explain why 1 following 5 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer wellobsidian is an igneous rockit is often called volcanic glass since it forms when lava cools extremely rapidly with no time to create crystals if you put lava in water the lava would cool quickly and would form some sort of igneous mass whose exact structure and composition would depend on the chemical composition of the lava and its original mass at the bottom of the ocean at ocean rifts hot magma enters the ocean and quickly cools when it hits the near freezing waterwhat happens is that an outer crust of the magma cools quickly to form a skin around the remaining magma which cools slowly inside this skinthis is the quick version of the origin of basaltic rock the igneous rock that forms much of the ocean crust if you had enough lava you could form this sort of skin which would allow the remaining liquid to cool more slowly and perhaps generate some crystals but that would take more lava than you are likely to have but to form obsidian you need to cool lava very quicklyas happens in many violent volcanic eruptionskuiperbelt2003 · 6 years ago0 0 comment askers rating pouring water on lava source shttpsowlyima9z ai erika · 1 year ago0 0 comment umm right minecraft is not very well based in reality im afraid i wouldnt take any physics lessons from it  in real life its all a matter of balance for instance if you dropped a bucket of lava into the ocean the lava would quickly cool transfer its energy to the water and solidify into a lump of rock however if you were to reverse the scenario and pour a bucket of water on a volcano all that would happen would be that the water would boil and evaporate so yeah hope that answers your question rover · 6 years ago0 1 comment it would not create obsidian like in minecraft it would most likely form some sort of igneous rock or simply steam off the water and stay molten alec · 6 years ago0 1 comment god is conscious how he created the international its stated in genesis your attempting to apply evolutionary questioning on how scientist say it began and that they are incorrect technological awareness stated sea existence got here first then fish got here out of the waters and more desirable legs to stroll on in accordance to evolution as they declare did others the 1st area of genesis states the subject of the earth earlier it grew to become into created it says he created the heaven thats the sky over the earth no longer the universe if he meant the universe he might have used plural the heavens the earth grew to become into with out type or the hebrew observe which ability a waste or desolate no longer something there and void or the hebrew a vacuity an empty place there grew to become into finished darkness over the shape of the waters day a million god creates easy it ability he starts the earth to rotate on its axis for the 24 hour rotation easy is day and darkness is night in spite of out stars and sunlight and moon the earth might nevertheless rotate on its axis day 2 god divides the waters those on the earth and those above the sky around the outer area of the earth he creates the ambience of the earth called the firmament or heaven a water cover grew to become into around the outer firmament of the earth day 3 god separates the land from the water creates grass bushes and plant existence day 4 god creates sunlight moon and stars day 5 god creates the water creatures and the birds day 6 god creates the land creatures and guyfurrjr · 1 year ago0 0 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these find moving container services want to build a free website online education an option need a small business loan
