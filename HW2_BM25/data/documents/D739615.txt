102a atp  the principle phosphoryl group donor enzymes called kinases catalyze the transfer of phosphoryl groups to organic molecules the source of the phosphoryl group in most phosphorylation reactions is a molecule called adenosine triphosphate abbreviated atp notice that there are essentially three parts to the molecule an adenine nucleoside base a fivecarbon sugar ribose and a triphosphate group the three phosphates are designated by greek letters a b and g adenosine diphosphate adp and adenosine monophosphate amp are also important players in the reactions of this chapter you will see atp adp and amp abbreviated in many different ways in this text and throughout the biochemical literature for example the three structures below are all abbreviated depictions of atp the following exercise will give you some practice in recognizing different abbreviations for biological molecules that contain phosphate groups template example start exercise 102 below are a number of representations labeled as of molecules that contain phosphoryl groups different abbreviations are used arrange as into groups of drawings that depict the same molecule using different abbreviations or no abbreviation at all solution template example end you are probably familiar with the physiological role of atp from your biology classes  it is commonly called the cells energy currency what this means is that atp stores  for a very short time  some of the energy derived from the oxidation of fuel molecules like carbohydrates or fats in plants and photosynthetic bacteria the energy comes from sunlight the energy in atp is stored in the two highenergy phosphate anhydride linkages  when we speak of the energy of an atp molecule being spent what we mean is that a phosphoryl group is being transferred from atp to some other acceptor molecule making the acceptor molecule more reactive for example in many phosphoryl transfer reactions such as the phosphorylation of glucose which we used as an example in section 101d the gamma  γ phosphate of atp is transferred to an organic acceptor releasing adp in other reactions the base ribose and the alpha phosphate is transferred to the organic molecule to form an organicamp adduct while inorganic pyrophosphate pp i is released occasionally the beta and gamma phosphate groups are transferred together with the release of amp in all of these reactions a relatively stable organic molecule is being transformed into a higher energy phosphorylated product this activated product can then go on to react in ways that its more stable nonphosphorylated counterpart could not  phosphoryl groups as we know are much better leaving groups in nucleophilic substitution reactions than the hydroxyl group of alcohols even though the conversion of a lowerenergy starting compound into a higher energy product is by itself a thermodynamically uphill process the overall phosphoryl transfer reaction is thermodynamically downhill because the conversion of atp into adp or amp  the breaking of a phosphate anhydride bond  releases a great deal of energy  in other words the energy stored in the phosphate anhydride bond of atp has been spent to create an activated higher energy molecule when amp or adp is converted back to atp energy from fuel molecules or from sunlight is required to reform the high energy anhydride bond this process is the subject of discussion later in this sectionthe explanation for why the phosphate anhydrides linkages in atp are so energetic lies primarily in the concept of charge separation recall from section 101 that atp at the physiological p h of 7 is almost completely ionized with a total charge of close to 4 when one of the two anhydride bonds is broken the negative charges on the phosphate groups are able to separate eliminating some of the samecharge repulsion that existed in atp one way to picture this is as a coil springing open another reason has to do with the energy of solvation by water when the gamma phosphate of atp is transferred to an alcohol for example surrounding water molecules are able to form more hydrogenbonding interactions with the products adp and the organic phosphate than was possible with atp and alcohol these additional solvation interactions stabilize the products of the phosphorylation reaction relative to the starting compounds you will learn more about the thermodynamic role of atp in metabolic pathways if you take a class in biochemistry  what is most important to understand at this point is that because of the energy stored in its phosphate anhydride bonds atp is a powerful phosphoryl group donor and is used as such in many important biochemical reactions some examples are discussed in the remainder of this section102b monophosphorylation of alcohols recall that almost all biomolecules are charged species which 1 keeps them water soluble and 2 prevents them from diffusing across lipid bilayer membranes although many biomolecules are ionized by virtue of negatively charged carboxylate and positively charged amino groups the most common ionic group in biologically important organic compounds is phosphate  thus the phosphorylation of alcohol groups is a critical metabolic step in alcohol phosphorylations atp is almost always the phosphate donor and the mechanism is very consistent the alcohol oxygen acts as a nucleophile attacking the gammaphosphorus of atp and expelling adp look again for example at the glucose kinase reaction that we first saw in section 101d  bhthe glucose kinase reaction is the first step in glycolysis a metabolic pathway in which the 6carbon sugar glucose is broken down into two 3carbon fragments called pyruvate the third step of glycolysis also a kinase reaction this time it is the hydroxyl group on carbon 1 of fructose6phosphate that is phosphorylated step 2 of glycolysis is the isomerization of glucose6phosphate to fructose6phosphate a reaction we will study in section 132a  once again atp is the phosphate donor in the fructose6phosphate kinase reaction now when the 6carbon sugar breaks into two 3carbon pieces each piece has its own phosphate group the carboncarbon bondbreaking step is a reaction that we will learn about in section 133c  the biological activity of many proteins is regulated by means of a very similar phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by protein kinases  in these reactions the side chain hydroxyl groups on serine threonine and tyrosine residues of certain proteins are modified with the gamma phosphate from atp notice the new  atp in adp out notation used in this figure showing that atp is converted to adp in the course of the reaction from here on we will frequently use this shorthand convention to indicate when common molecules such as atp water or phosphate are participants in a reaction either as reactants or products template example start exercise 103 draw a mechanism for the kinase reaction above using appropriate abbreviations for atp and adp solution template example end the conversion of a neutral hydroxyl group to a charged phosphate represents a very dramatic change in the local architecture of the protein and thus it may behave very differently when phosphorylated in terms of its overall conformation and ability to bind to small molecules or other proteins a proteins biological function whatever that may be may be turned off until the phosphorylation of a specific serine threonine or tyrosine serves as an activating on switch or viceversa in order to reverse the process and flip the switch again the phosphate group must be removed by a phosphatase enzyme a reaction which we will examine later in this chapter  section 103  template example start exercise 104  threonine kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of the side chain hydroxyl group of threonine residues in proteins draw the structure including the configuration of all stereocenters of a phosphothreonine residue explain how you can predict the stereochemistry of the side chain solution template example end102c diphosphorylation of alcohols we have just seen how alcohol groups can be converted to monophosphates using atp as the phosphate donor in some biochemical pathways the next step is the addition of a second phosphate group to form a diphosphate in the early stages of the biosynthesis of ‘isoprenoid’ compounds such as cholesterol for example two phosphates are added sequentially to a primary alcohol group on an intermediate compound called mevalonate the first phosphorylation is essentially the same as the reactions described in part b of this section in the second phosphorylation reaction the gamma phosphate of a second atp molecule is transferred to an oxygen atom on the first phosphate forming a new phosphate anhydride linkage another example of a diphosphorylation reaction takes place in a single step rather than sequentially phosphoribosyl diphosphate prpp is a very important intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of nucleotides and some amino acids and is the product of the diphosphorylation of ribose5phosphate in this reaction two phosphate groups the beta and the gamma are transferred together from atp to a hydroxyl on ribose5phosphate notice that the beta phosphorus of atp is the electrophile in this case rather then the alpha phosphorus consequentially the reaction results in the conversion on one atp to one amp rather than two atps to two adps are we getting more for our atp money in this onestep diphosphorylation not really  in order to convert the energypoor amp back up to the energyrich atp the cell first has to transfer a phosphate from a second atp molecule in a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called adenylate kinase so in the end the diphosphorylation reaction still costs the cell two atptoadp conversions it is worth noting that both of the diphosphate groups produced in these reactions end up as leaving groups in subsequent nucleophilic substitution reactions mevalonate diphosphate is eventually converted to isoprenyl diphosphate the substrate for protein prenyltransferase  section 93  prpp is the starting point for the biosynthesis of both pyrimidine c and ut and purine g and a nucleotides the s n 1 displacement of pyrophosphate in pyrimidine biosynthesis is shown below102d phosphorylation of carboxylates thus far we have seen alcohol oxygens and phosphate oxygens acting as nucleophilic accepting groups in phosphoryl transfer reactions consider next the first step of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthase once again in this reaction the gammaphosphate of atp is transferred to an oxygen acceptor  however in this case the acceptor is a carboxylate oxygen and the product is an acyl phosphate as we shall see in chapter 12 acyl phosphates are commonly referred to as activated carboxylates and are primed to undergo reactions called nucleophilic acyl substitutions template example start exercise 105 draw a mechanism for the acylphosphateforming reaction above using appropriate abbreviations for atp and adp solution template example end102e generation of nucleotide phosphates activation of the side chain carboxylate of aspartate is somewhat different from the parallel activation of glutamate shown above while the carboxylate group in glutamate accepts a simple phosphate group from atp the carboxylate in aspartate attacks the alphaphosphate of atp displacing inorganic pyrophosphate and accepting an entire amp group the resulting acyl adenosine phosphate which is technically a phosphate diester is another form of activated carboxylate that we will learn more about in chapter 12 for some interesting variations on the phosphoryl transfer reaction consider the early steps of isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria this is a completely different pathway than that mentioned in section 102c which is operative in animals in the first step the oxygen of a monophosphate ester attacks the a phosphate of ctp  not atp to expel inorganic pyrophosphate in step 2 a second hydroxyl group is phosphorylated in the normal way by an atpdependent kinase and in step 3 that phosphate proceeds to attack the first of the two phosphates on the nucleotide diphosphate diester expelling cmp and forming a cyclic diphosphate several more steps lead to the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate the building block molecule for all isoprenoid compounds102f regeneration of atp from adpthroughout this section we have seen reactions in which the energy contained in an atp anhydride bond is spent and adp or amp is formed as a result in order to regenerate atp a phosphate group must be transferred to adp which is of course a thermodynamically uphill reaction requiring the input of energy from the breakdown of fuel molecules or in the case of plants from sunlight by far the most important source of atp regeneration is the enzyme atp synthase which catalyzes the direct condensation between inorganic phosphate and adp despite the apparent simplicity of the chemistry going on here atp synthase is an extremely large complex and fascinating enzyme with multiple protein subunits and a intricate molecular motor design the reaction must be driven uphill by using the energy from a proton gradient that is set up across the inner mitochondrial membrane you will learn much more about this amazing biochemical machine if you take a course in biochemistry two other reactions in the gycolytic sugar breakdown pathway also result in the generation of atp from adp but these are minor physiological sources of atp compared to atp synthase phosphoglycerate kinase named according to the reverse of the reaction shown below transfers a phosphate from an acyl phosphate to adp note that here the leaving group is a carboxylate group pyruvate kinase again the name refers to the reverse reaction catalyzes a less familiarlooking phosphate transfer we will revisit this reaction in section 131a contributors organic chemistry with a
