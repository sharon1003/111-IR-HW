what are the differences between activitybased costing vs absorption costing for decision making theyre both valid but ones trickier analyzing costs can help companies make strategic financially sound decisions activitybased costing and absorption costing are two popular accounting methods that companies employ when evaluating business activities activitybased costing activitybased costing also known as abc is an accounting method that identifies a companys activities and assigns costs to units produced by the company based on the number of activities used by each unit activitybased costing first determines the purpose and cost of each activity performed by a company and then assigns a proportionate cost to every individual unit produced based on its consumption of those activities lets say a company spends 20000 per year on equipment setup under activitybased costing it would then attempt to assign a proportion of that 20000 to each unit it produces however doing so is not just a simple matter of taking that 20000 and dividing it by the number of units produced instead the company would need to figure out which units or products utilize which equipment the most and then assign each unit a cost based on its individual consumption of that usage companies rely on activitybased costing to better understand the true costs of manufacturing or producing products the downside of activitybased costing is that it can be a timeconsuming system to follow furthermore some indirect costs can be difficult to assign to an individual unit or product produced for example if a company pays 100000 in administrative staff salaries and manufactures a number of different products it can be tricky to assign that 100000 or portions thereof to individual products or units absorption costing also known as full costing absorption costing is an accounting method in which all manufacturing costs are absorbed by the units produced by a given company in absorption costing the cost of an individual unit produced will include direct materials labor and both fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs these costs are not recognized as expenses in the month a company pays for them rather they are recorded as assets in the form of inventory until the units produced are sold once this happens they are charged against a companys cost of goods sold absorption costing is typically required for financial and income tax reporting purposes lets say a company manufactures 10000 units of a particular product with a cost per unit of 10 in direct materials 8 in direct labor and 2 in variable manufacturing costs lets say the company also has fixed manufacturing overhead costs totaling 40000 per year under absorption costing the cost per unit can be calculated as follows 10 direct materials  8 direct labor  2 variable manufacturing costs  4 40000 per year in fixed manufacturing overhead costs divided by 10000 units  24 per unit differences in approach absorption costing and activitybased costing differ in approach absorption costing assigns costs to individual units whereas activitybased costing focuses on company activities as a central cost and then attempts to assign indirect costs to units one major advantage of activitybased costing is that it allows companies to understand the true cost and profitability of individual units produced or services rendered this increased accuracy is achieved by essentially converting indirect costs to direct costs in fact activitybased costing can be applied to all business costs not just productionrelated overhead for instance a company can assign its marketing costs directly to the individual units it produces because of this activitybased costing can paint a more precise picture than absorption costing on the other hand activitybased costing can be an expensive system to implement and it may not be as useful to companies whose overhead costs are primarily volumerelated or to companies whose overhead represents a small proportion of their overall costs absorption costing meanwhile is easier to implement yet recognized as perfectly compliant with generally accepted accounting principles and irs reporting requirements the downside however is that it may offer less insight to those charged with making strategic decisions regarding production practices and costs this article is part of the
