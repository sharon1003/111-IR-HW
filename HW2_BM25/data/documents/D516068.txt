leno’s garage which is full of them as he owns a large number of antique and vintage automobiles leno’s collection is quite pricey and some of the cars are worth over 1 million here are ten of the most expensive cars that jay leno owns10 1966 oldsmobile toronado – 150000the oldsmobile toronado has the distinction of being among the first cars built in the us during its time that features front wheel drive prior to it hitting the market the last american made vehicle to accomplish this feat was the 1937 cord ironically leno bought his 1966 oldsmobile toronado and then modified it so it would be a rear wheel drive vehicle it also now has a very powerful modified engine capable of reaching 1000 hp9 audi r8 spyder – 157000the r8 spyder isn’t just a sports car it’s an incredible ride with style and power that’s impeccable racing fans know the audi r8 well as being one of the fastest cars in the world and leno fancies this model as much as anyone could he paid a pretty penny to put one into his collection and now he regularly drives the sleek ride8 1909 stanley steamer – 185000jay leno cars garage has a slew of vintage models including the 1909 stanley steamer it comes from back in the day when cars ran purely on steam as opposed oil it’s not quick or convenient to use — it takes 20 to 30 minutes to get it running and ready — but leno does drive it around on occasion he got a decent deal on the car and then restored it to its original state7 1986 lamborghini countach – 215000many who were around in the 1980s remember this smooth car with a futuristic design that every auto lover craved after jay leno bought and put some work into his 1986 lamborghini countach he spent over 200000 however the money was well worth it as it not only looks great and runs well but he uses

jay leno’s collection the blastolene special which was produced by the blastolene brothers team to make the model street legal leno had his mechanics make some changes to one off vehicle to get it ready for the road and in true jay leno fashion he had it turbocharged as well5 1963 chrysler turbine – 415000the 1963 chrysler turbine was a revolutionary car concept when it was designed the goal was to produce a vehicle that could run on a gas turbine engine the tragic part is that the vehicles weren’t ever made available for sale to the public and out of the 55 cars that were built all were destroyed with the exception of 9 those remaining few either went to be put on display or were sold privately to uber rich collectors including jay leno the price that he paid is estimated to be 415000 currently leno is one of only two people in the world who privately owns a 1963 chrysler turbine4 1994 mc laren f1 – 970000another of the most valuable jay leno cars is the 1994 mc laren f1

getting it looking and working like new after many hours of restoration his 1955 mercedes 300sl gullwing coupe is a real showpiece that can even be driven of course now the value of the car is well above what he paid for it1 2006 eco jet – priceless proof that jay leno is one of the most legit car collectors on the planet is his collaboration with gm to create the eco jet the car was in part inspired by another vehicle on this list the 1963 chrysler turbine like its predecessor the eco jet uses biodiesel as opposed to fuel like a standard engine leno and one of his garage techs worked
