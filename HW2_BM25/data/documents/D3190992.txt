working something you might want to consider is increasing the amount of storage youve allocated for restore points so you might have more choices in the future click start rightclick on computer then

rebooting pressing f8 just at the end of the power on self test then choosing repair your computer from the menu that comes up then follow the prompts and choose system restore its more likely to complete from a clean bootup like this than from a running systemnoel detailed howto in my new e book configure the windows 7 to work options friday february 03 2012 422 pmreply  quote noel carboni pro digital software 16320 points0sign in to vote many thanks noel but appears to be hanging again as the ‘restoring files’ message with the moving dash just keeps going any other ideas this happened after trying to install a network printer on a print server it failed to install a couple of times on this pc but previously was ok on my wifes machine i read the printer drivers may be messed up but dont know what to do about it thanks again wilfwilf33friday february 03 2012 548 pmreply  quotewilf33 25 points1sign in to vote sounds like you could have a possible hardware failure basic corruption in windows seems less likely but still a possibility i take it you tried the startup repair setting id probably try booting the windows 7 dvd or better a system repair cddvd if youve made one and see if i could get a startup repair done with that perhaps someone else has ideas what to try nextnoel detailed howto in my new e book configure the windows 7 to work options friday february 03 2012 838 pmreply  quote noel carboni pro digital software 16320 points0sign in to vote thank you noel strange thing i removed the printer driver that i suspected may have been the cause as i had just tried to install a printer server printer before discovering that restore system did not work i tried system restore again but it failed as before then i set back up to run over night and this morning the system advised it had restored to an earlier date which was what i had been trying to do since this issue arose so case closed but i do not know what fixed it i havent tried to run system restore again yet so do not know if i will experience the same issue yet many thanks for your help wilfwilf33monday february 06 2012 1026 pmreply  quotewilf33 25 points0sign in to vote glad to hear you got it
