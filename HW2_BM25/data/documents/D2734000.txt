curio firearm manufactured before 1899 but only if the replica does not use rim fire or centre fire ammunition neither federal law nor texas state law specifically forbids felons from owning black powder weapons texas law says that one cannot own a firearm unless rights are restored or unless it qualifies as an antique or replica of antique but only if the replica does not rim fire or center fire under the united states gun control act of 1968 antique firearms and replicas are largely exempted antique firearms are defined as  any firearm with a frame or receiver manufactured in or before 1898 regardless of ignition system or  any firearm with a matchlock flintlock percussion cap or similar type of ignition system and  any replica of an antique firearm if the replica is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or conventional center fire ammunition or uses fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the united states and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels or commercial trade any muzzle loading rifle muzzle loading shotgun or muzzle loading pistol which is designed to use black powder or a black powder substitute and which cannot use fixed ammunition as long as your black power firearm qualifies as above it is legal for a felon to possess it hope that clears things up a bit scotty mac esq lawyer category criminal law satisfied customers 17900experience licensed texas general practice attorney verified scotty mac esq and 87 other criminal law specialists are ready to help you ask your own question now jacustomer how would your above interpretation apply to texas law as it pertains to felons possessing the black powder revolver in his vehicle his residence firing range or concealed would he be able to have it loaded while carrying it in any of those places can a black powder firearm be open carried in texas and lastly would the fiveyear waiting period still apply to black powder weapons expert vehicle residence firing range or concealed i dont see that these are restricted in any way so long as its a true antique open carry maybe the law specifies handguns cannot be open carried and defines a handgun as a firearm that can be fired with one hand its also illegal to display a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to cause alarm so its probably better to avoid if possible open carry of a working antique revolver note however that when it defines a handgun as a firearm it already defines firearm in that way that i indicated above as excluding antiques etc so strictly speaking if its not calculated to cause alarm open carry of an antique gun that does not fit the definition of firearm is legal but the police officer arresting you might not know the intricacies of the law the 5year waiting period applies to firearms under that same definition above antique firearms manufactured before 1899 are not firearms under that definition so the possession by a felon is not illegal scotty
