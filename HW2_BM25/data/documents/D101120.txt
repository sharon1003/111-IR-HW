cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events including myocardial infarction and stroke which can be fatal this risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use diclofenac sodium gel 3 is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery descriptiondiclofenac sodium gel 3 contains the active ingredient diclofenac sodium in a clear transparent colorless to slightly yellow gel base diclofenac sodium is a white to slightly yellow crystalline powder it is freely soluble in methanol soluble in ethanol sparingly soluble in water slightly soluble in acetone and partially insoluble in ether the chemical name for diclofenac sodium is sodium o 26dichloranilino phenyl acetate diclofenac sodium has a molecular weight of 31813 the cas number is cas15307796 the structural formula is represented below diclofenac sodium gel 3 also contains benzyl alcohol hydroxyethyl cellulose methoxypolyethylene glycol 350 peg60 hydrogenated castor oil and purified water 1 g of diclofenac sodium gel 3 contains 30 mg of the active substance diclofenac sodium clinical pharmacologythe mechanism of action of diclofenac sodium in the treatment of actinic keratoses ak is unknown the contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been established pharmacokinetics absorption when diclofenac sodium gel 3 is applied topically diclofenac is absorbed into the epidermis in a study in patients with compromised skin mainly atopic dermatitis and other dermatitic conditions of the hands arms or face approximately 10 of the applied dose 2 grams of 3 gel over 100 cm 2 of diclofenac was absorbed systemically in both normal and compromised epidermis after seven days with four times daily applications after topical application of 2 g diclofenac sodium gel 3 three times daily for six days to the calf of the leg in healthy subjects diclofenac could be detected in plasma mean bioavailability parameters were auc 0t 9±19 nghrm l mean±sd with a c max of 4±5 ngm l and a t max of 45±8 hours in comparison a single oral 75 mg dose of diclofenac voltaren®† produced an auc of 1600 nghrm l therefore the systemic bioavailability after topical application of diclofenac sodium gel 3 is lower than after oral dosing comparative bioavailability studies have not been conducted between available diclofenac topical products gels containing 1 to 3 diclofenac which have different dosing regimens a crossstudy evaluation of the data indicates that diclofenac is more bioavailable when applied to diseased skin and less bioavailable when applied to intact skin blood drawn at the end of treatment from 60 patients with ak lesions treated with diclofenac sodium gel 3 in three adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials was assayed for diclofenac levels each patient was administered 05 g of diclofenac sodium gel 3 twice a day for up to 105 days there were up to three 5 cm x 5 cm treatment sites per patient on the face forehead hands forearm and scalp serum concentrations of diclofenac were on average at or below 20 ngm l these data indicate that systemic absorption of diclofenac in patients treated topically with diclofenac sodium gel 3 is much lower than that occurring after oral daily dosing of diclofenac sodium no information is available on the absorption of diclofenac when diclofenac sodium gel 3 is used under occlusion distribution diclofenac binds tightly to serum albumin the volume of distribution of diclofenac following oral administration is approximately 550 m lkg metabolism biotransformation of diclofenac following oral administration involves conjugation at the carboxyl group of the side chain or single or multiple hydroxylations resulting in several phenolic metabolites most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates two of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active however to a much smaller extent than diclofenac metabolism of diclofenac following topical administration is thought to be similar to that after oral administration the small amounts of diclofenac and its metabolites appearing in the plasma following topical administration makes the quantification of specific metabolites imprecise elimination diclofenac and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine after oral dosing systemic clearance of diclofenac from plasma is 263±56 m lmin mean±sd the terminal plasma halflife is 1 to 2 hours four of the metabolites also have short terminal halflives of 1 to 3 hours indications and usagediclofenac sodium gel 3 is indicated for the topical treatment of actinic keratoses ak sun avoidance is indicated during therapy clinical studiesclinical trials were conducted involving a total of 427 patients 213 treated with diclofenac sodium gel 3 and 214 with a gel vehicle each patient had no fewer than five ak lesions in a major body area which was defined as one of five 5 cm x 5 cm regions scalp forehead face forearm and hand up to three major body areas were studied in any patient all patients were 18 years of age or older male and female with no clinically significant medical problems outside of the ak lesions and had undergone a 60day washout period from disallowed medications masoprocol 5fluorouracil cyclosporine retinoids trichloroacetic acidlactic acidpeel 50 glycolic acid peel and hyaluronancontaining cosmetics patients were excluded from participation for reasons of known or suspected hypersensitivity to any diclofenac sodium gel 3 ingredient pregnancy allergies to aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids or other dermatological conditions which might affect the absorption of the study medication application of dermatologic products such as sunscreens cosmetics and other drug products was not permitted patients were instructed to apply a small amount of diclofenac sodium gel 3 approximately 05 g onto the affected skin using their fingers and gently smoothing the gel over the lesion in addition all patients were instructed to avoid sun exposure complete clearing of the ak lesions 30 days after completion of treatment was the primary efficacy variable no longterm

benzyl alcohol andor polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 350 diclofenac sodium gel 3 is contraindicated in the following patients  in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery warningsas with other nsaids anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without prior exposure to diclofenac diclofenac sodium should be given with caution to patients with the aspirin triad the triad typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps or who exhibit severe potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other nsaids cardiovascular thrombotic events clinical trials of several cox2 selective and nonselective nsaids of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular cv thrombotic events including myocardial infarction mi and stroke which can be fatal based on available data it is unclear that the risk for cv thrombotic events is similar for all nsaids the relative increase in serious cv thrombotic events over baseline conferred by nsaid use appears to be similar in those with and without known cv disease or risk factors for cv disease however patients with known cv disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious cv thrombotic events due to their increased baseline rate some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment the increase in cv thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses to minimize the potential risk for an adverse cv event in nsaidtreated patients use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events throughout the entire treatment course even in the absence of previous cv symptoms patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cv events and the steps to take if they occur there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events associated with nsaid use the concurrent use of aspirin and an nsaid such as diclofenac increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal gi events status post coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery two large controlled clinical trials of a cox2 selective nsaid for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following cabg surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke nsaids are contraindicated in the setting of cabg postmi patients observational studies conducted in the danish national registry have demonstrated that patients treated with nsaids in the postmi period were at increased risk of reinfarction cvrelated death and allcause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment in this same cohort the incidence of death in the first year post mi was 20 per 100 person years in nsaidtreated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in nonnsaid exposed patients although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year postmi the increased relative risk of death in nsaid users persisted over at least the next four years of followup avoid the use of diclofenac sodium gel 3 in patients with a recent mi unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent cv thrombotic events if diclofenac sodium gel 3 is used in patients with a recent mi monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia heart failure and edema the coxib and traditional nsaid trialists’ collaboration metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately twofold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in cox2 selectivetreated patients and nonselective nsaidtreated patients compared to placebotreated patients in a danish national registry study of patients with heart failure nsaid use increased the risk of mi hospitalization for heart failure and death additionally fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with nsaids use of diclofenac may blunt the cv effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions eg diuretics ace inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers arbs avoid the use of diclofenac sodium gel 3 in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure if diclofenac sodium gel 3 is used in patients with severe heart failure monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure precautionsgeneral diclofenac sodium gel 3 should be used with caution in patients with active gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding and severe renal or hepatic impairments diclofenac sodium gel 3 should not be applied to open skin wounds infections or exfoliative dermatitis it should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes the safety of the concomitant use of sunscreens cosmetics or other topical medications and diclofenac sodium gel 3 is unknown information for patients in clinical studies localized dermal side effects such as contact dermatitis exfoliation dry skin and rash were found in patients treated with diclofenac sodium gel 3 at a higher incidence than in those with placebo patients should understand the importance of monitoring and followup evaluation the signs and symptoms of dermal adverse reactions and the possibility of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis if severe dermal reactions occur treatment with diclofenac sodium gel 3 may be interrupted until the condition subsides exposure to sunlight and the use of sunlamps should be avoided safety and efficacy of the use of diclofenac sodium gel 3 together with other dermal products including cosmetics sunscreens and other topical medications on the area being treated have not been studied cardiovascular thrombotic events advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events including chest pain shortness of breath weakness or slurring of speech and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately heart failure and edema advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath unexplained weight gain or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur drug interactions specific interaction studies between diclofenac sodium gel 3 and other topical or oral agents were not performed oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs although low there is systemic exposure to diclofenac following labeled use of diclofenac sodium gel 3 therefore concomitant administration of diclofenac sodium gel 3 with oral nsaids or aspirin may result in increased nsaid adverse effects carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility there did not appear to be any increase in drugrelated neoplasms following daily topical applications of diclofenac sodium gel for 2 years at concentrations up to 0035 diclofenac sodium and 25 hyaluronate sodium in albino mice note diclofenac sodium gel 3 contains 3 diclofenac sodium when administered orally for 2 years diclofenac showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential in rats given diclofenac sodium at up to 2 mgkgday 3

estimated systemic human exposure in rats and 10 mgkgday 30 times the estimated systemic human exposure in rabbits have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity despite the induction of maternal toxicity in rats maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia prolonged gestation reduced fetal weights and growth and reduced fetal survival  based on body surface area and assuming 10 bioavailability following topical application of 2 g diclofenac sodium gel 3 per day 1 mgkg diclofenac sodium diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice and rats there are however no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response this drug should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits to the mother justify the potential risk to the fetus because of the risk to the fetus resulting in premature closure of the ductus arteriosus diclofenac should be avoided in late pregnancy labor and delivery the effects of diclofenac on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown because of the known effects of prostaglandininhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system closure of the ductus arteriosus use of diclofenac during late pregnancy should be avoided and as with other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs it is possible that diclofenac may inhibit uterine contractions and delay parturition nursing mothers because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from diclofenac sodium a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother pediatric use actinic keratoses is not a condition seen within the pediatric population
