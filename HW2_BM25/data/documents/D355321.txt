thesubcommittee on government management organization and procurement committee on oversight and government reform united states house of representatives december 9 2009our shared vision madame chairwoman ranking member bilbray and members of the subcommittee thank you for this opportunity to discuss the role of the department of commerce commerce in protecting u s intellectual property ip rights in a global economy protecting ip rights is one of secretary lockes and the departments highest priorities and for good reason innovation and creativity are vital to this nations prosperity and job growth our inventors and artists need welltailored robust protection of their creations on a worldwide basis  not only so they can enjoy the fruits of their labors but just as important so their creations can fuel the enterprises that generate goodpaying jobs and continue to enhance productivity in the global economy innovation and creativity are our clear competitive advantages across the u s government we must safeguard these national assets of course there is no more important time to focus on these issues president obama and secretary locke know there is no scenario for our economic recovery that is not driven by innovation and creativity looking out over the long term our inventors need global protection for their creations if we are to address some of the grand challenges society faces we have long known that research into and development of new medicines is a costly highrisk undertaking if we are to have any hope of providing everimproving levels of healthcare while containing costs it will be with new innovations overcoming our energy and climate challenges will be impossible without widespread dissemination of new technology and our workers of the future  our children and students  will have to be educated in the ways of innovation and creation if they and their children are to enjoy prosperity protecting presentday innovation and creation is essential to assuring our economic success in the global marketplace the u s commerce department is proud to play a central role in protecting ipamong the nations founders many enduring legacies is their respect for and values of intellectual property rights by providing for patents and copyrights in article i section 8 of the constitution  to promote the progress of science and useful arts like other parts of the constitution the idea of promoting progress by rewarding the creation of intellectual property has become a nearly global aspiration over the decades congress federal courts and the executive branch have done a great deal to develop the nations intellectual property system and in the process we have established benchmarks for other nations seeking to emulate our success many of our national intellectual property rules are reflected in international treaties and agreements todays world is infinitely more complex than 18 thcentury society even where specific intellectual property rights are recognized we face differing views on stakeholders responsibilities in protecting and exercising these rights the awareness of the importance of ip is not universal and in todays interconnected electronic age preventing ip theft faces many challenges products can move across the globe at the speed of light and factories can be quickly adapted to replicate commercially successful goods working with congress the courts and our sister agencies the commerce department plays multiple roles in the national effort to address this complex set of issues in broad strokes we grant certain intellectual property rights on behalf of the u s governmentprovide administration leadership in developing policy that supports statutory and case lawadvocate for the establishment of global intellectual property normssupport national and international ip enforcement efforts advocating protection for product or categoryspecific u s interests and work to build up capacity in other nations so that they can have more effective intellectual property regimes for their own benefit and the benefit of global commerce these activities are mutually reinforcing coordinating them across the u s government and with our international partners can be a challenge but commerce is committed to working tirelessly on this effort policyadvice the u s patent and trademark offices uspto role in establishing patents and trademark rights is fundamental to our intellectual property system by law the office is responsible for the granting and issuing of patents and the registration of trademarks  see 35 usc ยง 2 a 1 the role complements the copyright offices registration creative works and the courts protection of trade dress and trade secrets under the common law giving life to this law  applying it in specific instances and evolving it to keep up with advances in technology  requires sound policymaking here congress has charged different parts of the commerce department with complementary missions congress has tasked the uspto through the secretary of commerce with advising the president on intellectual property policy matters in the united states and internationally through the office of the under secretary for intellectual property commerce provides policy guidance and advisory and technical assistance consistent with administration policies on domestic ip issues to members of congress and staff officials of government agencies and other ip stakeholders and as the internet has become a leading global platform for economic growth and social progress the role of commerces national telecommunications and information administration ntia also comes into play by statute ntia is the presidents principal adviser on telecommunications policies pertaining to the nations economic and technological advancement since the emergence of the internet on the commercial scene ntia has played a leading role in shaping internet policy in areas such as internet domain names technology innovation privacy and security in these areas ntia and pto have worked together to shape an intellectual property policy that balances strong intellectual property protection with flexibility to allow innovative new applications and services to flourish of course we perform these policy advice functions in collaboration with other u s government stakeholders they include entities within the executive office of the president including the office of science and technology policy trade negotiators at ustr and others as well as the copyright office our diplomatic corps at the state department customs officials at the department of homeland security dhs including law enforcement officers at u s immigration and customs ices national intellectual property rights coordination center ipr center the department of justice and increasingly the federal communications commission establishing a global balanced ruleoflaw for protecting intellectual property increasingly our trading partners around the world also rely on innovative and creative works to drive economic growth but respect for the intellectual property embedded in such works is hardly uniform with the increased significance of intellectual workproduct worldwide there is a parallel upsurge in unauthorized use of intellectual property counterfeiting and piracy that actively undermines americas innovationdriven economy the competitiveness of our companies and the livelihoods of our workers counterfeiting and piracy are a threat to our health safety and national security counterfeiting and piracy have annually cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars the u s chamber of commerce estimates that over 18 million americans are employed by ip intensive industries according to a 2007 study 58 billion was lost to the u s economy in total output from piracy of motion pictures music and sound recordings and business and entertainment software not even the entire copyright industry 1 small businesses are particularly at risk because they often lack the expertise to engage in selfhelp combating piracy and counterfeiting are therefore top priorities here an essential foundational step is to promote worldwide adoption of reasonable legal norms concerning the recognition and protection of ip in parallel we continue to work with congress and the courts to improve the state of u s law right now we are actively engaged with congress to enact patent reform legislation that fairly balances the interest of innovators across all industries and technologies we are seeking legislative changes that will simplify the patent process reduce legal costs improve fairness and make significant progress toward a more harmonized international patent system as global trade continues to climb greater harmonization of patent law will lead to greater efficiency predictability and reliability for u s innovators as the presidents statutory adviser on intellectual property policy commerce and the uspto have been actively involved in developing the u s governments legal position on important court cases in bilski v kappos which was argued in the supreme court in november of this year the united states argued that the uspto appropriately denied patent claims for a business method patent involving a method for hedging risk in the google books matter commerce worked closely with the department of justice and other government agencies to craft a court filing explaining the many benefits of a settlement that would give consumers easy access to vast numbers of outofprint works while articulating a series of concerns about details of the proposed settlement likewise commerce has helped in developing u s litigation positions in other cases involving the usptos rulemaking authority the appropriate standard for considering allegations of collusive conduct in the context of reverse payments from brand name manufacturers to prospective generic competitors in the hatchwaxman context among other important intellectual property matters in the international realm we work closely with the ustr and other agencies to establish on a

trilateral offices the uspto the european patent office and the japan patent office have been meeting to discuss cooperation in the areas of automation and sharing of patentrelated information most recently the trilateral offices have focused on creating new efficiencies in the global patent system as a result worksharing arrangements have been introduced and implemented that allow for accelerated and improved processing of a patent application once an initial office makes a determination of patentable subject matter to address these issues on a larger scale the five largest patent offices  the uspto the european patent office the japan patent office the korean intellectual property office and the state intellectual property office of china  have been meeting since 2007 to
