summer of 95members7743498 posts gender male location shrewsbury posted february 26 2011hi folks this might seem a really stupid question but its got me puzzled and no amount of remembering alevel geography or gcse chemistry can help i know that water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes due to the lower pressure why doesnt it also freeze at lower temperatures too according to this table httpwwwhitmcomdocumentscalibboilhtml at 3000ft altitude water boils at 2066f 54f below sea level bp so why does it still freeze at 32f near the top of snowdon or scafell i know about supercooled water clouds that remain as liquid at 20 or so until they find condensation nuclei but how can snow still fallsettle and lakes freeze at the sealevel freezing point 3000ft up and the boiling point at the 25in850mb level is about 203f so shouldnt the freezing point be about 23f 5c yet ive seen it snow at sea level with the 850mb temp around 28f 2cjohnholmes members2362318388 posts gender male location just south of doncaster sth yorks posted february 26 2011this may answer your basic query about why its a simple answer and better explained than mine would be at this time of the nightwater expands a lot when it boils one kilogram of water is one litre of liquid water but it becomes about 1700 litres of steam at atmospheric pressure this means that even modest increases in altitude can measurably reduce the boiling temperature some people complain that this affects cooking and even the taste of tea at altitude it is also true that pressure changes the melting temperature however because the volume occupied by a kilogram of liquid is not much different from that occupied by a kilogram of solid this effect is very small unless the pressures are very large for most substances the freezing point rises though only very slightly with increased pressurehope that helps in effect changes in pressure up or down have a greater effect on the boiling point of water that effect is very much smaller something like 0001c i think is the figure for the change by about 50000ft someone correct me if that value of altitude is wrong but the change in freezing point is minute there is a very complex answer involving differential calculus and advanced physicsbacktrack kamehamehamembers28038777 posts gender male location runcorn cheshire posted february 26 2011all i know is you cant pop popcorn on a mountain so i think johns explanation has the upper hand here summer of 95members7743498 posts gender male location shrewsbury posted february 27 2011so in other words the lower the pressure the smaller the range of temperatures that produce a liquid state very interesting i suppose then there must be a pressure below which ice just sublimates straight to steam
