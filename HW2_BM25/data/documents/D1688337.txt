suggested by the current slogan of the ys we build strong kids strong families strong communities they include health and fitness programs day camps childcare youth sports job and ged training mentoring counseling for abuse victims international exchanges and substanceabuse preventionan aggregate of programs developed over the long history of the ymca the individual ymcas also belong to the world alliance of ymcas consisting of independent ys from about 130 countries18441900 founding and expansion into an international movement the young mens christian association was founded on june 61844 in london england its prime mover was george williams a draper a cloth and dry goods salesman who had migrated to london from a rural section of the country to seek work at the time the industrial revolution was still condemning many urban dwellers to abysmal working and slumlike living conditions to lives in short of unrelieved gloom and despair like all the workingclass sections of the rapidly overcrowding industrialized cities of england in that era much of london was a virtual cesspool with streets overrun with pickpockets thieves murderous thugs prostitutes beggars drunks and destitute and abandoned children the conditions that charles dickens exposed in such novels as oliver twist 183739 and hard times 1854 williams and some fellow drapers sought to help alleviate the gloom of the city working class by providing christian fellowship prayer and bible study as an alternative to the squalor of the streets their efforts were very successful and the movement quickly spread by 1851 there were 24 ys in great britain with a total membership of 27000 and by late in that same year the movement had spread to north america first to canada and then to the united states where in boston the first ymca was founded on december 29 th under the tutelage of a lay missionary and retired sea captain named thomas sullivan as it did in europe the ymca quickly took hold in the united states and sprang up in various seaboard cities in 1854 the first international convention was held in paris by that time there were almost 400 ys in seven countries having a combined membership of 30369 because it cut across class sex race and denominational barriers that usually segregated various social and ethnic groups during the victorian age the movement was almost unique so was its social aim of ameliorating the plight of the destitute the rapid growth of the ymca in the united states was temporarily reversed during the civil war when y memberships were reduced by twothirds nevertheless the ys in the union states played an important role as the u s christian commission which was formed to assist both soldiers and prisoners of war a necessary rebuilding took place after the war the number of ys at wars end had been reduced to 59 but four years later had grown by an additional 600 in the aftermath of the war the prestigious new york ymca had proclaimed a fourfold mission the improvement of the spiritual mental social and physical condition of young men it was not until the 1880s that the ymcas began erecting buildings that needed fulltime staff members replacing the volunteers that had formerly run the ys by that time large auditoriums swimming pools gymnasiums and bowling alleys were included in the large urban ys as were dormitories or residences that allowed members to lodge in the ys for one or more nights it was in the gyms of the ymca that both basketball and volleyball began their evolution into important indoor sports the residences remained until the late 1950s providing income for the various proliferating ymca activities including boys work programs summer camps special classes featuring such activities as exercise drills using dumbbells medicine balls and indian clubs and social activities for young adults in 1894 george williams was knighted by englands queen victoria for his great contributions to the welfare of his fellow citizens before his death in 1905 he had seen his ymca grow into the premier worldwide organization of its kind a bit earlier in 1899 dwight l moody had died marking an end to formative period in the ymcas development in the united states an influential lay evangelist and national leader moody oversaw the growth of both national and international voluntary and missionary work and was the dominant force in the organization190129 continued growth and wartime services by the end of the century the fourfold purpose advanced by the new york y had been revamped into a triangle spirit mind and body for the next half century the leading figure in the ymca was john mott who like moody was also a lay evangelist as moody had mott served long periods as a staff member paid for his professional services when the united states entered world war i in 1917 mott initiated the move to place ymca volunteers and paid workers at the service of the country operating the canteens at military camps at home and in france the organization also raised funds for other military projects and also took on war relief aid for both prisoners of war and refugees in the wars aftermath it eased the plight of african american soldiers returning to their southern segregated communities and it also supervised laborers in europe brought from china to clear areas devastated by the horrific trench warfare the ymca also used residual funds from its wareffort fund raising to finance a decade of new building to foster its outreach to small communities and to develop ymca trade schools and colleges192940 surviving the great depression and helping the destitute even before the infamous black tuesday that ushered in the great depression in 1929 many of the ymcas were already involved in helping the poor unemployment had been worsening before the stock market crash and in 1928 these associations began using direct relief to alleviate the plight of those out of work less emphasis was given to such things as bible classes which saw enrollment drop by 60 percent between 1929 and 1933 by that year when the new deal programs of franklin d roosevelt had begun providing government relief the ymca and other private nonprofit organizations were able to direct their attention to surviving many of the local ymcas had suffered from a significant loss of income many up to 50 percent that caused some necessary selfscrutiny as did pressure exerted by militant student ymcas which wanted the movement to become more involved in the socioeconomic difficulties facing the nation the result was that the ymca entered partnerships with various welfare agencies engaged in joint community projects the association stressed that both characterbuilding and socialamelioration activities were its responsibility in such unfortunate times in addition to the traditional physical and mental health activities ys across america offered both educational and vocational training as well as medical assistance194179 world war ii and new peacetime challenges and changes as it had in the first world war in the second global conflict the ymca served both the nation and internationally the victims of the war it helped create the uso  united service organization for servicemen and servicewomen and worked with refugees and displaced families the ymca of the usa then known as the nation council of ymcas also collaborated with ymcas in thirtysix other countries to aid prisoners of war however with peace and the onset of the cold war the ymca faced new challenges world war ii had prompted a growing sense of womens opportunities outside the home and by the end of it 62 percent of the nations ys were admitting women in 1944 ymca youth secretaries had adopted what became known as the four fronts of youth work yindian guides a fatherson program and three boys clubs gray junior hiy and hiy these originally for boys alone would eventually serve as models for similar clubs for girls and finally for genderintegrated clubs there was still an emphasis on youth but the gradual shift from young christian men to the entire family without any gender sectarian or racial restrictions was underway and would not be reversed in the next decade the ymca undertook a program to refurbish some of its facilities and build new ones in 1958 with canadian ys under the rubric buildings for brotherhood the y raised 55 million to renovate or build almost 100 buildings at home and abroad after the war many old ymcas in the inner cities had been abandoned as demographic changes shifted americas rapidly growing citizenry into suburbia forcing the ymcas to relocate or dissolve through membership attrition during the social and cultural upheaval of 1960s and early 1970s exacerbated by the vietnam war the ymca faced new challenges it was charged by its national general secretary james bunting to discover new ways to remain both viable and relevant or face possible dissolution in some parts of the country certain programs like the fourfronts youth programs were already dying for lack of interest with the support of the ymca of the usa and federal aid community ys redoubled their outreach efforts offering some new programs but when the federal aid was withdrawn many ys faced financial problems the organization was also subjected to some aggressive criticism both at home and abroad something difficult for many of its associates to countenance however starting around 1975 thanks to a growing health consciousness in america there was a resurgence of interest in physical training programs and facilities of the ys19802000 revamping the ymcas image and redefining its mission the new health consciousness and the rapid increase of families in which both parents or a single parent are employed prompted a new period of growth and program changes in the 1980s responding to community needs local ys began updating both their facilities and their equipment becoming family health and fitness centers on a par with many of the burgeoning private health clubs in 1983 ys also began formalizing childcare services for working parents a service that had been provided for years it quickly became an important source of income for the association starting in 1984 the refurbishing and updating of the ys brought them under the scrutiny of federal and local tax authorities why the various agencies asked were ys tax exempt when they seemed no different in kind than privately owned health clubs and spas by 1992 when the query lost its steam the matter had been raised in 40 states and although the investigation had no effect on the ymcas nonprofit status it did prompt a reexamination of the organizations mission and programs the first such reappraisal undertaken since the 1930s the last decade of the century found the nations ys in good health with a stabilized array of income resources an increase in both clients and volunteers and an impressive spread of programs reflecting the movements sensitivity to social change also the organizations selfscrutiny and reevaluation begun in 1980s gave the ys in their own words a new appreciation both for their mission as community service agencies and for the judeochristian values that lie at the heart of the movement according to the organization during the 1980s and 90s the ideas of values clarification were slowly replaced by ideas of character much of the concern in the national leadership of the ymca has been directed to the moral laxity and relativism and disruption of the family that seemed to be eroding traditional values in which the ymca itself was firmly rooted the result was the formulation of four core values caring honesty respect and responsibility part of an assetbased approach to solving social problems through developing character and instilling a sense of civic virtue in the nations youth in collaboration with the search institute the ymca of the usa studied the issue and turned its findings into practical results measures to enhance family and youth assets that would serve as shields against irresponsibility and unhealthy or negative behavior clearly it is through this sort of continuing selfappraisal and redefinition of its mission in response to social change that the ymca will continue to thrive principal subsidiaries three aches
