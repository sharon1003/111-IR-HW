author topic remote control of electric trolling motoroldfoxy posted 08072008 1040 am et us i have a 9 foot inflatable outcast pontoon boat with a minn kota 30 electric trolling motor what i would like to do is put a onoffmom on switch on the arm of the swivel seat so that i can control the motor without turning around and using the tiller control i mainly want this feature for controled drift fishing and would be using the lowest speed i want the momentary position so i can bump the motor up when needed and the on for use when i use the tiller steering is not a problem as i have adapted the oars to be used as a rudder system the switch i am looking at is cole hersee heavy duty toggle switch  3 screw term onoffmom on rated 25amperehow do i wire it into my battery cable that goes from the motor to the battery where it has 3 terminals should i put a manual circuit breaker in for saftey im a novice at this so any help would be appreciated thanks jerryjimh posted 08072008 1123 am et us to wire a switch just insert it into the circuit in the positive lead between the source and the load however i do not recommend that you try to control a trolling motor with a switch to control heavy current loads you should use a relay or solenoid wire the solenoid contacts into the primary battery distribution between the battery and the trolling motor wire the solenoid or relay coil to your remote control switcholdfoxy posted 08072008 1147 am et us thanks for the reply jim could you give me some idea of what type of solenoid or relay i should use as i said i am a novice at this 12 volt wiring stuff the trolling motor draws a max of 30 amps a high speed which i will not be using with the switch i will be using the lowest setting thanks jerryjimh posted 08072008 0141 pm et us this product would be overkillhttpblueseacomcategory414productspecs9012you could probably use a standard starter motor solenoid they are about 30 or lessoldfoxy posted 08072008 0247 pm et us price wise will this workhttpwwwjamestowndistributorscomuserportalshowproduct dopid11941nextagjimh posted 08072008 0823 pm et us on further review as the referees in the nfl say it looks like the switch is rated for 25amperes since you say that the motor only draws 30amperes at maximum and you plan to only run it at very low settings you probably are ok with the switch it might be a bit awkward running the wires to the switch as you will need at least 10awg wire to handle the current and perhaps even larger wire to keep the voltage drop down the starting solenoid is probably not designed for continuous duty but for 14 i would give it a try using a solenoid will allow you to keep the wiring to the remote control very light gauge wire the coil ought not to draw more than 1ampere wire the solenoid in parallel with the control on the motor but do it so that the motor speed control is still in the circuitoldfoxy posted 08082008 1018 am et us thanks for the updatethe cable that goes from the motor to the battery now is 14 ga wire with spade connectors oem should i change this whole cable to 10 ga wireoldfoxy posted 08082008 1154 am et us update looking at a few schematics of the minn kota motors they use 14 ga leads on the endura 30  34 pount thrust motors from 36 pound and up they use a 10 ga leadjimh posted 08082008 1219 pm et us since your whole boat is only 9feet long i dont imagine the battery cables are likely to have much voltage drop i am beginning to wonder if remote control of a motor is really necessary on a boat that is 9feet long
