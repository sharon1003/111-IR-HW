telomeres molecular biology dna evolutionary biology cell biology genetics and heredity biology if telomeres are constantly being shortened with each cell division then how are our offspring born with fresh and complete chromosomes5 answers kirk janowiak m s x 2 biology  ethology purdue university answered sep 27 2014 · upvoted by quora user and adriana heguy · author has 26k answers and 32m answer views consider this the gametes egg and sperm cells of mother and father have only divided essentially one or two times any shortening of the telomeres would be quite minimal when compared to skin cells of an adult that have divided as many as 100 times before they were sent into apoptosis to be recycled even so this might mean that after a number of generations from now the telomeres of that family might be quite short and result in problems with moving that familys genes into the future good pointbut the telomeres of the gametes do not shorten so that is half the answer to your question while normal body cells do experience shortening of the telomeres with each successive mitotic event gametes egg and sperm do not in addition at fertilization of the egg by the sperm the mitotic divisions that happen in the zygote and later in the developing embryo telomere shortening is temporarily offset by activation of the enzyme telomerase telomerase is responsible for manufacturing the tailends of the dna strands that protect the ends of each chromosomechromatid and keep the protective tail the proper length telomerase remains active until well into the development cycle as the embryo divides and divides producing millions upon millions of cells until we have a fullterm offspring possessing many billions of cells after the time of birth the interval is a bit fuzzy the telomerase is deactivated in most cells as it is in all adult organisms and the telomeres begin to be eroded with each mitotic division any individual somatic body cell can divide about 100 times at that point the protective telomeres will have eroded to the degree that a signal is sent in the nucleus that prevents further mitosis in that cell accumulated damage accidents and other destructive or weakening events will send that cell into apoptosis  programmed cell death52k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to datepromoted by uc berkeley

may 17 2017 · author has 163 answers and 2694k answer views when a cell’s telomeres get too short it can no longer replicate and eventually dies a few cells — namely adult stem cells as well as sperm and egg cells — are not limited by this process though these cells have an enzyme named telomerase that can rebuild telomeres when they get too short this process is hijacked by cancer cells which become effectively immortal by turning on telomerase there are several indications that telomere length is a good predictor of longevity in newborns telomere length varies from about 800013000 “ base pairs ” dna letters in length and declines by about 2040 base pairs each year telomeres are also longer in women than men mirroring the difference in lifespan between the sexes in elderly twins the twin with shorter telomeres is roughly three times more likely to die first the variability in telomere length between people of the same age is not random and has a genetic component that has interested scientists for decades in a recent study in the journal nature genetics scientists identified multiple markers that are associated with either shorter or longer telomeres the strongest of these  resides near a gene named terc each copy of a “t” at this position is associated with an average 117 base pair decrease in telomere length equivalent to having the “biological age” of a person about four years older a person’s genetic makeup is not the only determinant of telomere length environmental factors such as smoking and obesity bring about premature telomere shortening telomere length is also highly influenced by the age of the father at conception because sperm cells are one of only a few types of cells that maintain or even increase their telomere length over time the trend is for older fathers to have children with longer telomeres this effect can even carry over a second generation to grandchildren it’s interesting to speculate that the trends in some societies towards delaying parenthood may have the unexpected benefit of boosting life expectancy any such benefit however would have to be weighed against known risks of being an older dadand also during meiosis telomeres control chromosome movements particularly bouquet formation at the leptotene stage homologous pairing and interaction with microtubules and spindles in telomerase null mice short telomeres are associated with infertility abnormal spindles and misalignment of metaphase chromosomes in oocytes however mouse telomeres are much longer than those of humans and telomere erosion in mice takes several generations to reach a critical point in humans telomere length in human unfertilized oocytes correlated with the morphological appearance of embryo quality in sibling fertilized oocytes as well as the likelihood of pregnancy however no measurements of telomere length in human embryos were made directly458 views · view upvoterspromoted by better help are you struggling

has given the perfect and detailed answer to your question as pointed out by him gametes undergo cell division only once to form a haploid cell with half the chromosomes same as that present at the time of embryo thus it is not subjected to repeat cell division leading to shortning of repetitive dna ends telomeres and thus the offsprings have the complete set of genetic material240 views ·
