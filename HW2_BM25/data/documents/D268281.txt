technology overview if you need to have a pacemaker fitted a small electrical device called a pacemaker will be surgically implanted in your chest the pacemaker sends electrical pulses to your heart to keep it beating regularly and not too slowly having a pacemaker can significantly improve your quality of life if you have problems with a slow heart rate the device can be lifesaving for some people in the uk pacemaker implantation is one of the most common types of heart surgery carried out with many thousands of pacemakers fitted each year how a pacemaker works a pacemaker is a small device about the size of a matchbox that weighs 2050g it consists of a pulse generator – which has a battery and a tiny computer circuit – and one or more wires known as pacing leads which attach to your heart the pulse generator emits electrical impulses through the wires to your heart the rate at which the electrical impulses are sent out is called the pacing rate almost all modern pacemakers work on demand this means they can be programmed to adjust the discharge rate in response to your bodys needs if the pacemaker senses that your heart has missed a beat or is beating too slowly it sends signals at a steady rate if it senses that your heart is beating normally by itself it doesnt send out any signals most pacemakers have a special sensor that recognises body movement or your breathing rate this allows them to speed up the discharge rate when youre active doctors describe this as rate responsive implantable cardioverter defibrillators icdsan implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd is a device similar to a pacemaker it sends a larger electrical shock to the heart that essentially reboots it to get it pumping again some devices contain both a pacemaker and an icd icds are often used as a preventative treatment for people thought to be at risk of cardiac arrest at some point in the future if the icd senses the heart is beating at a potentially dangerous abnormal rate it will deliver an electrical shock to the heart this often helps return the heart to a normal rhythm a conventional icd has a pacing lead thats implanted along a vein transvenously theres also a newer type of icd where the pacing lead is implanted under the skin subcutaneously why do i need a pacemaker the heart is essentially a pump made of muscle which is controlled by electrical signals these signals can become disrupted for several reasons which can lead to a number of potentially dangerous heart conditions such asan abnormally slow heartbeat bradycardiaan abnormally fast heartbeat tachycardiaheart block – where your heart beats irregularly because the electrical signals that control your heartbeat arent transmitted properlycardiac arrest – when a problem with the hearts electrical signals cause the heart to stop beating altogether read more about why you might need a pacemaker how is a pacemaker fitted having a pacemaker implanted is a relatively straightforward process its usually carried out under local anaesthetic which means youll be awake during the procedure the generator is usually placed under the skin near the collarbone on the left side of the chest the generator is attached to a wire thats guided through a blood vessel to the heart the procedure usually takes about an hour and most people are well enough to leave hospital the day after surgery read more about how a pacemaker is fitted after pacemaker surgery you should be able to return to normal physical activities soon after surgery as a precaution its usually recommended that strenuous activities are avoided for around four to six weeks after having a pacemaker fitted after this you should be able to do most activities and sports youll be able to feel the pacemaker but youll soon get used to it it may seem a bit heavy at first and may feel uncomfortable when you lie in certain positions youll need to attend regular checkups to make sure your pacemaker is working properly most pacemakers store information about your natural heart rhythms when you have followup appointments your doctor can retrieve this information and use it to check how well your heart and the pacemaker are working most ordinary household electrical equipment is safe to use and wont interfere with your pacemaker this includes microwaves as long as theyre in good working order read more about recovering from pacemaker surgery  safety having a pacemaker implanted is usually a very safe procedure with a low risk of complications the biggest concern is the pacemaker losing its ability to control the heartbeat either because it malfunctions or the wire moves out of the correct position its sometimes possible to reprogramme the pacemaker to fix a malfunction using wireless signals however further surgery may be needed if the pacemaker moves out of position read more about the risks of having a pacemaker alternatives to a pacemaker in some cases it may be possible to control an abnormal heartbeat arrhythmia without having a pacemaker fitted for example atrial fibrillation can sometimes be treated with medication or a nonsurgical procedure called catheter ablation however not all people with an arrhythmia can be treated in this way and in many cases a pacemaker is considered to be the most effective option if your cardiologist recommends having a pacemaker fitted ask them why they think its the best option and discuss any possible alternative treatments you could have new technology a new smaller pacemaker about the size of a pill has been developed and is currently being tested in a global clinical trial the new device uses wireless technology and can be implanted directly into the heart where it delivers electrical impulses from an electrode this means a lead isnt required which has the benefits of lowering the risk of infection and shortening the recovery time associated with implanting traditional pacemakers
