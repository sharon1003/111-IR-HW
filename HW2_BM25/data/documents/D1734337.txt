the leading cause of kidney disease in patients starting renal replacement therapy and affects ∼40 of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients it increases the risk of death mainly from cardiovascular causes and is defined by increased urinary albumin excretion uae in the absence of other renal diseases diabetic nephropathy is categorized into stages microalbuminuria uae 20 μgmin and ≤199 μgmin and macroalbuminuria uae ≥200 μgmin hyperglycemia increased blood pressure levels and genetic predisposition are the main risk factors for the development of diabetic nephropathy elevated serum lipids smoking habits and the amount and origin of dietary protein also seem to play a role as risk factors screening for microalbuminuria should be performed yearly starting 5 years after diagnosis in type 1 diabetes or earlier in the presence of puberty or poor metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes screening should be performed at diagnosis and yearly thereafter patients with micro and macroalbuminuria should undergo an evaluation regarding the presence of comorbid associations especially retinopathy and macrovascular disease achieving the best metabolic control a1c 7 treating

system uae urinary albumin excretion ukpds u k prospective diabetes study definition and epidemiologydiabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in patients starting renal replacement therapy  1 and is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality  2  diabetic nephropathy has been classically defined by the presence of proteinuria 05 g24 h this stage has been referred to as overt nephropathy clinical nephropathy proteinuria or macroalbuminuria in the early 1980s seminal studies from europe revealed that small amounts of albumin in the urine not usually detected by conventional methods were predictive of the later development of proteinuria in type 1  3 – 5 and type 2  6 diabetic patients this stage of renal involvement was termed microalbuminuria or incipient nephropathy the cumulative incidence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes was 126 over 73 years according to the european diabetes eurodiab prospective complications study group  7 and ∼33 in an 18year followup study in denmark  8  in patients with type 2 diabetes the incidence of microalbuminuria was 20 per year and the prevalence 10 years after diagnosis 25 in the u k prospective diabetes study ukpds  9  proteinuria occurs in 15–40 of patients with type 1 diabetes with a peak incidence around 15–20 years of diabetes  8 10 11  in patients with type 2 diabetes the prevalence is highly variable ranging from 5 to 20  2 9  diabetic nephropathy is more prevalent among african americans asians and native americans than caucasians  1 12  among patients starting renal replacement therapy the incidence of diabetic nephropathy doubled from the years 1991–2001  1  fortunately the rate of increase has slowed down probably because of the adoption in clinical practice of several measures that contribute to the early diagnosis and prevention of diabetic nephropathy which thereby decreases the progression of established renal disease however the implementation of these measures is far below the desirable goals  13  the aim of this article is to discuss the methods for early screening and diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy and the therapeutic strategies that promote reno and cardioprotection in this highrisk group of patients in order to reduce the incidence of diabetic nephropathy and its associated cardiovascular mortality stages clinical features and clinical coursediabetic nephropathy has been didactically categorized into stages based on the values of urinary albumin excretion uae microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria the cutoff values adopted by the american diabetes association  14 timed 24h and spot urine collection for the diagnosis of micro and macroalbuminuria as well as the main clinical features of each stage are depicted in table 1 there is accumulating evidence suggesting that the risk for developing diabetic nephropathy  15 – 18 and cardiovascular disease  19 20 starts when uae values are still within the normoalbuminuric range progression to micro or macroalbuminuria was more frequent in patients with type 2 diabetes with baseline uae above the median 25 mg24 h  15  after 10 years of followup the risk of diabetic nephropathy was 29 times greater in patients with type 2 diabetes with uae values 10 μgmin  16  the same was true for patients with type 1 diabetes  17  this favors the concept that the risk associated with uae is a continuum as is the case with blood pressure levels  21  possibly values of uae lower than those currently used for microalbuminuria diagnosis should be established although microalbuminuria has been considered a risk factor for macroalbuminuria not all patients progress to this stage and some may regress to normoalbuminuria  22  the initial studies in the 1980s demonstrated that ∼80 of microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients progressed to proteinuria over a period of 6–14 years  3 – 5  in more recent studies only 30–45 of microalbuminuric patients have been reported to progress to proteinuria over 10 years  22  maybe as a result of more intensive glycemic and blood pressure control strategies in fact a recent study involving type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria reported a uae reduction of 50 or greater in 56 of the patients  23  this reduction was primarily related to a short duration of microalbuminuria a1c 8 systolic blood pressure 115 mm hg and favorable lipid profile total cholesterol 198 mgdl and triglycerides 145 mgdl screening and diagnosisscreening for diabetic nephropathy must be initiated at the time of diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes  14  since ∼7 of them already have microalbuminuria at that time  9  for patients with type 1 diabetes the first screening has been recommended at 5 years after diagnosis  14  however the prevalence of microalbuminuria before 5 years in this group can reach 18 especially in patients with poor glycemic and lipid control and high normal blood pressure levels  24  furthermore puberty is an independent risk factor for microalbuminuria  25  therefore in type 1 diabetes screening for microalbuminuria might be performed 1 year after diabetes diagnosis especially in patients with poor metabolic control and after the onset of puberty if microalbuminuria is absent the screening must be repeated annually for both type 1 and 2 diabetic patients  14  the first step in the screening and diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is to measure albumin in a spot urine sample collected either as the first urine in the morning or at random for example at the medical visit this method is accurate easy to perform and recommended by american diabetes association guidelines  14  twentyfour–hour and timed urine collections are cumbersome and prone to errors related to collecting samples or recording of time the results of albumin measurements in spot collections may be expressed as urinary albumin concentration mgl  26 27 or as urinary albumintocreatinine ratio mgg or mgmmol  14 27 28  although expressing the results as albumin concentration might be influenced by dilutionconcentration of the urine sample this option is still accurate and cheaper than expression as albumintocreatinine ratio  26  the cutoff value of 17 mgl in a random urine specimen had a sensitivity of 100 and a specificity of 80 for the diagnosis of microalbuminuria when 24h timed urine collection was the reference standard  29  this value is similar to the cutoff value of 20 mgl recommended by the european diabetes policy group  27  all abnormal tests must be confirmed in two out of three samples collected over a 3 to 6month period  14 28  due to the known daytoday variability in uae screening should not be performed in the presence of conditions that increase uae such as urinary tract infection hematuria acute febrile illness vigorous exercise shortterm pronounced hyperglycemia uncontrolled hypertension and heart failure  30  samples must be refrigerated if they are to be used the same day or the next day and one freeze is acceptable before measurements  28  immunoassays routinely used for albumin measurements present adequate diagnostic sensitivity for detection of diabetic nephropathy however it was recently demonstrated that conventional immunochemicalbased assays did not detect an unreactive fraction of albuminuria underestimating uae  31  highperformance liquid chromatography measures total albumin including immunoreactive and immunounreactive forms and may allow early detection of incipient diabetic nephropathy in situations where specific uae measurements are not available semiquantitative dipstick measurements of albuminuria such as micral test ii can be used  14 32  another alternative is to use a qualitative test for proteinuria dipstick  33 or a quantitative measurement of protein in a spot urine sample  26 28 34  the presence of a positive dipstick combur m boehring manheim or a urinary protein concentration 430 mgl has a sensitivity of 100 for both tests and a specificity of 82 and 93 respectively for the diagnosis of proteinuria  34  an abnormal result should be confirmed by measurement of total protein in a 24h urine sample values 500 mg24 h confirm the diagnosis of proteinuria patients with lower values may still have microalbuminuria since this method is not sensitive enough to detect small increments in uae although the measurement of uae is the cornerstone for the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy there are some patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have decreased glomerular filtration rate gfr in the presence of normal uae  35 36  in patients with type 1 diabetes this phenomenon seems to be more common among female patients with longstanding diabetes hypertension andor retinopathy  35  for patients with type 2 diabetes in nhanes iii third national health and nutrition examination survey n  1197 low gfr 60 ml · min −1 · 173 m −2 was present in 30 of patients in the absence of micro or macroalbuminuria and retinopathy  37  although renal biopsy was not performed this observation was probably related to renal parenchymal disease other than classical diabetic glomerulosclerosis these studies indicate that normoalbuminuria does not protect from a decrease in gfr in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients therefore gfr should be routinely estimated and uae routinely measured for a proper screening of diabetic nephropathy gfr can be measured by specific techniques such as inulin clearance 51 credta 125 iiothalamate and iohexol  38  the clearance of endogenous creatinine is commonly used despite its limitations  39  in clinical practice gfr can be estimated by prediction equations that take into account serum creatinine concentration and some or all of the following variables age sex race and body size the recommended  40 equation by the national kidney foundation is that of the mdrd modified diet in renal disease gfr ml · min −1 · 173 m −2  186 × serum creatinine mgdl −1154 × age years −0203 × 0742 if female × 1210 if african american a userfriendly way to use this formula is available online  wwwkidneyorgklsprofessionalsgfrcalculatorcfm  the cockroftgault equation creatinine clearance mlmin   140 − age years × weight kg 72 × serum creatinine mgdl × 085 if female is less accurate  40  the reference range of gfr values in young individuals is from 80 to 130 ml · min −1 · 173 m −2 declining at ∼10 ml · min −1 · decade −1 after 50 years of age  41  risk factors and pathogenesisdiabetic nephropathy develops in at most 40 of patients with diabetes even when high glucose levels are maintained for long periods of time this observation raised the concept that a subset of patients have an increased susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy furthermore epidemiological  42 and familial studies  43 – 47 have demonstrated that genetic susceptibility contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes the main potentially modifiable diabetic nephropathy initiation and progression factors in susceptible individuals are sustained hyperglycemia  17 18 48 49 and hypertension  50 – 52  other putative risk factors are glomerular hyperfiltration  53 – 55  smoking  56 57  dyslipidemia  18 50 58 59  proteinuria levels  60 61  and dietary factors such as the amount and source of protein  62 – 64 and fat  65 in the diet pathologydiabetes causes unique changes in kidney structure classic glomerulosclerosis is characterized by increased glomerular basement membrane width diffuse mesangial sclerosis hyalinosis microaneurysm and hyaline arteriosclerosis  66  tubular  67 and interstitial  68 changes are also present areas of extreme mesangial expansion called kimmelstielwilson nodules or nodular mesangial expansion are observed in 40–50 of patients developing proteinuria  69  micro and macroalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes have more structural heterogeneity than patients with type 1 diabetes  70 71  evaluated by electron microscopy the severity of glomerular lesions is related to gfr and uae  72 – 74 and to diabetes duration  73 75  degree of glycemic control  76  and genetic factors  77 78  nonetheless there is an important overlap in mesangial expansion and glomerular basement membrane thickening among normoalbuminuric microalbuminuric and proteinuric type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients  73 74  with no clear cutoff to distinguish the groups evaluation of patients with diabetic nephropathyafter the diagnosis of micro or macroalbuminuria is confirmed patients should undergo a complete evaluation including a workup for other etiologies and an assessment of renal function and the presence of other comorbid associations differential diagnosis differential diagnosis is usually based on the history physical examination laboratory evaluation and imaging of the kidneys renal biopsy is only recommended in special situations the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is easily established in longterm type 1 diabetic patients 10 years diabetes duration especially if retinopathy is also present typical diabetic nephropathy is also likely to be present in proteinuric type 2 diabetic patients with retinopathy however diagnostic uncertainty exists in some patients with type 2 diabetes since the onset of diabetes is unknown and retinopathy is absent in a significant proportion 28 of these patients  79  the presence of symptoms during urination suggests urinary tract disorders such as obstruction infection or stones skin rash or arthritis may indicate systemic lupus erythematosus or cryoglobulinemia presence of risk factors for parenterally transmitted disease may raise the suspicion of kidney disease associated with hiv hepatitis c or hepatitis b history of proteinuria andor hypertension during childhood or pregnancy may suggest other glomerulonephritis also family history of kidney disease may indicate the presence of polycystic kidney disease or other genetic diseases  40  imaging of the kidneys usually by ultrasonography should be performed in patients with symptoms of urinary tract obstruction infection or kidney stones or with a family history of polycystic kidney disease  40  the criteria for renal biopsy are not well established but in type 1 diabetes the presence of proteinuria in association with short diabetes duration andor rapid decline of renal function especially in the absence of diabetic retinopathy have been used  80  in patients with type 2 diabetes the criteria are less clear the proportion of nondiabetic renal lesions in proteinuric type 2 diabetic patients seems to vary according to the criteria used to perform the biopsy and to the ethnic background of the patient when absence of retinopathy was the biopsy criterion in 49 proteinuric caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes only 12 had nondiabetic glomerulonephritis  79  on the other hand other nephropathies isolated or superimposed onto diabetic glomerulosclerosis were observed in 46 and 19 respectively of 68 chinese patients with type 2 diabetes proteinuria 1 g24 h renal involvement in the absence of retinopathy or unexplained hematuria were the reasons for performing a biopsy  81  patients with nondiabetic glomerulosclerosis had a better prognosis than those with diabetic glomerulosclerosis alone or in association with other nephropathies  81  however the real benefit of identifying and treating nondiabetic renal lesions in patients with diabetes remains to be established monitoring of renal function gfr is the best parameter of overall kidney function  40 and should be measured or estimated in micro and macroalbuminuric diabetic patients in microalbuminuric patients gfr may remain stable but a subset of patients has shown a rapid decline in gfr levels  82  in type 1 macroalbuminuric patients gfr declines about 12 ml · min −1 · month −1 without therapeutic interventions  83  in patients with type 2 diabetes gfr decline is more variable one study reported a mean decline of ∼05 ml · min −1 · month −1  84  although in some patients gfr may remain stable for long periods  85  patients with a more rapid gfr decline usually have more advanced diabetic glomerulopathy and worse metabolic control  82  patients should be referred to a nephrologist for evaluation and comanagement when gfr reaches 30 ml · min −1 · 173 m −2 since there is evidence that nephrologist care may improve morbidity and mortality when patients enter renal replacement therapy  40  comorbid associations it is particularly important to investigate retinopathy ideally this should be done by an experienced ophthalmologist since retinopathy is frequent in the presence of diabetic nephropathy and is a clue for its diagnosis prospective studies in type 2 diabetic patients showed that diabetic retinopathy was a predictor of later development of diabetic nephropathy  16 18  retinopathy is probably a risk marker and not a risk factor in itself since these microvascular complications diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy share common determinants such as poor glycemic blood pressure and lipid control other complications of diabetes such as peripheral and autonomic neuropathy should also be evaluated since they are seen more frequently in patients with diabetic nephropathy  86 87 and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality patients with diabetic nephropathy due to their high cardiovascular risk should be routinely evaluated for the presence of coronary heart disease independently of the presence of cardiac symptoms other atherosclerotic complications such as carotid disease peripheral artery disease and atherosclerotic renalartery stenosis should also be assessed radiocontrast agents used in angiography may cause acute renal failure in up to 35 of diabetic patients especially in those with decreased renal function  88  this can be prevented by prior hydration and administration of an isoosmolar contrast media  89  acetylcysteine a freeradical scavenger has also been shown to be renoprotective in some studies  90  but this was not confirmed in a recent study  91  critical renalartery stenosis 70 occurs in ∼17 of hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients  92 and may be associated with hypertension and renal insufficiency ischemic nephropathy in these patients the use of ace inhibitors or angiotensin ii type 1 receptor blockers arbs could reduce transcapillary filtration pressure leading to acute or chronic renal insufficiency especially if renalartery stenosis affects both kidneys or the sole functioning kidney a rise in serum creatinine 50 after use of these agents is a clue for the presence of renalartery stenosis  93  other suggestive features are renal impairment with minimal or absent proteinuria absent or minimal diabetic retinopathy presence of macrovascular disease in other sites coronary carotid and peripheral arteries vascular bruits especially femoral and asymmetric kidney shrinkage on renal ultrasound  93  magnetic resonance angiography is the method of choice to screen for renalartery stenosis in diabetic patients other options even though with lower sensitivity are captopril renal scintigraphy and duplex doppler ultrasonography imaging of the renal arteries captopril renal scintigraphy has limitations in patients with decreased renal function serum creatinine 20 mgdl and doppler ultrasonography is heavily dependent on operator experience  94  rarely does renal revascularization cure hypertension but it may improve or stabilize renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease  94  prevention and treatmentprevention normoalbuminuric patients the basis for the prevention of diabetic nephropathy is the treatment of its known risk factors hypertension hyperglycemia smoking and dyslipidemia these are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease and should be vigorously treated intensive blood glucose control clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that a1c levels 7 are associated with decreased risk for clinical and structural manifestations of diabetic nephropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients in the diabetes control and complications trial dcct intensive treatment of diabetes reduced the incidence of microalbuminuria by 39  95  it is interesting to note that patients randomized to strict glycemic control had a longlasting reduction of ∼40 in the risk for development of microalbuminuria and hypertension 7–8 years after the end of the dcct  96  in the ukpds a 30 risk reduction for the development of microalbuminuria was observed in the group intensively treated for hyperglycemia  97  moreover in the kumamoto study intensive glycemic control also reduced the rate of development of micro and macroalbuminuria  98  therefore intensive treatment of glycemia aiming at a1c 7 should be pursued as early as possible to prevent the development of microalbuminuria intensive blood pressure control treatment of hypertension dramatically reduces the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events in patients with diabetes hypertension is common in diabetic patients even when renal involvement is not present about 40 of type 1 and 70 of type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria have blood pressure levels 14090 mm hg  99  in the ukpds a reduction from 154 to 144 mm hg on systolic blood pressure reduced the risk for the development of microalbuminuria by 29  100  blood pressure targets for patients with diabetes are lower 13080 mm hg than those for patients without diabetes  101  in the hot hypertension optimal treatment study a reduction of diastolic blood pressure from 85 to 81 mm hg resulted in a 50 reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetic but not nondiabetic patients  102  reninangiotensin system blockade the role of ace inhibitors in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes has not been defined the use of perindopril during 3 years in normotensive normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients delayed the increase in albuminuria  103  in patients with type 2 diabetes ace inhibitors and arbs both diminish the risk for diabetic nephropathy  104 105 and reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events  106  in the microhope heart outcomes prevention evaluation study  106  ramipril 10 mgday decreased the risk of overt nephropathy by 24 and the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes who were 55 years of age with one additional cardiovascular risk factor by 37 moreover ramipril reduced uae at 1 year and at the end of the study  106  therefore ace inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial for reno and cardioprotection in patients with type 2 diabetes treatment micro and macroalbuminuric patients the goal of treatment is to prevent the progression from micro to macroalbuminuria the decline of renal function in patients with macroalbuminuria and the occurrence of cardiovascular events the treatment principles are the same as those adopted for the prevention of diabetic nephropathy although in this case multiple and more intensive strategies must be used the strategies and goals are described in table 2 intensive blood glucose control the effect of strict glycemic control on the progression from micro to macroalbuminuria and on the rate of renal function decline in macroalbuminuric patients is still controversial in the dcct study intensified glycemic control did not decrease the rate of progression to macroalbuminuria in patients with type 1 diabetes who were microalbuminuric at the beginning of the study  95 107  the microalbuminuria collaborative study group reported similar findings  108  however these studies  107 108 were underpowered to detect an effect of intensified glycemic control on the progression from micro to macroalbuminuria moreover improvement of glycemic control especially if associated with lower blood pressure levels reduced the renal function decline in proteinuric type 1 diabetic patients  109  in patients with type 2 diabetes very few studies analyzed the role of blood glucose control on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in the kumamoto study a reduction in the conversion from micro to macroalbuminuria was observed with intensive treatment  98  although the effects of strict glycemic control on the progression of diabetic nephropathy are not firmly established it should be pursued in all these patients some oral antihyperglycemic agents seem to be especially useful rosiglitazone as compared with glyburide has been shown to decrease uae in patients with type 2 diabetes this suggests a beneficial effect in the prevention of renal complications of type 2 diabetes  110  also the use of antihyperglycemic agents in proteinuric type 2 diabetic patients should take renal function into account metformin should not be used when serum creatinine is 15 mgdl in men and 14 mgdl in women due to the increased risk of lactic acidosis  111  sulfonylureas and their metabolites except glimepiride are eliminated via renal excretion and should not be used in patients with decreased renal function  112  repaglinide  113 and nateglinide  114 have a short duration of action are excreted independently of renal function and have a safety profile in patients with renal impairment however at this point sulfonylureas and insulin secretagogues are usually not very effective due to the low endogenous production of insulin resulting from the long duration of diabetes thus most type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy should be treated with insulin intensive blood pressure treatment and reninangiotensin system blockade in microalbuminuric type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of hypertension irrespective of the agent used produced a beneficial effect on albuminuria  115  reninangiotensin system ras blockade with ace inhibitors or arbs confers an additional benefit on renal function this renoprotective effect is independent of blood pressure reduction  115 116 and may be related to decreased intraglomerular pressure and passage of proteins into the proximal tubule  117  these drugs decrease uae and the rate of progression from microalbuminuria to more advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy a metaanalysis of 12 trials evaluating 698 nonhypertensive microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients showed that treatment with ace inhibitors decreased the risk of progression to macroalbuminuria by 60 and increased the chances of regression to normoalbuminuria  118  arbs were also effective in reducing the development of macroalbuminuria in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients irbesartan 300 mgday reduced the risk of progression to overt diabetic nephropathy by 70 in a 2year followup study of 590 hypertensive microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients  119  additionally a 38 reduction in uae was observed with 34 of patients reversing to normoalbuminuria it is also interesting to note that uae was still reduced 1 month after the withdrawal of irbesartan  120  in another trial valsartan 80 mgday produced a greater reduction in uae than amlodipine 44 vs 8 with the same degree of blood pressure reduction  116  these data reinforce the idea that the antiproteinuric effect of arbs is blood pressure independent although there is no longterm study comparing the effects of ace inhibitors and arbs on the progression from microalbuminuria to overt diabetic nephropathy both agents led to a similar reduction in albuminuria in a 12week study  121 and a 1year study  122  therefore the use of either ace inhibitors or arbs is recommended as a firstline therapy for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria even if they are normotensive  14  in proteinuric patients mogensen  123 was the first to demonstrate almost 30 years ago that treatment of hypertension reduced albuminuria and the rate of gfr decline in type 1 diabetic patients subsequently other studies have clearly demonstrated that aggressive treatment of hypertension has a strong beneficial effect in reducing gfr decline in proteinuric type 1 diabetic patients  124  this reduction in gfr decline was predicted by reduction in albuminuria  125  according to the mdrd modification of diet in renal disease trial the lower the blood pressure the greater the preservation of renal function in nondiabetic patients  126  patients with proteinuria 1 gday and renal insufficiency had slower decline in renal function when blood pressure was 12575 mm hg  126  although this study included mainly nondiabetic patients this goal also has been recommended for proteinuric diabetic patients  127  addition of ace inhibitors in proteinuric type 1 diabetic patients  128 or arbs in macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients  129 130 decreased proteinuria and renal function decline although there was no difference in the cardiovascular event rate a significantly lower incidence of congestive heart failure was observed among patients receiving arbs  129  the antiproteinuric effect of arbs has certain characteristics it occurs early within 7 days after treatment is started and persists stable thereafter  131  and it is independent of blood pressure reduction  116 and has a doseresponse effect beyond the doses needed to control blood pressure  132  an acute increase in serum creatinine of up to 30–35 stabilizing after 2 months might occur in proteinuric patients with creatinine values 14 mgdl starting ace inhibitors this raise in creatinine is associated with longterm preservation of renal function and therefore ace inhibitors should not be stopped  133  greater increases should raise the suspicion of renalartery stenosis inhibition of the ras especially with ace inhibitors might raise serum potassium levels particularly in patients with renal insufficiency  134  for these reasons albuminuria serum creatinine and potassium should be checked monthly during the first 2–3 months after starting treatment with ace inhibitors or arbs recently mogensen et al  121 developed the new concept of dual blockade of the ras ace inhibitors and arbs interrupt the ras at different levels and the combination of these classes of drugs may have an additive effect on renoprotection the combination of candesartan 16 mgday and lisinopril 20 mgday was more effective in reducing blood pressure and uae ratio in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes than either drug alone  121  other studies have also demonstrated that the combination of ace inhibitors and arbs had a synergistic effect in blood pressure and uae reduction in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy ras dual blockade is more effective in reducing uae than maximal recommended doses of ace inhibitors alone  135  even though no longterm trials analyzing the benefit of ras dual blockade in diabetic nephropathy are available in nondiabetic proteinuric patients the cooperate combination treatment of angiotensinii receptor blocker and angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor in nondiabetic renal disease trial has shown that dual therapy was superior to monotherapy at its maximal doses in retarding the progression of renal disease in a 3year followup  136  the combination of spironolactone an aldosterone antagonist with an ace inhibitor was also more effective in reducing uae and blood pressure in micro and macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients than the ace inhibitor alone  137  strategies of blood pressure treatment in patients with diabetic nephropathy a detailed discussion of the agents used to treat hypertension in patients with diabetic nephropathy is beyond the scope of this article and recent guidelines  101 138 and reviews on this subject are available  127 139 140  therefore only general guidelines will be discussed here taking into account the special characteristics of these patients to reach the blood pressure goal of 13080 mm hg in diabetic patients in general  101  or 12575 mm hg in patients with proteinuria 10 g24 h and increased serum creatinine three to four antihypertensive agents are usually necessary  141  it is more important to reach the blood pressure goals than to use a particular agent since most patients will require several agents however due to the known renoprotective effect of ace inhibitors and arbs treatment should start with either of these agents patients with systolic blood pressure 20 mm hg or diastolic blood pressure 10 mm hg above the goal should start treatment with two agents an ace inhibitor or arb and a lowdose thiazide diuretic 125–25 mgday can be initially used but loop diuretics furosemide should be used instead of thiazides in patients with gfr 30 mlmin corresponding to a serum creatinine of 25–30 mgdl  101  arbs are an excellent alternative if ace inhibitors are not tolerated cough and are the preferred agents for type 2 diabetic patients with left ventricular hypertrophy  104 andor micro or macroalbuminuria  106 119 129  arbs and ace inhibitors can be combined if there is no reduction in albuminuria or if blood pressure target levels are not reached even before maximizing the dose of each agent additional agents should be added as needed calcium channel blockers have an additional effect on reducing blood pressure levels these agents should only be used in combination with an ace inhibitor and should not be used in patients with a recent coronary event βblockers are especially useful in patients with myocardial ischemia since these drugs reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with baseline pulse rate 84 bpm  141  possibly a metabolic neutral compound carvedilol should be used the combination of βblockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be used with caution since both agents have negative chronotropic effects blood pressure treatment could be assessed by 24h ambulatory monitoring in the following situations in patients with treatmentresistant hypertension when there is a suspicion of white coat hypertension or to detect druginduced or autonomic neuropathy–related hypotensive episodes  138  diet intervention replacing red meat with chicken in the usual diet reduced uae by 46 and reduced total cholesterol ldl cholesterol and apolipoprotein b in microalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes in a 4week study  142  this was probably related to the lower amount of saturated fat and the higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids found in chicken meat than in red meat the beneficial effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on endothelial function  143 could also reduce uae a normal protein diet with chicken as the only source of meat may represent an additive strategy for the treatment of microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients however longterm studies are necessary according to a metaanalysis  144 of five studies including a total of 108 patients dietary protein restriction slowed the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes more recently a 4year randomized controlled trial in 82 patients with type 1 diabetes with progressive diabetic nephropathy showed that a moderately low–protein diet 09 g · kg −1 · day −1 reduced the risk of endstage renal disease or death by 76 although no effect on gfr decline was observed  145  the mechanisms by which a lowprotein diet may reduce progression of diabetic nephropathy are still unknown but might be related to improved lipid profile andor glomerular hemodynamics dyslipidemia the goal for ldl cholesterol is 100 mgdl for diabetic patients in general and 70 mgdl for diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease  146  the effect of lipid reduction by antilipemic agents on progression of diabetic nephropathy is still unknown so far there have been no large trials analyzing whether the treatment of dyslipidemia could prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy or the decline of renal function however there is some evidence that lipid reduction by antilipemic agents might preserve gfr and decrease proteinuria in diabetic patients  147  in the heart protection study 40 mg simvastatin reduced the rate of major vascular events and gfr decline in patients with diabetes independent of cholesterol levels at baseline by 25  148  moreover the results of the recently presented cards collaborative atorvastatin diabetes study which showed a marked reduction of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and at least one additional risk factor for coronary artery disease suggest that all diabetic patients should be taking statins  wwwcardstrialorg  anemia anemia may occur in patients with diabetic nephropathy even before the onset of advanced renal failure serum creatinine 18 mgdl and it has been related to erythropoietin deficiency  149  furthermore anemia has been considered a risk factor for progression of renal disease and retinopathy  150  until the results of the ongoing acord anemia correction in diabetes study  151 become available it is recommended to start erythropoietin treatment when hb levels are 11 gdl the target hb levels should be 12–13 gdl and the potential risk of elevation of blood pressure levels with erythropoietin treatment should be taken into account  150  use of aspirin lowdose aspirin has been recommended for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with diabetes this therapy did not have a negative impact on renal function uae or gfr in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with micro or macroalbuminuria  152 153  however the subgroup analysis of the primary prevention project trial did not show a significant reduction in the occurrence of cardiovascular events in 1031 diabetic patients using lowdose aspirin 100 mgday  154  although this study was underpowered to analyze the effect on the development of cardiovascular events these data raise the issue that diabetic patients could be less responsive to aspirin therapy aspirin resistance in fact a recent study demonstrated a reduced response of platelets from diabetic subjects to treatment with aspirin 150 mgday this phenomenon was associated with higher levels of a1c lower concentration of hdl cholesterol and higher concentration of total cholesterol  155  therefore diabetic patients might benefit from aspirin doses 100–150 mgday or use of other antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel multifactorial intervention patients with microalbuminuria frequently have other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia in the steno2 study multifactorial intervention was compared with conventional treatment in 160 microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients  156  the targets were to achieve blood pressure levels 13080 mm hg fasting serum cholesterol 175 mgdl fasting serum triglycerides 150 mgdl and a1c 65 the multifactorial intervention consisted of a stepwise implementation of lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy including a lowfat diet a three to five times a week lighttomoderate exercise program a smoking cessation program and prescription of ace inhibitors or arbs and aspirin the intensively treated group had a 61 reduction in the risk of developing macroalbuminuria and a 58 and 63 reduction in the risk of retinopathy and autonomic neuropathy respectively most importantly a 55 reduction in the risk for the development of a composite end point consisting of death from cardiovascular causes nonfatal myocardial infarction revascularization procedures nonfatal stroke and amputation was also observed in the multifactorial intervention group new potential therapeutic strategiesthe measures described above might not be effective in some patients with diabetes and novel therapeutic strategies are warranted high doses of thiamine and its derivate benfotiamine have been shown to retard the development of microalbuminuria in experimental diabetic nephropathy probably due to decreased activation of protein kinase c decreased protein glycation and oxidative stress  157  treatment with alt711 a crosslink breaker of the advanced glycation end products has been shown to result in a significant reduction in uae blood pressure and renal lesions in experimental diabetes  158  treatment with a protein kinase c β inhibitor ruboxistaurin normalized gfr decreased albumin excretion rate and ameliorated glomerular lesions in diabetic rodents  159  in a rat model of diabetesinduced glomerulosclerosis administration of a modified heparin glycosaminoglycan prevented albuminuria glomerular and tubular matrix accumulation and transforming growth factor β1 m rna overexpression  160  very few studies have been conducted in humans sulodexide a glycosaminoglycan significantly reduced albuminuria in micro or macroalbuminuric type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients  161  pimagedine a secondgeneration inhibitor of advanced glycation end products reduced urinary protein excretion and the decline in gfr in proteinuric type 1 diabetic patients in a randomized placebocontrolled study  162  conclusionsin the last few years we have witnessed enormous progress in the understanding of the risk factors and mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy the stages of renal involvement in diabetes and the treatment strategies to prevent or interrupt the progression of diabetic nephropathy early detection of diabetic nephropathy adoption of multifactorial interventions targeting the main risk factors hyperglycemia hypertension dyslipidemia and smoking and use of agents with a renoprotective effect ace inhibitors andor arbs do indeed reduce the progression of renal disease treatment of hypertension is a priority attention to these procedures will also ensure the reduction of cardiovascular mortality note added in proof in a 5year prospective study barnett et al  n engl j med 3511952–1961 2004 observed that telmisartan 80 mgday was not inferior to enalapril 20 mgday in preventing the progression of decline of gfr in 250 type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria reinforcing the suggestion that ace inhibitors and arbs have a similar effect
