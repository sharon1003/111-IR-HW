multi engine rating privatecommercial pilot atp cfihome of pilot ratings training engines tools schedule to add a multi engine rating to a private commercial atp or cfi certificate the faa requires an instructor endorsement and a practical test a knowledge test written is not required the practical test includes a detailed oral test pilots may take their original private pilot or other practical tests in a multiengine airplane in which case they will be subject to additional experience requirements a pilot certificate obtained in such a manner will not include single engine piloting privileges ability to deal with a total power loss is not demonstrated during multi engine certification if you are in the san francisco bay area and would like initial or recurrent multi engine training please contact the author of this article anton sabev  are multiengine airplanes really safer why require an additional rating to fly multiengine airplanes if these questions intrigue you read on  muti engine safety math per flying hour a twin engine airplane compared to a single is2 times more likely to develop problems in any of its engines4 times less likely to develop problems in two of its engines surprisingly safety doesnt improve significantly with 3 or 4 engines a dual failure in the 3 engine types usually creates an unacceptable loss of performance in the 4 engine types a dual failure on the same side creates a directional control dilemma the pilot makes all the difference two engines are better than one but  proficiency incompletely trained or rusty pilots can fly multi engine airplanes but not safely in normal operations they would be at least twice safer flying a single engine airplane this is due to the higher probability of any of the engines failing in a multi and the consequences of not being prepared to handle those cases oceans long over water flights are safer in multiengine airplanes but only with proper preflight planning the pilot needs to make computations which prove that in case of an engine failure enough range is available to reach the destination the departure or the alternate airport the computations should assume the worst possible moment for engine failure  the equal time point  and take into consideration existing winds and temperatures mountains multi engine airplanes have a significant safety advantage over singles in mountain over flights again this only holds true if care is taken to ensure that a takeoff and flight at safe altitudes above peak levels is possible after an engine failure myths given the above no wonder there is a popular saying if an engine fails in a twin the remaining engine will only carry you to the scene of the accident obviously this is not true for airline operations as well as for private pilots who take the time and effort to stay proficient in engine out operations so one of my engines failed engine out operations frustrate flight in two basic wayssignificant performance degradationdirectional control difficulties performance  will she climb performance degradation affects our climb rate service ceiling range and airspeed in a twin we lose much more than 50 from any of these when we lose 50 of our thrust power why climb depends on excess power a significant amount of power is used just to overcome drag in level flight therefore if we lose half of our power we lose much more than half of our climbing ability which in turn lowers our service ceiling multi engine pilots are taught to combat performance problems by maintaining proper flight speed and bank minimizing drag and by preflight verification that performance will be adequate after an engine loss directional control  will she fly directional control problems after an engine failure are insignificant at normal flight speeds but become severe as speed decreases there is a speed vmc usually higher than stall speed below which control is impossible to maintain pilots can regain directional control by increasing airspeed banking into the working engine s the more the better feathering the dead engine if altitude is not an issue  when were very high or still on the ground  we can cure all directional problems by simply closing all the throttles we have takeoff decisions  fast or fatal both control and performance are even more critical during takeoff in a takeoff engine failure situation a quick decision needs to be made whether to abort or continue the takeoff this decision entirely depends on the airspeed achieved the runway length and surrounding terrain in typical propeller twins and runway length combinations most of the accident causing errors are misjudged continued takeoffs on the other hand the typical turbojetrunway length combinations more often result in misjudged aborted takeoffs when learning multi engine flying two additional training factors areincreased airplane and systems complexityhigher speed leading to increased workloads the last two present no difficulties to pilots experienced with high performance single engine airplanes on the other hand newly certified private pilots are likely to require more training addressing the above areas centerline thrust  is it better pilots of centerline twins will be similarly affected by performance loss as any other twin after an engine failure there wont be directional control complications this is a great blessing but it has some negative consequences it is now harder to detect an engine failure on takeoff and much harder to figure out which engine failed each airplane has different engine failure indications which make recurrent training very important it is just as imperative to maintain blue line vyse speed after a failure as in any other multi engine airplane additionally a multiengine rating is required to fly centerline twins if a centerline twin is used on the practical test a centerline thrust only limitation will be placed on the pilot certificate
