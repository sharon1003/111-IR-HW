what is type dynamics Â© 1998 bill olson introduction determining type dynamics type development link to table format introduction the infjlist discusses type dynamics and type development from time to time though these theories are very important to type theory most popularly available books dont discuss these topics i suppose the authors consider them advanced topics there is a fair bit of debate about type development theories and some debate over type dynamics too i will explain the commonly accepted theories and leave the variations for some other time first type dynamics in a four letter type code the two middle letters are the most important these are the two functions that you use most the outer two letters help us to understand the orientation of the middle two letters the first letter  ei is the orientation of the dominant function it has something to say about which world you live in the second letter  sn is the perceiving function which is how you go about gathering information the third letter is the judging function  tf and is how you go about drawing conclusions the last letter  jp was added by myers and briggs the rest came from carl jung to specifically help with type dynamics the j or p indicates which of the middle two letters you extravert the judging function or the perceiving function your top two preferred functions show up in your type code and the rest are interpolated from that the first function is called the dominant the second favorite the auxiliary the third favorite is the tertiary function and the fourth is the inferior there are a total of four functions  s n t and f but there are two orientations to each function introverted and extraverted so there are a total of eight combinations when you put it all together the common short hand used in type circles is to capitalize the function letter with a lower case subscript extraverted feeling would be fe introverted feeling would be fi and so on type dynamics describes four functions for each person dominant through inferior but does not address the other four functions there are a large number of theories that address this and none has emerged as a dominant one everybody has all eight functions and uses them at some time but theres no agreement on where the four neglected functions fall in a persons hierarchy of functions back to top determining type dynamics there is a step by step procedure you can go through to determine the type dynamics for a given type ill start with infj1 determine which function is extraverted the last letter tells you this in this case j that means the judging function is extraverted fe in this case2 the other function has the opposite orientation from the other so the n is ni introverted3 the first letter tells you which of the functions is dominant in this case i which means the ni is the dominant function4 the auxiliary is the other middle letter in this case fe5 the tertiary is the same type of function as the auxiliary but the other type theres a raging debate about its orientation some say the orientation is supposed to be the same as the auxiliary some say the opposite and some say it could swing either way jungs original theory says that the psyche seeks balance and so each camp claims that the tertiary oriented one way or the other would balance the psyche i will denote the orientation with a  in this case the auxiliary is fe so the tertiary is the same type of function a judging one which would be t6 the inferior is opposite to the dominant in orientation and the same type of function as the dominant but the opposite one since the dominant is ni in this case the inferior is se7 the function order then comes out as ni fe t and se8 ne fi one side of t and si are left out of the mix pick a theory to how they get integrated the dominant function is the one that is most conscious to you and the inferior least conscious the inferior rears up and takes over sometimes this is often called the grip when in the grip were a bad caricature of our opposite everything negative and none of the good attributes if you consciously work on the inferior function you can lesson grip reactions though exercising the inferior function always takes energy while exercising the dominant will build energy as another example ill do enfj1 extraverted function fe 2 introverted function ni 3 dominant function fe first letter is e 4 auxilliary ni 5 tertiary s 6 inferior ti 7 function order fe ni s ti as you can see even though enfjs are only one letter different from infjs the function order comes out quite differently back to top type development type development is a theory about when these functions develop in an ideal situation a small child will develop the dominant function first then the auxiliary as a teenager then the tertiary in their late 20s and early 30s then the inferior at midlife crisis there are many reasons why this scenario doesnt usually play out this way for one introverts need to develop an extraverted function their auxiliary at a fairly early stage in life adults are going to worry if they dont extravert something family and cultural influences can have an effect too f men and t women are not culturally acceptable so theyre going to have cultural pressure to develop the opposite function from an early age even if its their inferior see this information in table format back to topit is with logic that one proves it is with intuition that one invents henri poincare
