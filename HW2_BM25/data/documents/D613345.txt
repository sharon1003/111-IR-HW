established a claim at spokane falls in 1871 25 together they built a small sawmill on a claim near the south bank of the falls 25 26 james n glover and jasper matheney oregonians passing through the region in 1873 recognized the value of the spokane river and its falls for the purpose of water power 25 they realized the investment potential and bought the claims of 160 acres 65 ha and the sawmill from downing and scranton for a total of 4000 27 glover and matheney knew that the northern pacific railroad company had received a government charter to build a main line across this northern route

prospectors 38 the inland empire erupted with numerous mining rushes from 1883 to 1892 39 mining and smelting emerged as a major stimulus to spokane at the onset of the initial 1883 gold rush in the nearby coeur dalene mining district spokane became popular with prospectors offering low prices on everything from a horse to a frying pan 40 it would keep this status for subsequent rushes in the region due to its trade center status and accessibility to railroad infrastructure 41 dspokanes growth continued unabated until august 4 1889 when a fire now known as the great fire not to be confused with the great fire of 1910 which happened nearby began just after 600 pm and destroyed the citys downtown commercial district 42 due to technical problems with a pump station there was no water pressure in the city when the fire started 43 in a desperate bid to starve the fire firefighters began razing buildings with dynamite eventually the winds and the fire died down 32 blocks of spokanes downtown core had been destroyed and one person killed 42spokane falls 1890despite this catastrophe and in part because of it spokane experienced a building boom 44 e the downtown was rebuilt and the city was reincorporated under the present name of spokane in 1891 35 according to historian david h stratton from the late 1890s to about 1912 a great flurry of construction created a modern urban profile of office buildings banks department stores hotels and other commercial institutions which stretched from the spokane river to the site of the northern pacific railroad tracks below the south hill 45 yet the rebuilding and development of the city was far from smooth between 1889 and 1896 alone all six bridges over the spokane river were destroyed by floods before their completion 45 in the 1890s the city was subject to intrastate migration by africanamericans from roslyn looking for work after the closure of the areas mines two africanamerican churches calvary baptist and bethel african methodist episcopal were founded in 1890 46 just three years after the fire in 1892 james j hill s great northern railway arrived in the chosen site for hills rail yards the newly created township of hillyard annexed by spokane in 1924 47 spokane became an important rail shipping and transportation hub for the inland empire connecting mines in the silver valley with agricultural areas around the palouse region 37 48 the citys population ballooned to 19922 in 1890 and to 36848 in 1900 with the arrival of additional railroads 44 by 1910 the population had hit 104000 and spokane eclipsed walla walla as the commercial center of the inland empire 49 in time the city came to be known as the capital of the inland empire and the heart of a vast tributary region 38 50 after the arrival of the northern pacific union pacific great northern and chicago milwaukee st paul and pacific railroads spokane became one of the most important rail centers in the western u s 44 50 51 52early 20th century  editthe monroe street bridge 1911expansion abruptly stopped in the 1910s and was followed by a period of population decline 53 due in large part to spokanes slowing economy control of regional mines and resources became increasingly dominated by national corporations rather than local people and organizations diverting capital outside of spokane and decreasing growth and investment opportunities in the city 53 during this time of stagnation unrest was prevalent among the areas unemployed who became victimized by job sharks who charged a fee for signing up workers in the logging camps job sharks and employment agencies were known to cheat itinerant workers sometimes paying bribes to periodically fire entire work crews thus generating repetitive fees for themselves 54 crime spiked in the 1890s and 1900s 55 56 with eruptions of violent activity involving unions such as the industrial workers of the world iww or wobblies as they were often known whose free speech fights had begun to garner national attention 57 now with grievances concerning the unethical practices of the employment agencies they initiated a free speech fight in september 1908 by purposely breaking a city ordinance on soapboxing 57 with iww encouragement union members from many western states came to spokane to take part in what had become a publicity stunt many wobblies were incarcerated including feminist labor leader elizabeth gurley flynn who published her account in the local industrial worker 57the masonic temple built in 1905after mining declined at the turn of the 20th century agriculture and logging became the primary influences in the spokane economy 58 the population explosion and the building of homes railroads and mines in northern idaho and southern british columbia fueled the logging industry 58 although overshadowed in importance by the vast timbered areas on the coastal regions west of the cascades and burdened with monopolistic rail freight rates and stiff competition spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors window sashes blinds and other planing mill products 59 rail freight rates were much higher in spokane than the rates in coastal seaport cities such as seattle and portland so much so that minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to seattle and then back to spokane for less than shipping directly to spokane even though the rail line ran through spokane on the way to the coast 50 60 f the inland northwest region has also long been associated with farming especially wheat production 61 initially the palouse was thought to unsuitable for wheat production due to the hilly terrain believing wheat could not be cultivated on the tops of the hills but the region showed great promise for wheat production when it began in the late 1850s in part due to the hilltops 61 the palouse was and still is a breadbasket and was able to develop and grow with the completion of several railroad networks as well as a highway system that began to center around the city of spokane aiding farmers from around the region in distributing their products to market 62 inland empire farmers exported wheat livestock and other agricultural products to the ports such as new york liverpool and tokyo 63 local morale was affected for years by the collapse of the division street bridge early in the morning on december 15 1915 which killed five people and injured over 20 but a new bridge was built eventually replaced in 1994 64 the 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population 53 growth in the 1920s and 1930s remained slow but less drastically so forcing city boosters to market the city as a quiet comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity 65 the inland empire was heavily dependent on natural resources and extractive goods produced from mines forests and farms which experienced a fall in demand 66 the situation improved slightly with the start of world war ii as aluminum production commenced in spokane due to the areas cheap electricity produced from regional dams and the increased demand for airplanes 66second half of the 20th century  editthe great northern clock tower and former expo 74 washington state pavilion in riverfront park after

worlds fair in expo 74 on may 4 becoming the smallest city at the time to host a worlds fair 69 70 this event transformed spokanes downtown removing a century of railroad infrastructure and reinventing the urban core after expo 74 the fairgrounds became the 100acre 40 ha riverfront park 71the growth witnessed in the late 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another u s recession in 1981 in which silver timber and farm prices dropped 72 the period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady familywage jobs in the manufacturing sector 73 although this was a tough period spokanes economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic diversification growing companies such as key tronic and other research marketing and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen spokanes dependence on natural resources 7221st century  editspokane has an extensive skywalk network as of 2014 spokane is still trying to make the

resulting in the expansion of the university district with two medical school branches 74 75 the city faces challenges such as a scarcity of highpaying jobs pockets of poverty and areas of high crime 73the opening of the river park square mall in 1999 served as a catalyst and sparked a downtown rebirth that included the building of the spokane arena and expansion of the spokane convention center
