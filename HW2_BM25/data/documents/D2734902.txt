like most mental health writers i have compared depression to illnesses like diabetes in the past and stressed the biochemical aspect of mood disorders in my efforts to reduce stigma somehow talking about the gene g72g30 located on chromosome 13q that may predispose individuals to depression and bipolar disorder makes it more legitimate as if the gene proves we aren’t making it up however the more i read about how abuse trauma and chronic stress —unresolved issues of all kinds — can cause and aggravate depression the less i want to compare it to diabetes taking insulin really isn’t the same thing as taking an antidepressant it’s not that simple as i wrote about in my recent blog about selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssris the theory that depressed people suffer from a lack of serotonin and other neurotransmitters which are replenished by antidepressants sounds good but isn’t totally accurate ssris aren’t like insulin in that they fill in a deficiency in fact we still don’t really know how they work but they certainly do for many people in his chapter a heroic passage in the book darkness before dawn  psychiatrist james gordon md writes “depression is not a disease the end point of a pathological process it is a sign that our lives are out of balance that we’re stuck it’s a wakeup call and the start of a journey that can help us become whole and happy a hero’s journey that can change and transform our lives”part of me cringes when i read that forever stuck in my brain is renowned psychiatrist peter kramer ’s quote “depression is not a perspective it is a disease to see the worst things a person can see is one experience to suffer a mood disorder is another”and yet i agree with dr gordon on some kinds of depression for example the symptoms of sadness irritability and interrupted sleep i experienced at the beginning of this year was a wakeup call that i was working too many hours and trying too hard to build a foundation for treatmentresistant depression overnight crying for five days straight led to an aha moment when i realized that my health and my family should always come first so i backed down my work hours and delegated more tasks to other administrators in my depression community and the sadness and panic faded i don’t think popping a xanax or upping my zoloft would have done much good however there are also times when i know the depression is nothing more than a biochemical response when i tried the natural hormone progesterone for example and my thoughts went from “i wish i were dead” to “let’s review some suicidal plans immediately” luckily i knew my mental state was due to the progesterone because my psychiatrist had warned me about taking it i didn’t listen and i knew a friend who wanted to jump off the bay bridge after rubbing progesterone cream on her chest i have a similar reaction when i eat foods made with sugar and white flour i start doing death math i don’t believe those hours obsessing about ways to die served me in any way in fact that kind of depression is a lifethreatening condition that has killed almost a million people around the globe including comedic genius robin williams in a new york times piece titled it’s not always depression  psychotherapist hilary jacobs hendel describes her sessions with a patient brian who came to her after years of treatmentresistant depression he had already tried cognitive behavioral therapy psychoanalytic psychotherapy supportive therapy and dialectical behavioral therapy he had been prescribed several medication combinations and had been hospitalized next on the list was electroshock therapy which he didn’t want to do during her first few sessions with brian he was totally comatose she writes “he could barely bring himself to speak and his voice when i managed to get anything out of him was meek his body was rigid his facial expression blank he couldn’t look me in the eye yes he seemed extremely depressed but knowing he had been treated for depression for years without good results i wondered about the diagnosis”she eventually diagnosed him as a survivor of childhood neglect a kind of trauma and proceeded with experiential dynamic psychotherapy which focuses on “fostering awareness of the emotional life of the patient as it unfolds in real time in front of the therapist” they worked together twice a week for four years and he eventually let go of his shame learned how to express his feelings and engaged in meaningful work i’ve heard other stories like this that make me think that sometimes depression isn’t so much a physical disease as a spiritual and psychological condition — a kind of constipated state of mind where your thoughts and spirit are stuck in a toxic quicksand that is swallowing you up minute by minute in these situations my guess is that drugs are probably less effective than a kind of psychotherapy or meditation technique or spiritual healing that confronts the source of the pain but keep in mind i studied theology in college not medicine a friend of mine who also had a traumatic childhood asked me the other day “do you think that the reason many of us have depression is because this is a warning signal from our minds and bodies that there is something wrong in our lives that we are not ‘sick’ in the traditional sense as in a diagnosis of diabetes but we are being alerted that we have not yet reached the root psychological cause that is creating the anguish in other words you simply cannot put out the psychological fire until it is resolved within and that it may be so subconscious that we may not yet be aware of it”six years ago i would have told her depression is always a physical condition that needs to be treated with the traditional psychiatric approach in the years of 2005 and 2006 i spent too much time trying to locate the source of my unresolved issues and frankly it almost cost me my life after all the yoga meditation and psychotherapy i still had a bag of about 30 prescriptions ready to flatten my pulse not until i landed at johns hopkins mood disorder clinic did i get my life back however during the last few years i have seen and experienced the limitations of psychiatry and the biomedical model i have witnessed people stay stuck despite many sessions of ect and medications and psychotherapy which is why i felt strongly enough to start my foundation for intractable depression i would very much like to say that depression is always a disease it’s simpler just as a diabetic needs insulin we need antidepressants — that’s clean but the truth is that i have been so humbled in the last 10 years that i don’t really know what depression is and what works anymore i appreciate that each human being is so unique with different nerve cells and tissues that it can be dangerous to make bold claims in any camp i agree with gordon that we need a more integrative approach to depression — one that includes nutrition exercise meditation and other methods of healing like experiential dynamic psychotherapy but i also think that we must always keep in mind that depression can be a lifethreatening illness a serious biochemical condition that we can’t think or pray ourselves out of we must always remember the people who did not survive this disease because they didn’t think it was a disease continue the conversation on project beyond blue
