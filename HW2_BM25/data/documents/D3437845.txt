seasonal produce guides macrobiotic basics what does natural on food labels mean short answer not as much as you think by molly watson updated 100317share pin email cauliflower at market photo Â© molly watson the term natural gets thrown around a lot these days from food product labels to chef chatter there seems to be a belief that anything natural is good one study found the majority of consumers though that natural had more meaning than  organic  to be clear that simply isnt true so what does natural mean legally food labeled natural does not contain any artificial ingredients coloring ingredients or chemical preservatives sounds good or does it the important element there is the word artificial it is not as a consumer might assume the same as processed it simple means that the flavor does not fit the following definition of a natural flavora natural flavor is the essential oil oleoresin essence or extractive protein hydrolysate distillate or any product of roasting heating or enzymolysis which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice fruit or fruit juice vegetable or vegetable juice edible yeast herb bark bud root leaf or similar plant material meat seafood poultry eggs dairy products or fermentation products thereof whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional so if a flavor is made from any of the above ingredients it is natural no matter how highly changed and manipulated it is including processed proteins that you may or may not consider desirable what about natural on meat labels its the same as above with the added element that the meat or poultry so labeled has only been minimally processed it has nothing to do with being organic or freerange in short it means that its meat to repeat an allnatural stamp on a meat label only means that youre buying meat it gets a tad more depressing from there meat from animals treated with artificial hormones can and is labeled natural as is meat injected with saline solution sure saline salt water adds flavor but it also adds considerable weight to a product sold by the pound and as long as anything in that saline solution meets the definition of a natural flavor above the meat can still be labeled all natural which gets us a fair piece away from the idea that its just meat one is buying sugar for example can be added to the solution along with salt to say nothing of flavors derived from other foods so highly processed chicken nuggets with an unpronounceable ingredient list can legally be labelled as containing allnatural chicken or as having been made with natural chicken for more about meat labeling see what do meat labels mean is it worth looking for natural on food labels in short the natural label on food means something and there are guidelines about which foods can be labelled natural but they arent very stringent for people interested in pure foods and minimally processed or unprocessed foods the natural label probably wont tell you what you want to know
