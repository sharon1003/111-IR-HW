bleargh said ↑frequency and wavelength proportions change as you shift mediums so you cant use one to define the other in a general sense  frequency never changes beween mediums while wavelength does everything ive ever read about eye physiology  rods  cones use wavelength of light in sensitivityresponse curves but i suppose it could just as well be frequency at any single given speed wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional so at any given speed changes in frequency will change color perception frequency and wavelength are defined in terms of the speed of light in a vacuum ν × λ  c in general frequency × wavelength  speed of light the speed of light in a vacuum is about 3 × 10 sup8 sup if youre in a different medium then use refractive index n to find the speed of light in that medium n  cv since frequency does not change when moving from one medium to another if speed decreases then wavelength will decrease i believe that this is essentially the simple explanation for why water and sky looks blue they are both media that slow down light  for the mcat i cant imagine having a question asking the test taker to integrate the visual sensationperception stuff with the optical physics stuff on this level  to be honest im not sure that its as simple as saying wavelength or frequency is what determines color sensation regardless of the medium frequency doesnt change from one medium to another but wavelength does but also so does energy the speed of light in a vacuum is constant but changes in media like glass or water energy of a photon is a function of both speed and wavelength e  hcλ the first question to ask is what physical mechanism could the eye use to detect wavelength there is no easy answer to this question alternative question what physical mechanism could the eye use to detect energy this is easy as i understand it the physical transduction of light into sensory information is dependent on the energy of the photon which has to match the amount of energy that it takes to isomerize the visual pigment in the cone cell this causes a configurational change in the pigment causing some membranebound protein to change conformation which causes a cascade of events that are ultimately perceived as a color so while both wavelength and speed change when entering a medium i think its really differences in energy that are sensed and perceived as different colors energy is something that intuitively makes sense as a physical parameter that would interact with our photopigments length wavelength does not make as much sense as an experiment close your eyes and gentle poke them through your eyelids with your fingers many people report perceiving colors when they do this thats because some energy has been added to the system and it causes changes in cone cell activity no wavelength has been added  so to the op color is usually defined in terms of wavelength and bleargh is right that this changes in different media however for the mcat you should be prepared to convert between frequencies and wavelengths of light given a particular speed of light
