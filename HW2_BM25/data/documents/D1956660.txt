from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search ventriculomegaly is a brain condition that occurs in the fetus when the lateral ventricles become dilated the most common definition uses a width of the atrium of the lateral ventricle of greater than 10 mm 1 this occurs in around 1 of pregnancies 2 when this measurement is between 10 and 15 mm the ventriculomegaly may be described as mild to moderate when the measurement is greater than 15mm the ventriculomegaly may be classified as more severe 3 enlargement of the ventricles may occur for a number of reasons such as loss of brain volume perhaps due to infection or infarction  or impaired outflow or absorption of cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles often however there is no identifiable cause the interventricular foramen may be congenitally malformed or may have become obstructed by infection hemorrhage or rarely tumor which may impair the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and thus accumulation in the ventricles this diagnosis is generally found in routine fetal anomaly scans at 18–22 weeks gestation it is one of the more common abnormal brain findings on prenatal ultrasound occurring in around 1–2 per 1000 pregnancies 4 in many cases of mild ventriculomegaly however there is resolution of ventriculomegaly during the pregnancy associations  editventriculomegaly is also known to be associated with other malformations such as agenesis of the corpus callosum spina bifida and heart defects fetuses with both isolated ventriculomegaly and with other anomalies have an increased risk of having a chromosomal abnormality including that of down syndrome 3 5many conditions associated with ventriculomegaly can be defined prior to birth but the possibility remains of other anomalies either structural chromosomal or genetic only being identified later in pregnancy or after birth 6 ventriculomegaly associated with abnormal findings and other structural malformations often has an adverse prognosis which ranges from disability often mild to death however in cases of mild isolated ventriculomegaly there is around a 90 chance of a normal outcome 5 7increasingly fetal magnetic resonance imaging is being considered as part of the assessment of pregnancies complicated by fetal ventriculomegaly 8 and appears to be important in the postnatal assessment of affected children 9although evaluation of lateral ventricles dimensions is decisive for establishing a diagnosis of ventriculomegaly the shape of the ventricular system including that of the frontal horns is also important 10references  edit cardoza jd goldstein rb filly ra 1988 exclusion of fetal ventriculomegaly with a single measurement the width of the lateral ventricular atrium radiology 169 711–714 salomon lh bernard jp ville y 2007 reference ranges for fetal ventricular width a nonnormal approach  ultrasound obstet gynecol in press abstract a b breeze ac alexander pm murdoch em missfelderlobos hh hackett ga lees cc 2007 obstetric and neonatal outcomes in severe fetal ventriculomegaly prenat diagn 27 21249 1 abstract achiron r schimmel m achiron a mashiach s 1993 fetal mild idiopathic lateral ventriculomegaly is there a correlation with fetal trisomy ultrasound obstet gynecol 3 89–92 a b gaglioti p danelon d bontempo s mombro m cardaropoli s todros t 2005 fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly outcome in 176 cases ultrasound obstet gynecol apr25 43727 breeze ac dey pk lees cc hackett ga smith gcs murdoch em 2005 obstetric and neonatal outcomes in apparently isolated mild fetal ventriculomegaly j perinat med 33 236–240 2 abstract signorelli m tiberti a valseriati d molin e cerri v groli c bianchi ua 2004 width of the fetal lateral ventricular atrium between 10 and 12 mm a simple variation of the norm ultrasound obstet gynecol jan23 1148 glenn oa barkovich aj 2006 magnetic resonance imaging of the fetal brain and spine an increasingly important tool in prenatal diagnosis part 1 ajnr am j neuroradiol sep27 8160411 falip c blanc n maes e zaccaria i oury jf sebag g garel c 2007 postnatal clinical and imaging followup of infants with prenatal isolated mild ventriculomegaly a series of 101 cases pediatr radiol 2007 oct37 109819 3 abstract glonek m kedzia a derkowski w prenatal assessment of ventriculomegaly an anatomical study medical science monitor  international medical journal of experimental and clinical research 20039 7 mt6977 external links  editdiagnosis and evaluation for ventriculomegaly center for prenatal pediatrics at columbia university medical center ny presbyterian ucsf fetal treatment center ventriculomegaly categories gross pathology
