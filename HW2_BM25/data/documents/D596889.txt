this wood is my absolute favourite of favourites quite simply it has a richness that speaks to my senses like a fine cognac longaged in french oak barrels or perhaps your preference is grand marnier my kitchen cabinets are made from yew as are many of our doors here at west wind hardwood and upon returning from time away i am always struck by how extraordinary this richly coloured unique wood is there are many many species of yew one of the more common is english yew the name “yew” comes from the protogermanic “īwa“and with a possible origination from the gaulish “ivos” referring to the colour brown our local species is known as pacific yew western yew american yew oregon yew bowplant mountain mahogany long associated with magic death and rebirtheternal life attributed with magical and psychic abilities yew was one of the ‘nine sacred woods’ used in the ritual fires of the celts and as a ‘totem’ tree by celtic tribes reincarnation has always held a fascination for me multiple lives and such i hold the concept lightly having had no firsthand experiences but i was recently informed that i have lived three previous lives my first as a female warrior in preroman britain which i find curious considering the importance the yew tree held in these times perhaps some heed should be given to hamlet’s words ‘ … there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy’certainly i do believe the universe operates in a continuous chain reaction of cause and effect by actions thoughts and words energy is released and in turn influences our direction man is therefore the sender and receiver of these influences what we are then is entirely dependent on what we think consider well your motives and intentions“all that we are is a result of what we have thought it is founded on our thoughts and made up of our thoughts” – dhammapada growth characteristics taxus brevifolia  pacific yew or western yew is a small to medium sized spindly evergreen conifer native to the pacific northwest it ranges from alaska to central california mostly in the coastal range the yew is extremely slowing growing and small size indicating no relationship to age think of our pacific rockfish in comparison foliage is relatively sparse and has a habit of rotting from the inside creating elaborate hollow forms very haunting the trunk is typically tapered and usually fluted covered by thin scaly reddishbrown bark our “john” likens the bark to the arbutusmadrone tree the leaves are flat dark green arranged spirally female trees develop distinctive soft bright red berrylike structures arils pacific yew normally grows inconspicuously and slowly beneath a conifer forest canopy in dense shade jan has tunnel vision when it comes to the yew tree it goes without saying that on our many hikes his ‘yew’ radar is on and i am surprised at how they melt into their surroundings unmissed by people like……well like me  the species is not abundant generally occurring in small groups or single trees it grows best on cool moist flats along streams in deep gorges and damp ravines and where fires are relatively infrequent buttle lake strathcona park –

memoriamagricultural and medicinal aspects interestingly all parts of the tree are poisonous except the fleshy covering of the berry arils which can be used as a laxative and diuretic however since the seeds are highly poisonous please don’t be selfmedicating and until recently pacific yew has been considered a nuisance weed by modern forestry insufficiently important to harvest for lumber or pulp it was often burned along with logging slash that remained after timber harvest or at best left behind in the early 1960’s the national cancer institute us found that extracts from pacific yew bark showed in vitro activity against cancer cells and thus began a period of stardom for this hitherto largely ignored “treeofdeath” this is how west wind has come to stock yew wood both as a byproduct of outdated forestry techniques and of the medical research industry find the two halves salvaged from the burn pile at arbutus ridge the harvest of yew bark for taxol raises an ethical dilemma saving trees or victims of cancer several alternatives to harvesting wild pacific yew to obtain taxol are explored by laboratories along with the intensive cultivation of forest tree nurseries thus illustrating the value of preservation for future generations and showing how wise stewardship of an ecosystem can help achieve sustainable harvest working properties for centuries this wood was used for bowstaves by the bowmen of england as it was once a worthy quest to find the perfect piece finding long ‘true’ boards is still a ‘handson – comeandvisitus’ task sourcing long wide boards is challenging when you consider the tormented irregular grain pattern growing characteristics of the trunk however it polishes beautifully and of course ages to a magnificent colour it has a warm touchme quality being a very hard ‘softwood’ it was also used for shuttles cogs and pulleyins let me know if it’s necessary to cover the hardcore nittygritty facts such as specific gravity crushing

by singing to the well at midsummer night or by ‘welldressing’ – decorating the well with petals and sprays of yew the yew may be the oldestlived tree in the world unfortunately it is impossible
