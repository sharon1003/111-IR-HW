unplanned events and even physical destruction is vital for any individual or organization that uses computers threats to computers and electronic information can be caused by humans intentionally eg security breach hackers activities malware or unintentionally human error by technology failures eg system crash downtime firmware version inconsistencies or environmental hazards eg power surge computer room fire water leaks from defective sprinklers heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac plumbing effluent backflow into subfloors natural disasters etc data protection and security are critical components of daily pathology practice that impact the entire information technology it infrastructure including individual workstations servers and networks with increasing connectivity of information systems laboratory instruments workstations and mobile devices to the internet and wireless networks the demand to continuously protect data in all of its forms locations and transmissions can become a daunting task the responsibility of assuring that patient data in the pathology laboratory remains private and secure rests with the pathology informaticists ideally working closely with their information services division therefore it is important that informaticists are knowledgeable about security threats and privacy regulations that impact the pathology laboratory as well as candidate technological solutions available to address them it is equally important that the laboratorys overall it infrastructure be incorporated in recovery strategies developed for it systems applications and data ideally in a manner that mirrors the standard practices already in use by the greater enterprise thus supporting economies of scale and standard work in this review we introduce the reader to key technical terms and processes related to data security as it pertains to the laboratory information system lis provide our insight into current and future challenges related to securing healthcare data with rapid technological changes and describe current regulations in the usa related to patient data privacy and security table 1 provides a glossary of common terms related

information systems to guard against and enable response to disasters and catastrophe environmental technological or human error security breaches protection against malicious intrusion or data theft and recovery from security breaches privacy and data management for research laboratory data security policies and procedures pathology laboratory workflow is dependent on the use of lis which acquires generates analyzes stores and manages electronic protected health information e phi in addition to lis laboratories likely also store e phi in software that run laboratory instruments and automation lines as well as in middleware such as autoverification software therefore making sure that the data contained in laboratory software remain protected and secure at all times is critical to daily pathology practice 1 the same is true for interfaced devices such as chemistry analyzers that also store e phi accordingly security policies and procedures have to be in place and enforced in the laboratory in us laboratories security must meet the requirements of health insurance portability and accountability act  hipaa see the us regulations for health information security section while other countries have developed similar security regulations for patient data major security elements that should be addressed include prevention of unauthorized access to patients medical records confidentiality prevention of unauthorized alterations or loss to data integrity and prevention of compromises to availability of data to authorized individuals hence incomplete or unavailable data is not considered secure 2 in order to develop an effective security program security measures must be designed to allow authorized endusers access to information in a timely manner 3 the ultimate responsibility for security implementation and compliance belongs to the healthcare entity that manages data a security risk analysis is a systematic process designed to examine and identify any potential threats and vulnerabilities as well as to implement changes and monitor their results 2 such analyses should be conducted periodically and repeated as significant system changes occur when security risks are identified appropriate measures must be taken to reduce them the result of risk analysis may point out security infrastructure holes eg threats vulnerabilities and associated risks that can be addressed through policy training and sometimes through new technology not all threats or vulnerabilities identified need to be addressed but it is wise practice to document their assessment an organization may elect not to address risks that have negligible impact however the resulting policies and procedures should be designed to prevent detect contain and correct any security violations these security risk analyses can be performed internally or by hiring outside professionals nevertheless direct involvement of the pathology laboratory leadership is advised in a recent guide to privacy and security of health information in the usa the office of the national coordinator onc for health information technology hit suggested five steps that are necessary to perform a security risk analysis figure 1 4 5figure 1 five steps of a security risk analysis process click here to view review current health information security identify any threats and vulnerabilities asses risks for likelihood and impact mitigate security risks monitor results during a security risk analysis process all electronic systems or devices that play a role in generating capturing storing or modifying patient data require review this includes lis hardware and software as well as devices that can access lis data ie mobile devices such as tablet computers or smartphones or interfaced devices such as instruments or point of care testing devices similarly copiers and fax machines that can store data should be part of the review process 6 organizations should establish audit programs to ensure that access to health information systems is appropriate and has not been compromised as a rule most organizations should complete full audit processes on an annual basis written policies are required to cover the mechanisms available to provide individuals with access to information systems policies and procedures for terminating access such as when staff leaves the healthcare organization need to be implemented in addition security awareness training should be provided to all staff members initial general training should be reinforced through periodic security reminders system availability and disaster resiliency according to a study performed by valenstein et al  computers system downtime in the pathology laboratory varies widely between institutions and may occasionally be associated with adverse clinical outcomes 7 therefore a major requirement of laboratory computer systems used to manage patient information is their reliability 8 laboratories as well as health institutions in general should have procedures for both planned and unplanned system outages ie downtime procedures for both types of outage these procedures should address how the laboratory should function during the outage and the sequence and process by which all impacted software in the laboratory lis middleware instrument software etc are brought back online once the outage has been resolved for planned outages ie downtime that occurs to perform system maintenance or an upgrade the procedure should define the sequence as well as the process for shutting systems down for unplanned events procedures should assign responsibility for determination of the cause of the outage to defined individuals as well as the process and persons responsible for performing disaster recovery unplanned events can be classified into two broad categories i natural disasters eg floods hurricanes tornadoes or earthquakes and ii manmade disasters disasters related to human error can include intentional destruction technology conflicts infrastructural failures and accidents such as a motor vehicle crashing into ones data center while preventing some types of disaster may be difficult or impossible setting up ones it infrastructure to account for such a possibility can help reduce or avoid losses 9 10 downtime procedures can use information garnered from a security risk analysis to help outline how an organization should react to any kind of outage these should specify the laboratorys response based on the type of system outage eg electronic healthmedical record lis instrument network phone system paging system and should be updated at least annually or as systems and risks change downtime procedures also need to take into account both the infrastructure and personnel needs for the success of critical business operations during the outage in addition software support personnel should have defined procedures in place for checking the integrity of the data housed in systems and software once they are brought back online and before endusers access is allowed back into the system unplanned outages require additional steps for recovery mainly the identification and resolution of the cause of the outage software support personnel should have troubleshooting procedures available for such events in addition an analysis of the effectiveness of the procedures should be performed after the downtime is resolved to determine if changes to these procedures would help improve efficiency andor patient safety implementation of any measure that could prevent future occurrences of such outage should be performed because any unplanned outage can result in data loss it is critically important for the laboratory to develop robust data protection mechanisms that minimize loss and help speed the recovery process common strategies for data protection to consider include type of backup periodic vs realtimefor periodic backups scope of backup full vs incrementalfrequency of backup for realtime backups switchover capability business continuoushigh availability more labor intensive but cheaperlocation of backups onsite offsite or bothbackup media magnetic tape is cheap but is very slow storage area network technology which overcomes the need to restore data only the systems will need to be restored or synchronizedpersonnel to perform disaster recovery internal vs outsourced to a 3 rd party 11 12 13hardware security these safeguards relate to protection of the actual physical systems used to manage and store patient data 14 physical access facility access control to an area where servers terminals and modems are stored must be controlled eg access cards and the area should be locked at all times only authorized individuals should have physical access to hospital servers and a log with all employees who have entered this area should be maintained physical safety of computer servers is achieved by using appropriate computer room facilities not only with security access but also with controlled humidity temperature and fire protection in case of fire in the computer room waterbased fire extinguishers should not be used because they may damage delicate electronic equipment carbondioxide co 2  is a safer fire extinguisher agent because it displaces oxygen and cools the reaction without being conductive or leaving toxic or corrosive residues 15 older computer rooms may contain halon extinguishers while this gas does not damage electronics it is a chlorofluorocarbon gas and is no longer being deployed because like freon it can damage the ozone layer newer agents that replaced halon with a similar mode of action that act by removing the heat from the fire and not damaging the ozone layer are clean halocarbon agents including fm200 fe25 and fe13 and inert gases which suppress fire by lowering oxygen concentration below the combustion level all these agents are currently approved by the national fire protection association and have advantages and disadvantages clean agent halocarbons require decreased storage space and can extinguish fire much quicker than inert gases while the later can be piped up for a longer distance to reach the data center and may perform better in rooms that are not sealed very early smoke detection apparatus vesda can be employed to help detect early smoke or combustion products 16 it is also important to ensure that computer facilities have a stable power supply to avoid surges voltage spikes and outages electrical power disruptions are common events in both natural and manmade disasters a sudden loss of power can cause data loss or possible hardware damage uninterruptible power supply devices have battery backups to temporarily maintain power to computers in the event of a power outage modern datacenters and hospitals typically have large generators deployed as electrical backup yet even these can fail thus colocations facilities are typically placed on a unique electrical grid from the primary facility protection of patient data should also include procedures for the safe destruction of data on devices when the data is no longer needed or when those device need to be discarded these include all storage devices old diskettes tapes flash drives etc policies and procedures for inventory control purposes and detailed databases of the inventory and configurations of the existing hardware can help in identifying missing equipment or altered internal configurations endpoint security endpoint security as a subtype of hardware security represents a different aspect of this requirement where the covered entity ce is expected to protect the enduser physical abstraction layer of their it infrastructure from becoming an originating point for breaches to unauthorized storage devices and portable computers while there has been a consistent refinement of end point security approaches in the past decade for other it sectors use of such solutions in healthcare it has lagged as many institutions and enterprises have so far altogether omitted addressing the issue 17 given that any it appliance and specifically enduser workstationslaptops may be viewed as a conduit for enmasse extraction of data to other temporarily attached peripheral storage devices eg universal serial bus usb thumb drives and external serial advanced technology attachment e sata disk drives it is imperative that softwarehardware solutions be adopted to thwart such connectivity unless specifically authorized with such solutions in place for example a usb thumb drive could no longer be used to allow for the unauthorized copying of one or more patient results records at present many healthcare institutions circumvent this sector of oversight by establishing local policy making it a professional expectation that employees with access to systems containing e phi will not attempt to generate unauthorized copies of such data on their own storage devices however in the longterm it will become increasingly likely that central it groups will be required to incorporate formal end point security solutions into their overall physical safeguard portfolio software security organizations should implement identity confirmation procedures for individuals or entities requesting access to e phi each user that has access granted to the e phi containing application must be assigned with a unique username that is never reused even if the original person to whom the username belonged has left the organization the healthcare institution should prohibit sharing of login information a generic login may be used to log into a computer workstation however before using any information system application users are required to authenticate authentication is the process of verifying or confirming the identity of a user that is requesting access to information in the united states the national institute of standards and technology nist issued an electronic authentication guideline that recommends four levels of assurance for authentication processes involved in electronic transactions 18 to help with this process especially in organizations where users have to access multiple information systems various authentication tools are currently available including usernamepassword pairs single signon biometrics id using human traits such as voice or fingerprints and hardware or software tokens 18 these mechanisms can also be used to authenticate the identity of users who are involved in the transport of specimens slides or other materials between multiple locations 19passwords passwords are currently the main mechanism used for user authentication therefore proper enforcement of password use is critical organizations should use procedures for creating changing and safeguarding passwords covered entities need to enforce strong passwords for log on to information systems and medical applications 20 the international standards organization iso and other groups have recommendations for passwords 21 in general good passwords contain at least six characters mixed lower and uppercase as well as numbers and possibly even punctuation marks demanding users to select sophisticated passwords however may result in passwords being written down 22 alternatively password management tools can allow users to encrypt by using a master password organize and save passwords on external media ie usb flashdrive security questions may also be implemented to permit users easy recovery of forgotten passwords bypassing additional calls to the computer services helpdesk although current best practices suggest changing passwords every 90 days password aging this is controversial especially in the healthcare environment a better approach could be a balance between strong passwords and longer time between required changes eg 12 months password aging could possibly identify users who do not login to systems for an extended period of time it is also recommended that only one login per user at a time should be allowed and only one login session at a time this permits id and monitoring for password sharing and users accounts should be locked after a maximum number of login attempts failed login attempts allow identification of unauthorized use of passwords automated logout policies can be implemented so that after a certain period of inactivity the session is automatically disconnected from the system however if the automated logout time is too short it can interfere with systems usability a recent trend supporting increased password robustness is the use of socalled twofactor authentication where a second credential is required in addition to the standard signon password in one model a key fob with a rotating pseudorandom multidigit numerical key is used to provide the second factor ie rsa security solutions inc alternatively a numerical key can be texted to the users smart phone ie google gmail etc with this added layer in place it becomes increasingly difficult to simply use a stolen usernamepassword list to gain unauthorized access to hipaacovered systems 23single signon single signon enables users to use one id and password pair to access multiple related but independent systems the most common technique used is called clinical context object workgroup ccow this is a standard written and adopted by health level seven hl7 it is vendor independent and allows users to obtain information about a specific patient from all interconnected systems however this does not allow the viewer to see any information belonging to another patient from any secondary systems ccow works for both clientserver and webbased applications apart from the benefits of reducing password fatigue single signon also reduces it costs due to the decreased volume of password related helpdesk calls however there are risks with single signon such as gaining access to multiple systems when one user name and password has been compromised on a technical level ccow solutions should be implemented with significant care and diligence as there have been a number of documented instances where ccow synchronization errors have caused patient harm owing to intermittent failure of the layer to keep all disparate applications pointed to the same patient instance thus extensive local validation is needed prior to certifying any ccow solution as being ready for clinical use 24biometrics biometric devices permit the use of biometrics which are unique and measurable characteristics of a human being that allow automatic recognition or identity verification 25 examples include fingerprinting palm vein patterns iris or retinal patterns recognition speech scans and even sometimes dna 26 although dna is still not a practical authentication method due to expense time and intrusiveness involved the iris pattern recognition is increasingly accepted and practical 27 28 biometrics are unique and their use makes it very difficult if not impossible to forge identity however biometric devices are not infallible once a biometric file is intercepted the patients biometric could be definitively compromised thus it is important that biometric data not be used for purposes the enrolled individual did not provide consent in addition the biometric template needs biometric authentication protection this led to the development of cancelable biometrics and biometrics cryptosystems which as an additional security measure dont have stored the full biometric template 29 employing more than one method of authentication such as a password and fingerprinting makes it more difficult for users to share credentials thereby reducing the risks for unauthorized access access control information systems should have the ability to control which users can have access to it and what information those users can view in a role based access control  rbac system the access is granted based on users roles eg administrator pathologist resident histotechnologist etc  and on the permitted role for specific information access eg only read data or provided with access to write change or delete data 30 the rbac system however does have limitations these often occur in the case of users that need different levels of access to perform their job for example a lab technician who works in hematology during the week but on occasion covers the blood bank on weekends will need different levels of access to the clinical pathology lis and blood bank systems similarly some pathologists may be members of the quality improvement committee thus needing access to sensitive quality related data in addition to information required to perform their daily clinical work therefore computer systems need capabilities to accommodate these special situations moreover computer systems should have capabilities to override standard settings in the case of an emergency generation and maintenance of the rbac list is a difficult task requiring collaboration between information security personnel human resources clinical administration and others a data protection officer could oversee these activities maintenance activities include tracking when a user has changed roles or left the institution or when the users role itself needs to be modified audit trails modern liss have capabilities to perform additional random or by request audits on access record viewing and modification of patient data written documentation of such reviews of information system activity eg audit logs access reports security incident tracking reports should be required so that they will be available during inspections or if questions arise about safety of data 31data security measures apart from the aforementioned security measures there are many other factors that need to be considered when dealing with data in the pathology laboratory this includes data integrity protection recovery and encryption data integrity data integrity refers to the process of maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle 32 therefore data that has integrity is identically maintained during any operation such as transfer storage or retrieval including backup in order to achieve this certain rules need to be consistently and routinely applied to all data entering the system data integrity often includes checks and corrections for invalid data based on a predefined set of rules data integrity is normally enforced in a database system by a series of integrity constraints rules such as entity integrity referential integrity or domain integrity table 1 outdated and legacy systems that use file systems ie text spreadsheets flat files etc lack any kind of data integrity model in the pathology laboratory it is important to verify the integrity of lis after restoration of data files this can be accomplished by reviewing a representative set of lisgenerated patient reports or by creating test dummy patient reports for review 33data protection strategies the pathology laboratory must be able to easily retrieve a complete copy of stored patient results which includes all the pertinent associated data eg original reference range used annotations etc 34 to protect electronic patient data various methods and strategies can be enforced continuous data protection cdp also called continuous backup refers to backup of data by saving it automatically every time the data is changed this allows restoration of data either file system or user data to any point in time specialized software can provide fine granularity allowing just the restoration of a particular file or type of files eg mail boxes database logs etc while traditional backup can only restore data to the point at which the backup was taken based on backup schedules the continuous data approach allows for data restoration at any given time this can be achieved by writing data not only to the original location on a disk but also to a secondary location usually another computer over a network 12 another advantage of cdp is that decreased backup media space is needed compared to the traditional backup usually cdp saves byte or blocklevel differences rather than the entire modified file while traditional backups make copies of entire files however a major disadvantage is the continuous bandwidth usage required with cdp this may adversely affect network performance especially for operations where file sizes are large throttling techniques that prioritize network traffic in order to reduce the impact of backup on daytoday operations can be employed data can be divided and replicated among multiple physical drives using redundant array of independent disks raid originally known as redundant array of inexpensive disks storage technology raid allows data to be stored redundantly in a balanced way to improve overall storage performance a number of raid levels were developed to provide different balance between performance capacity and tolerance based on systems needs however currently there is no standard and raid implementations can be proprietary and unique to individual vendors raid can be implemented as software software manages mirroring of data that is stored on internal or external drives controllers hardware devices that have processing power that can be added to a server to offload the overhead of raid from the cpus or storage arrays multiple highperformance redundant raid controllers connected to multiple storage disks 35 the use of raid as well as replication and mirroring might protect only the most recent copy of data when data corruption is not immediately detected these technologies could actually protect corrupted data therefore cdp technology allows data restoration to previous uncorrupted versions transactions that took place after the corrupting event will be lost in this setting however they could be recovered in other manner transaction logging is a process that records a history of all data modifications performed in a database that guarantees reliability for hardware failure recoveries and acid atomicity consistency isolation durability properties of database transactions database updates are saved in files located on a stable storage and are used during a recovery process permitting a complete data recovery data recovery it is important for a laboratory to have procedures in place for their timely recovery from a destructive event data recovery implies salvaging data when it cannot be accessed normally due to damaged corrupted or inaccessible secondary storage media mass storage devices related to the actual physical damage of the storage device or to logical damage of the file system that prevents it from being mounted by the host operating system os 13 secondary media can be internal or external hard disk drives solid state drives usb flash drives storage magnetic tapes cds dvds or raid the most common scenario for data recovery is related to an os failure this can be accomplished by simply copying all the wanted files to a new disk from the backup media the best approach is to have the disk partitioned and to store valuable data files on a different partition than the replaceable os system another scenario involves files deleted from a storage medium usually references to the deleted files in the os directory structure are removed and the space they occupy is made available for later overwriting but the contents of the deleted files may still be stored on the disk drive in a number of disconnected fragments and may thus be recoverable this type of data recovery can be achieved with specialized software such data recovery can be used in forensic applications where data may not necessary be damaged however is hidden or encrypted solutions such as system snapshots or ghost copies of entire workstation are good strategies to backup and restore entire systems including operating systems and installed application which can allow for more rapid total system recovery data encryption in the united states hipaa requires covered entities to notify individuals if health related personal identifiable information is lost or stolen however this can be avoided if the lost personal identifiable information has been properly encrypted according to standards imposed by nist 33 encryption disguises data based on the mathematical algorithms preventing it from being read except by the intended recipient who has the key the original information is enciphered to become unreadable for unauthorized parties an authorized party on the other hand can decrypt the data using a decryption algorithm ie key applications are available for it managers that can enforce the encryption of an entire hard drive of a computer or device ie smartphone or tablet systems such as virtual private network technology leverage encryption to allow for secure communication over public networks by encrypting all data effectively and by creating a secure tunnel internet security the internet enhances information and communication among individual workstations and on a large scale between medical information systems however the internet is a public environment with highrisk security threats when liss instruments workstations andor mobile devices are connected to the internet significant protection is required 36 personal computer pc security in the era of internet connectivity involves not only safeguarding computers and networks themselves but also protecting the information that is stored and transmitted laboratory computers may be exposed to many security risks eg intrusion from hackers viruses from emails spyware denialofservice attack phishing and so on all laboratory personnel including pathologists should have a basic understanding of internet security threats and should be in compliance with their organizations policies and procedures to avert them there is always a tradeoff between the level of protection desired and the cost of protection enforcement or systems functionality 37 internet security involves both network and browser security measures network layer security often uses protocols such as secure sockets layer ssl for web traffic a ssl connection allows the browser and server of a web transmission to authenticate identities and encrypt data transferred ssl works by using a private key to encrypt data that is being transferred in so doing ssl ensures that data that came from a web server is in the original form and that no one tampered with it web servers that support ssl sessions have web addresses that start with https instead of http in the united stated hipaa requires that all internet transmissions containing patient data are sent using at minimum ssl to protect confidentiality 38 39firewalls firewalls are systems that act as filters between networks preventing outside access to private networks or limiting access to the outside from within the network they can be hardware software or a combination of both software can analyze incoming or outgoing data to determine whether they are appropriate and if they meet criteria to be granted access to the network firewalls can limit systems functionality for example they may sometimes block signals required to remotely control robotic microscopes during telepathology firewalls are maintained by system administrators who are responsible for the implementation of organizations policies on network access 40 41antivirus software there are many different kinds of malware malicious software protection from malicious software is critical due to the increased number and severity of cyberattack threats software viruses are computer programs that can replicate themselves and spread from one computer to another they are written intentionally to alter a computers operation and almost always corrupt or modify files on targeted computers trojan horses are malicious applications masquerading as legitimate software that can grant hackers unauthorized access to computers they dont replicate in computer files however when installed usually in tandem with other applications downloaded online can allow hackers to harm host computers or to steal locally stored information spyware are software applications designed to monitor users computing they can collect almost any type of data including login passwords computer worms are standalone malware applications that replicate to spread to other computers usually through computer networks even if there is no direct harm to computer files they can slowdown network data transmission by consuming bandwidth 42 antivirus software can detect and protect computers and networks from malware however to be effective they need to be properly used they have to be correctly configured for automated regular virus definition updates and file scanning internet security software suites provide additional safety typically adding firewalls and application access control or privacy features workforce education and implementation of policies and procedures that prevent malicious software installation although not currently required by law are highly recommended interfaced instruments interfaced instruments have unique security challenges and requirements whereas in the past most instruments controllers used proprietary operating systems and dedicated network communication protocols these days they use widely windows based operating systems and transmission control protocol and internet protocol tcpip based network protocols for communications this exposes laboratory instrumentation to the same type of security issues discussed for pcs servers and mobile devices therefore instruments os and hardware protection must be approached similarly to typical computers further vendors typically will request appropriate secure internetbased access to these devices by using technology such as virtual private networks vpn this allows for significant improvement in support and troubleshooting that must be supported these requirements are mandated by a specific clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi standard 38 as a result placing an instrument with an os windows requires planning for monitoring access setting up secure vendor access installation of antivirus software and planning for backup and restoration in case of system failure one complexity often encountered is that these medical devices may not come under the jurisdiction of the larger it group but rather the medical device support group the fact that computers associated with these instruments were placed by an outside vendor can create controversy over the installation of antivirus software or the use of institutional backup and restore software due to perceived or actual license restrictions furthermore given these devices complexity antivirus software could potentially interfere with the required communications as could both firewalls and proxy servers mobile devices the increased use of mobile devices eg smartphones tablet computers and wireless medical devices eg pointofcaretesting in healthcare realm pose serious challenges for organizations with respect to ensuring data security and integrity 43 44 45 clinicians are increasingly demanding to have laboratory results and critical values communicated directly to their mobile devices to protect e phi institutions that permit the use of mobile devices need to develop new policies for their appropriate clinical use and to adopt costeffective ways to manage their security however currently there are limited standards with respect to the use of wireless data in healthcare 39 41 46 in 2005 the food and drug administration issued a notice entitled cybersecurity for networked medical devices is a shared responsibility 47 nevertheless new regulations related to secure authentication for mobile devices 48 options to track and secure mobile devices remotely by locking or wiping out information 49 or for the use of clinical software on personal mobile devices are still needed new policies eg use of secure text messages and secure email communication and technologies eg cloud computing that can allow physicians to send and receive encrypted messages on mobile devices are currently being developed to overcome some of these security issues 50 pathology informaticists should be prepared to handle data from the next generation of healthcare technologies such as inhome patient monitoring devices that could push labrelated data directly to the hospitals electronic medical record 51us regulations for health information security under hipaa pathology laboratories are legally required to securely acquire analyze store and transmit the vast amounts of electronic data they handle according to hipaa health information that is associated to an identifiable patient is known as individually identifiable health information iihi a subset of this type of information is known as protected health information phi the legal definitions of these terms are presented in table 3 52 laboratory results in combination with unique patient demographics and patient identifiers constitute phi regardless of form because laboratory accession numbers are designed to uniquely identify a patient within a health facility these also should be treated as phi according to the last item in the list of identifiers from the 45 cfr code of federal regulations sect 164514 any other uniquely identifying code characteristic or number table 4 52 if one fails to remove an accession number from a specimen during deidentification the burden will be on that individual to demonstrate why an accession number could not be used alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual if it is very easy to remove the specimen number the legal system could be less inclined to accept the documented risk analysis by weighting any risks relative to the efforts required to remove that information table 3 legal definitions related to health information click here to view table 4 legal requirements for deidentifying protected health information click here to view in the united states hipaa governs privacy and protection of medical information and health records 53 the initial hipaa rules enacted by the federal government in 1996 were related to the administration of health insurance and aimed at improvement of continuity and availability of health insurance coverage as well as at the prevention of waste fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry according to this act an individuals phi has to be kept confidential and only used in hisher best interests 54 only personnel involved in a particular patients care are considered to have a business relationship with this often referred to as a needtoknow basis and therefore are authorized to access that patients medical record three components related to the privacy and security of phi were initially included in this act creation of a federally managed system of unique patient identifier safeguards to protect that identifier and transaction formats for health information these were also considered building blocks for the creation of the national health information network nhin 55 unfortunately 2 years later congress repealed the health identifier which would have been a major advance for the us medical care systems yet left in place the draconian security measures designed only to protect that identifier hipaa also required privacy regulation to be issued by the united states department of health and human services hhs the final version of this privacy regulation known as the hipaa privacy rule was issued on december 28 2000 56 this rule gives patients certain rights over their health information including the right to obtain and examine a copy of their health record and to request an amendment of their record at the same time it requires safeguards to protect the privacy of phi 56 covered entities have the right to decline a patients request but must document the reasons for declining to release the data requested 57 the privacy rule encouraged the development of health information systems by establishing standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information modifications to the privacy rule were issued in august of 2002 which established national standards for protection of health information including unique health identifiers for individuals employers health plans and healthcare providers as well as electronic transmission and authentication of signatures 52 per hipaa a ce is any group or organization that creates transmits receives and maintains phi including e phi these encompass healthcare plans healthcare billing companies or healthcare providers a business associate ba is a person or organization other than a member of a ces workforce that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of or provides certain services to a ce that involve the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information hipaa applies to all covered entities and to bas 58 concurrently with the development of the privacy rule the secretary of hhs was required to publish national standards for the security of e phi under the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa presumably due to the continuous growth of electronic data use and proven cases of e phi misuse the proposed rule for electronic security of e phi was issued for comment on august 12 1998 but was not finalized until almost 5 years later on february 20 2003 59 known as the hipaa security rule it mandates appropriate administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure confidentiality integrity and security of e phi 59 hence the security rule applies only to phi in electronic form while the privacy rule consists of security standards that apply to phi in any medium faxes if they originate on paper are specifically excluded from the security rule both the security rule and the privacy rule require ce to implement safeguards to protect phi however the privacy rule provides no specific details and simply requires that ce reasonably protect phi with appropriate safeguards while the security rule specifies 43 categories of safeguards table 5 table 6 and table 7 3 60 each safeguard is listed as either required or addressable required safeguards must be implemented covered entities must evaluate addressable safeguards for feasibility and appropriateness if the safeguard is not implemented the ce must document the reasons for that decision when it is decided that the addressable specifications are not appropriate documentation including alternative methods is imperative healthcare organizations can go above and beyond the law by implementing greater data protection measures than what it is required by law with the caveat that implementing such expanded measures imparts a regulatory expectation that they will be assiduously followed these requirements can have significant impact on the computing within an organization limiting workflow and creating barriers to adoption of valuable information technology hippa regulations also require that covered entities have notice of privacy practices posted online on the public domain available for patient access and similar notices distributed with inpatientoutpatient registration questionnaires given to patients 61table 5 administrative safeguards according to hipaa security policies and proceduresclick here to view table 6 physical safeguards according to hipaa hardware securityclick here to view table 7 technical safeguards according to hipaa software securityclick here to view the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech signed into law in the usa on february 17 2009 modified a number of hipaa regulations 62 both ce and ba are required to report breaches of security while the penalties for unauthorized disclosure are stiffened 62 63 the security breach notification rule within hitech requires ces and their bas to notify any affected patient when the security of their phi has been compromised according to predefined guidelines in no case later than 60 days following the breach discovery if there is insufficient contact information for 10 or more affected individuals the ce must post the notice on the home page of its web site or provide it in major print or broadcast regional media where the affected individuals likely reside for security breaches that affect more than 500 identified individuals ces must notify the secretary of hhs as well as prominent media outlets in addition to satisfying the previously mentioned notification of patients breach of fully deidentified data is not considered as a reportable event hhs maintains a public and searchable web site with records of these breaches 64 between september 2009 and november 2012 there have been 511 security breaches of this type reported in the u s affecting over 21 million individuals in total most of the reported breaches involved e phi including loss theft hacking and unauthorized access of laptops backup tapes computers servers or portable electronic devices loss of large sets of patient data was primarily due to theft 5218 or accidental disclosure 1839 the location of data at the time of loss has been overwhelmingly on paper 2529 or on a laptop 2506 65 breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals are required to be reported in a more limited fashion to the hhs on an annual basis encrypted data does not need to be reported for example in late 2012 a university of michigan clinical investigators laptop was stolen from a vehicle although the pc contained tens of thousands of identified results the laptop featured the standard enterpriseissued fulldisk nistcompliant encryption thus meeting the safe harbor provision under the hitech act consequently there was only the fiduciary need to carry out a breach analysis locally with no further need to file a data incident report with hhs with hitech penalties for unauthorized disclosures including those associated with security breaches related to health information have been substantially increased 62 currently for a single unauthorized disclosure convicted individuals ce or ba can be fined from 100 to up to 50000 or face imprisonment depending on the level of intent to do harm during a single calendar year the maximum fine for all unauthorized disclosures for a particular ce or ba is 15 million a study performed by a major privacy and security research center in 2011 found that the frequency of reported data breaches among 72 organizations surveyed increased by 32 from the previous year generating a significant increase 10fold in associated costs ie fines communication remediation loss of strategic partners or patients unsecured mobile devices were particularly responsible for these vulnerabilities 66research data the use of human samples and related healthcare data for research purposes has been invaluable in the past and will become critical in the near future especially with the implementation of genomics and proteomics development of gridbased systems such as the cancer biomedical informatics grid ca big may better assist with these tasks however they pose new data security challenges to participating pathology laboratories including new regulatory measures 5 it is the ability to connect a unique individual with private medical information that causes most of the concern for unauthorized disclosure the legal requirements in the united states under which health information can be deidentified is presented in table 4 therefore when dealing with biomedical informatics research deidentification and anonymization eg data scrubbing using the doublet method 67 are important techniques to minimize potential loss of patient confidentiality and privacy moreover access and use of this type of data must be strictly enforced and restricted to the purpose defined in the informed consent disclosure results filters and query restrictions are two of the proposed methods to enforce data privacy in this context the software interface removes data that is not supposed to be seen by the requester from the query results 51 in the u s before pathology data can be used for research purposes laboratory needs to make sure that its use complies with hipaa the common rule 63 68 69 70 and with the institutional review board irb guidelines as a general rule patient data to be used for research studies should be fully deidentified unless there is a compelling need for the use of identified or anonymized data sets eg for longitudinal studies where matching new results to prior results is paramount typically it is the role of the irb to determine the level of patient data identification that will be allowed for any given study finally in settings where anonymized data is to be used many institutions have adopted the concept of an honest broker clearing house that manages the codebook between fully identified data as housed in the institutions primary repositories and the anonymized data set as used by individual investigators in this manner the research team has no possibility of accidentally discovering the identity of their study subjects most importantly this investigative model has been thoroughly reviewed and approved by the federal governments office for human research protections making the honest broker model an important operational element of any enterprise considering clinical research 5 71emergency situations it is very important that an emergency service is available for all key hardware and software being used in the laboratory in the u s hipaa requires procedures for accessing necessary e phi during emergency situations it managers may need to recover access to computers even if they are protected with basic inputoutput system bioslevel security full disk encryption and strong multifactor authentication the security rule mandates emergency access procedures 59 they have to be activated in the case of a potential lifethreatening situation when a physician or other member of the healthcare team needs immediate access to information to which they normally do not have access these types of procedures are called breakglass access procedures an emergency access solution should be utilized only when normal processes are insufficient eg the helpdesk or system administrators are unavailable documentation policies rules to guide decisions and procedures usually process descriptions that deal with it securityrelated issues in the laboratory should be made available to users and it staff in the laboratory in order to comply with the hipaa privacy and security rules covered entities are required to develop appropriate written policies and procedures for each standard implementation and to periodically review and update them policies and procedures should document adherence to regulatory requirements as well as handling of staff violations they need to be communicated to staff in an understandable way and compliance has to be monitored on a regular basis through audit and risk analysis processes the laboratory director is responsible with the regular review of written policies and procedures as well as of any written records of assessments actions or activities eg at least annually or when a major system changes in addition it is important that division of pathology informatics documents any maintenance modifications customizations testing after modifications validation activities downtime scheduled or unscheduled and user training they are involved with conclusion given that pathology laboratories are heavily involved in dealing with patient information for clinical and possibly research purposes policies and procedures that deal with data protection and security are critical contemporary pathology laboratories need to address security concerns due to increased connectivity of their information systems and workstations to the internet as well as to address the demand for wireless and mobile devices use a fundamental activity for laboratories at least in the usa is to remain compliant with hipaa and hitech the most recent updates made to the hipaa privacy and security rules were published in january 2013 and were effective beginning march 26 2013 they implemented hitech strengthened privacy protections under genetic information nondiscrimination act and included other changes especially affecting bas according to these new updates bas became subject to direct civil penalties if found responsible for privacy or security breaches 72 helpful resources that pathologists and laboratory personnel responsible for patient data privacy and security should have handy include college of american pathologists checklists for laboratory accreditation 73 these checklists include a special section for laboratory computer services which covers all major aspects of liss and computer services in the laboratory including privacy and security of patient data in addition special stipulations related to confidentiality and security of patient data for telepathology services are addressed centers for medicare and medicaid services published educational materials and guidelines related to compliance with hipaa privacy and security standards and health insurance reform 59clsi published technical and operational standards as well as technical implementation procedures related to security of in vitro diagnostic ivd systems devices analytical instruments data management systems etc installed at a healthcare organization the auto11ait security of ivd instruments and software systems document is intended for vendors users eg laboratory personnel and the it management of healthcare organizations 74the information security task force of the international society of blood transfusion developed and published guidelines for information security in transfusion medicine these guidelines address the applicability of the hipaa security standards in transfusion medicine 75in todays environment liss are almost never relied upon besides true core laboratory workers for data retrieval or reference laboratory data is uploaded many times to multiple electronic medical records and even when the lis is the most secure environment risks still exist for those data to be compromised because of systems that are not under the laboratory control therefore it is essential to have a full and unwavering organizationwide commitment to the security of phi references1 ulirsch rc ashwood er noce p security in the clinical laboratory guidelines for managing the information resource
