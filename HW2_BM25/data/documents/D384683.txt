and floors to prevent moisture from passing into the interior spaces damp problems are among the most frequent problems encountered in homes contents  hide 1 overview2 materials3 masonry construction4 concrete walls and floors5 remedial damp proofing6 health and safety7 references overview  editdpc visible between concrete foundation and brickwork damp proofing is defined by the american society for testing and materials astm as a material that resists the passage of water with no hydrostatic pressure and waterproof as a treatment that resists the passage of water under pressure 1 generally damp proofing keeps moisture out of a building where vapor barriers keep interior moisture from getting into walls moisture resistance is not necessarily absolute it is usually defined by a specific test method limits and engineering tolerances damp proofing is accomplished several ways including a dampproof course dpc is a barrier through the structure designed to prevent moisture rising by capillary action such as through a phenomenon known as rising damp rising damp is the effect of water rising from the ground into property 2 the damp proof course may be horizontal or vertical 3 a dpc layer is usually laid below all masonry walls regardless if the wall is a load bearing wall or a partition wall a dampproof membrane dpm is a membrane material applied to prevent moisture transmission a common example is polyethylene sheeting laid under a concrete slab to prevent the concrete from gaining moisture through capillary action 4 a dpm may be used for the dpc integral damp proofing in concrete involves adding materials to the concrete mix to make the concrete itself impermeable 3surface coating with thin water proof materials for resistance to nonpressurized moisture such as rain water or a coating of cement sprayed on such as shotcrete which can resist water under pressure 3cavity wall construction such as rainscreen construction is where the interior walls are separated from the exterior walls by a cavity 3pressure grouting cracks and joints in masonry materials 3materials  editmaterials widely used for damp proofing include 5flexible materials like butyl rubber hot bitumen plastic sheets bituminous felts sheets of lead copper etc semirigid materials like mastic asphalt rigid materials like impervious bricks stones slates cement mortar or cement concrete painted with bitumen etc stones mortar with waterproofing compounds coarse sand layers under floors continuous plastic sheets under floors masonry construction  edita dpc is a durable impermeable material such as slate felt paper metal plastic or special engineered bricks 6 bedded into the mortar between two courses of bricks or blocks it can often be seen as a thin line in the mortar near ground level to create a continuous barrier pieces of dpc or dpm may be sealed together in addition the dpc may be sealed to the dpm around the outside edges of the ground floor completely sealing the inside of the building from the damp ground around it in a masonry cavity wall there is usually a dpc in both the outer and inner wall  citation needed in the outer wall it is normally 150 millimetres 59 in to 200 millimetres 79 in above ground level the height of 23 brick courses this allows rain to form puddles and splash up off the ground without saturating the wall above dpc level the wall below the dpc may become saturated in rainy weather the dpc in the inner wall is usually below floor level under a suspended timber floor structure or with a solid concrete floor it is usually found immediately above the floor slab so that it can be linked to the dpm under the floor slab this enables installation of skirting boards above floor level without fear of puncturing it alternatively instead of fitting separate inner and outer dpcs it is common in commercial housebuilding to use a onepiece length of rigid plastic albeit an angled section which fits neatly across the cavity and slots into both walls a cavity tray this method requires the need for weep vents to enable rainwater ingress to drain from the cavities otherwise rising dampness could occur from above the dpc concrete walls and floors  editconcrete normally allows moisture to pass through so a vertical damp proof barrier is needed barriers may be a coating or membrane applied to the exterior of the concrete the coating may be asphalt asphalt emulsion a thinned asphalt called cutback asphalt or a rubber polymer 7 membranes are rubberized asphalt or epdm rubber rubberized products perform better because concrete sometimes develops cracks and the barrier does not crack with the concrete remedial damp proofing  edituntil the 20th century masonry buildings in europe and north america were generally constructed from highly permeable materials such as stone and limebased mortars and renders covered with soft waterbased paints which all allowed any damp to diffuse into the air without damage the later application of impermeable materials which prevent the natural dispersion of damp such as tiles linoleum cement and gypsumbased materials and synthetic paints is thought by some to be the most significant cause of damp problems in older buildings 8there are many solutions for dealing with dampness in existing buildings the choice of which will largely be determined by the types of dampness that are affecting the building eg rising damp hygroscopic damp condensation penetrating damp etc these are described in more detail under damp structural health and safety  editsome dpc materials may contain asbestos fibres this was more commonly found in the older grey sealants as well as flexible tar boards other possibly hazardous materials include the use of lead sheets as a dpc material references  edit
