cite permissions share abstract iron deficiency anemia in early life is related to altered behavioral and neural development studies in human infants suggest that this is an irreversible effect that may be related to changes in chemistry of neurotransmitters organization and morphology of neuronal networks and neurobiology of myelination the acquisition of iron by the brain is an agerelated and brainregiondependent process with tightly controlled rates of movement of iron across the bloodbrain barrier dopamine receptors and transporters are altered as are behaviors related to this neurotransmitter the growing body of evidence suggests that brain iron deficiency in early life has multiple consequences in neurochemistry and neurobiologyiron deficiency brain development behavior rats humans neurotransmitters topiciron membrane transport proteins neurotransmitters brain rats iron deficiency brain development issue section supplement 11th international symposium on trace elements in man and animals iron deficiency is reported to be the most prevalent nutritional problem in the world today with an estimated 25–5 billion people so afflicted  1 2  among the numerous biological effects of iron there is considerable evidence that iron is also important for neurological functioning and development  3 – 7  this biological basis of the behavioral and cognitive developmental delays observed in irondeficient infants is not completely understood but possibilities include i abnormalities in neurotransmitter metabolism  3 6 8 9  ii decreased myelin formation  10  and iii alterations in brain energy metabolism  11  although the most recent evidence from human studies using auditoryevoked potential changes in irondeficient infants does not distinguish between these three biological possibilities it does point toward slowed central neural processing as a key component in neural dysfunction in iron deficiency  5 12  this article will focus on distinct bodies of evidence regarding the role of iron in neural functioning and its relationship to cognition and behavior how does the brain get iron and where does it go within the brain there is a system for the acquisition of iron from the plasma pool transferrin tf receptor a mechanism for the dispersal or mobilization of iron tf 4 a mechanism for cellspecific iron storage h and l isoforms of ferritin and a functional pool of iron within each cell  3 13 14  the bloodbrain barrier provides an effective regulatory point for iron movement from the plasma pool to the cerebral spinal fluid whereas the choroids plexus is also a likely source of iron movement into and out of the brain not all brain regions contain the same amount of iron with the basal ganglia substantia nigra and deep cerebellar nuclei particularly rich in iron  14 15  magnetic resonance imaging mri has recently been used to map iron distribution in the brains of children and adolescents  15 16  the highest concentrations are found in globus pallidus caudate nucleus putamen and substantia nigra as noted in figure 1 there is nearly a threefold variation in iron concentrations within rat brain as well as a heterogeneous response to dietary iron deprivation or iron loading areas of the brain that are iron rich in adult rat brains are not iron rich for the first 60 d of life  17  interestingly the same is true in humans where the substantia nigra does not become rich in iron until the age of 12–15 y  16  the concentration of iron is highest in the brain at birth decreases through weaning and then begins to increase coincident with the onset of myelination and an increased expression of tf m rna  5 17 18  figure 1view large download slide changes in brain iron fe transferrin tf ferritin ferr and

rats given an iron supplemented diet 350 μ g feg diet from postnatal days 10–35 35susu the brain obtains iron primarily via tf and tf receptors expressed in endothelial cells on the brain microvasculature  2 19  there appears to be a regulatory role for adjacent astrocytes in the regulation of this uptake across the bloodbrain barrier  fig 2  we and others have studied this process as a function of both iron status of the brain and the potential role of plasma tf saturation on rates of iron uptake  20 – 22  the rate of uptake of iron is affected by iron status there is an increased rate when the iron status is low and a decreased rate when it is high  23  in addition this uptake process is highly selective and not reflective of overall bloodbrain barrier permeability  24 25  our collaborative efforts with the laboratory of dr james connor demonstrated a heterogeneous loss of iron from the brain with dietary iron deficiency and a heterogeneous “restoration” of iron with iron therapy  20 – 22  the heterogeneous distribution of iron in brain may very well be the result of regional regulation of uptake and redistribution processes that are dependent on the distributions of tf receptor and newly described endosomal metal transport protein dmt1 divalent metal transporter and a proposed cellular iron exporter ferroportin mtp1 or fpn1  26  the regional distributions of tf protein and m rna levels lend support to the notion that the bulk of brain tf protein is translocated to those regions because the locations of tf and tf m rna are distinct  27  fig 3  figure 2view

rna distributions in young adult rat brain and agematched control han et al  26 does timing of iron deficiency matter the previously mentioned studies in human infants of nerve conduction provide some evidence that the effects of iron deficiency on biological neural functioning are irreversible  5 12  the issue of timing of iron deficiency therefore is of great importance these biological measurements are the first data that directly support the contention that human toddlers with iron deficiency anemia suffer developmental delays due to biological abnormalities given the fact that nearly all of the published clinical intervention trials in human infants also fail to show a complete normalization in functioning despite a normalization of iron status investigators are forced to consider the question of “critical periods” of development that absolutely require adequate iron nutriture for “normal” development a number of animal studies have been conducted in an attempt to mimic and model the human condition and the timing of nutrient deficiency to coincide with the timing of peak risk of human infant iron deficiency  28  as autopsy data of human infants suffering solely from iron deficiency is nonexistent we have relied on animal models and imaging methods to argue for the existence of “a critical period” although the course of development in the rat is more compressed than in humans in both species there is the same sequence of cell migration significant myelination cellular differentiation and increased expression of neuropeptides what appears to occur from 3–16 mo postnatal in humans occurs from 7–25 d postnatal in rats  28  iron deficiency during lactation in the rat results in significant loss of regional brain iron that is distinct from those regions that lose iron with dietary restrictions later in life  22  fig 4  importantly the restoration of brain iron with later aggressive dietary iron repletion also resulted in incomplete restoration of abnormalities in dopamine da metabolism and in behaviors related to da  22 29 30  ie  the sensitivity of a brain region to loss of iron during development is likely to be related to the regional development requirements for iron during that period in contrast to the perception that brain iron is “resistant” to iron depletion these experiments demonstrate quite clearly that in the rodent dietary treatments can decrease brain iron within 10 d and replete iron within 14 d comparative data in human infants or primate models are lacking thus there remains uncertainty regarding the completeness of brain iron recovery in humans despite full restoration of hematological indices of iron status  5 12  figure 4view large download slide microdialysis dopamine da content from caudate

dialysate was collected every 20 min and measured by hplc nelson et al  29 the great ado concerning irreversibility of effects of iron deficiency in infancy is thus based on several features i the vast majority of studies in humans have had a focus on irondeficient infants 12–24 mo of age without similar careful examinations of children who are older ii animal models show very clear irreversible abnormalities resulting from gestational and early lactational iron deficiency iii reports of adolescent and adult iron deficiency and brain functioning generally show a normalization in behaviors with correction of the iron deficiency  31  a recently described clinical condition called restless legs syndrome rls appears to be related to deficits in brain iron content and metabolism  32  mri images demonstrate a decrease in substantia nigra and red nucleus iron content the severity of this decrease in brain iron content is correlated with the severity of symptoms a number of patients are quite resistant to dietary iron repletion but do resolve symptoms in a majority of cases with high doses of intravenous iron dextran it is quite interesting that many patients respond to da agonists or ldopa if rls is a primary diagnosis as we present in the next section there is clear evidence for a cellular connection between da metabolism and iron metabolism iron and neurotransmitters the dopaminergic system develops rapidly during early postnatal life with a rapid increase in the number and density of da transporters and receptors in terminal field up to early puberty other monoamine transporters and receptors are also being actively expressed in developing neuronal tracts during this time period with continued modification in density up through puberty and into adulthood these monoamine projections play an important role in the organization of axonal growth and synapse formation during early stages of brain growth but convert to their more traditional role of neurotransmission with aging the role of iron or other micronutrients in this “pruning” of neuronal connections with development is not generally known nor is there an awareness of the impact of this potential role of iron in brain biology on subsequent developmental achievement the potential or demonstrated role of iron in neurotransmitter metabolism has been investigated by a number of research groups over the past four decades as a result we know that iron is essential for a number of enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis  3 14 including tryptophan hydroxylase serotonin and tyrosine hydroxylase norepinephrine ne and da in addition iron is a cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase and is essential for the functioning of a number of electron transfer reactions related to both lipid metabolism and brainenergy metabolism  14  iron is related to the activity of monoamine oxidase an enzyme critical for proper rates of degradation of these neurotransmitters apart from these biochemical roles of iron there are several other fundamental observations i iron is colocalized with dopaminergic neurons throughout the brain  6 14  ii extracellular da and ne are elevated in brains of irondeficient rats but other neurotransmitters are not  8 30 33  iii as brain iron concentration drops due to dietary iron restriction there are decreases in density of d 2 and d 1 receptors and da transporters in striatum  8 29 35  iv the loss of brain iron with dietary iron deficiency is region specific and leads to a heterogeneous effect on da neurobiology ie in the regions where iron does not fall there are no changes in da biology  8 9  and v the effects of iron deficiency on brain da are not due to anemia per se because hemolytic anemia in the absence of iron deficiency does not produce these abnormalities in da neurobiology  fig 4  6 8 35  although most of the research activity on brain iron and neurotransmitters has focused on da there is evidence that both serotonin and ne metabolism are also altered in brain iron insufficiency the serotonin transporter density was significantly lower in brains of irondeficient mice  34 whereas in vivo microdialysis in rats provided evidence for decreased rates of uptake of ne  33  our own studies of cold tolerance and thermoregulation showed that irondeficient anemic women and rats had elevated plasma ne levels  36  this is consistent with a more rapid loss of ne from peripheral sympathetic nervous system pools and are suggestive of an effect of iron deficiency on monoamine uptake mechanisms it is important to recall that serotonin ne and da transporters are all members of the same family of na  cotransporters and show similar characteristics with respect to regulation and translocation  37  the only other neurotransmitter studied relative to brain iron status has been γ aminobutyric acid  38  a direct mechanism of effect of cellular iron status on monoamine metabolism has yet to be demonstrated although recent cell culture experiments from our laboratory support such a concept  39  experiments with pheochromocytoma pc12 cells and neuroblastoma cells demonstrated a dose response relationship between iron chelation and expression of the da and the ne transporter  fig 5a b  these experiments demonstrate for the first time direct evidence for a cellular relationship of iron and monoamine metabolism figure 5view large download slide  a and b dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter levels in pc12 and n2a cells in response to iron chelation for 24 h with desferal at the indicated doses all experiments were repeated three times with at least three wells of cells used for analysis at each treatment dose how is behavior related to brain iron and neurotransmitter biology irondeficient animals and human infants have changes in behavior that are resistant to iron therapy  2 – 5 40  we demonstrated in animal models that behavioral changes are robustly associated with changes to central da and iron concentrations  8 22 29  our most recent analysis of behavior da and regional brain iron however reveals some relevant relationships multivariate regression analysis of spontaneous activity demonstrates that as much as 65 of the variability in exploration of the novel environment is associated with ventral midbrain iron and da d 1 receptor density in midbrain and caudate putamen  41  multivariate analysis of anxietylike behaviors demonstrates that nearly 45 of the variance in latency to move to a “safer” environment can be attributed to variation in nucleus accumbens da transporter and d 2 receptor density  40  preweaning iron deficiency and postweaning iron deficiency in rats results in decreased exploration and decreased movement  41 42  iron repletion results in the normalization of several of these behaviors as well as normalization of most of the alterations in da biology adult iron deficiency and cognitive functioning a limited number of studies have been conducted to determine if iron deficiency during nondevelopmental periods of life are associated with changes in behavior cognition and brain function  31 43  studies in adolescents who were iron deficient but not anemic revealed alterations in cognitive functioning that could be attributed to iron depletion but not anemia  31  when specific tests of attention are performed irondeficient anemic adolescents perform less well than ironsufficient teens and also respond to iron therapy this brief article has highlighted several of the known biologic roles of brain iron on neural metabolism and functioning although much of the work has focused on early development as the “critical period” there is not yet certainty that that period has been exactly defined or limited to infants less than 2 y of age the more recent evidence with adults with rls iron deficiency in renal disease and simple postpartum iron deficiency all suggest that neural functioning and behavioral consequences to brain iron deficits are not limited to infants the author is thankful for long and fruitful collaborations with dr james connor dr byron jones members of the brain and behavior in
