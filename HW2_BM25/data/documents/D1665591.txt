gets 5 stars and then some it is so good but one of the greatest and most successful shows in the history of tv should get better treatment than this particular series of dvds receives it is very cheaply put out there with no particular care to the quality of the entertainment to begin with it is highly frustrating that there is no option for continuous play on any of this series dvds every time you want to watch the next episode you have to sort through several lists to get the option to play the next available episode try going through these steps with latenight insomnia next there is no brief synopsis of episodes as there usually is on such videosas if were supposed to know which episode it is by merely the title so know that if you are looking for particular episodes youd better know the title of it or watch every one to find out which it is lastly as with all of this series there is a huge tendency for skips throughout video simply stops and there are no apparent scratches to it and other dvds play well in my player so i know its the dvd i love this series so much i feel i have to overlook it because the alternative is to not see it at all fortunately amazon is great to work withthey exchanged this item for me twice the skips made it so unwatchable but the third times the charm this one appears to play well but really you would think that mtm or whoever owns the rights to this series would have ensured that such basic issues would have been ironed out before release because it is horribly frustrating to have to maneuver your way through a series of menus

2013once a week in the 1970s i would prepare a tv dinner and sit down to watch the mary tyler moore show i loved it my opinion of this season while well written and acted is that season 4 mary has a much more strident voice and her attitude reflects the angry feminism of that era  her wardrobe by nolan miller is just dreadfulyes i am shallow enough to watch some of these old tv shows for the costume and set designs season 1 had mary in darling outfits by evan picone and where is adorable little bess read more search sort by top rated filter by all reviewers all stars text image video40

2006verified purchase the set up is familiar by now mary richards mary tyler moore works at wjm news in minneapolis despite the efforts of the crew including news writer murray gavin mac leod and producer lou grant ed asner the show is constantly last in the ratings thanks in large part to bumbling anchor ted baxter ted knight on the home front mary lives in a building with her best friends rhoda valerie harper and phyllis cloris leachman rounding out the cast are teds girlfriend georgette georgia engel and wjms answer to martha stewart before she made any kind of name for herself sue ann nivens betty white season 4 of the mary tyler moore show is my favorite of the seven seasons its the last one before rhoda leaves for her own series set in new york and the season that introduces us to sue ann that means this is the only season to feature all eight of the series main characters and it features some of the best laughs of the show while mary has given some bad parties before this is the first season to really play up her ability to give a lousy party it starts right out with the first episode the lars affair when phyllis husband hooks up with sue ann in my opinion the best of these bad parties are on disc two mary must give the dinner party when a congresswoman accepts her invitation to dinner she talks sue ann into cooking only to have too many people show up for the actual event then in happy birthday lou she decides to give a surprise party for her boss only to discover he hates birthdays and surprises another standout episode is the coproducers mary and rhoda are given the green light to work on a sunday afternoon talk show the catch is they must use egotistical ted and sue ann as the cohosts georgettes final line in this one is classic speaking of georgette she gets a chance to shine in almost a nuns story after seeing ted kissing another woman she decides to join a convent the final scene is hilarious and shows she is much smarter then she normally appears better late thats a pun than never is another classic a tired mary writes a flip obituary only to have it read on the air the next night and i cant forget ted baxter meets walter cronkite after finally winning a local award ted thinks that his idol has come to offer him a network job the show takes on some serious topics in this season as well most noticeably lous wife leaves him and files for divorce this is the first real story arc of the series and plays out over several episodes starting with the lou and edie story in disc one some like that one are more somber some play up the comedy such as mary finding lou a date old enough to be his mother in lous first date the writing has really gelled here and all the returning characters are at their best sue ann intended to be a one episode guest star is still developing she isnt quite as snide as she is in later seasons but her basic overbearing personality is in place the actors do a great job as well they know their characters take the great work by the writers and make it shine the result is a show that is hilarious and touching about a group of people we really come to care about this season also features an impressive list of guest stars including brett somers and a before they were famous henry winkler fonzie on happy days and bruce boxleitner of scarecrow and mrs king and babylon 5 this set is just like the season three set unfortunately that means no extras fortunately that means the picture is sharp and the mono sound track is clear while there are still classic episodes of this sitcom to come ive always felt the show looses something once rhoda leaves therefore i treasure this season when any character can walk into an episode at any time its wonderfully funny any fan of the show will love this set comment 13 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse50 out of 5 stars classic comedy by mrliteral on october 21 2006verified purchase back in the late 70s and early 80s an afternoon highlight was catching an hour of great shows that had just recently come into syndication the mary tyler moore show and the bob newhart show i may have been too young to really catch them in their first runs but it was a delight to see them when i did unlike many hit comedies of yesteryear these shows outside of the clothes do not show their age even now they are still brilliantly funny in a way that many shows today can only aspire to the mary tyler moore show dealt with the adventures of mary richards a single thirtyish woman living in minneapolis at home she spent a lot of time with her neighbor and best friend rhoda morgenstern she worked at wjm as associate producer of the news in this office the head writer was murray slaughter the producer was lou grant and the anchorman was ted baxter baxter played by ted knight often steals the show vain dumb and cheap ted nonetheless is endearing especially when his façade cracks but all the characters have their own distinct personalities and they mix together almost perfectly the fourth season really demonstrates how the show has gone well beyond mary who often isnt even the prinicipal character the opening episode illustrates this marys landlady phyllis finds her husband having an affair with sue ann nivens for those only familiar with betty white as the blissful airhead in golden girls and later shows this role shows a completely different side of her mary is more of an observer than an actual participant throughout the season other characters also take the spotlight an ongoing story arc deals with lous separation from his wife edie ted pursues awards and meets his long lost father rhoda dates her boss and lou  phyllis becomes a real estate agent in fact of the 24 episodes in the set just a little more than half have mary as the central character for that matter little occurs on the romantic front for her after one episode with a much younger man she spends most of the rest of the season casually dating the station sportscaster who is only briefly in a few episodes in sum this show is as good now as ever whats really nice is each episode is only twentyfive minutes long so you can squeeze them when you need a quick break from the rest of the world if you want to see how good tv comedy can be this is a show well worth watching comment 8 people found this helpful was this

the show continues to deliver the laughs with more hilarious situations and superb acting i will saythis is the last best season as rhoda departs come season 5 it is amazing to realize that the show was much poorer without her and i think many fans truly missed her and the interactions she had with mary and phyllis comment was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse50 out of 5 stars great

venomous performance as the wronged phyllis chloris leachman was indeed in such demand at this pointher appearances on the show went down to just three episodes per season until she too got a spinoff
