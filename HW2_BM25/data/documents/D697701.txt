history of spanish food the cuisine of many countries is influenced by the additions introduced by other cultures this is especially true with spanish cuisine the influences of other cultures on the cuisine in spain go a long way back and as other influences were incorporated spain developed a cuisine that is uniquely its own spain is situated with water around most of it it connects to france on the northeast and is just a short distance from morocco on the southern tip where the mediterranean meets the atlantic this puts spain in a good position to be influenced by many cultures that sail both seas much of spain is considered to have a mediterranean diet as many of the cultures that influenced spain’s cuisine came from that part of the world each region of spain has added it own variations to what these other cultures have brought vegetables as well as meats are consumed with great pleasure in spain with so much of spain surrounded by water fish and seafood are also very much a part of the cuisine the phoenicians sailed the mediterranean and brought their sauces to spain the greeks gave the spanish cuisine the gift of olives and olive oil though the romans are at times credited with introducing the spanish to these important ingredients other cultures that have contributed to the spanish cuisine are the jews and the carthaginians while they left their mark on the cuisine it is the moors who most strongly influenced spain’s cuisine for over five hundred years the moors ruled spain so it is no wonder that they indelibly left their mark on the cuisine the moors brought many of the fruits that are eaten in spain today mixing fruits nuts fish and meats with light seasonings was one appetizing introduction rice was brought by the moors and is a staple of the spanish diet this accounts for the abundance of rice dishes in spain especially paella the moors also brought nutmeg saffron and cinnamon to spain a cold soup that is catching on around the world that is typically spanish is gazpacho and we can thank the moors for that too if not for the moors spanish cuisine would not be the gastronomical pleasure it is today at one point in the moorish rule christian jews and moors lived fairly harmoniously and this helped to blend many of the individual culture’s contributions to the cuisine pork is eaten a lot in spain and is a contribution by christians as neither jews nor moors would eat it however pork dishes did have seasonings added and methods of preparation used that were influenced by the jewish and moorish cultures there are many things in the spanish diet that came from a rather great distance and were enthusiastically adopted and incorporated into the cuisine before the rest of europe after columbus sailed to the new world in 1492 other spanish explorers soon followed and brought back many delightful additions to the spanish diet among them were tomatoes chocolate vanilla various types of beans and potatoes all of which are now considered basic to the spanish cuisine though we think of potatoes as an irish staple they became a staple in the spanish diet before they were even introduced to ireland so as you can imagine spanish cuisine is influenced by many cultures the spanish food history of this wonderful cuisine was popular many years ago and is becoming increasingly popular today return to home page need helpful cooking tips join my monthly newsletter for new recipes informative cooking tips and how to information on international cuisines create flavorful easy meals using a variety of different ingredients learn new ways of using spices in dishes experiment with global flavorsas a thank you for signing up you will receive a free ecookbook with 170 creative salsa recipes that you can make easily at home these are not your normal recipes for homemade salsa but contain an eclectic mix that you will want to try recipes included are black eyed pea salsa jamaican salsa adobo herb salsa watermelon salsa carrot mango salsa and even some sweet salsas such as tropical fruit  black bean salsa also included with this cookbook are recipes on how to cook with salsa in your everyday cooking sign up below to get your free copyenter your email address enter your first name optionalthen dont worry — your email address is totally secure i promise to use it only to send you monthly newsletter share this page facebook twitter google pinterest tumblr reddit
