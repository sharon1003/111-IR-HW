management type posts here  the next posts in the series will break down metrics and issues to consider in sqm by industry and conclude with a case study on the application of sqm we hope these posts keep you on top of your game and informed first what is supplier quality management sqm supplier quality management sqm is confidence in a supplier’s ability to deliver a good or service that will satisfy the customer’s needs achievable through interactive relationship between the customer and the supplier it aims at ensuring the product’s ‘fit’ to the customer’s requirements with little or no adjustment or inspection the us quality guru joseph moses juran born 1904 in romania  divides the supplier quality assurance process into nine stepsdefinition of the product’s quality

requirementscertification of qualified suppliersconduction of quality improvement planscreation and use of supplier ratings5 key metrics to use for scoring supplier quality management from lns researchcost of quality the definition of this metric is similar to the way it sounds it measures the cost incurred by an organization to manufacture a quality product further narrowing things down these costs come from two main categories cost of good quality and cost of poor quality the cost of quality definition and enterprise quality management software—part 2 cost of quality both offer detailed descriptions of these metrics and insights on how to measure them overall equipment effectiveness oee quality affects many different parts of the business so it is critical to establish a comprehensive metric that provides visibility into the most important areas of operations the answer to this lies with calculating the oee formula oee  availability × efficiency × quality first oee measures how often an asset is available when it should be producing product for a customer second when an asset is producing product for a customer oee measures how close the asset is producing to its theoretical maximum and third for those products that are produced oee measures the percentage that are produced within quality specifications percentage of products in compliance this is a critical metric in regulated industries such as medical devices pharmaceutical biotechnology and food and beverages even in industries such as automotive aerospace and defense this metric plays a crucial role it measures the percentage of products that are in compliance with government regulations and internal guidelines it is often challenging for companies to keep employees up to date with the changing compliance landscape additionally compliance to the european union’s registration evaluation authorization and restrictions of chemicals reach directive or the restriction on hazardous substances rohs or the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive impact companies differently based on the industry which adds to the complexity of selling in a global market this metric measures how effective your organization is in being compliant with local national or global policies that affect your business ontime and complete shipments managing the quality of the product should not be at the expense of delaying final delivery from the plant floor even though ontime and complete shipments as a metric sounds fairly easy to understand there are many different ways companies measure this metric lns research defines this metric as percentage of products delivered on time and complete with no errors or repromise dates new products introduction npi npi as a metric is defined as a percentage of new products introduced in the market that hit time volume and quality targets new products are often introduced in the market and are a source of competitive advantage in industries such as automotive and consumer electronics profit growth depends not only on how successful your organization is at introducing new products into the market but also how effective your organization is at hitting npi targets these five key metrics provide an executive with critical insight into operational and financial performance of your supplier supplier quality management evaluation process1 risk criteria evaluation supplier quality management risk assessment to get a full picture of your company’s supplier risk portfolio individualized risk assessments should be made on the performance of each supplier this can be done in various ways traditionally quality managers have sent representatives for onsite audits to view actual production lines this of course has become costly with globalization unless multiple suppliers have been strategically chosen within close proximity another method is to build into the quality agreement the delivery of data reports and audits upon request or at specified times throughout the life of the contract as supplier quality management is an integral component to the total cost of quality enterprise quality management software eqms companies have begun incorporating it into available software a quality manager should integrate his or her eqms with that of the suppliers and if possible with the supplier’s suppliers often through a shared webportal this is an ideal method of obtaining a realtime performance assessment and greater visibility however the integration may seem overbearing for smaller companies that would rather remain independent from larger entities supplier quality management risk quantification a supplier’s risk can be quantified as a function of two variables likelihood and impact of adverse events occurring and ultimately assigned a level of risk for comparison and later prioritization the first variable relates to the aforementioned performance of the supplier by analyzing performance indicators in a way that creates standardized metrics—average response time for corrective actions mrb inventory levels delivery times customer complaints etc—suppliers can be rated based on their overall performance relative to others supplier quality management greatly facilitates this as information is recorded and available within the software allowing companies to make an assessment on the likelihood a supplier will have a particular failure in a standardized way the second risk variable impact greatly depends on the supplier’s criticality to production and the final product for example if a there is no substitute for a material used then that supplier should automatically be considered riskier despite its levels of performance if production cannot continue without this supplier it should hold considerable weight in a risk portfolio conversely the less critical a supplier is to continuity the less risk it should be assigned supplier quality management risk prioritization since organizations heavily rely on supply chains for production supplier quality management should be of great consideration in defining strategic vision by quantifying supplier risk accounting for both performance and criticality we can effectively prioritize issues that require the most attention it is advisable to treat these external risks similar to internal inefficiencies or gaps employing closedloop capa or deviation management techniques as you would inhouse will mitigate supplier risk while also avoiding the same issues from arising in the future2 audit strategy prioritize your list of suppliers based upon risk including how long it has been since their last auditpick the top five highest risk suppliers and schedule those audits throughout the year and hire another sqe for every fifteen suppliers five supplier auditsyearsqe x three yearscycle  15 supplier auditssqecycle that require onsite auditing the number “5” is arbitrary but “5” is in the right order of magnitude3 review of frequency suppliers are audited there is no specific requirement for the manufacturer to audit just to have control if you do audit there is no requirement to do it x number of times a year however is there is a new persistent problem and the supplier hasn’t corrected it a visit may be necessary even though not planned major suppliers top five should be visited once a year by you or a subcontracted auditing firm of your choice sometimes unplanned audits are better as the supplier cannot over prepare for your visit and you can audit a “normal production day” at the supplier4 review of audit priorities a key audit priority is auditing top management to insure that quality is a top management focus and they know and understand the qualityauditing process no matter the industry type what is the quality table of organization what are their goals and objectives who manages quality ongoing training and education what does the quality budget look like is there a supplier quality manual in place is it constantly updated the audit priority is a balanced scorecard of measurements focused on cost quality and timeliness concluding thoughts on evaluation of suppliers thru supplier quality management programs in today’s world of globalized supply and demand networks companies need to efficiently optimize the supply base given a broad set of requirements that go well beyond cost to effectively do this companies should begin to use a risk based approach that looks at both the criticality of a supplier and the likelihood of failure of a supplier by applying standardized risk and audit tools through an enterprise system the long term successes of initiatives around supplier quality are much more likely to succeed0 linked in twitter 0 google facebook 22 email42 print
