create and query an azure sql data warehouse using the azure portal if you dont have an azure subscription create a free account before you begin before you begin download and install the newest version of sql server management studio ssms sign in to the azure portal sign in to the azure portal create a data warehouse an azure sql data warehouse is created with a defined set of compute resources the database is created within an azure resource group and in an azure sql logical server follow these steps to create a sql data warehouse that contains the adventure works dw sample data click create a resource in the upper lefthand corner of the azure portal select databases from the new page and select sql data warehouse under featured on the new page fill out the sql data warehouse form with the following information setting suggested value description database namemy sample data warehouse for valid database names see database identifiers note a data warehouse is a type of database subscription your subscription for details about your subscriptions see subscriptions resource groupmy resource group for valid resource group names see naming rules and restrictions select source sample specifies to load a sample database note a data warehouse is one type of database select sample adventure works dw specifies to load the adventure works dw sample database click server

information about regions see azure regions click select click performance tier to specify the performance configuration for the data warehouse for this tutorial select the optimized for elasticity performance tier the slider by default is set to dw400 try moving it up and down to see how it works click apply now that you have completed the sql database form click create to provision the database provisioning takes a few minutes on the toolbar click notifications to monitor the deployment process create a serverlevel firewall rule the sql data warehouse service creates a firewall at the serverlevel that prevents external applications and tools from connecting to the server or any databases on the server to enable connectivity you can add firewall rules that enable connectivity for specific ip addresses follow these steps to create a serverlevel firewall rule for your clients ip address note sql data warehouse communicates over port 1433 if you are trying to connect from within a corporate network outbound traffic over port 1433 might not be allowed by your networks firewall if so you cannot connect to your azure sql database server unless your it department opens port 1433 after the deployment completes click sql databases from the lefthand menu and then click my sample database on the sql databases page the overview page for your database opens showing you the fully qualified server name such as mynewserver20171113databasewindowsnet and provides options for further configuration copy this fully qualified server name for use to connect to your server and its databases in subsequent quick starts to open server settings click the server name to open server settingsclick the server name click show firewall settings the firewall settings page for the sql database server opens to add your current ip address to a new firewall rule click add client ip on the toolbar a firewall rule can open port 1433 for a single ip address or a range of ip addresses click save a serverlevel firewall rule is created for your current ip address opening port 1433 on the logical server click ok and then close the firewall settings page you can now connect to the sql server and its data warehouses using this ip address the connection works from sql server management studio or another tool of your choice when you connect use the server admin account you created previously important by default access through the sql database firewall is enabled for all azure services click off on this page and then click save to disable the firewall for all azure services get the fully qualified server name get the fully qualified server name for your sql server in the azure portal later you use the fully qualified name when connecting to the server sign in to the azure portal select sql databases from the lefthand menu and click your database on the sql databases page in the essentials pane in the azure portal page for your database locate and then copy the server name in this example the fully qualified name is mynewserver20171113databasewindowsnet connect to the server as server admin this section uses sql server management studio ssms to establish a connection to your azure sql server open sql server management studio in the connect to server dialog box enter the following information setting suggested value description server type database engine this value is required server name the fully qualified server name heres an example mynewserver20171113databasewindowsnet authentication sql server authentication sql authentication is the only authentication type that is configured in this tutorial login the server admin account this is the account that you specified when you created the server password the password for your server admin account this is the password that you specified when you created the server click connect the object explorer window opens in ssms in object explorer expand databases then expand my sample database to view the objects in your new database run some queries sql data warehouse uses tsql as the query language to open a query window and run some tsql queries use the following steps rightclick my sample data warehouse and select new query a new query window opens in the query window enter the following command to see a list of databases select  from sysdatabases click execute the query results show two databases master and my sample data warehouse to look at some data use the following command to see the number of customers with last name of adams that have three children at home the results list six customers select last name first name from dbodim customer where last name  adams and number children at home  3clean up resources you are being charged for data warehouse units and data stored your data warehouse these compute and storage resources are billed separately if you want to keep the data in storage you can pause compute when you arent using the data warehouse by pausing compute you are only charged for data storage you can resume compute whenever you are ready to work with the data if you want to remove future charges you can delete the data warehouse follow these steps to clean up resources as you desire sign in to the azure portal click on your data warehouse to pause compute click the pause button when the data warehouse is paused you see a start button to resume compute click start to remove the data warehouse so you are not charged for compute or storage click delete to remove the sql server you created click mynewserver20171113databasewindowsnet in the previous image and then click delete be careful with this deletion since deleting the server also deletes all databases assigned to the server to remove the resource group click my resource group and then click delete resource group next steps you have now created a data warehouse created a firewall rule connected to your data warehouse and run a few queries to learn more about azure sql data
