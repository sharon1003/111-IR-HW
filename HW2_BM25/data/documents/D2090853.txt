sherman’s march sherman’s march to the sea was a campaign during the american civil war it was a march from atlanta ga to savannah ga the campaign was a month long that took place from november 1864 to december 1864 it is called sherman’s march to the sea because the officer in command was major general william tecumseh sherman the campaign is most famous for the destruction that was left in the wake of sherman’s army this campaign is one of the first total war campaigns that was conducted by the union the destruction of georgia was not completely done by the advancing union army but sherman is the commander that gets credit for destroying georgia william tecumseh sherman was a wellknown general in the union army during the american civil war had decided to march to sea after his success of capturing atlanta georgia on september 1 1864 sherman understood that despite the north’s victories in atlanta georgia the southern citizens would never give up their effort to the war and would continue to be loyal to the confederate government sherman decided to march to the sea for two reasons he wanted to move the base there and secondly more important to destroy the moral of the southerners he said the north was “not only fighting hostile armies but a hostile people and must make old and young rich and poor feel the hard hand of war”sherman understood that by destroying the southern citizens’ moral he would directly cut off the confederate’s military’s supply because most of them if not all came from the citizens that was the only way to speed up the victory for the north without enduring the casualties from battles to battles the war was then not only northern military versus southern military but also southern citizens as well a total war with that in mind sherman proposed his plan to general ulysses s grant and president abraham lincoln leaving sixty thousand men behind in northern georgia and tennessee to fight with the confederate army sherman took sixtytwo thousand men directly under his command to march from atlanta georgia to the coast city of savannah georgia lincoln was opposed to his plan at first but later approved of the plan the march started in atlanta ga on november 15 1864 and ended in savannah ga on december 21 1864 it is known as the most destructive act amongst the civilian population of the civil war sherman won most of the battles that were a part of the campaign and was able to accomplish his plan with a total of about two thousand and one hundred union casualties the confederate forces had about one thousand casualties before the march to the sea campaign took place sherman had used atlanta as his headquarters to plan the march the order that sherman give to start the march is known as special field orders no 120 this order had nine points that divided the army tells how the army will move and tells the commanders that it was alright to burn buildings in areas that resistance was present this order made it so it was up to sherman’s commanders to decide what they wanted to destroy during the campaign this is significant because it shows that sherman did not want to completely destroy the area between atlanta and savannah the retreating confederate forces burned most of the crops so that the union army could not use seize them for resupply the union army was divided into two wings commanded by major genera oliver o howard and major general henry w slocum each wing of the army had two corps assigned to it howard commanded the right wing and slocum commanded the left wing one thing that the union army did do was rip up the train tracks the tracks were then heated and wrapped around trees this was done so that the confederates could not use the rail lines to resupply or move soldiers to reinforce savannah the rails wrapped around trees became known as sherman neckties during the march to the sea there were five major battles that took place almost all of the battles were victories by the union forces the battles were griswoldville buck head creek honey hill waynesborough and the second battle of fort mc allister out of these five battles four of them were union victories the only battle that was a confederate victory was the battle of honey hill the battle of honey hill happened because the union forces wanted to cut the railroad near pocotaligo the battle took place on november 30 1864 the union commander that was in command during this battle was major general john p hatch hatch tried to breach the entrenchments of the confederate forces but he failed to do so hatch also failed to cut the railroad line the griswoldville battle was the first and major infantry engagement during the sherman’s march to the sea as sherman began to move his columns of troops closer to central georgia his right wing of the xv and xvii corps marched southeast for irwinton and gordon brigadier general charles c walcutt’s second brigade of woods’ division of the xv corps was ordered to guard this movement he moved southward toward macon along with two guns from lieutenant albert f r arndt’s michigan battery on november 21 1864 union general judson kilpatrick had attacked macon but later on retreated with his troops after the battle of walnut creek the union army started to build up more of a skirmish line at griswoldville until the morning of november 22 nd on the confederate side general joseph wheeler had correctly predicted the movement of federal troops to the east he started to search for the head of the union column at the same time confederate general william j hardee was acquainted with the fact that a large federal army had moved to the east toward augusta he ordered brigadier general pleasant j philips with a large force of georgia militia state line troops and two battalions of emergency soldiers from the factories at athens and augusta to move from macon to augusta as general philips approached griswoldville he was warned of a union force of around one thousand men that was waiting ahead he formed a skirmish line to be ready for a fight his force encountered walcutt’s brigade which had arrived before him and taken a position on the ridge both sides were not aware of the other’s appearance brigadier general pleasant j philips ordered his troops to march forward without knowing that walcutt’s skirmish lines were waiting ahead as the union troops started to fire they fell back to their main line on the ridge to take their advantage on the height at the same time union commander brig gen charles r woods was ordered to fall back to a farm known as the duncan farm here with the support of artillery an open field to his front and protection by the swamp he started to fire at the confederate army this became the biggest disadvantage for the confederate army because they had to charge up on the ridge without any cover it was known that the confederate soldiers were men ranging in age from teenagers to men in their sixties who were fighting to protect their families from sherman’s march they fought bravely for their home land there were only thirteen killed and eighty six wounded on the union side but fifty killed and five hundred wounded on the confederate side the battle ended with the victory for the union but general walcutt was wounded and later on was replaced by col robert f catterson of the 97th regiment indiana infantry fort mc allister played an important role in the civil war the fort had seen conflict as early as 1862 the first battle of fort mc allister did not take place during the march to the sea campaign  to understand why the taking of fort mc allister was important during the campaign some background information is needed fort mc allister was a confederate fortification located near the tip of the ogeechee river in bryan country it played an important role in the defense of savannah from naval attacks during the civil war it was built under the direction of captain john mc crady however it was named after captain joseph mc allister because he owned the plantation that the fort was built upon the first real battle of fort mc allister took place on march 3rd 1863 admiral samuel dupont ordered three additional ironclads the passsaic the nahant and the patapsco to join the montauk his goal was to test the guns and mechanical devices the attack started at 840 am and lasted about eight hours leaving damages to the walls of the fort fire from the ironclads was extremely catastrophic but fort mc allister did not fall proving that the ironclads needed more power due to its ten largecaliber gun and cannon balls fort mc allister repelled seven union naval attacks on july 1 1862 it came under attack for the first time the gunboat potomska sailed into the ogeechee and opened fire against the fort under the direction of lieutenant pendleton g watmough however outgunned by the fort the potomska moved back down the river on july 29th 1862 the second attack by the union against fort mc allister occurred this time the paul jones a heavily armored sidewheeler with 100pounder rifled cannon was led by commander charles steedman unfortunately after an hour and a half of firing the paul jones retreated further down the river another attack occurred on november 2nd 1862 during a scouting mission led by captain augustus bonard he approached the wissahickon and the seneca two gunboats near the mouth of the ogeechee with his emmett rifles the wissahickon was attacked and the gunboat withdrew however the wissahickon sustained serious damages after it was attacked again on november 19th 1862 by captain george anderson the second and final battle of fort mc allister took place on december 13th 1864 general william tecumseh sherman began his plan on attacking fort mc allister on december 10th when he discovered that it could provide him supplies from savannah he ordered hazen’s 4000man division to attack the fort with only 230 veteran troops to defend the fort confederate major george anderson was defeated within 15 minutes general sherman took over the fort and celebrated with a victory the taking of the fort would allow for union ships to control the river this battle took place towards the end of the march to the sea campaign when savannah was captured sherman was not in the state he was on his way back from planning his invasion into the carolinas the southern civilians surrendered the city without much of a fight they did not want the city to be destroyed in a siege like atlanta was since savannah was captured just before christmas sherman sent a telegraph to president lincoln in the telegraph sherman declared the capture of savannah as a christmas present for lincoln sherman also sent about 2500 bales of cotton that were captured after savannah surrendered sherman’s march to the sea is important when studying the civil war because of the impact it had on the south it served its purpose to demoralize the confederates the campaign also gave the union more of a foot hold in the south if this campaign did not happen then the war could have dragged on for longer than what it did after the war sherman ended up succeeding grant as general of the army this rank was the highest position that was in the army only one person at a time could hold this rank shermans march to the sea your browser does not
