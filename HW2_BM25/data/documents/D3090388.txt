dr amir khan sports medicine6 doctors agree in brief depends ligaments that have blood supply have the capacity to heal such as medial collateral ligament mcl and posterior cruciate ligament pcl time to heal is dependent on the severity of the injury and can range from a few weeks to several weeks lateral collateral ligament lcl is a poor healer whereas the acl will likely not heal and require surgery discuss your injury with your orthopedist thank1 comment dr jeffrey sider obviously it is important to evaluate the severity of the ligament injury whether grade 1 which might be 12 weeks versus a grade 3 which might require a surgical repair an exam and mri are use in this evaluation
