bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue leading to increased bone fragility· major cause of fractures in elderly and postmenopausal women· 8 times more common in women than men· cannot be detected by xray until more than 2540 of calcium in the bone is lost· cause of primary oa is unknown· secondary oa has a precipitating event· joint cartilage becomes yellow and opaque with rough surfaces and areas of malacia· fragments of cartilage may come loose· inflammation of the synovial membrane secondary to the cartilage breakdown clinical manifestations· weight bearing joints are the most affected· joint stiffness occurs after periods of rest· crepitation may be present· usually affected asymmetrically· heberdens nodes· commonly affects hips knees and vertebral column nursing diagnoses· pain· sleep pattern disturbance· impaired physical mobility· selfcare deficit· selfesteem disturbance· altered nutrition more than body requirements fractures· disruption or break in continuity of the structure of a bone· occurs from trauma mva fall etc or pathologic· classified by types communication with the environment and location· can also be stable or unstable types of fractures· complete fractures· incomplete fracture· comminuted fracture· closed fracture· open fracture clinical manifestations· edema and swelling· pain and tenderness· muscle spasm· deformity· ecchymosis· loss of function· crepitation complicationsinfection compartment syndrome fat embolism shock avascular necrosis delayed union and nonunion reactions to internal fixation devices fat emboli· fat embolism after fracture of long bones or pelvis multiple fractures or crush injuries fat emboli may develop especially in young adults men typically 2030 years old clinical manifestations· hypoxia· tachypnea· systemic emboliztion petechiae are noted in the buccal membrane and conjunctival sac on the hard plate or fundus of the eye· over the chest and anterior axialllry folds prevention · quick immobilization of fracture· minimal fracture manipulation· adequate support for fractured bones during turning and positioning shockdelayed union and nonunion · delayed union occurs when healing does not advance at a normal rate for the location and type of fracture· nonunion failure of the ends of a fractured bone to unite please read medical management on p 1839avascular necrosis of bone· occurs when the bone loses its blood supply and dies read· p 1839· reaction to internal fixation device· reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome· heterotrophic ossification emergency management of fractures· immobilize the minute you believe there is a fracture· splint· if an open fracture cover the wound with a clean sterile dressing to prevent contamination of deeper tissue medical

lateral arm· balanced suspension hip fx  replacement· usually women  men· approximately 75 of falls occur indoors· 14 – 36 death rate within one year· 25 cant walk independently· 60 do not gain prefx ambulation intracapsular fracture· intracapsular fracture occurs within the capsule· their name is taken from the specific location subcapital transcervical or basilar neck· these fractures are often associated with osteoporosis and minor trauma extracapsular fracture· occurs below the capsule and are termed intertrochanteric if they occur in a region between the greater and lesser trochanter· usually occurs from sever direct trauma or a fall clinical manifestations· external rotation· muscle spasms· shortening of the affected ext· severe pain· tenderness to the region of the fracture site· displaced femoral neck fractures cause serious disruption of the blood supply to the femoral head which can result in avascular necrosis care· surgery repair is the preferred method of managing intracapsular and extracapsular· treatment with traction requires 1216 weeks of immobilization for healing to occur even if the blood supply to the region is intact· initially the affected area is placed in either a buck’s or russell until surgery· traction can relieve muscle spasms intracapsular· are usually repaired with the replacing the head of the femur· slow to heal because of the disruption in the blood supply extracapsular· is usually pinned nursing management· patients surgery may be delayed if the patient has dm cardiovascular issues the surgeon might wait till the patient is stabilized· analgesics or muscle relaxants control muscle spasms· teach patient to use trapeze and show them the exercise prior to surgery· practice getting in and our of bed post surgery· vitals· i o· pain med· check dressing for signs of bleeding and infection· access the toes for neurovascualr assessment· ambulaton usually begins on the first day by pt either a walker or crutches are used what not to do after hip surgery· do not force hip into greater than 90 degrees of flexion· do not force into adduction· do not force hop into internal rotation· do not cross legs· do not put on shoes or stockings until 8 weeks after surgery without adaptive device· do not sit on chairs without arms to aid rising to a standing position what you should do after hip surgery· use toilet elevator on toilet seats· place chair inside shower or tub and remain seated while you wash· use pillow between legs for 8 weeks when lying on the good side or when supine· keep hip in neutral  straight position when sitting walking or lying· notify surgeon of severe pain deformity or loss of function· inform dentist of presence of prosthesis before dental work so that antibiotics can be given nursing diagnoses· impaired physical mobility related to surgical procedure· pain related to edema from surgery site· high risk for infection related to surgical procedure· impaired skin integrity related to immobility and to surgical procedure critical thinking· you have a 68 yo female patient that presents to your floor from the er with a right hip fx she has a foley in place ordered is bucks traction with 5 lbs weight she is scheduled to have surgery tomorrow· your pt comes back after surgery what will you do to care for her over the next few days amputations· in upper extremities usually from trauma· in lower extremities usually from vascular problems except in younger patients· in patients with dm wound care and eye exams should be a priority due to potential complications of this disease· goal is to preserve extremity length and function while removing all infected etc tissue types· symes· below the knee bka· above the knee aka· hip disarticulation· guillotine open· rays· above the elbow aeanursing management· inspect the amputation for signs of irritation especially redness and abrasion· discontinue use of the prosthesis if an irritation develops· wash residual limb thoroughly each night with warm water and bacteriostatic soap dry gently· do not use any substance such as lotions alcohol powders or oil unless prescribed by doc· change residual limb sock daily post op· use pain med· perform rom to all joints daily· do not elevate residual limb on pillows· lay prone with hp extension for 30 minutes three to hour times a day phantom pain· warn the patient that they might feel this· that they might feel that the limb is still there· itching tingling aching· coldness shooting burning or crushing pain· this pain is real nursing diagnoses· body image disturbance related to loss of body part· impaired skin integrity related to surgical procedure· pain related to phantom limb sensation· impaired physical mobility related to loss of body part postop

stasis interventions· relieve pain· maintain adequate neurovascular· maintain health· improve physical mobility· maintain selfesteem· monitor complications diagnosis· pain related to the surgical procedure swelling and immobilization· risk for peripheral neurovascular dysfunction related to swelling constrictive devices or impaired circulation osteomyelitis· an infection of bone by direct or indirect invasion by an organism· most commonly affected is the vertebrae in an adult· direct entry is contamination from open fracture or surgery· indirect is a bloodborne infection from a distant site· most common infecting organism is staphylococcus aureus· are seeing occurrence of mrsa now· acute osteomyelitis refers to the initial infection or an infection of less than 1 month in duration· chronic osteomyelitis refers to a bone infection that persists for longer than 4 weeks or an infection that has failed to respond to initial tx clinical manifestations· fever· night sweats· chills· restlessness· nausea· malaise· severe bone pain· swelling· tenderness· warmth at site· restricted movement· drainage from sinus tracts to the skin and fracture site· chronic pus accumulation and scar tissue formation diagnostics· wound culture determines the causative organism· a bone or tissue biopsy is the definitive way to determine the causative agent· elevated wbc leukocytes and sed rate· on xray will take at least 10 days to show if not weeks· can also do a ct or mri or gallium scan collaborative care· vigorous antibiotic therapy· surgical debridement and decompression· immobilization of affected part· surgical removal of dead bone· constant irrigation· long hospital stay due to need for iv antibiotics diagnoses· pain· hyperthermia· impaired physical mobility· ineffective management of therapuetic regimen· high risk for infection· knowledge deficit· selfcare deficit· body image disturbance· impaired skin integrity osteoarthritis· also known as degenerative joint disease djd· is a slowly progressive disorder of articulating joints and is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage· damage is confined to the joints and surrounding tissues· cause of primary oa is unknown· secondary oa has a precipitating event· joint cartilage becomes yellow and opaque with rough surfaces and areas of malacia· fragments of cartilage may come loose· inflammation of the synovial membrane secondary to the cartilage breakdown clinical manifestations· weight bearing joints are the most affected· joint stiffness occurs after periods of rest· crepitation may be present· usually affected asymmetrically· heberdens nodes· commonly affects hips knees and vertebral column nursing diagnoses· pain· sleep pattern disturbance· impaired physical mobility· selfcare deficit· selfesteem
