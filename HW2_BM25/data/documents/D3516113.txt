how much money can i make growing wine grapes is a businessâ€”a good business despite the uncertainties of the marketplace unpredictability of the weather and the vagaries of farming growing wine grapes can produce a good income year after year if the vineyard is well run and well marketed fortunately once the vineyard is in the ground the costs to operate the vineyard from year to year are pretty predictable it costs 5000 and up per acre to farm every year this includes all farming costs other costs such as insurance and interest expense have to be considered separately for some reason that i have never understood the cost of harvesting is considered separately as well at about 150 per acre grapes are sold by the ton and prices vary from area to area and from variety to variety in 2000 in sonoma county the average price for a ton of grapes was just under 2000 however russian river pinot was going for 3500 a ton while some chardonnay was going for 1200 a ton you have to look carefully at the variety and the appellation to determine actual price per ton you can expect tons per acre varies considerably from variety to variety and from high quality grapes to low quality grapes you can get as many as 10 tons to the acre or more for some varieties at lower qualities but in general you should consider about 4 tons to the acre or less for high quality grapes of most varieties average yields for pinot noir will be a little lower and most white grape varieties a little higher so for a typical sonoma county red wine grape variety if you figure 2200 a ton and 5 tons to the acre you should get about 11000 an acre in revenue take away our average of 5000 in costs  150 per acre for harvest and you get 5850 per acre in net income related posts coveted location near annadel open space20150206 221635marie vintage creekside lodge cabin20150130 220407marie scenic forestville retreat20141219 154357marie historic estate at 2000 crane canyon rd santa rosa20170326 214238marie city of santa rosa closely monitors postfire benzene contamination20180315 182017marie heart of bennett valley 6439 bennett valley rd santa rosa20180221 064915toniamccallumgmailcom coldwell banker 2016 housing market outlook experts forecast gradual increase in sales as prices moderate20160309 215412marie healdsburg vineyard dreamscape20160222 204558marie beautifully remodeled movein ready20150920 213434marie winegrape growers in sonoma county voluntarily commit to conserve water by 25 in four watersheds20150826 065434pressrelease hall ranch geyserville vineyard estate property20150717 223608marie rincon valley hill views20150513 215322marie santa rosa craftsman20150422 222911marie dry creek old vine zinfandel vineyard and home20150327 171835marie santa rosa country retreat on acreage20150219 194132marie coveted location near annadel open space20150206 221635marie vintage creekside lodge cabin20150130 220407marie scenic forestville retreat20141219 154357marie historic estate at 2000 crane canyon rd santa rosa20170326 214238marie city of santa rosa closely monitors postfire benzene contamination20180315 182017marie heart of bennett valley 6439 bennett valley rd santa rosa20180221 064915toniamccallumgmailcom coldwell banker 2016 housing market outlook experts forecast gradual increase in sales as prices moderate20160309 215412marie
