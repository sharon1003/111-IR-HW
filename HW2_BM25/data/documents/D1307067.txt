double helix in which two strands are wound around each otherwhat are the four kinds of bases found in dna  adenine thymine guanine and cytosin explain how dna is replicated  the dna molecules seperate into two strands and then procuces two new complementary strands following the rules of base pairing each strand of double helix of dna serves as a template or model for the new strandswhere and in what form is eukaryotic dna found  in cell nucleus as chromosome how are histones related to nucleosomes nucleosomes are composed of dna wound around dnalist the three main types of rna messanger rna transfer rna and ribosome rnawhat happens durning transcription rna polymerase binds to dna seperates the strands and then uses one strand as a template to assemble rnawhat happens durning translation the cell uses information from messenger rna to produce proteinsdescribe the difference between rna and dna the sugar in rna is ribosoe instead of deoxuribose rna is generally single stranded rna contains uracil in place pf thyminewhat conclusion did griffith and avery drew from the experiments because the ability to cause disease was inherited by the offspring of the transformed bacteria griffith concluded that the transforming factors had to be genewhat conclusion did hershey and chase draw from their experiments nearly all the radioactivity in the bacteria was from phosphorus the marker found in dna hershey and chase concluded that the genetic materials of the bacteriophage was indeed dna not proteinlist the chemical components of dna dna is a nuceic acid made up of nucleotides joined into long strands or chains by covalent bondshow is dna replication differ in prokayotic cells and eukaryotic cells  replication is most prokaryotic cells starts from a single point and proceeds in two directions until the entire chromosomes is copied in eukaryotic cells replication may begin at dozens or even hundreds of places on the dna molecule proceeding in both directions until each chromosome id completely cpoieddescribe the components and structure of a dna nucleotide deoxyribose sugar phosphate group nutrogenous basethe most damaging effects of ultraviolet light on dna replication occur at which wavelenghth 260nmdescribe the function of each of the three types of rna m rna carries unstroctions for protein synthesis form dna to the ribosome t rna carries ameno acid to reboome r rna makes up the rebesome where proteins are made if the code on a dna molecule for a specific amino acid is cta what would the messenger rna codon be the transfer rna codon m rnagau t rnacuahow does the possible impact of a chromosomal mutation that occurs during meiosis differ from that of a similar event that occurs during mitosis of a body cell that is not involved in reproduction chromosomal mutation durning meiosis well be carred by some of the organisms gameted possiblity to the offspring a body cell mutation will be passed on on to that cells daughter cells but not to offspring a mutation in the dna of an organism changes in a base sequence in a protein coding region from cac to cat what is the effect of the mutation on the final protein explain your answer the mutation changes m rna codon from gug to gua both code for ualine so protein not affected describe the two main types of mutation point mutation gene mutation that involve changes in one or a few nucleotides frameshift mutation mutation that shifts the readingreading frame of the genetic message by inserting or deleting a nucleotide list three effects mutation can have on genes the effects of mutations on genes vary widely some have little or no effects and some produce beneficial variations some negatively disrupt gene functionwhat is the significance of mutation to living things plants and animal breeder often make use of goos mutation for example whe na complete set of chromosomes fails to separate durning meiosis the gametes that result may produce triploids 3n or tetraploid 4n organismswhat are mutations mutations are heritable changes in genetic informationhow does a cell interpret the genetic code the genetic code is read three letters at a time so that each word is three bases long and coresponds to a single amino acidwhat are codons and anticodons codon a threeletter word in m rna anticodon group of three bases of t rna molecule that are complementary to the three bases of a codon of m rnawhy is the genetic code considered universal one of the most interesting discoveries of molecular biology is the nearuniversal nature of the genetic code alothough some organisms show slight variations in the amino acid assigned to particular codons the code is always reaf three bases at a time and in the same directionhow are genes regulated in eukaryotic cells by binding dna sequences in the regulatory regions of eukaryotic genes transciption factors control the expression of those geneswhat are genes factors that are passed from one generation to the next which determine traitswhat is a genotype a persons genetic makeupwhat is a phenotype a persons physical characteristicswhat is fertilization occurs durning sexual reproduction when male and female reproductive cells join what are homozygous organisms with 2 indentical allels for a particular trait dd ddwhat are heterozygous organisms with 2 different alleles from a particular trait ddwhat are alleles differnet forms of a gene what is meiosis a process of reduction division in which the number of chromosomes per cell is cut in half and the homologous chromosomes that exist in a diploid cell are seperatedwhat is a diploid cell contains 2 complete sets of chromosomes and 2 complete sets of geneswhat is a haploid cell contains 1 set of chromosomeswhat does incomplete dominance mean the heterozygous phenotype is somewhere in between the 2 homozygous phenetype rallele for red flowers w allele for white flowerswhat is codominance both alleles contribute to the phenotype advertisement upgrade to remove ads features quizlet live quizlet learn diagrams flashcards mobile help sign up help center honor code community guidelines students
