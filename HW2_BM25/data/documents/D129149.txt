method2 microwaving eggs without the shell1 use this method for safe even cooking breaking the egg apart also breaks the first step in hardboiling but if youre using a microwave this is highly recommended cooking the egg yolk and white separately ensures that each part is cooked just as hard as you want it and removes the risk of a scalding explosion this method of microwaving eggs is sometimes called hardcooking since it doesnt involve any water but results in an egg with a hardboiled textureto hardboil eggs in a microwave2 lightly grease two bowls rub the inside of two small microwavesafe bowls with butter or butter substitute using a paper towel custard ramekins work well if you are only cooking one egg but you can use any size containerto hardboil eggs in a microwave3 separate the egg whites and egg yolks crack the egg open carefully then separate the two halves of shell with the egg still inside one of them pour the egg yolk from one half of the shell to the other repeatedly until all of the egg white has separated from the yolk put the yolk into one bowl and the egg white into the other if you are cooking more than one egg repeat this step keeping all yolks in one bowl and all whites in another if this is too tedious you can just drop the entire egg into one bowl this can lead to a runny white or an overcooked rubbery yolk since the two parts cook at different rates in the microwave 9to hardboil eggs in a microwave4 pierce the egg yolks even the thin membrane holding the yolk together will build up pressure as the moisture inside heats up eventually exploding messily prevent this by piercing each yolk with the tip of a knife skewer or fork to let the steam escape 10to hardboil eggs in a microwave5 cover each bowl contrary to rumor plastic wrap can be safely used for this purpose as long as it does not touch the food itself parchment paper or wax paper can be used insteadto hardboil eggs in a microwave6 cook the white at medium or low power if your microwave oven has a medium or low power setting use it whenever cooking eggs or egg dishes since eggs are easily overcooked to a rubbery superheated mess because its difficult to control the temperature of microwaved food its best to cook in short bursts checking frequently follow these guidelines for typical large chicken eggs most importantly take the egg white out while it is still slightly underdone before it is completely hard the egg will continue to cook from its own heat after removal cook 1 egg white or 1 whole egg for about 30 to 60 seconds 11cook 2 egg whites for about 45 to 75 seconds 12cook 4 egg whites for about 2 minutes 30 seconds to 3 minutes 15 seconds 13to hardboil eggs in a microwave7 cook the yolk for 20 to 30 seconds per yolk remove the bowl containing white and put in the yolk still on medium or low power if the option is available cook the bowl of egg yolk for about 20 to 30 seconds per yolk 14 if cooking more than one yolk stop every 30 seconds to check on progress remove the yolk once its slightly softer than you prefer8 let the egg stand for two or three minutes microwaves heat up the fat in the egg much hotter than a pot of boiling water does this heat will continue to cook the egg after it is removed if part of the egg isnt hard enough after three minutes cook it for another 10 to 20 seconds there is no way to make an overcooked egg softer so its usually better to aim for a slightly soft hardcooked egg
