in blocks or multiple rows to ensure pollination is important here is a troubleshooting list of possible corn growing problems with control and cure suggestions read to the bottom of this post for corn growing success tips corn problems and solutions• corn does not emerge soil may be cold or damp plant later when the soil and temperatures are warmer make sure soil is welldraining by adding aged compost and organic matter to soil• insides of seed and young plants are eaten corn wireworm or the seed corn maggot is eating the seed the corn wireworm is the larvae of the click beetle the click beetle is reddish brown or black to ¾ inches long wireworms are brown or yellow and leathery to 1½ inches long the seed corn maggot is a yellowishwhite legless maggot the larvae of a fly the maggot feeds on the inside of sprouting seed cultivate the planting bed in fall to expose larvae to birds spade the corn bed and let it lie fallow every third season to trap use pieces of potato on a spike setting them 2 to 4 inches into the soil check the traps twice a week pick and destroy wireworms and maggots from the potato• seedlings are cut off near the soil surface cutworms are gray or brown grubs that hide in the soil by day and feed at night handpick grubs from the soil at the base of plants remove weeds and keep the garden free of plant debris place a 3inch cardboard collars around the stems of seedlings and push the collars 1 inch into the soil• seedlings are uprooted crows and birds will pull up seedlings to feed on seed cover seedlings with bird block or row covers until they are established• stalks fall over european corn borers are grayish pink caterpillars with dark head more below they can tunnel through stalks and weaken them use bacillus thuringiensis and garden cleanup to control borers too much nitrogen also can leave stalks lush and green but weak test soil adjust fertilization avoid using fertilizers too rich in nitrogen feed plants with aged compost• stalks and leaves deformed bent over or may fail to unfurl plants are stunted aphids are small softbodied insects–green and gray–that cluster on undersides of leaves aphids leave behind a sticky excrement called honeydew black sooty mold may grow on honeydew spray away aphids with a blast of water use insecticidal soap aluminum mulch will disorient aphids aphid predators include lacewing flies ladybugs and praying mantis• tiny shot holes in leaves the corn flea beetle can riddle leaves with small holes and transmit stewart’s wilt a bacterial disease that leaves the plant’s vascular system clogged with slime infected plants wilt become stunted and die pick off beetles cultivate the garden to disturb the insect life cycle spray with pyrethrum or rotenone• large holes in leaves armyworm corn earworm various beetles and grasshoppers eat corn leaves and foliage handpick insects and destroy or place them in soapy water loss of small amount of leaf tissue will not reduce yields plant early corn varieties to avoid armyworms use commercial traps with floral lures cultivate in the fall to expose larvae• holes in leaves near whorls european corn borer larvae are light brown to pinkish caterpillars with dark brown heads and dark spots on the body adult moth is light brown with a ¾inch wingspan larvae feed on corn whorls then bore into stalks they also feed on tassels and kernels handpick and destroy larvae apply bacillus thuringiensis remove and destroy all infested stalks at the end of the season• leaf edges roll inwards soil moisture may be inadequate corn makes rapid growth after ears form and begins to mature this requires consistent moisture water corn deeply up to 2 or 3 hours at a time when soil dries to a depth of 4 inches water again place 2 to 3 inches of organic mulch on planting bed to conserve moisture• leaves are mottled and streaked yellow and green leaves yellow and die along the margins growth is slowed or stunted mosaic virus and maize dwarf mosaic virus has no cure it is spread by beetles plant mosaic virusresistant varieties destroy infected plants and keep weeds and grasses down that host aphids beetles do not handle healthy plants after infected one• yellow striping on leaves stewart’s wilt is a bacterial disease that results in the plant’s vascular system becoming clogged with slime infected plants will yellow wilt become stunted and die control flea beetles which spread the disease pick off beetles cultivate the garden to disturb the insect life cycle spray with pyrethrum or rotenone plant tolerant varieties• leaves have purple margins starting with leaves at the bottom of the plant plant may be stunted phosphorus deficiency perform a soil test add bonemeal to the top of the planting bed at a rate of 2 to 3 pounds per 100 square feet use a commercial fertilizer rich in phosphorus 5105 is good• reddishbrown blisters on the top of leaves and stalks leaves may turn yellow rust is caused by a fungus rustycolored spores grow on the plant rust favors warm humid weather plant rustresistant varieties avoid overhead irrigation prune away infected leaves• grayish or tan oval spots on leaves northern corn leaf blight and southern corn leaf blight are fungal diseases that favor wet conditions add aged compost or organic material to planting beds to keep soil welldrained avoid overhead irrigation keep garden clean of debris and weeds which can harbor fungus spores plant resistant varieties• leaves yellow as tassels form insufficient nitrogen side dress plants with aged compost water with compost tea or fish emulsion add aged compost to planting beds in advance of planting• graywhite gnarled growths or galls on ears and leaves corn smut is a fungus disease remove and destroy galls as soon as found when they are still white do not allow black powdery spores from galls to fall into soil plant resistant varieties problem is more common in late harvests• ears only partly filled silks are chewed short or clipped off earwigs japanese beetles and corn rootworm beetles feed on silks which prevents pollination or causes poor kernel development check ears daily for earwigs and beetles handpick and destroy spray plants with hot pepper and garlic repellant place traps around the garden to collect pests keep garden free of weeds and debris• incomplete kernel development ears partially filled with ripe kernels shriveled kernels each individual kernel must be pollinated kernels that don’t receive pollen will not fill out pollen from male tassels must reach the female silks several possible causes 1 poor pollination can happen when not enough plants are planted plant at least 3 to 4 rows at least 8 feet long 2 hot weather or high winds during pollination pollen sheds 2 to 3 weeks before harvest 3 insufficient soil moisture keep corn evenly moist especially from silking to harvest 4 inadequate fertilizer or soil fertility add aged compost to planting beds check for potassium deficiency plant varieties adapted to your area 5 birds are eating kernels put paper bags over ears after pollination• worms eat down through kernels ears look brown and eaten corn earworm is a brownheaded caterpillar with lengthwise stripes to 2 inches long the adult is a nightflying moth with brownish or olive wings and bright green eyes the worm finds its way into the whorl of the corn plant to burrow down and eat developing tassels apply 20 drops of mineral oil just inside the ear tip 3 to 7 days after silks first appear break off the wormy end of ear and discard plant earlymaturing varieties to avoid earworms varieties such as ‘country gentleman’ ‘golden security’ and ‘silver cross bantam’ have long tight husks use commercial traps handpick caterpillars and destroy dust with sevin• stalks produce small ears plants are spaced too close together plant early varieties at least 8 inches apart space later varieties 12 to 15 inches apart• popped kernels kernels look like popcorn seed coats will sometime break at the weakest point no cure plant another variety• kernels are pink and moldy brown lesions on stalks near joints stalks rotten inside fungi can cause rots keep garden free of plant debris and weeds that can harbor fungus spores remove diseased plants make sure soil is welldrained add aged compost to planting beds twice a year keep soil evenly moist but not wet corn growing success tips planting grow corn in full sun corn requires moist welldrained soil rich in organic matter prepare planting beds or planting mounds with plenty of aged compost additionally sprinkle planting beds with nitrogenrich cottonseed meal or soybean meal about 3 pounds per 100 square feet plant corn in mounds or hills–thin each hill to 3 plants–or in raised beds mounds and raised beds warm early in the season and are well drained block planting plant corn in blocks or short multiple rows space plants about 15 inches apart with at least 4 rows and at least 4 plants in each row block planting will improve pollination corn drops pollen from its tassels down to the silks in the ears below planted in a block corn pollen that drifts on the breeze is more likely to find its way to an ear and silks below plant time sow corn in the garden after the last frost in spring it is best to plant corn when the soil has warmed to at least 62°f succession plant corn every two weeks for a continuous harvest corn can be started indoors 3 to 4 weeks before planting out start seed in biodegradable pots so that roots are not disturbed when transplanted care corn requires even regular watering use a soaker hose to keep corn moist about 2 inches of water each week add 1 to 2 inches of mulch between stalks to conserve soil moisture side dress corn with aged compost or a balanced fertilizer 1 month after planting and again when the tassels form harvest begin picking corn 3 weeks after the first silks appear when silks brown and begin to dry the corn is ripe check the ears to see that they are filled to the tip with kernels to further test for ripeness press a kernel with your fingernail if the juice is milky white the ear is ripe more tips how to
