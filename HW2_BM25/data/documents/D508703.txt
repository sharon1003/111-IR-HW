how to configure email alerts to review documents in share point date march 13th 2013 author ryan tags reminder category general share point reminder comments 2 tweet i am going to walk through an example showing how you can use our share point reminder software to send out date based email alerts reminding authors to review and update old documents perhaps you’ve got contracts that will expire at a certain time and need to be renewed perhaps you’ve got policies that need to be checked for accuracy at least once per year reminder can help with this and many other scenarios requiring you to setup email alerts to be sent on certain dates – and it’s much easier than working with workflow scenario 1 – email to author asking for a document to be reviewed once per year in this simple example we’re just going to send out an email to an author if a document hasn’t been updated in a year start with a standard share point document library or even a normal list with document attachments these screenshots are from share point 2013 but reminder can work with any onpremises version of share point and if you’re using share point online  office 365 then you can use our reminder 365 product create a new wiki page or web part page if you’re using share point 2007 somewhere in the same site the location is not important as long as it’s in the same site add a new web part to the page insert  web part  miscellaneous  reminderedit the web part and in the toolpane the settings on the right configure it like this set the watch list to documents or whatever your document library or list is calledset the email to  created by tip – you don’t have to use the created by column who is the first person to upload the document you could use use the modified by column the last person to edit the documentadd a “owner” field as a person or group field into the document library and set reminder to send to that hard code a person or distribution address into reminder such as “docreviewersyourcorpcom”setup a subject and message – remember you can include details from the document library such as name and modified by and any other metadata fields from the list the email will also contain a link to the document record under send when set the reminder email to be sent when the modified field is overdue by 12 months – this will trigger an email when a document’s last modified date is a year old if someone edits a document half way through a year the alert email will be ‘moved back’ to be a full 12 months since the last modificationin the send email section set this list to be checked at 7am every weekday or whatever makes sense to your organisation and that’s it in a years’ time the person who created the document will get emails like this – notice the ‘mail merge’ of information from the document library  list being put into the subject and message scenario 2 – email to an account manager to ensure a contract is renewed building up on the previous example we’re going to add an owner field into the document library as who initially uploads a document may not be the person who is later responsible for it add a review date field – just sending an email in a year’s time isn’t precise enough for our well organised officeso add these fields using library  create column owner is a person or group field expiration date is a date and time field and defaults to a calculated value of today365 so by default documents are due for review 1 year after they were created but this can be changed note – you can use today in default values and filters just not calculated columns  it will look something like this the setup for reminder is almost identical to the previous example but email to  owner subject  the document name is due for review on review datesend when  review date is due soon within 5 days and you’re done 5 days before the review date comes around an email will be sent to the document owner further ideas you can have multiple reminders for different time periods eg the first email 6 months after it was created the second 24 months after or one email 2 weeks before a review date saying “due soon” and another email once the review date has passed by a month saying “overdue – get on with it” – let the computer be the team nagemail cc – perhaps the ‘due soon’ email can go to just the document owner but the “overdue” email can be cc’d to the team leader dynamic review dates – perhaps hr documents need to be reviewed every year but health and safety documents very 2 years you can set different rules and emails by setting up views to filter different types of documents and setup different reminder web parts for different views download the free 30 day trial and get started todaytags reminder
