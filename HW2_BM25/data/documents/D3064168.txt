s on 03252018 rating 5 of 5 starsgreat firearm  beefy little gun changed grips now looks as good as it feelsthanks reviewed by toribio m on 03152018 rating 5 of 5 starsflawless gun i love it reviewed by eric d on 03142018 rating 5 of 5 starsbuds service was fast and on time i got exactly what i ordered very happy reviewed by daniel r on 11262010 rating 5 of 5 starsfirst off i have to say this is one of the smoothest guns and one of the soothest deals ive done in awhile hats off to buds for the quick service and for providing me with this great little piece just recieved my rami s few weeks ago and have had no problems apprx 250 rounds without any ftf or fte i am very pleased and will be doing business with buds again reviewed by ricky r on 07152010 rating 5 of 5 starsfirst off i have to say this is one of the smoothest guns ive shot and i report that out of 100 round i had no ftfs or ftes if your looking for a great ccw look no further its very accurate for such a short barrel and the build quality is up there with the good 1911s at a fraction of the cost thank you buds for great service and thank you to cz for this piece of work buds is the only place i will shop for my firearms from now on you cant beat their prices or their customer service this picture also does this weapon no justice reviewed by joseph f on 03032010 rating 5 of 5 starsthis is one of my new favorites the fit and finish is exceptional it is loaded with features single or double action fully adjustable rear sight and amazingly accurate for only having a 3 barrel when i put the first few rounds through it it did not feed the round completly i had to nudge the slide forward a few times however after another 50 rounds or so no more issues it has a great feel and balance i highly recommend this for a concealed carry weapon reviewed by shannon r on 02212010 rating 5 of 5 starsjust tested out my new rami this weekend with no jamming or other problems this is a very well built pistol very accurate and a pleasure to shoot hate to say it but this will probably take the place of my sw 38 snub i would highly recommend this piece for concealed carry which is what i purchased it for reviewed by john u on 09302009 rating 5 of 5 starsthis is truly a marvelous weapon light accurateand the fit and finish is excellent as ive come to expect from cz i bought this for my wife as her cz75 in 40 sw is too large to fit in her purse the rami is perfect for this got a great deal at buds as always and i think im going to buy one of these for myselfreviewed by david b on 09252007 rating 5 of 5 starsi have put 350 rounds thru a used rami 9 i am an average marksman with no competition experience i have been shoting pistols for 40 years and have owned and fired everything from an astra 600 to a super blackhawk the little rami is very well made tight light and has an average trigger with considerable creep from a rest at 25 yds i shot a five inch group with one flier the recoil is manageable and comfortable but the mag release button didnt fit my right thumb as easily as a larger pistol or my mp compact the action was flawless and takedown and cleaning was a snap the thing comes with three mags and dry firing bullets with rubber primers it fits in any holster for that size pistol and if u s made would probably cost 700 dollars it is the lightest nonpolymer pistol ive shot and the sada exposed hammer arrangement is somewhat like a ppk very safe and has the option of a sa first shot for combat the 40 gets the nod but for conc carry the rami is nearly perfect i am very happy with this weapon the edges could be slightly smoother but it comes out fast and i have no reason to doubt its reliability ive fired jhp and fmj with equal feeding
