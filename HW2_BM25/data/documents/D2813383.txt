pets dogs how long do female dogs bleed forweve had a rescued springer for 2months now its been a while since we had a dog she started her bleeding down below 2 days ago just wondering how long it goes on for and when people say in season is it before she bleeds or while she is bit confused but i do love my doggyfollow 21 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer its about 2 weeks the bleeding is to flush out the egg that hasnt been fertilised so she is in season before the period because thats when she is most fertile dahammerhead  you are totally wrong and could cause pointless worry the dog is a mammal and female she bleeds its a fact of life dogs do it every 6 months as oposed to a human 28 days source s i have had 5 female dogs in my life time none of which were

behavior understanding their importance is critical to achieving rapid results that are long lasting and help develop the bond between you and your dog read more here httpsbitlyimw t6vc the first is simple you must win your dogs mind if you don’t achieve this first then you will be struggling the all the way when i talk about winning your dogs mind what i really mean is that your dog looks to you for all the decisions before you do anything else watch one of the amazing video sites that show you the 5 golden rules to establishing yourself as the pack leader if you aren’t putting these in place then you are setting yourself up to fail just at the crucial point where you really want your dog to listen they will go and do their own thing for sure your dog may play ball occasionally or even most of the time you may even have a dog that is obedient 99 of the time however if you want a dog who always listens to you and does as you ask then you need to win your dogs mind the second key to success is to motivate your dog it is really important that you discover what it is that your dog enjoys both in terms of exercise and play but also in terms of a reward if you can make the experience enjoyable then you will both achieve more and look forward to training some dogs love to fetch others love agility and other dogs simply love obedience training or swimming out into water and retrieve at least to start with find out what your dogs love is and help them develop this what i am saying is work with your dog the other point to recognize is to make training enjoyable reward your dog

swell and then will bleed for just over a week it then starts to decrease and change colour to a clear discharge  middle week  which is the time when she is ready to accept the male  after the middle week it then tapers off and generally back to normal in the 4weekssetterart · 1 decade ago0 0 comment the heat cycle of a dog lasts about 3 weeks total the bleeding part is being in heat and usually lasts about 1 week going into heat is about a week and coming out of heat lasts another week i dont know the answer for sure about being in season since i am not sure if she is fertile during all 3 weeks or just during the in heat time frame dogs usually go into heat every 6 months it is best for her healthwise to have her spayed it eliminates the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer pet overpopulation is a huge problem and spaying or neutering is the responsible pet owner thing to do she can be spayed 6 weeks after she has completed her heat cyclesevenofus · 1 decade ago0 0 comment dog bleeds for 3 weeks every 68 months kav82 · 1 decade ago0 0 comment i believe your doggy just went in heat or in season usually it will last about 30 days she will spot during those days if you can keep her outside but if shes an indoor house dogs you might want to invest in some doggy diapers sold at walmart for 10 for a 32 pack it will last you about maybe a week or two she can bleed and pee in it but make sure you keep her on her regular potty routine ie if shes pad train you want to make sure she still mimicks that even though shes wearing a diaper and not peeing on the pad if she gets used to peeing on the diaper for convience she might grow out of the habit of using the pad she might break her potty trained routine welps best of luck if you have any further questions feel free to contact a vet they will answer your questions over the phone so it wont cost you time or money to keep bringing her in for little things source smommy of 6 chihuahuas stephanie t · 1 decade ago1 0

pink and finally cream she will usually accept the stud during the 10th to the 16th day with some variation in season refers to roughly a three week period twice a year source s lhasa apso mc carty dalai · 1 decade ago0 0 comment1 what is heat heat is more properly called the estrous cycle during this cycle female dogs may get pregnant it’s equivalent to human menstruation 2 what are the symptoms females bleed from the vagina sometimes with swelling of the vulva and increased urination don’t expect bleeding comparable to a human female for small dogs it’s usually not much and you may need to pay close attention to your puppy to identify her first cycle other than the bleeding the most noticeable symptom may be male dogs hanging around your house 3 when does a dog come into heat the average female dog has her first cycle about six months of age a few dogs start earlier and few dogs later even as late as 14months if you have a new female puppy you should watch her and note when she has her first cycle if she’s 14months old and still hasnt’t been in heat you should take her to a veterinarian 4 how long does the heat cycle last the average is three weeks or 21days in some dogs it lasts only two weeks while others go four weeks 5 how often will she be in heat most female dogs have regular cycles usually every six to eight months it’s quite typical to be in heat twice a year 6 when can she get pregnant she can get pregnant only when in heat some breeders test for progesterone levels to identify the most fertile days but the ruleofthumb is that the most fertile days are 1115 of her cycle note – when she’s in heat the average dog will permit any male dog to mount her few females however will accept a male when they’re not in heat 7 can she get pregnant her first cycle yes however responsible breeders generally would not breed a dog that early for one thing you need to do genetic testing and some serious problems such as hip conditions do not show up until a dog is approximately 2years of age 8 can i take her on walks during this cycle yes with care she has no problem with the exercise but she’s a walking magnet for male dogs even the best trained and behaved female dog will succumb to hormones you can’t trust her off a leash or out of your control never let her outside by herself even in a fenced yard if there is any possibility of male dogs nearby for walks if there are male dogs in your neighborhood it’s a good idea to take your dog in your car and drive to a remote area take her for the walk there and drive back home otherwise the scent of her urine and vaginal discharge will blaze a trail to your home 9 when i can have her spayed the answer to that one has changed continually over the 25years i’ve been in the dog business people used to be told to let their dog go through at least one cycle or let them have one litter today veterinarians are doing it much earlier some vets spay as early as 6weeks of age talk to your veterinarian about your dog and the vet’s preferences the state of veterinary medicine also is much improved over the past 25years 10 if i don’t have her spayed will she go through menopause no her fertility may decline but she will not go through menopause comparable to a human’s she won’t lose her ability to become pregnant even as a senior so if you don’t want to her to have any or more litters she must be spayed louise louis is a certified canine specialist and the creator of httpwww toy breedscom your online resource for toy breed dogsdeano2806 · 1 decade ago2 2 comment2 weeks
