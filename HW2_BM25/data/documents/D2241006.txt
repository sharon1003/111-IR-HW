my experience with invisalignby terri im in my late 40s with three teenage boys two are still in braces one has finished my dentist has advised that i get braces for several years although my teeth dont look out of alignment they dont meet correctly and are crowded on both the top and bottom my bottom teeth overlap and i have an overbite the crowding has caused some unusual wear and potential gum problems the lack of meeting correctly resulting in a fractured tooth that required a crown finally after years of encouragement and the very expensive crown i decided to seek an orthodontic opinion i had the regular impressions and photos taken i did talk with two different orthos before selecting one our childrens ortho doesnt take adults my ortho reviewed my case and told me i was an invisalign candidate i could also do metal and ceramic i choose invisalign because of the cosmetic benefits the pros of invisalign in my opinion they are nearly invisible after the first week no one has noticed that im wearing them family friends coworkers are completely unaware that im having my teeth corrected i havent had any wear problems of conventional braces  torn cheeks or tongue mouth sores etc i like being able to remove them for brushing and flossing as well as special occasions i remove them for all meals i try to average 20 hours of wear per day it isnt difficult as a plus  my snacking has been reduced substantially  it just isnt worth taking them out to snack and then brush my teeth to put them back in like most folks who wear braces ive brushed by teeth in some really tacky places the other part of invisalign that i really liked was knowing how long it would take and how things would look at the end when you get the aligners back from the factory they are marked 1 of xxx number  which indicates the number of aligners for your treatment you wear each aligner for 2 weeks its easy to calculate how long things will take naturally there is some flexibility depending upon how quickly your teeth move but my experience is that the estimate is right on the money additionally they send a computer simulation of how your teeth will move during treatment so you can visually see what they will look like along the way as well as at the end i was really motivated by the animation my ortho mentioned that its different than conventional braces in that invisalign moves the back teeth first and finishes with the front teeth if you looked at my smile today you wouldnt see any difference although my bite and how my molars meet is very different than just a few months ago i can hardly wait for my front teeth to move so i can see some actual results the cons of invisalign in my opinion they are more expensive for me it was about 500 more than ceramic my ortho said that they might add a couple of weeks to my treatment over conventional braces but nothing substantial my treatment time is one year there was also a 6 week delay between impressions and receiving the aligners the ortho sends the molds xrays and treatment plan to invisalign invisalign then creates the computer simulation and sends it to the ortho for approval the ortho approves or modifies the plan this process takes time  which can be frustrating after all once weve finally decided to do it  lets do itthe impressions  conventional braces use a 30 60 second sillyputty stuff that sets up real quick invisalign requires a mixture that takes 5 minutes to set five really long minutes each for upper and lower of icky stuff dripping down your throat i had problems which meant they had to take the uppers twice  10 minutes is a really long time when you have that stuff in your month the lisp  the first week or so my speech was really affected people noticed that i was talking differently and asked if i had dental work done after the first week no one has noticed although i still think i talk a little weird i think some of that it just me being self conscious i do alot of public speaking  no one seems to be aware of any change attachments some invisalign cases like mine require attachments to various teeth i have 4 these are small bumps that are glued to the outside of your teeth like braces they put some stuff on your tooth and harden it with the light they help the aligners rotate teeth they are invisible and dont really cause any problem i dont know how it will be to have them removed each new set of aligners which are changed every two weeks produces tooth pain the ortho calls it pressure  baloney  it hurts ive learned to change into new aligners at night after taking two advil  by morning its not too bad  although i eat soft foods for two or three days after moving to a new set my ortho sends me home with 3 sets of aligners  i see him every 6 weeks for a progress check removing the aligners after the first couple of days of a new set is a trick  they fit really tight and snap on after several days they loosen and things are easier but its tough until you get it figured out so far im pleased with the cosmetic look and comfortable fit i can also notice the changes in my teeth as far as how my bite has changed im looking forward to seeing changes in my smile my ortho has told me that ill probably need to wear retainers at night forever  i cant count on my teeth maintaining their new alignment without help  he said this was the same regardless of the treatment i selected best of luck with any orthodontic treatment personally im very satisfied with invisalign next story a braces story from down under
