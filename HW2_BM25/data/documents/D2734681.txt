history because the manifestations of adenovirus infections are protean the major syndromes are discussed separately the major syndromes covered in this article include 1 acute respiratory disease ard 2 pharyngoconjunctival fever 3 epidemic keratoconjunctivitis 4 acute hemorrhagic cystitis 5 gastroenteritis and 5 adenoviral infections in immunocompromised hosts given the range of manifestations the varying levels and effects of immunosuppressive therapies and rapid advances in molecular methods of detection a comprehensive review of adenovirus infection in the immunosuppressed host is beyond the scope of this article the reader is encouraged to review the literature for more detail regarding infection in specific settings acute respiratory disease predominantly adenovirus types 1 2 4 5 and 6 occasionally 3 and 7as with many other viral syndromes ard is more common in spring and winter months approximately half of adenovirus respiratory infections do not cause symptoms adenoviruses account for 10 of all childhood lower respiratory tract infections the contagiousness of adenovirus is facilitated by very high levels of viral particles 1000001000000m l in the sputum or oral secretions of infected adults additionally adults who lack antibody may be infected by the inhalation of as few as 5 virions in droplet nuclei fever rhinorrhea cough and sore throat usually lasting 35 days are typical symptoms of adenoviral ard causes of sore throat may include pharyngitis adenoiditis or tonsillitis tonsillitis and otitis media were reported in up to 60 and 30 respectively in a series of young children with serotype 4 predominance prolonged fevers leukocytosis and elevations in c reactive protein crp and erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr were also noted in over half of cases suggesting potential for confusion of this viral syndrome with bacterial infections  8lower respiratory tract infections including tracheobronchitis bronchiolitis and pneumonia may mimic respiratory syncytial virus infection or influenza notably conjunctivitis in the presence of bronchitis suggests adenoviral infection fatal pneumonia is uncommon but is more likely in neonates and has been associated with serotypes 3 7 14 21 and 30  9encephalitis hepatitis and myocarditis are uncommon from the 1950s to 1971 prevaccine era adenoviruses accounted for significant acute disease in 70 of military recruits adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7 were primarily involved a live entericcoated oral vaccine against these serotypes was introduced in 1971 and reduced adenovirusrelated respiratory illness by more than 95 in recruits and thus attenuated outbreaks vaccine production ceased in 1996 for economic reasons and vaccination administration was limited to highrisk periods until supplies ran out in 1999 in 1997 a large epidemic of more than 500 cases associated with serotypes 3 and 7 occurred in us navy recruits most recent analyses suggest that serotype 4 has caused most military outbreaks since 1999 with the exception of ad14 outbreaks in basic trainees declined with the reintroduction of live oral entericcoated adenovirus vaccine against types 4 and 7  10 11adenovirus serotype 14ad14 referred to as the super cold in the media has caused rare outbreaks of ard since 1955 between may 2006 and june 2007 141 cases of ad14 infection were reported in clusters in new york oregon texas and washington almost 40 of affected persons were hospitalized almost half in intensive care with a 5 overall mortality rate the cases in texas involved military trainees at lackland air force base and subsequent cases were reported at lackland three other texas military bases and one eye culture in a civilian unassociated with the military adenovirus may be isolated from children with whooping cough syndrome in the presence or absence of bordetella pertussis infection however whether adenovirus is an etiologic cause of the syndrome remains unclear  12 13pharyngoconjunctival fever predominantly serotypes 3 4 and 7this syndrome most often affects schoolaged children contagious in nature sporadic outbreaks of adenovirus infection occur in small groups especially summer camps in the setting of an inadequately chlorinated water source such as a pool or lake interestingly water sample cultures are often not confirmatory spread occurs via the respiratory route and contact with ocular secretions during the acute illness the classic presentation is characterized by fever sore throat coryza and red eyes upper respiratory tract symptoms may precede ocular findings or may be absent acute conjunctivitis may occur with or without pharyngitis or a respiratory syndrome encephalitis may occur but is rare conjunctivitis usually begins in one eye and then spreads to the other although both eyes may be affected simultaneously severe pain is atypical but mild pain or discomfort tearing pruritus and morning crusting are common it usually is selflimited to 5 days incubation period is 5 days uncommonly an exanthem or diarrhea may occur epidemic keratoconjunctivitis predominantly serotypes 8 19 and 37this is highly contagious with approximately 10 transmission in household contacts via hands and fomites transmission has also been associated with instrumentation industrial trauma shipyard workers ie shipyard eye welders airborne particles contaminated ophthalmic solutions and the hands of health care workers  14 corneal trauma facilitates infection after an 8day incubation period an insidious onset of unilateral red eye occurs spreading to involve both eyes patients have photophobia tearing and pain indicating corneal involvement children may have fever and lymphadenopathy malaise and headache are reported inflammation may persist for weeks and residual scarring and visual impairment may occur acute hemorrhagic cystitis serotypes 11 and 21 or nephritis acute hemorrhagic cystitis usually affects children aged 515 years but may also affect immunosuppressed adults eg from kidney or bone marrow transplantation aids boys are affected more often than girls dysuria frequency and grossly bloody urine are reported hematuria is selflimited to 3 days and other symptoms resolve later symptoms may be more prolonged in hematopoietic stem cell recipients nephritis has occurred in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants and is associated with fever hematuria and flank pain  15 16gastroenteritis most commonly associated with serotypes 40 and 41 but others may be involvedenteric adenovirus infection is a common cause of infantile diarrhea in the daycare setting but less common than rotavirus infection and in some settings less common than infection with astroviruses it can also affect adults in addition a nosocomial outbreak in a hematology unit has been reported  17 adenoviruses replicate readily in the human intestine and may be cultured from asymptomatic individuals thus their presence in the setting of a diarrheal syndrome may be incidental many serotypes are fastidious in culture serotypes 40 and 41 had been termed noncultivatable however they have been cultured in the setting of diarrheal syndromes using newer cell lines monoclonal antibody assays enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and electron microscopy support the association of these strains with enteric disease however one cannot assume that enteric disease is limited to these strains in fact various serotypes of adenovirus have been associated with infectious diarrheal syndromes in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants fever and watery diarrhea are usually limited to 12 weeks mesenteric adenitis and intussusception have been associated with nonenteric adenovirus serotypes ie types 1 2 3 5 6 approximately 40 of infants with intussusception have positive findings from cultures of stool or mesenteric lymph nodes for nonenteric serotypes and most have no evidence of infection with enteric strains ie 40 41 the role of adenovirus in this setting is unclear mesenteric lymphadenitis or hyperirritable small bowel associated with nonenteric adenoviral infection has been postulated to lead to intussusception however most patients with intussusception have no evidence of adenoviral infection based on culture serology or histopathologic viral inclusion findings thus intussusception may be related to multiple etiologies adenoviral infections in immunocompromised hosts multiple serotypesadenovirus is known to cause disease during the posttransplantation period in patients who have received hematopoietic stem cell transplants risk factors for adenovirus disease include allogeneic stem cell transplantation tcell depletion and nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens such as highdose alemtuzumab campath antibody therapy lymphopenia young age and graft versus host disease prolonged neutropenia or immunosuppression also enhances the risk of adenoviral infections manifestations may vary but include hemorrhagic cystitisnephritis pneumonitis hepatitisliver failure and gastroenteritis particularly during the acute posttransplantation period prior to engraftment in one series nephritis was associated with acute renal failure in more than 90 of patients adenovirus should be considered in patients with a fever hematuria flank pain and worsening renal function  18 5uncommonly tcell immunodeficiency related to hiv infection has been associated with adenoviral infections particularly in infants and children infected with hiv pneumonitis and hemorrhagic cystitis are cited most often cholecystitis severe hepatitis and liver failure have been reported  19immunosuppression in recipients of solid organ transplants has also been associated with the above syndromes as has diffuse adenoviral infection of the allograft itself both allograft loss and recovery have been reported  18 adenoviral infection following pediatric lung transplantation has been reported  20importantly note that a prior history of adenoviral infection in a patient with recovered immunocompetence may herald recurrence when the patient again becomes immunosuppressed a high level of suspicion for adenovirus is warranted in these cases general considerations pulmonary infiltrates are often diffuse and reticulonodular but they may be lobar hematuria may occur in the setting of nephritis or hemorrhagic cystitis abnormal transaminase levels which may be dramatic may indicate adenoviral hepatitis diarrhea may indicate adenoviral gastroenteritis next physical
