hospital from disconnecting life support on john doe jersey a homeless man who was beaten senseless by the triplets metatron —a seraph and the voice of god—appears to bethany in a pillar of fire and explains that if bartleby and loki succeed in reentering heaven they will overrule the word of god disprove the fundamental concept of gods omnipotence and nullify all of existence bethany aided by two prophets must stop the angels and save the universe now a target bethany is attacked by the triplets who are driven off by the two foretold prophets—drugdealing stoners jay and silent bob bethany and the prophets are joined by rufus the thirteenth apostle and serendipity the muse of creative inspiration now working in a strip club in search of inspiration of her own azrael summons the golgothan—a vile creature made of human excrement—but bob immobilizes it with aerosol air freshener on a train to new jersey a drunken bethany reveals her mission to bartleby who tries to kill her bob throws the angels off the train bartleby and loki now realize the consequences of their scheme loki wants no part of destroying all existence but bartleby remains angry at god for his expulsion and for granting free will to humans while demanding servitude of angels and resolves to proceed metatron confesses to bethany that gods whereabouts are unknown he disappeared while visiting new jersey in human form to play skee ball the task falls to bethany because—she now learns—she is the last scion the greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandniece of jesus the group fails to persuade glick to cancel the celebration jay steals one of glicks golf clubs their only remaining option is to keep the angels out of the church but azrael and the triplets trap them in a bar to prevent them from doing so azrael reveals that he sent the news clipping to the angels he would rather end all existence than spend eternity in hell bob kills azrael with the golf club which glick had blessed to improve his game bethany blesses the bar sinks contents and the others drown the triplets in the holy water they race to the church where bartleby kills glick his parishioners and assorted bystanders when

jersey bethany puts it all together bethany and bob race across the street to the hospital as the others try to block bartlebys path to the church bethany disconnects johns life support liberating god but killing herself bartleby reaches the church entrance where he confronts god who annihilates him with her voice bob arrives with bethanys lifeless body god resurrects her and conceives a child—the new last scion—within her womb god metatron rufus and serendipity return to heaven leaving bethany and the prophets to reflect on the past and the future cast  editben affleck as bartleby matt damon

partner scott mosier assembled a group of visual artists to realize their concept of a surreal abstract environment somewhere between reality and unreality production designer robert holtzman special effects supervisor charles belardinelli creature effects supervisor vincent guastini costume designer abigail murray and director of photography robert yeoman 5locations  editprincipal photography took place from april 1998 to june 1998 the triplets attack on john doe jersey was filmed on the boardwalk in asbury park new jersey all other scenes were shot in and around pittsburgh pennsylvania the mexican restaurant in which metatron explains bethanys mission was the franklin inn in franklin park north of pittsburgh serendipitys pole dance and the golgothan confrontation took place at the park view cafe since renamed crazy mocha on east north avenue in pittsburgh the heroes plan their final strategy in the grand concourse restaurant in the restored pittsburgh and lake erie railroad station st michael’s church site of the apocalyptic climax is the saints peter and paul church—now vacant—in east liberty 6casting  editcritics expressed surprise at the films eclectic casting which smith said was done deliberately to emphasize contrasts between characters—rickman as the powerful metatron for example opposite mewes as the hopelessly verbose stoner jay a shakespearean trained actor of the highest order next to a dude from new jersey smith warned mewes that he would have to take his acting to a higher level i really impressed upon him that he had to be prepared for this movie there are real actors in this one we kept telling him 5 in response mewes memorized not only his own dialogue but the entire screenplay because he didnt want to piss off that rickman dude 7other unorthodox casting decisions included mexican actress salma hayek as serendipity—the muse who throughout history inspired all the geniuses of art and music like mozart and michelangelo and never got any of the credit—and singersongwriter alanis morissette as god theres a zen buddhist serenity to alanis that calls to mind something otherworldly smith explained shes definitely ethereal in nature even when not speaking and she carries an air about her that played into the role 5deleted scene  editon the films official website smith described a scene that did not make the final cut a climactic faceoff in the hospital between silent bob a badly burned and halfdecomposed triplet and the golgothan the battle was to end with the triplet killing bethany temporarily and god newly liberated transforming the golgothan into flowers test audiences felt there was too much golgothan and the films run time already exceeded two hours so the scene was eliminated 8soundtrack  editmusic from the

14possible sequel  editin late november 2005 smith responded to talk of a possible sequel on the view askewcom message boards so weird you should ask this because ever since 911 i have been thinking about a sequel of sorts i mean the worst terrorist attack on american soil was religiously bent in the wake of said attack the leader of the free world outed himself as pretty damned christian in the last election rather than a quagmire war abroad the big issue was whether or not gay marriage was moral back when i made dogma i always maintained that another movie about religion wouldnt be forthcoming as dogma was the product of 28 years of religious and spiritual meditation and id kinda shot my wad on the subject now i think i might have more to say and yes the last scion would be at the epicenter of it and shed have to be played by alanis and wed need a bigger budget because the entire third act would be the apocalypse scary thing is this the film would have to touch on islam and unlike the catholic league when those cats dont like what you do they issue a death warrant on your ass and now that ive got a family im not as free to stir the shitpot as i was when i was single back when i made dogma i mean now ive gotta think about more than my own safety and wellbeing but regardless – yeah a dogma followups been swimming around in my head for some time now 15in october 2017 smith revealed that he no longer desired to make any new religious films 16notes  editreferences  edit a b c dogma at box office mojo a b a practicing catholic on the religious storm of dogma chicago
