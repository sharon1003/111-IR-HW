of bluecollar jobs — accelerated by the recent recession — has resulted in the hollowing out of the middle which has left behind either lowpaying jobs or higherpaying jobs that require significant

people degrade or demean jobs that dont require a fouryear degree …thats not what they want their kids to do says symonds who is launching the global pathways institute at arizona state university to

times as much three hours away he says people dont know about these jobs  we want to use data as much as we can to drive that depressed housing prices have made it harder for workers to move

development at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee peter cappelli director of the center for human resources at the wharton school says other factors — such as automated screening algorithms in online application systems — might also play a role in his book why good people cant get jobs cappelli notes one case where a company received 25000 applications for an engineering job but none matched the qualifications cappelli also argues that employers may say they cant find workers for political leverage to loosen immigration laws particularly for higherskilled workers and to get

many good jobs but people dont know how to get to them biden said in a white house interview its not the federal government creating jobs were facilitating were putting the mechanism together to identify real jobs were just saying heres where the jobs are heres the requirements heres how you get those requirements and well help you pay for it if you qualify biden cites a program he visited in detroit that taught programming skills to two dozen women with no previous experience all graduated and within days were hired at salaries of 55000 to 100000 the administrations report released in july stresses the importance of employers working with schools to make sure students are getting the right skills and promotes more apprenticeships it also highlights programs that encourage accountability such as a report card program in new jersey where schools are graded based on where their graduates were placed and how much they earn biden says he is confident some of the basic initiatives will be funded on monday he announced 450 million in newjobtraining grants for partnerships between businesses and community colleges altogether 2 billion has been given out in the past

to respond to the ebb and flow of job demand by offering fasttrack nondegree courses that get trained students into the workforce faster but also can be easily scaled back or dismantled when the supply of workers meets demand we need students who are collegeready and ready for an intensive experience said todd oldham vice president of economic and workforce development at monroe community

people to work and has an employment rate of 98 according to the college if we go to one of those schools and say we need a program to train the five new people we hired theyre going to laugh at us cause theres no way they can develop a program buy the equipment hire instructors get the floor space for five people ajax said but if we get 10 companies and were training 50 to 100 per year thats a
