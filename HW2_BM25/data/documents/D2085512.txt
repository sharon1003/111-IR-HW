fluid mechanics  theoryin this section mass density will be introduced the concept of the specific weight will also be presented mass density mass density click to view movie 20kcopper cube in water and mercury click to view movie 27kthe mass density  ρ of a fluid is defined as the ratio of the mass of the fluid m to its volume v that isρ  mvthe si unit for the mass density is kgm 3 while the english unit is slugsft 3 for liquids mass density is not a strong function of temperature and pressure hence density is generally assumed to be independent of the temperature and pressure for liquids on the other hand for gases density varies with both temperature and pressure the relation between ρ t and p for gases is given by the ideal gas law which will be presented in a later section the density of different liquids has a wide range for example the density of water at 16 o c is 999 kgm 3 while the density of mercury at 20 o c is 13550 kgm 3 in order for an object to float in a liquid the density of the object must be less than that of the liquid for example a copper cube  ρ  9000 kgm 3  will sink in water but it will float on mercury20°c 68°f 1 atm density ρ kgm 3 slugft 3water pure 998 1936water sea 1025 1989ammonia 608 1180benzene 881 1709carbon tetrachloride 1590 3085ethanol 789 1531freon 12 liquid 1327 2575gasoline 680 1319glycerin 1260 2445kerosene 804 1560mercury 13550 2629methanol 791 1535sae 10w oil 870 1688sae 30w oil 891 1729sae 50w oil 902 1750for gases a similar phenomenon can be observed consider the balloons as shown in the figure the density of helium inside the balloons is less than the surrounding air for a given temperature and pressure hence the balloons rise in air for more information on this subject readers are referred to the discussion of buoyancy specific weight or weight densitythe specific weight γ of a fluid is defined asγ  ρ gwhere g is the gravitational acceleration basically the specific weight represents weight per unit volume sometimes it is also referred to as the weight density the si unit for the specific weight is nm 3 while the english unit is lbft 3 specific gravity specific gravity is simply the ratio of the specific weight of a given liquid to the specific weight of water at 4° c  γ water  981 k nm 3 or 624 lbft 3  sg  γ  γ water this definition is helpful when comparing densities of different liquids
