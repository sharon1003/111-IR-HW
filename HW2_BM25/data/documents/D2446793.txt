science caffeine absorption how quickly does caffeine enter the bloodstream those that are regular consumers of coffee or energy drinks have figured out that it takes about 1520 minutes before the effects of caffeine are realized energy shots can be a tad quicker since there is less liquid to drink and food items such as caffeinated gum or chews can be even quicker since some of the caffeine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth however feeling alert doesn’t really tell us how long it takes for all of the caffeine to be fully absorbed into the bloodstream this is a bit more complicated luckily there have been a few scientific studies that have measured how fast caffeine via different mediums is completely absorbed by the bloodstream caffeine absorption rates caffeine medium amount bioavailability blood saturation caffeine capsules¹ 200mg 90 84120 minutes caffeine gum¹ 200mg 77 4480 minutes coffee² 200mg 99 4239 minutes energy drink² 200mg 99 4239 minutes looking at the above data we can glean some interesting information liquid is the overall best caffeine delivery method with the most caffeine being absorbed in the least amount of time to fully saturate blood plasma the effects of caffeine gum are quicker but less caffeine is absorbed overall an advertised 100mg caffeine piece of gum would really only deliver 77mg of caffeine caffeine capsules and tablets take the longest to fully saturate the blood since they have to dissolve in the stomach first we couldn’t locate any data on caffeine candies such as live wire chews or jelly belly extreme sports beans but since these items are completely dissolved by the saliva and swallowed they would most likely have similar results as the liquid caffeine delivery agents as for caffeinated gum our guess would be that caffeine gum has less bioavailability because some of the caffeine gets trapped in the gum material which is not fully consumed is caffeine on an empty stomach best many people report that drinking caffeine on an empty stomach provides faster absorption than drinking caffeine with food or after eating there was some research³ into this notion and it found that the rate of stomach emptying did speed up or slow down blood saturation rates people with full stomachs especially those given a high fiber hard to digest meal had slower caffeine absorption rates some people report consuming caffeine on an empty stomach causes indigestion different times call for different caffeine caffeine absorption isn’t as straight forward as people might think since there are several variables that influence how quickly it saturates the bloodstream while there are many ways to consume caffeine the best way may depend on the situation a people find themselves in if a person needs to feel the effects of caffeine quicker gum or candy would be in order but if a person wants to get the most bang for their buck then caffeine in liquid form will deliver the exact dose they had hoped for this

dilution by food or drink i cut the 200mg stay awake in half or quarters for my metabolism takes only 15 minutes for energy to come up however if you have a tendency toward hypoglycemia insulin resistance or diabetes you may get the opposite effect and find yourself getting sleepy but for most people a pill that stays in the mouth is fastest the prufessa • 7 months ago when i eat carbs which gives me a sharp crash shortly afterwards in the morning i like to make sure wash it down with some caffeine that way the caffeine digests with the food and stops the crash until i get home to my couchalso i keep my coffee on a warmer at work and take a sip every 30 minutes this keeps me from drinking too much and being wired and keeps me at a nice constant energy level all dayi used to drink a whole cup at one time that caused a sharp spike and jittery feeling then a couple of house later i was crashing which caused me to get another cup and after that i have an uneasy feeling the rest of the day like a half sleepy half woke feeling taking one sip every 30 minutes has gotten rid of that issue and i never drink more than i need to in order to get thru the dayin between the coffee sips i sip water every 10 minutes so in an hour i take 4 sips of water and 2 sips of coffee martin mews • 1 year ago what about nappies taking a cue from the nicotine patch crowd ive been wearing disposable caffinated nappies for the last month or two changed daily and im pleased to report i feel great and totally absorbed all day long paul • 1 year ago what about chocolate the caffeine in chocolate candy is in the fat that is cocoa butter since fat coats the mouth and tongue better than water is the caffeine in chocolate absorbed faster and better ted • 1 year ago chocolate has little caffeine and its actually in the cocoa solids but as for absorption i doubt there has been any studies on chocolate since its really not a primary caffeine source people eat chocolate primarily for the taste and the theobromine paul • 1 year ago my question remains people make similar claims for the taste of both coffee and tobacco we eat chocolate because it is a stimulant exactly like coffee and tobacco the taste of these substances is only related to their qualities as a delivery system and the quantity of the drug delivered the prufessa • 7 months agoi have never in my life ate chocolate for its stimulant propertiesfurthermore i have never noticed the stimulant properties of chocolate after consuming it not even when i overdo my chocolate intake which happens from time to time when i get a hold of a bag of chocolateseven furthermore i have never heard of anyone saying that they need some chocolate in order to wake up or feel less sleepyso what in the world are you talking about theres very little caffeine found in chocolate relatively speaking its miniscule and not worth doing this experiment onlol • 1 year agobruh elias fierens • 1 year ago bruhartman99 • 1 year ago source 2 measured time to peak saliva levels not blood saturation and it matters  they measured time to peak saliva level for a pill and it was 67 minutes which is a lot less than the 84120 min you found in source 1 its unlikely that time to peak for anything you drink is lower than sublingual or gum times to peak drinking coffee is slower but yes faster than the pill victoria • 2 years ago helpful really tidy and nice article will keep reading what you guys post ted • 2 years ago thanks victoria we appreciate your feedback ty • 4 years ago so what about products like thishttpwwwamazoncomenerg they still have to digestdissolve in the stomach so does the rapid effect just placebo ted • 4 years ago i would guess they they fit in the time line of capsules mentioned above these could be designed to dissolve faster than others though layster • 4 years ago this is really helpfull but i have no idea why no one has made an energy drink family tree i would really like to know the relationships between companies ted • 4 years ago good idea ill look into this laura • 5 years ago why does a 12 oz red bull give me less of a kick than one level teaspoon of instant coffee prepared in 68 ounces of liquid troy gardner • 2 years agobecause the amount of water dilutes the effect and slows the absorption rate say you have equal 200mg of caffiene in both but one is 12 as dense will drive faster through the intestinal wall as its partly driven by the concentration balancedifference on opposing sides of mouth or intestinal tissue and it has to reach a certain threshold in a certain time for it to work best like any drug there is optimal dose for optimal effect that varies on person it might be something like this as seen in the blood50mg  low almost no effect 100mg  ok effect  minimal threshold 150mg  optimal dose 200mg  a little too much tad bit of sweating faster speech 250mg  overdose anxiety sweating profusely heart racingif you had 200mg with food the digestion might deliver that over 2 hours so you might not even get 50mg in the blood if you took it on an empty stomach you might get 150mg in 10 minutes which is enough to be felt appledystopia • 5 years ago i agree with the caffeine and gum suggestion that kurtk suggests i did it once and it worked wonders and i googled it to see if anyone else does it if you do it you want to use no doz or something that doesnt taste too bad vivarin tastes awful i agree 100 it hits you fast as it is absorbed sublingually i did this at a concert and it hit me fast just as i was starting to lose energy i didnt have a drink with me to swallow a pill necessity is the mother of invention by the way it did make the gum break down and turn into sludge after a while i was chewing eclipse i think maybe the starch in the pill does that but this was after chewing it for 30 minutes the caffeine will probably absorb in less then 10 get rid of the gum before it turns into sludge i am a programmer too but i dont do oodles of caffeine i actually quit drinking coffee regularly about 10 years ago i do green tea now it has a small amount of caffeine but the stimulant effect comes from theanine i did this after discovering dr nicolas perricone on pbs he strongly recommends not drinking coffee after 10 years i still get carded for beer and i am much older than 21 almost twice that i found that i would stress out too much with caffeine which isnt good in the pressure cooker of the silicon valley coffee releases the stress hormone cortisol even one cup will release cortisol and keep the levels elevated all day it makes you feel stressed out stores belly fat causes skin to thin and wrinkle as well as increasing stretch marks and even causes brain cells to die in other words it makes you age rapidly cortisol is the fight or flight hormone it is meant to be released in emergencies not every day also it causes adrenal depletion thats why you feel so great after that one cup in the morning and you will get so much done and then you fade out there is only so much adrenalin that will be produced and released i still do take the occasional caffeine pill but i break a 200mg in half i will take caffeine before hitting the gym the increase in testosterone offsets the effects of cortisol i also take it in emergencies or if i am out at a party or drinking while i dont drive drunk i find that driving home late at night after a couple drinks were consumed earlier makes me feel tired tommy • 5 years ago yeah kids better get some high quality coke felix the cat • 6 years ago the best way ive found to administer caffeine is by sucking on the beans you can hold hem in your cheeks the prufessa • 7 months agohow does that taste though sounds grossporknbeans • 7 years agocaffeinated lady do you dissolve the pill in liquid or just in your mouth one thing about the everything2com guys post was the problem is that while i was reaching for the water it crumbled to dust in my mouth i swallowed it anyway and realized my mistake in seconds so he actually had just the powder in his mouth and swallowed it without water as he was reaching for it if he had mixed it in the water i wonder if it wouldve been differentartman99 • 1 year ago generally when i take sublingual pills ive heard them say no water for a few minutes under the tongue big blood vessels and you wantthehighest concentration of med sitting there as long as good contact def crushed up and only a little saliva fastest stick a sonic toothbrush under there and you get half the rush of snorting somethingkurtk • 9 years ago having suffered from sleep problems for a while now ive been experimenting a little with different caffeine administration routes and the best by far is sublingualy just break off 50mgs of a caffeine tablet and chew it up with a piece of gum or two it diffuses through the mucous membranes in your cheeks and under your tongue and hits your bloodstream almost instantly lasts for about an hour also something i read in national geographic that you caffeine freaks might want to make note of nicotine doubles the rate that caffeine is metabolized into the body a small downside to this i guess is that a person on caffeine only absorbs half the nicotine he would under normal circumstances just some food for thought wonder if the gum route works for ambien stuck • 10 years agoi am trying to do my crswk on the effect of caffeine on the nervous system none of you have helped menev • 11 years ago to facforrester you are probably immune to the effects of it try to discontinue for a month or at least a few weeks then do the same thing youll notice a difference nev • 11 years ago to devv mountain dew has 55mg12oz of liquid an espresso has anywhere from 100200mg per shot total you are talking about 660mg for the 12pack and assuming a singleshot espresso and additional 200mg thats a total of 860mg or 086g of caffeine over probably 12 hours or more ld50 of caffeine is 10g instantaneous absorption meaning taken all at once you arent taking anywhere near that amount and definitely not at oncefacforrester • 11 years agoive taken jet alerts for 56 yearsi crushed onetook half of it  i never really noticed much diferencebut i also take 130 mgs methadone daily toobob • 11 years agoi went to a site that sold caffeine they warned against more than a gram at a time it is possible to get caffeine poisoning thodevv • 11 years agosothis is kinda bull on the 150mg killing youseeim 18 since ive been about 15 ive gone through a 12 pack of mt dew a daynot to mention a capachino every morningif caffeine in that amount were deadlyi wouldnt be herei would say u are more likely to choke on the damn thing then u are to overdose poppy • 2 years ago if you had an existing heart problem moderate severe though that would have killed you by now also you should probably cut down that cant be good for youcaffeinated lady • 11 years ago i really dont see how crushing a caffeine pill and eating half could kill you i do this every day and have for years i buy the 200 mg pills because they are cheaper than 100 mg ones i split them in half always then i eat half letting it disolve before swallowing because i have trouble swallowing pills it works fine for me in place of coffee two or three times a dayjohnnyjohnjjoe • 12 years ago im so there elliott back • 12 years ago i think you mean absorption which is a little funny because it invokes the bp rule evil monkey • 12 years ago no the ld50 for caffeine is about 150mgkg that equates to about 10 grams for the average person via oral administration a line probably wont kill you but remember this is just for death by caffeine if you have heart problems blood pressure problems mental problems or something else you might die a lot sooner drop • 12 years ago just to let you knowthe ld50 for caffeine is 10000mgkg i dont think a line or 2 of caffeine is going to kill you as for donâ€™t try this at home itâ€™s dangerous and you might die yeah i suppose you would if you crushed up around oh say100 nodoze and snorted them all in one gowardy • 12 years agohey i luv tht badger • 12 years ago wat about caffeine disapation how long does it take for caffiene to disapate from your body to determine exactly how long you have to ingest the caffiene to die or the limit of time so you can slow down so u dont die on average the human body can filter out 3oz of alcohol an hour so wats caffiene last modified september 11 2014
