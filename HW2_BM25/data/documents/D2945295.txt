the world meteorological organization wmo to be a middle or multilevel stratus type 1 2 although it is usually a lowbased cloud it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels this change in classification would once have made it a family d cloud but this style of letterbased family nomenclature was discontinued by the wmo in 1956 nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area nimbo is from the latin word nimbus which denotes precipitation downwardgrowing nimbostratus can have the same vertical extent as most large upwardgrowing cumulus but its horizontal extent tends to be even greater this sometimes leads to the exclusion of nimbostratus from the group of vertical clouds by some independent meteorologists and educators classifications that follow this approach usually show nimbostratus as lowlevel 3 4 5 based on its normal base height range contents  hide 1 appearance2

from near surface in the low levels to about 3000 m 9800 ft in the middle level of the troposphere although usually dark at its base it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer 6 nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 to 4000 m though found worldwide nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes 7 it is coded c m 2 on the synop report formation  editnimbostratus occurs along a warm front or occluded front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain these clouds being preceded by higherlevel clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus 8 9 often when an altostratus cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes it will become nimbostratus 10nimbostratus unlike cumulonimbus is not associated with thunderstorms however at an unusually unstable warm front caused as a result of the advancing warm air being hot humid and unstable cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the usual nimbostratus lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it in this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours the occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front forecast  editnimbostrati often have very few visual features nimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a coldfrontal cumulonimbus cloud 7 precipitation may last for several days depending on the speed of the frontal system 8 a nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus but the rain or snow falls as virga which doesnt reach the ground stratus or stratocumulus usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front origin of name  editfurther information cloud § history of cloud science and nomenclature under luke howard s first systematized study of clouds carried out in france in 1802 three general cloud forms were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation cirriform cumiliform and stratiform these were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude in addition to these three main types howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together cumulostratus a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers and nimbus a complex blending of cirriform cumuliform and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation later in the 20th century an imc commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type it was then renamed nimbostratus and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the international atlas of clouds and of states of the sky this left cumulonimbus as the only nimbiform type as indicated by its rootname subtypes and derivative types  editspecies and varieties nimbostratus is very thick opaque and featureless so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties 11 12precipitationbased supplementary features nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features the latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the clouds vertical depth accessory cloud nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck 13 pannus is coded c l 7 genitus mother clouds this genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus mutatus mother clouds nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus altostratus and stratocumulus relation to other clouds  editmultilevel nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genustypes by way of being nonconvective in nature however the other sheetlike clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time stratus clouds are lowlevel and form from near ground level to 2000 metres 6600 ft at all latitudes in the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from 2000 metres 6600 ft to 7000 metres 23000 ft in polar areas 7000 metres 23000 ft in temperate areas and 7600 metres 24900 ft in tropical areas although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the highlevel the main hightlevel stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun cirrostratus forms at altitudes of 3000 to 7600 metres 9800 to 24900 ft in high latitudes 5000 to 12000 metres 16000 to 39000 ft in temperate latitudes and 6100 to 18000 metres 20000 to 59100 ft in low tropical latitudes 14 of the nonstratiform clouds cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation the remaining cumuliform cumulus and stratocumuliform stratocumulus altocumulus and cirrocumulus clouds have the least in common
