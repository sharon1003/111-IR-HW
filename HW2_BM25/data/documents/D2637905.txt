is hemp legal the answer is simply and truly yes there is nothing about hemp that is illegal we do not sell any illegal products shipping you the hemp we sell is completely allowed there are no laws in the us or canada that make possession of hemp illegal this includes the sterilized seed hemp seed oil hemp seed flour hemp seed cake hulled hemp seeds hemp clothing hemp fabrics hemp fuel or any other product made from industrial hemp we grow and supply seed derivative products from one of the many strains of hemp that produce little or no thc we measure it at 000 thc there are also strains of cannabis sativa that produce high levels of thc these strains would be considered marijuana there is nothing similar between marijuana and hemp they may as well be different plants as they are grown differently processed differently are made from different parts of the plant and have grown so far apart genetically that they are for all intents and purposes completely different plants will i test positive for thc if i eat your hemp products the subject of drug tests have come up many times in the past and we are of two minds on the subject of positive results health canada which is the governmental body that regulates the hemp industry in canada states that we cannot sell a hemp oil product that contains more than 10 parts per million thc therefore the oil we sell we can guarantee contains less than 10 ppm thc we actually test to levels of 4 ppm to be sure that we do not sell products with measurable levels of thc and our oil has consistently tested with nondetectable levels at 4 ppm for arguments sake we’ll say that the oil you ingest has a thc level of 1 ppm thc though the actual levels are probably a lot lower it would then become something probably around the 1 part per billion in your body we presume if the level of accuracy of the drug test allows for concentrations in the parts per trillion range you might test positive though you could have picked up that kind of concentration touching someone’s hand that had traces of thc and then putting your fingers in your mouth we then cannot guarantee that if your drug test is able to detect levels in the parts per trillion that you would not test positive because we only guarantee that our oil is less than 10 ppm do we think this is possible yes we do it is possible to detect parts per trillion thc in blood do we think this is likely no we don’t but it is up to you to decide we have heard that ny police have been told not to eat poppy seed bagels because it is causing false positives for opiates in drug tests we don’t know if this is true or not but if there are such severe draconian testing where you work we do not recommend that you consume hemp products and risk losing your job on another note we have done tests with an old distributor of ours who got his paralegal secretary to consume 3 pounds of hemp seeds and then go for a drug test she tested negative for thc in her blood sometimes hemp oil tests higher than the hemp seed because it is a concentrated version of the seed but with our rigorous testing we are confident that our oils have low enough percentages of thc as to not cause a false positive with respect to drug tests we cannot in anyway guarantee this and assume no liability
