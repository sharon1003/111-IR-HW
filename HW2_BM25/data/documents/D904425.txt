reactivated lin28a gene credit cell shyhchang et al young animals are known to repair their tissues effortlessly but can this capacity be recaptured in adults a new study from researchers at the stem cell program at boston childrens hospital suggests that it can by reactivating a dormant gene called lin28a which is active in embryonic stem cells researchers were able to regrow hair and repair cartilage bone skin and other soft tissues in a mouse model the study also found that lin28a promotes tissue repair in part by enhancing metabolism in mitochondria  the energyproducing engines in cells  suggesting that a mundane cellular housekeeping function could open new avenues for developing regenerative treatments findings were published online by the journal cell on november 7 efforts to improve wound healing and tissue repair have mostly failed but altering metabolism provides a new strategy which we hope will prove successful says the studys senior investigator george q daley md ph d director of boston childrens stem cell transplantation program and an investigator with the howard hughes medical institute most people would naturally think that growth factors are the major players in wound healing but we found that the core metabolism of cells is ratelimiting in terms of tissue repair adds ph d candidate shyhchang ng cofirst author on the paper with hao zhu md both scientists in the daley lab the enhanced metabolic rate we saw when we reactivated lin28a is typical of embryos during their rapid growth phase lin28 first discovered in worms functions in all complex organisms it is abundant in embryonic stem cells expressed strongly during early embryo formation and has been used to reprogram skin cells into stem cells it acts by binding to rna and regulating how genes are translated into proteins to better understand how lin28a promotes tissue repair the researchers systematically looked at what specific rnas it binds to they initially had their sights on a tiny rna called let7 which is known to promote cell maturation and aging we were confident that let7 would be the mechanism says shyhchang but there was something else involved specifically the researchers found that lin28a also enhances the production of metabolic enzymes in mitochondria the structures that produce energy for the cell by revving up a cells bioenergetics they found lin28a helps generate the energy needed to stimulate and grow new tissues we already know that accumulated defects in mitochondrial metabolism can lead to aging in many cells and tissues says shyhchang we are showing the converse  that enhancement of mitochondrial metabolism can boost tissue repair and regeneration recapturing the remarkable repair capacity of juvenile animals further experiments showed that bypassing lin28a and directly activating mitochondrial metabolism with a smallmolecule compound also had the effect of enhancing wound healing this suggests the possibility of inducing regeneration and promoting tissue repair with drugs since lin28 itself is difficult to introduce into cells the fact that we were able to activate mitochondrial metabolism pharmacologically gives us hope shyhchang says lin28a didnt universally induce regeneration in all tissues heart tissue showed little effect and while the researchers were able to enhance the regrowth of finger tips in newborn mice they could not in adults lin28a could be a key factor in constituting a healing cocktail says shyhchang but there are other embryonic factors that remain to be found story source materials
