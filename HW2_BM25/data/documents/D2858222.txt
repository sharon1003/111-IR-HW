photography credit elise bauer the first time i traveled to the land of my austrian ancestors i was taken to a restaurant where i saw “schnitzel” on the menu of course i ordered it thinking i could use a good german sausage in a bun you have my permission to pound your head on the wall now i mean who in america didn’t grow up with those fast food joints with the giant hot dogs on the top of them when the order came i was stunned by how far off it was from what i was expecting even my gracious hosts had a hard time believing me when i told them that in america a wiener schnitzel was a hot dog at least where i was from in suburban california curses yes we tend to distort some traditional dishes here in america but this one we weren’t even close“schnitzel” for the uninitiated is german for “cutlet” which is usually made with veal and is thinly pounded breaded and fried as for this recipe it is made with thinly pounded pork cutlets those of you looking for a quick midweek dinner may be happy with this one i love it the sauce alone is worth making the recipe for and could easily be used on chicken for turkey meatballs or over fish follow me on pinterest pork schnitzel recipe print

listed they taught me to use kellogg’s cornflake crumbs instead of bread or panko they’re difficult to find but i’ve had luck at most publix locations they serve the schnitzel with creamy dill dip and with a cucumbervinegar salad and mashed potatoes on the side the complementary textures and flavors are amazingjuly 9 2017 · 2 replies sandy made this tonight for my family the only thing the didn’t

pork chops panfried pork chops with a creamy dijon mustard sauce photography credit elise bauer we eat a lot of pork in this family even given my father’s germanic background pork chops are the most convenient which is probably why i remember my mother serving them so often growing up the chops were thinner and almost always bonein there were a lot of kids gnawing on bones at our table these days

the dijon mustard a little too tangy for my taste nancy i love these pork chops i just made them  i had a nice open french white wine  this is one of my favorite pork chop recipes  thank you lori i immediately double the recipe and it came out great my husband doen’t like sauces cooked with wine so i substituted water for the wine the pork wasn’t exactly moist but it was not over cooked and tasted great i am glad i doubled the sauce but it did require longer reduction times other than that yummyabbie wonderful sauce tough meat i used organic bones less chops they lacked flavor inside and good texture this method would work great with chicken the sauce was wonderful view more
