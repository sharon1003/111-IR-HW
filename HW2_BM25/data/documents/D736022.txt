danish design student susanne koefoed in 1968 it was first sketched at a radical design conference mounted by the scandinavian students organization sdo 2 the group organized a summer study session at stockholm’s art and design college konstfack alternating time between workshop sessions and larger lectures in these lectures the tone was set by the american designer and educator victor papanek in the writings that he formulated during this period too he imagined persons who were disabled –both physically challenged and mentally—as figures in need of renewed attention 3 although there is no evidence that papanek met koefoed his influence pervaded the seminar where the original isa was drafted charged with creating a signsymbol to mark barrierfree accommodations koefoed presented an early version of the symbol at the july 1968 exhibition held at the sdo seminar’s end koefoed’s symbol depicts an empty wheelchair this icon was widely promoted around sweden the following year 4karl montan director of sweden’s new handicapped institute also promoted koefoed’s design to rehabilitation international head of ri’s international commission of technology and accessibility icta montan was asked by ri to form a special committee that would find and deliver a symbol to the group’s 1969 convention in dublin 5 montan’s group was asked to choose from six symbols when koefoed’s symbol was presented several members complained that it was too austere and illegible as montan noted a slight inconvenience with the symbol is the equally thick lines which may give an impression of a monogram of letters with a head on the symbol this inconvenience would disappear 6 taking the original copy of the design montan would add a circle to the top of the seat to give the impression of a seated figure functions  editthe symbol is often seen where access has been improved particularly for wheelchair users but also for other disability issues 7 frequently the symbol denotes the removal of environmental barriers such as steps to help also older people parents with baby carriages and travellers 8 universal design aims to obviate such symbols by creating products and facilities that are accessible to nearly all users from the start the wheelchair symbol is international and therefore not accompanied by braille in any particular language specific uses of the isa include marking a parking space reserved for vehicles used by people with disabilitiesblue badge holders marking a vehicle used by a person with a disability often for permission to use a space marking a public lavatory with facilities designed for wheelchair users indicating a button to activate an automatic door indicating an accessible transit station or vehicle indicating a transit route that uses
