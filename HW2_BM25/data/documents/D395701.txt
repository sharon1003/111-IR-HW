normal function the hbb gene provides instructions for making a protein called betaglobin betaglobin is a component subunit of a larger protein called hemoglobin which is located inside red blood cells in adults hemoglobin normally consists of four protein subunits two subunits of betaglobin and two subunits of another protein called alphaglobin which is produced from another gene called hba each of these protein subunits is attached bound to an ironcontaining molecule called heme each heme contains an iron molecule in its center that can bind to one oxygen molecule hemoglobin within red blood cells binds to oxygen molecules in the lungs these cells then travel through the bloodstream and deliver oxygen to tissues throughout the body related information what is dna what is a gene how do genes direct the production of proteins more about how genes work health conditions related to genetic changes chromosomal location other names for this gene additional information  resources sources for this page
