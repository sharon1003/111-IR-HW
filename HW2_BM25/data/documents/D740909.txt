31aug dream interpretation for the element of fire by mackenzie wright 1 comment everyone’s heard of the four elements used by philosophers and alchemists earth air fire and water are considered the very components that make up the universe— not literally but symbolically each one is a powerful archetype that represents specific energies the meanings of these elements are embedded in our subconscious minds which is why they often manifest in our dreams fire the element of fire represents our spirit or energy and is often related to matters of religion or that which we hold sacred a universal symbol for passion fire can represent anything toward which we feel passionate this particularly includes our sexual passions and desires among all the elements fire is the most transformative for example the forest being burnt to the ground metal forged in the heat of the flame the phoenix rising out of its ashes among all the elements fire is the most transformative something burning if something is burning in your dream a lot of the interpretation depends on what is set on fire and how the burning affects you if you are surrounded by fire it could mean a change in your interests or way of thinking a house generally represents ourselves in a dream so if your house is on fire it also points to personal transformation whether you’re inside of it or not if you yourself set the fire you want the change to occur if you’re trying to put out the fire you’re trying to prevent the change fire extinguishers represent your desperation to quash your emotions desires or changes happening in your life if another person is involved either burning you or being burned it could mean you’re burning up with desire or are experiencing strong feelings toward that person being burned if you yourself are burnt during your dream it speaks of your inner state of unrest you’re fired up you’re feeling heated—you’re angry or experiencing overwhelming negative emotions if something burns you you may be “playing with fire” have you been doing anything dangerous with risky behavior there is a fear of getting burned fire pits and places having a campfire indicates you need to bring your friends closer to you and share more of your life with them you need to share your warmth and friendship in a pleasant situation maybe you need to plan more leisurely activities surrounding a barbecue fire can also symbolize fun and leisurely activities but if you’re more focused on cooking something it means you’ve been making small changes if they’re cooking nicely they’re under your control if they’re burning or you’re having trouble with the food over the fire it indicates you’re having trouble in life a hearth fire or fireplace is a good place to be— somewhere warm cozy and comfortable you’re in a good place in your life and it’s making you content if the fire goes out or won’t light then you’re lacking certain comforts fires that light the way burning candles torchers or lanterns are generally a good sign in a dream they represent illumination enlightenment possibly inspiration or a flash of brilliance think of the image of a light bulb over a cartoon character’s head when he has a great idea it could be a spiritual awakening or finally figuring out the solution to a problem the way is now clearly lit so you can move on heat heat can manifest in different forms as well if it’s uncomfortable then things are “heating up” for you in life and getting tough you may be in trouble if it’s pleasant and comforting the heat probably means things are going well and of course an intense heat can indicate sexual desire is increasing log in or register to post comments comments 1blkstyleon log in or register to post comments jul 28 2013
