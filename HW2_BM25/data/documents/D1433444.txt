recommended that you get tested regularly what is a pap smear a pap smear also called a pap test is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women it involves collecting cells from your vagina and cervix — the lower narrow end of your uterus thats at the top of your vagina the pap smear is usually done in conjunction with a pelvic exam in women 30 years of age or older the pap smear may be combined with a test for human papillomavirus hpv — a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancer in some women normal pap smear results if only normal cervical cells were discovered during your pap smear youre said to have a negative result you wont need any further treatment or testing until youre due for your next pap smear and pelvic exam abnormal pap smear results if abnormal or unusual cells were discovered during your pap smear youre said to have a positive result a positive result doesnt mean you have cervical cancer what a positive result means depends on the type of cells discovered in your test here are some terms your doctor might use and what your next course of action might be atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance ascusone abnormal result you may receive is called atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance also known as ascus squamous cells are thin and flat and grow on the surface of a healthy cervix in the case of ascus the pap smear reveals slightly abnormal squamous cells but the changes dont clearly suggest that precancerous cells are present in fact while an ascus pap smear result may sound alarming it is considered only mildly abnormal and is actually the most common abnormal pap smear result you can receive there may in fact be no immediate cervical cancer risk associated with your ascus pap smear result the most common causes of ascus pap smear results are noncancerous benign conditions such as infections or inflammation these conditions can cause cervical cells to appear abnormal eventually however most cells return to a normal appearance with time for some women an ascus result is due to changes in the cervical cells caused by hpv infection with the liquidbased pap smear test your doctor can reanalyze the sample to check for the presence of certain highrisk types of hpv virus — these highrisk hpv types are known to promote the development of cancers like cervical cancer if no highrisk viruses are present the abnormal cells found as a result of the test arent of great concern if worrisome viruses are present youll need further testing that being said in most cases these cervical changes do not progress to cervical cancer but do require further monitoring and possible treatment to prevent an increased risk of cervical cancer squamous intraepithelial lesion this term is used to indicate that the cells collected from the pap smear may be precancerous if the changes are low grade it means the size shape and other characteristics of the cells suggest that if a precancerous lesion is present its likely to be years away from becoming cancer if the changes are high grade theres a greater chance that the lesion may develop into cancer much sooner in this instance additional diagnostic testing is necessary atypical glandular cells glandular cells produce mucus and grow in the opening of your cervix and within your uterus atypical glandular cells may appear to be abnormal which raises a worry for the presence of precancer or cancer further testing is needed to determine the source of the abnormal cells and their significance squamous cell cancer or adenocarcinoma cells this result means the cells collected for the pap smear appear so abnormal that the pathologist is almost certain a cancer is present squamous cell cancer refers to cancers arising in the flat surface cells of the vagina or cervix adenocarcinoma refers to cancers arising in glandular cells if such cells are found your doctor will recommend a prompt evaluation followup after an abnormal pap smear followup depends on the type of abnormality seen sometimes only repeat testing is needed in other instances your doctor may perform a procedure called colposcopy using a special magnifying instrument colposcope to examine the tissues of the cervix vagina and vulva  your doctor also may take a tissue sample  biopsy from any areas that appear abnormal the tissue sample is then sent to a laboratory for analysis and a definitive diagnosis based on these results you may need treatment to remove any abnormal cells after treatment you will need to continue followup for cervical cancer screenings a word from verywell detecting cervical cancer early with a pap smear gives you a greater chance at a cure remain educated about your cervical health and keep up with your pap smears another tidbit is to remember not to have sex douche or use tampons or other vaginal hygiene products 48 hours prior to your pap smear test as these can give false results sources american
