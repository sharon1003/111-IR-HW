potentially treatable cause of considerable lifelong morbidity effective pharmacological treatments are scarce but one group of drugs that has shown promise is the antiepileptics gabapentin has become popular as a firstline treatment for neuropathic pain because of its efficacy as an antineuropathic agent and relatively benign sideeffect profile however its mechanism of action is far from clear this review discusses the available evidence for the postulated mechanisms of action of gabapentin understanding the mechanism of action of this agent may well lead to the development of safer and more effective antineuropathic drugs discover the worlds research14 million members100 million publications700k research projects join for free fulltext pdfavailable from kenneth baillie download

culture although gbp is well established as an effective antiepileptic and antineuropathic pain drug the underlying molecular mechanism of gbp is still not entirely clear 23 gbp does not interact with

treatment of epilepsy pain relief and especially neuropathic pain  1  results with human and rat brain nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy indicate that gabapentin increases gaba synthesis probably by modulating as it does invitro the action of the gaba synthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase and the glutamate synthesizing enzyme branchedchain amino acid transaminase 2  gabapentin
