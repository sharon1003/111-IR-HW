histoplasmosis are reported three of the patients are alive and in fair health five years three years and three months respectively after the diagnosis of the two diseases had been established the autopsy of the fourth case revealed destruction of the adrenal glands by caseation necrosis the necrotic material contained h capsulatum22 two of the four cases reported were first diagnosed as sarcoidosis on the basis of lymph node biopsy33 histoplasmosis should be considered as an etiologic agent in addisons disease as suggested by these cases and by a review of 103 cases of histoplasmosis in which 35 per cent of the cases were found to have adrenal involvement this is a higher incidence of adrenal involvement than in the other systemic mycoses previous article next article addisons disease associated with histoplasmosis report of four cases and review of the literature k r crispell m d william parson m d james hamlin m df and guy hollifield m d charlottesville virginia t is the purpose of this paper to report four cases of addisons disease occurring in pa tients with histoplasmosis and to stress the importance of considering this fungus disease as a possible etiologic agent in addisons disease rawson et al1 called attention to the fact that histoplasmosis may be a cause of adrenal insuf ficiency however no cases of adrenal insuffi ciency associated with histoplasmosis have been reported in which the patients have been treated and survived three of the four pa tients to be reported herein are alive and in fair health five years three years and three months respectively after the diagnosis of the two dis eases had been established one patient suc cumbed approximately twentytwo months after the diagnosis had been established case reports case i w s a fiftyfour year old white male who lived in virginia but had spent some time in missouri and panama was first admitted to the university of virginia hospital on may 6 1953 with a complaint of vomiting of six weeks duration he had noticed gradually increasing weakness and anorexia and had sustained a thirty to thirtyfive pound weight loss during the previous ten months six weeks prior to admis sion intermittent cramping abdominal pains developed and recurrent vomiting occurred physical examination revealed an asthénie white male with a temperature of 98°f and a blood pressure of 135 mm hg systolic and 70 diastolic there were several small healing ulcérations on the buccal mucosa the liver edge was palpable one fingerbreadth below the right costal margin moderate epigastric tenderness and guarding were present no significant lymphadenopathy or pigmentary changes were noted significant laboratory findings on admission included hemoglobin 14 gm per cent hemato crit 46 per cent white blood cells 9800 with 35 per cent lymphocytes 57 per cent neutrophils and 8 per cent eosinophils the urine was acid with a specific gravity of 1011  there was a trace of albumin no sugar or acetone a centri fuged specimen showed four to six white blood cells and two to four coarsely granular casts per highpowered field blood studies revealed a urea nitrogen of 80 mg per cent a fasting blood sugar of 80 mg per cent chlorides of 97 m eql sodium of 134 m eql potassium of 62 m eql and a carbon dioxide combining power of 239 m eql an electrocardiogram showed low voltage complexes the basal metabolic rate was minus 10 per cent the thorn test with intravenous acth was positive in that there was no fall in the eosinophil count the keplerpowerrobin son water test was positive the a factor being 62 urinary 17ketosteroids in two twentyfour hour specimens were 70 mg and 59 mg respectively skin tests with o t 110000 and histoplasmin were recorded as positive in twentyfour hours xravs of the chest gastro intestinal series barium enema and xrays of the gallbladder were negative a diagnosis of addisons disease was made and the patient was started on a regimen of oral cortisone 125 mg twice a day and na ci 1 gm three times a day he followed a course of general improvement throughout hospitalization k from department of internal medicine school of medicine university of virginia t now at the peter bent brigham hospital boston massachusetts january 1956 23 addisons disease and histoplasmosis—crispell et al he was seen again on august 17 1953 with recurrence of symptoms it was found at this time that he required desoxycorticosterone acetate as well as cortisone and added salt for adequate control of symptoms he was therefore given 30 mg of corticosteronetrimethylacetate intravenously and oral cortisone 125 mg twice a day he continued to improve on this regimen and remained well until june 28 1954 when he was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of painful ulcers on his lip and tongue examination of the mouth lesions revealed a 1 by 1 cm indurated ulcer 1 cm in depth on the vermilion border of the upper lip and a similar larger lesion on the left lateral aspect of the tongue biopsy of these lesions revealed organisms which morphologically were histo plasma capsulatum cultures of the mouth lesions and the urine revealed this organism a histoplasmin skin test was equivocal in forty eight hours xrays of the chest were unchanged from the previous admission at the suggestion of dr e c cawley of the department of dermatology the patient was given stilbamidine in daily doses of 50 mg the dose was gradually increased to 150 mg daily but symptoms of toxicity developed after a total dose of 825 mg then dihydroxystilbamidine was administered in a daily dose of 50 mg the dose was increased gradually to 150 mg daily for a total dose of 2025 mg there were no obvious signs of toxicity while he was receiving dihydroxystilbamidine the lesions in the mouth showed evidence of healing and became much less tender on a followup visit one month after discharge from the hospital the ulcers in the mouth had completely healed and there was no new evidence of histoplasmosis addisons dis ease remained well controlled on a program of oral cortisone and intramuscular desoxycorti costeronetrimethylacetate the patient remained in fair health until january 1955 when he had a recurrence of sore throat hoarseness and inability to swallow solids he was readmitted to the university of virginia hospital and examination revealed ulcération about the false vocal cords biopsy of these lesions again showed h capsulatum the patient was again treated with hydroxystilbamidine® with slight initial improvement but the lesions then  we wish to thank dr w g morson of william s merrell company for supplying the dihydroxystil bamidine gradually increased in size to involve the larynx and pharynx it was necessary to insert a levin tube in order to administer a liquid diet the patient was transferred to the clinical center at the national institute of health he died in acute renal failure three weeks after admission autopsy was obtained and the findings pertinent to this case history are as follows 1 sections of adrenal gland show almost complete destruction of adrenal tissue by extensive caseation surrounded by chronic granulomatous inflammation with a few epi thelioid tuberclelike lesions and occasional giant cells the caseous areas contain cellular debris and tiny fragments some of which contain organisms resembling h capsulatum 2 sec tions of the kidney show areas of chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction with caseous and noncaseous focal necrotic lesions containing a number of organisms resembling h capsulatum case ii f j t s a fortythree year old white male resident of mississippi was admitted to the foundation hospital in new orleans in august 1947 with a complaint of hoarseness of five months duration examination of the larynx by dr francis le jeune revealed a smooth infiltrating lesion of the left vocal cord sections of the lesion contained h capsulatum treatment with promin® 15 mg daily was followed by progressive improvement in the appearance of the vocal cord and gradual disappearance of the hoarseness he remained well until march 1948 when constipation epigastric burning and morning weakness developed one month later diarrhea nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain developed he was readmitted to the hospital examination revealed a blood pressure of 80 mm hg systolic and 50 diastolic and the typical pigmentary changes of addisons disease blood studies revealed a fasting blood sugar of 72 mg per cent chloride of 85 m eql and sodium of 104 m eql xray of the chest showed a small  sections of tissue and case history kindly furnished by dr horace bernton and dr john edgecomb of the national institute of health bethesda maryland t this case is reported by the kindness of dr albert segalof f ochsner clinic new orleans la the laryn geal lesion has been discussed by dr francis le jeune of the ochsner clinic new orleans la in a previous paper histoplasmosis—a deficiency disease by roberts a e and forman f s ann otol rhinol  laryng 59 809 1950 american journal of medicine addisons disease and histoplasmosis—crispell et al 25 heart with clear lung fields a keplerpower wilder test was positive examination of the larynx was completely negative the diagnosis of addisons disease was made and the patient was regulated on a regimen of doca and na cl he did well on this regimen until february 1950 when he was seen in the clinic on account of falling blood pressure for the past few months and fatigue in the morning his blood pressure was 85 systolic and 55 diastolic temperature was 1037°f at this time the patient was thought to be on the verge of an addisonian crisis and was treated with aqueous and lipoadrenal extract his disease was finally regulated with desoxycorticosterone acetate 2 mg intra muscularly oral cortisone 25 mg and na cl 2 gm daily the patient has continued to do well on this schedule with good control of addisons disease and no evidence of histo plasmosis when last seen in february 1954 case in a c a fortyfour year old white male high school instruction director who lived in virginia but had been stationed in memphis tennessee during world war n was admitted to the university of virginia hospital on july 11 1951 complaining of a sore throat of two months duration the patient was apparently in good health until november 1946 when he had the onset of cough and fever and was thought to have had virus pneumonia he continued to have residual pneumonitis by xray examination fol lowing his recovery from this illness after repeated examinations including biopsy of a posterior cervical lesion a diagnosis of sarcoid was made treatment during this period was mainly supportive the patient made quite a rapid improvement and remained in good health until may 1951 when another episode of virus pneumonia occurred after recovery from the acute phase of this episode dysphagia developed which failed to respond to local therapy increasing weakness a twentyfive pound weight loss and a nocturnal fever of ioo°f were noted in june 1951 a lesion which had appeared on the epiglottis was biopsied and reported as histoplasmosis the patient was referred to the university of virginia hospital for further treatment physical examination on admission revealed an obviously malnourished debilitated middle aged white man in no acute distress blood pressure was 110 mm hg systolic and 70 diastolic there were two small grayish brown january 1956 excoriated areas with thick scabs on the parieto occipital area of the scalp and two similar lesions on the face in the region of the alae no significant lymphadenopathy was noted in direct laryngoscopy revealed the epiglottis to be moderately thickened with a pink irregular granulomatous lesion on the superior rim and extending about 2 cm down the posterior surface significant laboratory findings included he moglobin 15 gm per cent red blood cells 456 million white blood cells 7300 blood urea 55 mg per cent chloride 81 m eq and coz combining power 23 m eql the urine was acid with a specific gravity of 1020 micro scopic examination revealed two white blood cells no red blood cells numerous hyaline and a few granular casts the histoplasmin skin test was negative in a dilution of 110000 although the complement fixation test for histoplasmosis was positive in a dilution of 12048 xray of the chest revealed a slight old pleural reaction in the right base a biopsy of one of the posterior scalp lesions was interpreted as histoplasmosis of the skin treatment with a 40 per cent solution of ethyl vanillate was started on july 25 1951 on august 1st the patient went suddenly into acute addison crisis manifested by a shocklike state unobtainable blood pressure a serum chloride of 81 m eql and a coa combining power of 14 m eql treatment with adrenal cortical extract whole blood and glucose in physiologic saline produced a remission and within twenty four hours it was possible to maintain the patient on a regimen of doca and cortisone subse quently the doca was discontinued and the symptoms were well controlled on 20 mg of cortisone daily the patient was transferred to the veterans administration hospital roanoke virginia on august 13 1951 recurrence of symptoms of addisonian crisis occurred on august 25th and again on september 16th responding each time to appropriate therapy continued treatment of the histoplasmosis with ethyl vanillate gave generally satisfactory results and gradual healing took place in all the cutaneous lesions the lesion of the epiglottis failed to respond to this therapy this lesion was treated with propamidine and varidase® sprays and a marked diminution in the size of the epiglottic granuloma occurred on discharge from the hospital on march 6 1952 26 addisons disease and histoplasmosis—crispell et al the patient showed no visible evidence of histoplasmosis  he has been followed at sixmonth intervals and his condition has remained unchanged addisons disease is well controlled by two linguets of doca and 25 mg of oral cortisone daily case iv d h g a fortyfive year old white farmer was admitted to the local tuberculosis sanatorium on march 4 1955 four months prior to admission listlessness weakness and malaise developed and the patient noted a low grade afternoon fever with sweating but no chills a severe nonproductive cough developed and a fifteen pound weight loss was sustained during the two months prior to hospitalization there had been no preceding febrile illness or cough the patient had spent most of his life in the farming area of virginia except for a short visit to nashville tennessee in 1949 physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 13090 a few scattered raies were present at the apex of the left lung anteri orly and over the left midlung posteriorly a grade m systolic murmur was noted along the left sternal border and auricular fibrillation was present with a pulse rate of 100 single small left axillary and right inguinal nodes and a small subcutaneous epigastric nodule were palpable the liver and spleen were palpable smooth and nontender bilateral inguinal hernias were present laboratory data revealed normal blood counts and urinalysis negative spinal fluid and smears of concentrated sputum specimens were negative for acidfast bacilli tuberculin skin tests and blood agglutinations for typhoid para typhoid brucellosis and tularemia were nega tive xray of the chest showed miliary calcifica tions consistent with healed histoplasmosis on march 21 1955 the patient was trans ferred to the university of virginia hospital physical examination at this time was essentially unchanged except that vitiligo interspersed with moderate pigmentation was noted on the wrists elbows lower abdomen scrotum and dorsum of the penis  dr robert scott kindly supplied this portion of the history and has previously reported some aspects of this case treatment of progressive histoplasmosis with ethyl vanillate and propamidine by ellis f f scott r j and miller j m antibiotics  chemother 2 347 1952 admission laboratory findings included hema tocrit 52 per cent white blood cells 6200 with sixtyfour per cent neutrophils 31 per cent lymphocytes 4 per cent monocytes and 1 per cent eosinophils fasting blood sugar 110 mg per cent blood urea 37 mg per cent total serum protein 71 gm per cent with albumin 41 and globulin 30 cephalin flocculation 4 plus thymol turbidity 194 units and 14 per cent bsp retention in fortyfive minutes the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 39 mm in one hour bray skin tests for histoplasmosis coccidioidomy cosis and blastomycosis were negative ag glutinations for histoplasmosis and coccidioido mycosis were negative nine blood cultures showed no growth a bone marrow biopsy revealed slight normo blastic hyperplasia biopsy of the inguinal node showed granulomatous changes compatible with sarcoidosis on april 15 1955 exploratory laparotomy was performed to obtain biopsies of the liver and abdominal lymph nodes these showed granu lomatous lesions containing giant cells but no evidence of necrosis and special staining technics failed to reveal fungi or acidfast organisms the patients postoperative course was un eventful until eighteen hours following surgery when acute adrenal insufficiency suddenly developed as evidenced by confusion lethargy temperature 104°f blood pressure 6040 serum sodium 110 m eql serum potassium 487 m eql and blood urea 62 mg per cent intravenous hydrocortisone with 5 per cent glucose in physiologic saline produced a prompt response with clearing of the sensorium rise in blood pressure and a fall in temperature to normal levels the blood pressure was stabilized and normal serum electrolyte values were maintained on 375 mg of cortisone daily by mouth in retrospect this man had adrenal insufficiency before he was operated upon as the serum sodium was 120 m eql serum potas sium 65 m eql blood urea nitrogen 57 mg per cent and serum chlorides 89 m eql it was not recognized until the stress of surgery precipitated acute adrenal insufficiency

these cases the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was not proved by laboratory tests of adrenal function of cases of adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral tuberculous necrosis of the adrenals in early reports tuberculosis is given as the cause in 70 to 90 per cent of the cases of addisons disease2 tuberculosis is now reported to be responsible for about 50 per cent of the cases3 with a reduc tion in the number of cases of addisons disease due to tuberculosis the systemic fungus infec tions should be considered more carefully as an etiologic agent in all cases of adrenal insufficiency in this country the vast majority of cases of histoplasmosis occur in the central mississippi valley6 in the cases reported herein all of the patients had been in this area sometime prior to the onset of their illness three of the patients a c w s and d g had lived most of their lives in virginia but had been in the mississippi valley area at some time while the other pa tient j t s lived in mississippi a history of having been in the mississippi valley area in any person with addisons disease should raise the suspicion of histoplasmosis as the etiologic agent also of interest is a recent report stating that h capsulatum was isolated from twentytwo of fifty cats and from twentytwo of fifty dogs obtained from loudoun county virginia17 one patient d g lives in this county and w s was from an adjoining county although at autopsy the adrenal glands are among the most frequently involved organs in cases of histoplasmosis case reports of addisons disease due to this organism which have been january 1956 recognized ante mortem are relatively rare table i rawson et al1 reported one case and were able to find reports of eight other cases published prior to 1948 odonnell reported a case with massive caseous necrosis of both adrenals due to histoplasmosis which was diagnosed as addisons disease after necropsy3 in a review of all the cases of histoplasmosis at the mayo clinic vivian et al reported adrenal involvement in six of twenty cases4 there was clinical evidence of addisons disease in two of these cases parsons and zarafonetis reported three cases of patients with extensive caseous necrosis of the adrenals and in the cases re viewed found adrenal involvement in eighteen of seventyone5 the diagnosis of histoplasmosis is established by isolation of the organism by culture or demonstration of the organism in infected tissue histoplasmin skin tests and complement fixation tests may be useful aids in diagnosis in some cases but the results with these tests are variable and are frequently difficult to interpret due to cross reactions campbell and binkley in a study of thirtyseven cases proved by culture reported four different antibody patterns in histoplas mosis7 in ten cases of generalized histoplasmosis associated with severe endocrinopathy there were consistently low complement fixation titers and titers were also negligible in the sera of patients showing only cutaneous or mucocutane ous lesions in our cases the diagnosis of addisons disease 28 addisons disease and histoplasmosis—crispell et al was made prior to the diagnosis of histoplas mosis in one instance and after the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in two it should be noted from case in that addisonian crisis occurred suddenly without any previous overt signs of adrenal insufficiency this danger should be recognized and watched for in any patient with histo plasmosis it is also to be noted that two of our patients a c and d g were diagnosed as having had sarcoidosis before the diagnosis of histoplasmosis was established the possible confusion of histoplasmosis with sarcoidosis has been previously emphasized1820 it will be noted that each patient received a different form of treatment for the systemic histoplasmosis including ethyl vanillate hy droxystilbamidine and promin the drug therapy may have had very little to do with the course of the disease since the three very dif ferent drugs all seemed to be effective initially patient w s had what appeared to be a clinical response to hydroxystilbamidine but recurrent pharyngeal lesions did not respond to a second course of this therapy it may be proper to try hydroxystilbamidine until a specific treatment for systemic mycoses is available the treatment of hypoadrenalism in these cases does not differ from the treatment of addisons disease due to other causes as would be expected there has been no amelioration of addisons disease associated with apparent quiescence of the histoplasmosis the incidence of adrenal involvement at autopsy is not as frequent in other systemic mycoses as in histoplasmosis martin and smith8 reported adrenal involvement in two of sixty proved cases of blastomycosis kunkel et al9 also found only two cases of adrenal involvement in ninety cases of blastomycosis seen at the mayo clinic cryptococcosis may involve the adrenals and rawson and coworkers1 were able to find a total of six cases coccidioido mycosis with adrenal involvement occurred sixteen times in ninetyfive cases reported by forbus and besterbreurtje10 summary 1 four cases of addisons disease associated
