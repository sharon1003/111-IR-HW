endometriosis is the abnormal growth of cells endometrial cells similar to those that form the lining tissue of the uterus but in a location outside of the uterus the lining of the uterus is known as the endometrium endometriosis is most commonly found in or on other organs of the pelvis such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes in most cases of endometriosis it does not cause noticeable symptoms or signs in other cases it can cause problems and severe symptoms for women who do get symptoms of endometriosis these can include pelvic pain that may be worse during the menstrual period painful sex pain with bowel movements or painful urination the symptoms of endometriosis are all typically worse during the menstrual period infertility is a known complication of endometriosis causes of endometriosis the cause of endometriosis is unknown there are several theories about its cause one theory is that the endometrial tissue is deposited in unusual locations by the process of retrograde menstruation in which the backward flow of menstrual debris spreads through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic and abdominal cavities another theory is that tissues lining the pelvic organs possess primitive cells that are able to develop into endometrium the direct transfer of endometrial tissues at the time of surgery may be responsible for the endometriosis implants occasionally found in surgical scars for example episiotomy or cesarean section scars transfer of endometrial cells via the bloodstream or lymphatic system is another possible explanation and may explain the rare cases of endometriosis that are found in the brain and other organs remote from the pelvis lastly there is evidence that some women with endometriosis have an abnormal immune response that may contribute to development of the condition reference kasper d l et al eds harrisons principles of internal medicine 19th ed united states mc grawhill education 2015 medically reviewed by a doctor on 1292018symptom checker health concerns on your mind click here to visit our symptom checker main article on endometriosis symptoms and signs endometriosis endometriosis implants are most commonly found on the ovaries the fallopian tubes outer surfaces of the uterus or intestines endometriosis slideshow pictures take the endometriosis quizpelvic pain pictures slideshow pictures images illustrations  quizzes endometriosis quiz test your medical iqendometriosis is a common gynecological condition take this quiz to learn what happens when a woman has endometriosis as well as endometriosis symptoms stages treatment what is endometriosis endometriosis is an abnormal growth of endometrial cells like those found in a womans uterus learn about endometriosis slideshow pictures take the endometriosis quizpelvic pain pictures slideshow endometriosis symptoms and signs abdominal cramping bleeding between periods menometrorrhagiaheavy bleeding during periods menorrhagiainability to get pregnant conceiveinfertility low back pain lower abdominal pain pain during sex pain with bowel movements pain with pelvic examinations painful periods  dysmenorrheapainful urination pelvic pain rectal pain vaginal pain examples of medications for endometriosis symptoms and signsanastrozole arimidexbirth control pills list of oral contraceptives and side effectsdanazol  oral danocrinegoserelin  implant zoladexibuprofen advil childrens advilmotrin medipren motrin nuprin pedia care fever and othersletrozole femaraleuprolide lupron lupron depot lupron depotped eligardmedroxyprogesterone provera depoprovera deposub q provera 104naproxen aleve anaprox naprelan naprosynsymptoms  signs az list a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y zsubscribe to medicine nets womens health newsletter by clicking submit i agree to the medicine nets terms  conditions  privacy policy and understand that i may opt out of medicine nets subscriptions at any time from womens health resources5 lifesaving tests every woman needs are we close to a cure for cancer9 questions to ask before having surgery featured centers how could you live better with migraine not being defined by your cancer track cold  flu in your area health solutions from our sponsors frequent constipation greater food accessibility popular collections beware of deadly bug bites  stings recognize these common eye conditions natural cold  flu remedies managing blood sugar swings cholesterol what the numbers mean omega3 foods for a stronger heart lowt and erectile dysfunction joint friendly exercises the most effective birth control lung cancer stages  treatments migraine triggers you can avoid why heart attacks happen foods to help you concentrate your cancer questions answered stop wrecking your teeth the dangers of blood clots learn more about eating disorders surgery or medication for crohns
