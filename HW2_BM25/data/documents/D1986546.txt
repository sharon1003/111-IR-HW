september 1 2015 1015 am ending support for the rc4 cipher in microsoft edge and internet explorer 11by microsoft edge team share tweet share share skype today microsoft is announcing the endofsupport of the rc4 cipher in microsoft edge and internet explorer 11 starting in early 2016 the rc4 cipher will be disabled bydefault and will not be used during tls fallback negotiations there is consensus across the industry that rc4 is no longer cryptographically secure our announcement aligns with today’s announcements from google and mozilla who are ending support for rc4 in chrome and firefox what is rc4 rc4 is a stream cipher that was first described in 1987 and has been widely supported across web browsers and online services modern attacks have demonstrated that rc4 can be broken within hours or days the typical attacks on rc4 exploit biases in the rc4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted plaintexts in february 2015 these new attacks prompted the internet engineering task force to prohibit the use of rc4 with tls microsoft edge and internet explorer 11 only utilize rc4 during a fallback from tls 12 or 11 to tls 10 a fallback to tls 10 with rc4 is most often the result of an innocent error but this is indistinguishable from a maninthemiddle attack for this reason rc4 will be entirely disabled by default for all microsoft edge and internet explorer users on windows 7 windows 81 and windows 10 starting in early 2016 how can i prepare we expect that most users will not notice this change the percentage of insecure web services that support only rc4 is known to be small and shrinking if your web service relies on rc4 you will need to take action since 2013 microsoft has recommended that customers enable tls 12 in their services and remove support for rc4 for

browser from chrome  opera  uc browser  safari – automatic bing translation on lumia  pc  can’t able to download files more then 1gb from mega cloud storage  it says you need more modern efficient browser to download  i am downloading files  if i press clear all browsing – it will turn current downloading into partial and stopped  but in all modern browser  it only clear previously download and current downloading will continue right click on favorite bookmark to create new folder and right click on new folder to rename and create subfolder right click on favorite bookmark to rename bookmark ability to move bookmark from one folder to another please – these are available in all well developed modern browser3 years ago aakash sharmaand also files downloading don’t show  net speed  total file size and currently mbgb downloaded from it but available in all big brand browser3 years ago kyle pflug hi aakashthanks for your input the best place for feature requests like the above is the send feedback tool in the browser or the microsoft edge uservoice page here httpswindowsuservoicecomforums285214microsoftedge this blog is focused on the developer audience and the web platform so it generally isn’t the place to discuss client app features like those listed above3 years ago mike gale thanks guys i was looking at a hand crafted crypto suite list for schannel yesterday and noticed that the rc4’s put in there involuntarily had been removed guess that was an update i’d prefer a polite notification but good to see them gone we might look back in a few years and shake our heads at those ecdhe’s too3 years ago me gustaaakash sharma the thing with mega isn’t really just edge the site tries to get you to use a plugin to download files larger than 1gb but since edge doesn’t yet have a plugin model it assumes that it is ie that is viewing the page and comes up with that if you look it also says that it detected you using ie the edge team has already announced that a plugin model will become available at some point i think it was something like around the first or second big windows 10 rollup so for that it is just a matter of waiting if you want the feedback to be received more efficiently the browser itself does have a send feedback option this would be better than posting in comments on a blog3 years ago x  thanks guys happy that rc4 is finally going away do have concern over google’s announcement at “httpgoogleonlinesecurityblogspotsg201509disablingsslv3andrc4html” under “minimum standards for tls clients” clients are expected to support tlsecdhersawithaes128gcmsha256 cipher this is ok for windows 10 however ie on win 78 and server 20082012 do not support this cipher so how do we connect to google gmail or you tube make google api calls for desktop clients we can install another browser though we prefer ie but what about  net applications that use the same schannel protocol any plans to add tlsecdhersawithaes128gcmsha256 cipher support to win 78 and server 20082012
