such treatment they require a doctors attention and systemic treatment with prescription antifungal medications candidiasis candida yeast infections are diagnosed by staining specimens of sputum or urine or scrapings from the skin or the lining of the mouth or vagina and by examining them under a microscope people with vaginal yeast infections can be effectively treated with medications occasionally repeated courses of treatment may be required how do people prevent superficial fungal infections preventing superficial fungal infections is difficult because people are continually exposed to fungi keeping the skin dry and clean is probably helpful what are systemic fungal infections some fungi are normally present in the body kept under control by the bodys immune system if the immune system is abnormally weak however the fungi can grow out of control and cause illnesses these are termed opportunistic infections among the most common opportunistic fungal infections that affect people arecandidiasisaspergillosisphycomycosiscryptococcosis the trichophyton fungus photographed under an electron microscope at more than 4000 times its original size causes ringworm of the scalp tinea capitis the fungus is reproducing by flowering Â© oliver meckesphoto researchers inc people with aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome people with leukemia cancer of the blood cells and people with hodgkins disease or other kinds of lymphoma cancer of the immune system are at risk for opportunistic fungal infections because their immune systems have been weakened such infections may also occur in people who are receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy or who are taking corticosteroids  or immunosupressant  drugs such as the drugs a person takes after an organ transplant  corticosteroid kortikosteeroids are medications that are prescribed to reduce inflammation and sometimes to suppress the bodys immune responses  immunosuppressants imyoonosupresants are substances that weaken the bodys immune system people who have received prolonged courses of antibiotics for treatment of serious bacterial infections are also at risk for fungal infections other fungi cause illnesses even in otherwise healthy people with normal immune systems in these cases people inhale the spores immature form of fungi that normally live in the environment especially the soil in certain geographical areas examples include histoplasmosis histoplazmosis occurs in the united states in the east and midwest in mexico and in central america the fungus that causes it often grows on chicken droppings and bat guano coccidioidomycosis koksideoidomykosis or valley fever is found in the southwestern united states north american blastomycosis blastomykosis is found throughout north america and outbreaks recently have been reported in africa as well south american blastomycosis which is caused by a different fungus is seen in south and central america what are the symptoms of systemic fungal infections systemic fungal infections often are chronic  and develop slowly taking weeks or months to become a problem symptoms are sometimes similar to those of the common cold but sometimes especially in people with weakened immune systems symptoms may be sudden and severe requiring hospitalization symptoms may include cough fever chills night sweats anorexia loss of appetite weight loss general fatigue and depression if the infection spreads from the lungs to other organs it may be particularly severe especially if the patient has a weakened immune system for example cryptococcosis kriptokokosis may lead to meningitis meninjytis which causes inflammation and swelling of the lining around the brain and spinal cord how do doctors diagnose and treat systemic fungal infections diagnosis diagnosing and treating systemic fungal infections can be a challenge for a doctor many of the symptoms are mild and vary greatly from person to person blood or skin tests exist for only a few of these infections and often are inconclusive or fail to find a fungus that really is there a result called a false negative chest xrays may show abnormalities in the lungs as fuzzy white spots on the black xray film but the spots do not identify the specific cause a diagnosis of systemic fungal infection usually is confirmed when a fungus is cultured or grown in a laboratory dish from a sample of the patients sputum bone marrow urine blood cerebrospinal serebrospynel fluid or other tissue  chronic kronik means continuing for a long period of time treatment treatment varies depending on which fungus is causing the condition and how severe the symptoms are doctors usually prescribe antifungal medications with drug therapy sometimes continuing for several weeks in some cases particularly if the immune system is weak drug treatment may fail or the doctor may recommend surgery to remove infected tissues see also athletes foot immunodeficiency ringworm yeast
