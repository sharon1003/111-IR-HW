tweet share email share share pin it share comment advertising xmajor blockbuster franchises like the avengers and the hunger games help keep hollywood studios afloat hence the term “tentpole” but awards season is just as much a part of the industry’s dna as the bigbudget blockbuster release schedule every year millions of people tune into the oscar telecast and spend the months leading up to the ceremony discussing what films are worthy of a win however the academy awards have been hit with the stigma that they are “out of touch” with the taste of the modern moviegoer to the organization’s credit they have worked on bucking that notion in the past couple of years as best picture nominees like argo silver linings playbook gravity and the wolf of wall street among others proved to be commercially viable as well as garnering critical acclaim however in 2014 the bad reputation has reared its ugly head once again a number of the films that are currently touted as the ones in consideration – including whiplash foxcatcher and the imitation game – are playing only in a limited theatrical release meaning that unless you live in one of the select markets certain viewers won’t be able to see them until they hit home media several months after their initial debut‘the imitation game’advertising xwhy is this a problem for starters it limits the number of cinephiles who can see a given movie after it is released and during awards season film buffs are interested in any and all titles that come with the phrase “for your consideration” in the case of the oscars if a majority of the population have not seen and discussed the movies that have been nominated it makes drawing people into the oscar race that much harder but that’s only the surface of this issue limited theatrical release is an antiquated practice that just doesn’t vibe with the landscape of modern society before the age of twitter and facebook these “smaller” films relied on the strategy to generate interest written reviews by nationally recognized critics would help spread the word about a film’s artistic merits and the per theater average at the box office would give studios an idea as to how successful their movie would be with the moviegoing public based on the response they’d either keep it in limited or expand it j k simmons in ‘whiplash’advertising xnowadays however the way wordofmouth spreads has changed drastically moments after the first press screening social media can be a powerful tool in determining the widespread interest of a particular release critics have the ability to share their thoughts with the world immediately after seeing a film – and coupled with the presence of trailers on the internet it leads to certain oscarbuzzed works being in high demand within a short period of time only many people still can’t see the films even when the interest has been generated one quick look on twitter can show studio executives that a considerable audience would like to see their film so the question of response isn’t up for debate that said theater distribution costs can run extremely high and there’s no guarantee that a smaller flick is going to crack the mainstream in a way that would warrant such an expense luckily there is an option out there that would be beneficial for all parties involved on demand rentals–the on demand solution advertising xearlier this year the scifi film snowpiercer was released to great acclaim despite making just 45 million in 356 theaters it still became one of the most talkedabout films of the summer the reasoning for that was because the weinstein company decided to distribute the movie to on demand services just a few weeks after its initial theatrical debut in the first two weeks of the on demand experiment snowpiercer pulled in 38 million illustrating that this is a model worth pursuing by taking advantage of the modern technologies available to them the studio’s move produced a twofold positive effect not only were they able to make more money on their investment but also more movie fans were able to see the film and spread the word about it to their friends getting to enjoy a new film from the comfort of your own home is a luxury we all dream of – with increasing frequency these days oscars 2015 contender ‘whiplash’the one issue with making the on demand or even i tunes rental simultaneous release more widespread would be the threat of upsetting theater owners who are not pleased with the notion of their institution being cut out that said the numbers show that they wouldn’t exactly be missing out on a goldmine should indie or ‘awardsbait’ films skip the movie houses whiplash has been out in theaters since october 10 and has made a grand total of 39 million in those eight weeks meanwhile as talk about the movie surges in critics voting circles around this time how many cinephiles are still unable to actually see what all the talk is about it’s not out of the question to envision on demand leading to prosperous results for other limited release titles from this year again these are movies that have received plenty of attention on the awards circuit and we’re willing to wager that a cinephile or two would be more than happy to pay a surcharge in order to see what all the fuss is about if snowpiercer was able to bring in millions best picture hopefuls could easily make just as much if not more obviously this wouldn’t need to apply to every single awards contender that hits the screen during the season certain projects enter theaters with a healthy dose of mainstream appeal  gone girl unbroken that make it easy to justify a nationwide release in thousands of theaters however not all oscar titles will be able to achieve that crossover status so using on demand to get the films in front of more people would be a smart and convenient way to include more viewers in the awards race discussion it just makes sense oscar isaac and jessica chastain in ‘a most violent year’the limited release problem is one that won’t be going away anytime soon on december 31 a most violent year which is another film looked at by many as a legitimate awards contender will screen in theaters in new york and los angeles only they say an expansion is planned in january but as the “expansions” of other movies this year have shown that doesn’t necessarily mean “nationwide”as we progress towards oscar night hollywood studios need to take a good hard look at this dilemma and figure out what they can do to make these indemand films available to as many as possible fortunately there’s a solution right in front of them the onus is on sony classics fox searchlight and others to embrace 21st century viewing habits and make synchronized limited theatrical releases and on demand premieres a major part of the industry follow chris on twitter  chris agar90 advertising xtags a most violent year foxcatcher oscars snowpiercer
