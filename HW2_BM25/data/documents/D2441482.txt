q can you lock the menu bar hi all i am using i web to create a website and so far am really pleased with what it can do however i would like to be able to lock the menu bar so that it always stays at the top of the screen and the rest of the page scrolls up underneath it or alongside it if i put the menu bar on the left the idea is that no matter where the reader is on the page they will always have access to the menu buttons i remember doing this on another program back in the bad old windows days i think it might have been locking panes or similar can this be done in i web thanks in advance for your help mike macbook pro mac os x 1057posted on feb 10 2010 632 amreply i have this question too 4
