us military careers joining the military what to expect on your first visit to mepsshare flip pin share email•••by rod powers updated june 23 2017joining the military requires two or more trips to the military entrance processing station meps at a very minimum you make a trip to meps for initial processing then the second trip to meps for final processing on the day you ship out to basic training this article will focus on the average first trip to meps meps is a department of defense jointservice organization staffed with military and civilians their job is to determine an applicants physical qualifications aptitude and moral standards as set by each branch of military service the department of defense and federal law there are 65 meps facilities located throughout the united states prescreening your trip to meps begins before you leave with a medical prescreening performed by your recruiter in performing this medical prescreening your recruiter will help you complete dd department of defense form 28072medical prescreen of medical history report the recruiter sends the results of this screening to meps in advance to be reviewed by meps medical personnel if the prescreening shows a medical condition which is obviously disqualifying with no chance of a waiver example you are blind or missing a limb then your processing stops at that point some medical conditions require additional medical records the prescreening is designed to identify those conditions so that your recruiter can help you obtain required medical records before your trip to meps this saves you from being temporarily disqualified requiring that you return later with the necessary records for full qualification while not allinclusive medical conditions which usually require medical reports documentation from the physician hospital etc are almost any surgery other than an uncomplicated appendectomy or hernia repair or ligation of tubes male or female absolutely any surgery of the brain back spinal cord chest upper abdomen pelvis and joints a tissue report is required in the case of most biopsies skin breast etc of tumors and lumps any history of hospitalization

mild acne and athletes foot allergies if more than mild back sprains addadhdsevere joint sprains heart conditions hepatitis mononucleosis the most useful medical records are the hospital records generally they are the most easily obtained of better quality and are kept available for a longer time generally the information needed is discharge summary surgeons report pathologists report history and physical xray and laboratory report most doctors letters are inadequate recruiters have been instructed to use the standard meps request form as it lists the required information all too many civilian doctors are unaware of current directives have no concept of what military training and duty is like and will be strongly biased in favor of the applicant meps is aware of this and may require that a consult is performed with one of their specialists military or contract getting ready for the trip once meps has given the recruiter the okay on the prescreening the recruiter will schedule your visit to meps here are some general rules to remember that apply to your visit discuss any childhood medical problems with your parents and bring documentation with you bring your social security card birth certificate and drivers license remove earrings they obstruct the headset used for the hearing test profanity and offensive wording or pictures on clothing are not tolerated hats are not permitted inside the meps if you wear either eyeglasses or contacts bring them along with your prescription and lens case bathe or shower the night before your examination wear underclothes get a good nights sleep before taking the catasvab wear neat moderate comfortable clothing dont bring stereo headphones watches jewelry excessive cash or any other valuables processing starts early at the meps  you must report on time arrival at mepsfor most applicants the initial trip to meps is a twoday process on the afternoon of arrival the applicant takes the computerized asvab test if youve already taken the asvab before your meps trip and received qualifying scores and the asvab test is less than 24 months old you wont be required to retest if you do test at meps exactly when youll see your asvab scores is dependent upon the meps when my daughters processed at the omaha meps they received their scores immediately after the test ive been told that other meps dont give access to the scores until the next day after medical processing once youve completed the asvab if you do not live in the same local area where your meps is located you will be taken to a contract hotel generally you will be assigned a roommate the lodging accommodations and meals are paid for by meps you will pay only for extras such as telephone calls inroom movies inroom internet access etc if available meps arranges contracts with motelhotels which are in the immediate vicinity of the meps this means accommodations vary from location to location ive visited some facilities where the motel accommodations were not the best discount motel6 type and other meps where the accommodations are truly outstanding 4star rating when you check into the motelhotel you will be instructed to sign receipt of a list of rules while this varies locationtolocation the rules include prohibitions for the use of alcoholdrugs curfew provisions noise restrictions etc in general it shouldnt be anything you cant live with youll have much tougher restrictions in boot camp  you should know that if you get caught violating any of these rules it could terminate your processing in the military your wakeup call the next morning will come very early usually about 0445 youll have scant time to dress eat and be at the designated location for the shuttle back to meps the entire morning is usually scheduled for a medical examination it is a hurry up  wait situation youll spend a lot of time waiting your turn i suggest bringing a book or magazine the evaluation the primary job of meps is to determine under military regulations policies and federal law whether or not you are qualified to serve in the united states armed forces and  if so what jobs you may qualify for under individual service regulations the first step in that process of course is obviously the asvab the asvab indicates whether or not you meet the basic general aptitude standards to join the military and  if so what jobs you qualify for under the standards set by the specific branch youre joining see enlisted job qualifications  meps personnel also determine whether you are medically qualified to serve additionally representatives of the service branch youre joining will be at meps to determine your job qualification and security qualifications while these individuals work at the meps location they are not part of meps they are assigned to the individual service recruiting activities so while the person giving you your asvab test and medical physical are assigned to meps and work jointly for all the services the people doing your enlistment contracts job selections and security qualifications are not assigned to meps and are representing only their individual services its very important that you are completely honest during your visit to meps if anyone including your recruiter has advised you to lie or withhold required information and you heed that advice it can have dire consequences later at most meps locations one of the very first things youll do when you arrive in the morning is to take a breathalyzer test to ensure that you are not currently under the influence of alcohol any trace of alcohol in your system at all will stop your processing onthespot the medical evaluation the physical begins with the completion of the medical questionaire dd form 28071  report of medical history it is an abbreviated form of the medical prescreening form that you completed in the recruiters office youre required to answer yes or no in answer to questions about whether you have ever had any of the medical conditions listed note that there is no i dont know on this form youve either had the condition ie diagnosed by a medical professional or you havent had the condition every item marked yes must be fully explained in the remarks section of the form if there are discrepancies between answers on this form and the answers you gave on the medical prescreening form your enlistment process will most likely stop and youll be returned to your recruiter to obtain additional medical records and information it is why it is very important to make sure that youre completely honest on both forms after completing the medical questionaire youll start the process you will take a blood and urine test including a test for drugs females will be tested for pregnancy your blood will be tested for hiv hemoglobin hematocrit rpr and alcohol there are also two different urine tests one is the legal drug urine and the other tests for p h blood protein and specific gravity youll take a hearing test and an eye exam including depth perception and color vision note lack of depth perception  color vision is not a disqualifying factor for military service but many military jobs require normal

prescribed training and subsequent military duty will the condition constitute an undue hazard to the examine or to others particularly under combat conditions if a waiver is required it is initiated and processed by the service you are trying to join not the meps whether or not a waiver will be approved and how long it takes for approvaldisapproval varies greatly each and every waiver is considered individually and approvaldisapproval depends on many individual factors including the recommendation of the medical profile officer and the current requirementsneeds of that particular military service expect the above medical examination process to take up most if not all of the morning job selection at this stage you work with your service counselorliaison to select a military job depending on the needs and wants of the service and your desires this can be a very short or long process keep in mind that not everyone gets a guaranteed job at this point it depends on the needs and general policies of the service for details on the job selection process see what the recruiter never told you preenlistment interview once you have selected a job the service counselor will complete their required paperwork and bring you and your paperwork to the meps control desk to initiate the enlistment processing at this time you will undergo a preenlistment interview pei during the pei the meps military processing clerk mpc sits with you “oneonone” and in private the mpc will fingerprint you and ask you questions concerning possible law violations drugalcohol abuse and other issues that may affect your entry into the armed forces also the mpc will brief you on the uniform code of military justice ucmj fraudulent enlistment policy and restrictions on personal conduct while in the delayed enlistment program dep during the pei if you have an additional disclosure a potentially disqualifying item not already reported it must be resolved before further processing continues once the pei is completed the mpc prepares your enlistment contract for you to review and sign with your service counselor if you need any additional testing for your job choice example the defense language aptitude battery  it will normally be done at this time special note some meps only give the dlab on certain day s of the week if you are primarily interested in a language aptitude job you may wish to check with your recruiter to ensure heshe schedules your meps trip for one of these days it may save you from having to make an extra trip to meps enlistment oath ceremony after you and your service counselor sign the contract you will return with the contract to the meps control desk for the oath of enlistment ceremony at designated times throughout the day control desk personnel or an mpc will take applicants with completed contracts to the meps ceremony room to prepare them for the oath of enlistment ceremony meps personnel will teach you to stand at “attention” and review with you the oath of enlistment also they will ask you if you have any questions pertaining to the ucmj fraudulent enlistment policy and the do d separation policy once youve been prepared a commissioned officer will be notified to report to the ceremony room to conduct the oath of enlistment during this time the officer may ask you some questions how you perceived the service and meals heshe received at the meps noon meal facility or at the hotel whether youve been briefed on the ucmj etc once the officer has determined that the applicant is ready to “swearin” heshe will administer the oath of enlistment and sign with you in the appropriate blocks of the enlistment contract contract signing will be performed in another room from the ceremony room it signifies your entry into the dep if you have family friends or your recruiter present at the ceremony they will be allowed to take pictures if dont want the ceremony interrupted by picturetaking there is usually no objection to staging a
