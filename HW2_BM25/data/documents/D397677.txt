airways economy class in boeing 777 and 787 is truly appalling the 787 aircraft is in no way a “dreamliner” as boeing infers and the 777 is just as bad they hae very poor legroom the seats are uncomfortable and very narrow meaning no elbow room even for me i am 5ft 6ins the food tray is far too small has no lip to stop tray from sliding and impossible to eat off if passenger in front has his seat reclined the 787 cabin is poorly finished and feels cramped with it’s terrible 333 seating arrangement and the 777 is worse with it’s 343 seating 787 was designed for 242 and the lack of seating width makes for a very unpleasant experience the 77 was designed for 333 it is quite clear that noone from the qatar senior management team has ever flown in economy class why anyone would want to fly in these aircraft for more than 4 hours is beyond me i couldn’t imagine how anyone could put up with this on the longhaul flights for which they have been designed qatar airways economy class is truly a 1 star experience the food offering was inedible qatar charge full service prices for budget airline comfort and should be thoroughly ashamed what a shambles i will never use qatar again avoid at all costs editors comment you’ll find that with the exception of the japanese airlines all 787s are in this configuration and the seat pitch of qatar is no different to the other airlines either it’s just economy travel and if it is a full flight it is uncomfortable arunkumarfrom united states  february 12 2018flew economy class overall score110overall value for money seat and

score610overall value for money seat and cabin space customer service in flight entertainment meals and beverages recommend airline no i used qatar airways for the fourth time late in 2016 25th october  8th december on the route zurich – bangkok – zurich in economy class on previous flights i had twice tried to sign on to qatar’s frequent flyer programme but somehow this did not work out i had wanted to deposit my need for an aisle seat as i have a back injury which requires me to get up frequently on the flight from doha to bangkok i was assigned a seat with which there was something wrong i requested that i be allowed to change the seat explaining that i might get problems but was told that this was impossible as the plane was full in bangkok i had to request another passenger to lift my luggage off the belt at the airport after leaving my luggage at the hotel i continued to hospital for cortisone injections i needed to leave bangkok eight days early the ticket i had bought stated that i would be charged 173 swiss francs for any change of reservation but when i tried to make the change online the cost was given as 355 swiss francs i called the qatar office in bangkok they confirmed that this was a mistake „probably a software problem“ and then proceeded to charge me 202 swiss francs i was told that i was charged more because my change of reservation had to made

meals and beverages recommend airline no my return airticket from amman  jordan to melbourne was not honoured when i arrived at the amman airport i was told that i was not listed i repurchased my ticket on my return home i found that the problem was caused by a qatar airways administrative error qatar airways never acknowledged my emails requesting reimbursement i had to approach my insurance company qatar has never apologised for their error a very good tour was spoilt by the last minute catastrophe thank goodness i had enough credit on my credit card to repurchase my ticket which was twice as expensive as the original purchase saptarshifrom kuwait  december 16 2017flew first class overall score110overall value for money seat and cabin space customer service in flight entertainment meals and beverages recommend airline no horrible customer service qatar airways damaged 3 of our bags when we traveled from houston to kuwait via doha on 6th oct 2017 i registered the complaint at kuwait airport before leaving the airport i was told that it will be settled in 2 weeks after 3 weeks of silence when i contacted them i was told that no complaint was raised by me before leaving the airport and hence my claim has been denied qatar airways lost my complaint and put that on me to deny my claim even after repeated followups i also insisted on checking the kuwait airport camera footage in front of damaged baggage office which would clearly show that we registered the complaint before leaving the airport but they did not do that qatar airways is notorious in denying responsibility neither accepting mistakes nor acting on good faith my recommendation  avoid qatar and take emirates or etihad instead saptarshi ballabh next »view all reviewstweet
