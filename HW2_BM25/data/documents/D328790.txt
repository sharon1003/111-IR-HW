silverywhite metal discovered in 1803 by william hyde wollaston he named it after the asteroid pallas which was itself named after the epithet of the greek goddess athena acquired by her when she slew pallas palladium platinum rhodium ruthenium iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals pgms these have similar chemical properties but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them more than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters which convert as much as 90 of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust  hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide into less noxious substances  nitrogen carbon dioxide and water vapor  palladium is also used in electronics dentistry medicine hydrogen purification chemical applications groundwater treatment and jewelry palladium is a key component of fuel cells which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity heat and water ore deposits of palladium and other pgms are rare the most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the bushveld igneous complex covering the transvaal basin in south africa the stillwater complex in montana united states the sudbury basin and thunder bay district of ontario canada and the norilsk complex in russia recycling is also a source mostly from scrapped catalytic converters the

a soft silverwhite metal that resembles platinum it is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals it is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when coldworked palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid in hot concentrated sulfuric acid and when finely ground in hydrochloric acid 4 it dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia palladium does not react with oxygen at standard temperatures and thus does not tarnish in air  palladium heated to 800 °c will produce a layer of palladium ii oxide pd

halflife of 65 million years found in nature 103pd with 17 days and 100 pd with 363 days eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 9094948 64 u  91 pd to 12293426 64 u  123 pd 7 these have halflives of less than thirty minutes except 101 pd halflife 847 hours 109 pd halflife 137 hours and 112 pd halflife 21 hours 8for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope 106 pd the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium the primary mode of decay for those isotopes of pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver 8radiogenic 107 ag is a decay product of 107 pd and was first discovered in 1978 9 in the santa clara 10 meteorite of 1976 the discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of ironcored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event 107 pd versus ag correlations observed in bodies which have been melted since accretion of the solar system must reflect the presence of shortlived nuclides in the early solar system 11compounds  editsee also category

wollaston purified enough of the material and offered it without naming the discoverer in a small shop in soho in april 1803 after harsh criticism from richard chenevix that palladium is an alloy of platinum and mercury wollaston anonymously offered a reward of 20 british pounds for 20 grains of synthetic palladium alloy 23 chenevix received the copley medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium 24 25 he disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805 23 26it was named by wollaston in 1802 after the asteroid 2 pallas which had been discovered two months earlier 4 wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from south america by dissolving the ore in aqua regia neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride he added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium ii cyanide which was heated to extract palladium metal 24palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of 0065 g per day approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight this treatment had many negative sideeffects and was later replaced by more effective drugs 27most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry 28 in the run up to year 2000 the russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted 29 for political reasons the export quota was not granted on time the ensuing market panic drove the price to an alltime high of 1100 per troy ounce in january 2001 30 around that time the ford motor company fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage stockpiled the metal when prices fell in early 2001 ford lost nearly us 1 billion 31world demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300 tons in 2000 the global production of palladium from mines was 222 tonnes in 2006 according to the united states geological survey 32 many were concerned about a steady supply of palladium in the wake of russias military maneuvers in ukraine partly as sanctions could hamper russian palladium exports any restrictions on russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014 33 those concerns pushed palladium prices to their highest level since 2001 34 in september 2014 they soared above the 900 per ounce mark in 2016 however palladium cost around 614 per ounce as russia managed to maintain stable supplies 35 in january 2018 palladium futures climbed past 1100 per ounce for the first time on record mainly due to the strong demand from the automotive industry 36occurrence  editpalladium output in 2005as overall mine production of palladium reached 208000 kilograms in 2016 russia was the top producer with 82000 kilograms followed by south africa canada and the u s 37 russias company norilsk nickel ranks first among the largest palladium producers globally it accounts for 39 of the world’s production 38palladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinumgroup metals in placer deposits of the ural mountains australia ethiopia north and south america for the production of palladium these deposits play only a minor role the most important commercial sources are nickel  copper deposits found in the sudbury basin ontario and the norilsk–talnakh deposits in siberia the other large deposit is the merensky reef platinum group metals deposit within the bushveld igneous complex south africa the stillwater igneous complex of montana and the roby zone ore body of the lac des îles igneous complex of ontario are the two other sources of palladium in canada and the united states 32 39 palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite 40 and polarite 41 many more pd minerals are known but all of them are very rare 42palladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel see synthesis of precious metals  though this source for palladium is not used none of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the highlevel radioactive waste 43applications  editcross section of a metalcore catalytic converter the soviet 25rouble commemorative palladium coin is a rare example of the monetary usage of palladium the largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters 44 palladium is also used in jewelry dentistry 44 45 watch making blood sugar test strips aircraft spark plugs surgical instruments and electrical contacts 46 palladium is also used to make professional transverse concert or classical flutes 47 as a commodity palladium bullion has iso currency codes of xpd and 964 palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes the others being gold silver and platinum 48 because it absorbs hydrogen palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989 catalysis  editwhen it is finely divided as with palladium on carbon palladium forms a versatile catalyst it speeds hydrogenation dehydrogenation and petroleum cracking a large number of carbon–carbon bonding reactions in organic chemistry such as the heck reaction and suzuki coupling are facilitated by palladium compound catalysts see palladium compounds and palladiumcatalyzed coupling reactions  when dispersed on conductive materials palladium is an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media 49 in 2010 palladiumcatalysed organic reactions were recognised by the nobel prize in chemistry palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations a 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbonfluoride bonds 50palladium is essential to the lindlar catalyst also called lindlars palladium 51catalytic cycle for kumada cross coupling reaction which is widely used in the synthesis of fine chemicals palladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications although its use is growing as a tool for synthetic biology in 2017 effective in vivo catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease 52electronics  editthe second greatest application of palladium in electronics is in multilayer ceramic capacitors 53 in which palladium and palladiumsilver alloy is used for electrodes 44 palladium sometimes alloyed with nickel is used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics 54 55 and in soldering materials the electronic sector consumed 107 million troy ounces 332 tonnes of palladium in 2006 according to a johnson matthey report 56technology  edithydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium 4 and membrane reactors with pd membranes are used in the production of high purity hydrogen 57 palladium is used in palladiumhydrogen electrode s in electrochemical studies palladium ii chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors 58hydrogen storage  editmain article palladium hydride palladium readily absorbs hydrogen at room temperatures forming palladium hydride pd h x with x less than 1 59 while this property is common to many transition metals palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches 1 60 this property has been investigated in designing an efficient inexpensive and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose 61 the content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to magnetic susceptibility which decreases with the increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for pd h 062 at any higher ratio the solid solution becomes diamagnetic 62dentistry  editpalladium is used in small amounts about 05 in some alloys of dental amalgam to decrease corrosion and increase the metallic lustre of the final restoration 63jewelry  edita palladiumplated belt buckle palladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called  white gold  where the naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating palladium is much less dense than platinum similar to gold palladium can be beaten into leaf as thin as 100 nm  1⁄ 250000 in 4 unlike platinum palladium may discolor at temperatures above 400 °c 752 °f 64 it is relatively brittle  clarification neededpalladium is one of the three most popular alloying metals in white gold  nickel and silver can also be used 44 palladiumgold is more expensive than nickelgold but seldom causes allergic reactions though certain crossallergies with nickel may occur 65when platinum was declared a strategic government resource during world war ii many jewelry bands were made out of palladium up to as recently as september 2001 66 palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting currently the casting problem has been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum has increased in price while palladium decreased 67prior to 2004 the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold in early 2004 when gold and platinum prices rose steeply china began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry consuming 37 tonnes in 2005 changes in the relative price of platinum after 2008 lowered demand for palladium to 174 tonnes in 2009 68 69in january 2010 hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the united kingdom and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium articles can be marked as 500 950 or 999 parts of palladium per thousand of the alloy fountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver rather than gold appearance is desired sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely photography  editin the platinotype printing process photographers make fineart blackandwhite prints using platinum or palladium salts often used with platinum palladium provides an alternative to silver 70toxicity  editpalladium is a metal with low toxicity it is poorly absorbed by the human body when digested plants such as the water hyacinth are killed by low levels of palladium salts but most other plants tolerate it although tests show that at levels above 00003 growth is affected high doses of palladium could be poisonous tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans 71precautions  editlike other platinumgroup metals bulk pd is quite inert although contact dermatitis has been reported data on the effects are limited it has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic 28 72 73 74 75some palladium is emitted with the exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters between 4 and 108 ngkm of palladium particulate is released by such cars while the total uptake from food is estimated to be less than 2 µg per person a day the second possible source of palladium is dental restoration from which the uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than 15 µg per person per day people working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake for soluble compounds such as palladium chloride 99 is eliminated from the body within
