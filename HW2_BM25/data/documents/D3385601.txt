0july 26 mobile technology my lifeproof mishap–and why i’ll continue to use their products this site contains affiliate links please see policies for more information pin 2 share 13 tweet 12 stumble27this is no ordinary review but it’s an honest one life proof provided me with their new lifeproof nüüd case for i phone 5 to review i love this product and want to tell you about our mishap and why i will continue trust my phone with lifeproof you might remember my lifeproof i phone case review last year when i shared photos of how great the case protected my i phone during my mud run save we love this case since then i’ve used it during the color run where it performed just as well save we have also had many many underwater photo sessions in our pool save last week we received a new lifeproof case in the mail to try–the lifeproof nüüd for i phone 5 save steve immediately watertested it and put it on his phone it was awesomeevery time we get ready to purposely stick a phone in the water it happens quite often around here actually we open the case up and check all the seals and then we water test the case without the phone to make sure there are no leaks caused by wear and tear on the case save we had a fun photoshoot for this review michael enjoyed dropping dad’s new phone in the pool save can you see it save it stayed at the bottom of the pool for about 10 minutes while i took some photos and came out like a champ wet case dry i phone we set up a fun shot in the rain as well we are in the middle of monsoon season you knowsave the photos for the review were done and the phone was working just fine but the kids asked to take it underwater again to take photos of themselves they had some great shots i was super excited to post their photos after about 15 minutes of their shoot the case… well… failed we don’t really know what happened but when michael went to take a photo the phone had turned off save after using a lifeproof case for over a year we had a mishap we knew it could happen–even the best of products have issues once in a while right this particular case had held up through watertesting being dunked in the pool a few times sitting at the bottom of the pool sitting in the rain and even through about 30 underwater pictures we did everything right including reading through the entire lifeproof nüüd user’s manual because we’re geeks like that maybe it had something to do with the way the phone went underwater – maybe we stuck it in at a bad angle maybe michael had his grip somewhere that caused the case to bow a little and let water in maybe it was a defective case maybe… well we don’t know but… we have insurance if you’re purposely sticking your phone underwater for any reason it’s always good to have insurance and we had a new phone in our hands in less than 48 hours the representatives at lifeproof were awesome you can find their policies and warranty information on their website and their customer service representatives are beyond helpful they even asked for us to send the case back to them no charge to us so their engineers could inspect the case to see what happened i’m interested to hear what they say and will update you on my facebook page when the results are in why am i going forth with a review and giveaway for a product that ultimately didn’t work because after over a year of using lifeproof this is the first issue of any type that we have had the lifeproof company and product line is amazing and is highly recommended by one of the best tech writers in the market cnetcom i phone life is another trusted source for tech reviews and you can see their review here there are some things you should do any time you use a product that allows your phone to do things it normally shouldn’t like go underwater1 read the owner’s manual always the product may look intuitive but there may be tips and tricks in the owner’s manual that help you have the best experience possible2 insure your phone a nobrainer in my opinion squaretrade offers warranties for phones for about 100 lifeproof provides a total water protection program for their i pad case i phone 5 frē case and the i phone 44s case for 793 check in with your phone in this case for example i wonder–had we had looked closely at the phone would have noticed water in the case maybe if we noticed earlier we could have taken the phone out and dried it it’s just a good idea to keep a close eye on the wellbeing of the phone4 back up photos to i cloud michael and jack got some amazing underwater shots in the pool and they were lost when the phone died backing our photos up to i cloud in case of unfortunate events like this could have saved those photos for us lifeproof is sending me out another case this week and i’ll be taking some awesome underwater photos with it i trust lifeproof along with thousands of other users if you’re interested in trying out a lifeproof case i’m giving one away lifeproof nüüd giveaway win a nüüd case

sometimes accidents happenreply stacie yates says august 2 at 702 pm i would replace my alreadywornlooking lifeproof fre case and run with it i love the waterproofing but i’m rather disappointed in several aspects of the fre the annoying fact that you have to use the headphone extension if you use yurbuds which are actually sold on the site the extension is timeconsuming to attach since you have to screw it in and that plug that’s meant to be used in the audio jack when the extension is not attached is just begging to get lost i don’t see why they didn’t opt for a flip open cover that remains attached like the charging port cover and not two months after i get the fre someone crowds me on a staircase and i brush the screen against decorative “faux stone” pillars the result two deep scratches in the protective skin over the screen sure the screen is unscathed but i’m sometimes disappointed in the lack of clarity and responsiveness with the covered screen and the scratches bug me additionally the flexible headphone extension seems to be a real achilles heel my first died completely after three weeks of normal use my second just died after not even four months of normal use rendering one of the earbuds dead when you use it i’m still waiting on lifeproof to get back to me on my second warranty claim for the impaired headphone extension a week after submission the durability of the headphone extension is really becoming a concern at this point reply stacie yates says august 2 at 705 pmhttpstwittercomtheladysybilstatus363480309175566336tweeted considering i

reply sam says april 9 at 507 pm my wife and i just purchased an i phone 5 and 5s respectively…and she has the fre and myself the nuud i must have tested thing 5x just to be sure…i did notice small microdrops of water inside the case after opening…and can only assume i didn’t dry it good enough before popping it open i trust this case i have no reason not to that said…i’m wondering if openingclosing it to check it and be sure it is ok is the best idea i’m thinking a couple times is probably fine but once it starts to age it may be best to leave it alone as a gasket could tear and fail easier i’d say test it check in…and leave itreply beth singewald says june 26 at 1151 am you are lucky that it took a year for your case to fail mine failed after the second use and my new phone is dead only a fool would fall for this marketing company twice no thank you reply larry says july 30 at 454 pm just got my new phone today i had to get a new 5s because my lifeproof nuud failed and destroyed the phone i will contact lifeproof and try to get a refund but this is actually a replacement from the first one that failed not water just the rubber housing started to fray although i had insurance i am still out the 199 copay good bye lifeproof your call quality has always been poor but i put up with it because i thought it was waterproof just another note the company does not recommend frequent reopening of the case used to say on the site that the case has a 50 opening life span don’t know if that is still on their website reply chad says december 26 at 946 pm if a company calls their product ‘life proof’ and claims they are waterproof yet also sells insurance to replace your phone if it is damaged by water that should raise a red flag after spending 300 to repair a phone ruined by water damage while in this case i would suggest never trusting this thing to actually be waterproof reply leave a reply your email address will not be published required
