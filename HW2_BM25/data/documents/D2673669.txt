maybe later sort comment on atticuss explanation of rape how suitable is this as an answer to scout does this answer make sense to scout when scout asks atticus what the definition of rape is he says that it was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent scout seems smart for her age she may not know all the details but it was enough for her to sort of understand what happened why does alexandra think atticus should dismiss calpurnia how does atticus respond to the suggestion aunt alexandra tells atticus that since she has moved in they can dismiss calpurnia aunt alexandra prefers that the children are raised by a white woman and not a black woman atticus said that calpurnia is already part of the family and the children see her as something close to mother he doesnt want heartbreaks to happen and calpurnia was doing a great job towards teaching the children their mannersthat there was no reason to dismiss her why is scout pleased when jem fights her back why is she less pleased when he tells atticus about dill scout is worried about jem growing up and separating himself from her when jem fights back it is just like old times scout still feels that a little of her childhood is alive jem tells atticus about dill running away from his parents and this is the final code of childhood jem has reached a point of maturity where he can gauge situations and their seriousness this is definitely a sign that jem is becoming a young man and scout doesnt like it she wants gem to continue to be a child what do we learn from dills account of his running away the reader learns that dill still tells lies and exaggerates too much some of what dill said was probably true for example his new father probably did not play with him or build a boat with him but some of his story was probably a lie his parents probably were not abusive what is the nightmare that now descends upon the children for the first time scout and jem witness the hatred of the mob and the horrors of racism and see their father in a vulnerable and perhaps deadly position this happened with the children snuck out at night they found atticus sitting outside the jail and a mob of angry people surrounded him they feared he might be hurt or killed what was and is the ku klux klan what do you think of atticuss comment about it the kkk rose in response to the massive immigration and dislike of certain religious groups specifically in this book you need to know that the kkk was against african americans atticus was in partly right about his comment that the kkk would not really go near maycomb but i think he was also aware that they still existed and were out there atticus did not want to worry scout or jem how does jem react when atticus tells him to go home and why he rufuses to go home he just says no and he stays there he reacts that way because he is very worried that these men will do something to atticus he thinks he might be able help out if anything bad were to happen what persuades the lynchingparty to give up their attempt on toms life why did they leave and not kill tom robinson scouts polite conversation about one of the sons walter cunningham having lunch at her house and a onesided discussion of entailments diffuses the mob anger and makes the men feel ashamed to be threatening scouts father comment on the way scout affects events without realizing it at the time scouts talk to mr cunningham first about his son mr cunningham then puts himself in atticus position and realizes that he couldnt kill atticus to get to tom because atticus like himself has children that he loves and must care for scout does not realize that by having this conversation she might have saved her fathers life if she did not talk to mr cunningham the mob might have attacked andor killed atticus what subtle change does scout notice in her father by chapter 16 scout has begun to notice all the pressure and stress on her father atticus is worried about a lot because of the court case and he works harder than ever atticus used to be home more but now calpurnia and aunt alexandra must take over much of the care although atticus wont admit it openly he thinks that he might have a chance to win at the tom robinson trial even though he has been disappointed in his town recently what sort of person is dolphus raymond a white man from a rich family who lives with a black women and their children the white community look down on him as he seems permanently drunk but scout and dill learn that by this he is giving the white community a reason for his schosen way of life how does reverend sykes help the children see and hear the trial he takes the children jem scout  dill up into the balcony where only the black people are allowed to be he did this because the white section on the first floor was full atticus told the children not to go to the trial and to stay at home atticus does not know that the children are there and watching comment on judge taylors attitude to his job does he take the trial seriously or not judge taylor is very laid back and often people think he is sleeping he is not however sleeping he is paying close attention to what everyone is saying the most important piece of information that proves judge taylor takes the trial seriously is that he appoints atticus the best lawyer in area to be toms lawyer judge taylor appointed atticus to be toms lawyer because he knows that atticus will try hard to prove tom innoscent even though tom is black
