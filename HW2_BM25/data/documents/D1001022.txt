45 terms arjunknanda histo  aging and senescence learn flashcards write spell test match gravity advertisement upgrade to remove ads sort what is senescence the process by which cells stay in g0 and stop dividing what is aging gradual change resulting in maturation from birth through childhood and adolescence to adulthood and decline through middle and old age why do normal cells not divide indefinitely what are the many reasons telomere shortening dna replicative stress oncogene activation ros dna damage growth arrest generally viable and metabolically active resisting apoptosis and expressing a senescenceassociated betagalactosidase enzyme are all characteristics of what the distinct phenotype of senescent cells what biochemical features are expressed in the senescent phenotype increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors like p21 and p16 retinoblastoma protein p rb and p53 pathway also histone modifications and silencing genes are found what is hutchinsongilford progeria syndrome hgps syndrome with accelerated aging what are the symptoms of hgps growth retardation reduced bone density hair loss wrinkled skin cvdwhat is the average lifespan of a patient with hgps 1215 years what is the cause of hgps a mutation in lamin a gene protein is a nuclear scaffold protein  inadequate support of nuclear envelope  disorganization of chromatin  dna damage what are the three mechanisms involved in senescence dna replication stress ros stem cell theory what is dna replication stress what does it cause inefficient dna replication which leads to downregulation of replication factors decreased d ntps decreased activity of dna helicases if there is a mutation in the rec q helicase what can this cause genomic instability disrupted dna replication repair and transcription  werner syndrome what is werner syndrome premature aging syndrome  graying and thinning of hair thin skin cataracts atherosclerosis osteoporosis some forms of cancer what is werner syndrome caused by mutation in wrn gene which codes for the rec q family of dna helicases how would ros be a mechanism in senescence ros produced by oxidative phosphorylation would cause mitochondrial dna damage those mutations would decrease cellular oxidative phosphorylation which would increase ros production it would be cyclical what is the stem cell theory as a mechanism of senescence tissue specific stem cells decline you see less production of undifferentiated cells thus less production of differentiated cells what are the two molecular mechanisms of senescence p53 and p rbwhat do you see in the p53 pathway dna damage increased p53 increased transcription p21 and senescent growth arrest what do you see in the p rb pathway increased p16 increased p rb inhibition of cell cycle regulators replicative senescence how does aging affect the integumentary system wrinkles form epidermis renewal slows thin skin gray hairatypical skin pigmentation decline in melanocytes hair loss dry skin decline in sebaceous glands decreased sweat decreased immune response decline in langerhans cells and macrophageshow do wrinkles form fibroblasts decrease in number collagen fibers also decrease and stiffen and break apart elastic fibers lose elasticity and thicken into clumps how does aging affect the cardiovascular system arteriosclerosis thickeninghardening of arteries loss of elasticity and restriction of blood flowwhat is the most common type of arteriosclerosis why does this form atherosclerosis buildup of fats and cholesterol in the artery wall forms plaques aka atheromas causes restriction of blood flow how does aging affect hematopoiesis decreased number of hematopoietic cells and cellularity changes in location how does aging affect the immune system decrease in t cells loses effectiveness too and reduced antibody response to antigen means weakened immune response how does aging affect the urinary system atrophy means decreased blood flow which means decreased blood filtration reabsorption and secretion how does aging affect the bladder reduced sizecapacity and weakening of muscles causes bladder control issues how does aging affect the male reproductive system decreased testosterone and sperm production enlargement of prostate bph and testicular atrophy how does aging affect the female reproductive system menopause decline in estrogen production and atrophy of ovaries uterus vagina and breasts how does aging affect the digestive system decreased secretion and motility how does aging affect the respiratory system decreased lung capacity airways and tissues become less elastic how does aging affect the brain decrease in brain mass 7 by 80how does aging affect smell and taste gradual decline after 50 due to decrease in olfactory and gustatory receptors and decreased rate of replacement how does aging affect vision loss of elasticity  presbyopia loss of transparency  cataracts also there may be macular degeneration how does aging affect hearing 25 of people have hearing loss after 60 may be loss or damage to hair cells and progressive hearing loss  presbycusis how does aging affect the anterior pituitary decrease in anterior pituitary means decreased production of h gh which means muscle atrophy how does aging affect the thyroid decreased production of calcitonin and thyroid hormones which decreases metabolic rate and increases body fat how does aging affect the parathyroid gland increase in pth levels due to inadequate dietary intake of calcium leads to decreased bone mass and osteoporosis how does aging affect the adrenal glands decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol how does aging affect the pancreas decreased rate of insulin secretion so glucose increases faster and insulin receptor sensitivity decreases so glucose returns to normal more slowlyhow does aging affect muscle tissue loss of muscle mass 10 loss from 3050 another 40 from 5080 and strength how does aging affect bone loss of bone mass demineralization happens early in females and accelerates after 45 can cause osteoporosis and brittleness because of less collagenwhat happens in primary osteoporosis why does it happen critical loss of bone mass because of a deficiency of h gh senile or estrogen postmenopausal decreased estrogen increases levels of il1 a stimulator of osteoclasts vertebral compression fractures femoral head fractures and slow healing of fractured bones are common findings of what osteoporosis how does aging affect joints decreased production of synovial fluid articular cartilage becomes thinner there is loss of flexibility in ligaments and osteoarthritis
