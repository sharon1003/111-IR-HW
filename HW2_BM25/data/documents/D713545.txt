algae intro colonial diatoms filamentous desmids motile the filamentous algae filamentous algae page 1 page 2this gallery includes only the filamentous green algae the group is a heterogeneous one in which the members although superficially similar show a wide diversity in their life cycle and modes of reproduction spirogyra oedogonium and cladophora are amongst the varieties most frequently encountered all bluegreen algae are now classified amongst the bacteria and will be found in the cyanobacteria gallery spirogyra spirogyra is a filamentous green alga which is common in freshwater habitats it has the appearance of very fine bright darkgreen filaments moving gently with the currents in the water and is slimy to the touch when attempts are made to collect it the slime serves to deter creatures which otherwise attatch themselves to underwater plants so spirogyra under the microscope is usually spotless a field of spirogyra filaments their appearance is not quite typical in that the nuclei are unusually prominent and the characteristic spiral chloroplasts are so fine and tightly wound that close examination is needed to confirm the identification in any case the possession of spiral chloroplasts is sufficient to positively identify spirogyra to genus darkfield x120 the central portion of a cell of spirogyra showing the nucleus and giving an insight into the way the spiral chloroplast contacts with the wall of the cell the filament in the background provides another view brightfield x1000 central portion of a spirogyra cell showing nucleus and chloroplasts brightfield x1000 this filament of spirogyra is about to break into two filaments the wall of each cell centre of picture has developed an inward indentation at the junction between the cells increase in pressure in each cell will cause the indentation to pop out forcing separation of the filaments and leaving them with highly convex ends brightfield x1000 two filaments of spirogyra the lower one clearly showing the nucleus this picture also gives a good insight into the way the chloroplasts line the wall of the cell brightfield x1000 conjugation in spirogyra in common with other members of its phylum gamophyta spirogyra lacks a motile variant at all stages of its life history ie no motile gametes ova or sperm no zoospores etc sexual reproduction is by a process called conjugation  another of the famously remarkable sights available to the microscopist although it is not possible to distinguish them visually certain filaments in a loose parallel bundle of spirogyra assume the female and others the male role in the process which follows the cells of adjacent filaments develop bumps which grow towards one another and eventually fuse to form a continuous tube between the cells meanwhile the contents of each cell have detatched themselves from their respective cell walls and have formed a round ball over a relatively short space of time minutes the green spheres from the male filament squeeze their way down the connecting tubes to fuse with a similarly contracted female cell in the other filament the result of this sexual union is the formation of a zygospore with a tough resistant outer covering within the chambers of the female filament after a dormant period these zygotes undergo meiosis and germinate resulting in new filaments of spirogyra once seen never forgotten click for a diagram showing conjugation in spirogyra crassa this picture shows two stages in spirogyra conjugation the central pair of cells are joined by a conjugation tube which has yet to fuse into form a continuous passage the cell contents are at a similarly early stage of detatching themselves from the cell wall to form a ball by contrast the two cells to the right contain newly formed zygospores as a result of consummated conjugation brightfield x500 a detail of the above specimen at higher magnification brightfield x1000 this picture shows the contents of three male cells about to migrate down the conjugation tubes joining them to the female filament below the cell third from the left is already half way down the tube the process was completed in a minute or so darkfield x300 male and female cells now occupy the same space and are pictured before fusion to form a zygospore has taken place the filament designated female is the one in which the zygospores have formed darkfield x300 two mature zygospores of spirogyra from another part of the specimen which provided the above pictures in this form spirogyra can survive winter or other adverse conditions and germinate in the spring to form new filaments the hardened outer spore wall can be seen reflecting the light from the darkfield condenser darkfield x400 a zygospore of spirogyra against a background of decaying plant remains and other algal forms darkfield x400 its hard to say what is happening here it looks like the stage in conjugation of spirogyra in which the contraction of the cell contents to a ball is not quite complete and the spiral nature of the chloroplast is still discernable darkfield x1000
