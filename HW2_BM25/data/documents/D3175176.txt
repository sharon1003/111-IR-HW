salts and acids and bases back nextpass the salt acid and base please in this section well talk about the dirty little secret that some molecules disguised as innocuous salts can have acidic or basic tendencies here a salt will refer to a molecule that dissociates entirely when added to an aqueous solution which in our case will be water most people are familiar with good ole table salt or as chemists like to say na cl actually table salt is way more nuanced and frankly more delightful than just plain old na cl—in your face chemists na cl is an example of a salt that does not have acidic or basic properties when dissolved into solution the reason na cl doesnt change the p h of a solution is because the cation na  and anion cl  that are produced when na cl is dissolved are really weak acids and bases we know this because their conjugate acid and base partners are really strong acids and bases the conjugate base of na  is na oh and the conjugate acid of cl  is hcl look how tiny those dissociation constants are those dissociation constants tell us that the reaction will lie very far to the left if we give these equations a 180° spin this might make more sense because na oh and hcl are a strong base and strong acid respectively they will be nearly fully dissociated in solution incidentally combining hcl and na oh in equal proportions results in a neutral solution of na  and cl  combining any strong acid and strong base results in a neutral solution for your reference pleasure here are some cations and anions that do not react with water to give acidic or basic solutions cations alkali metals from group 1a li  na  and k alkaline earth metals from group 2a ca 2 sr 2 and ba 2anions cl  br  i  no 3  and cl o 4 things get dicey when a particular cation or anion from a salt does significantly react with water one example of a salt that produces an acid solution is the salt nh 4 cl ammonium chloride when nh 4 cl is dissolved into water the molecule splits up into nh 4  and cl  anions we showed above that cl  will not react significantly with water because its conjugate partner is a strong acid but nh 4  will react with water to some small extent by acting as an acid and transferring a proton if we wanted to we could calculate all the species present in a solution of nh 4 cl by treating the nh 4  released by the salt as a weak acid solution dont worry youll have a chance to do this later on in the example problems it turns out that salts can also have basic properties when they release ions that react with water to form oh  for example the salt na cn releases both a na  cation which doesnt react with water because its conjugate base is really strong and a cn  anion which does react with water because its conjugate acid is weak say what take a look at the chemical equation for cn  acting as a base notice that the conjugate acid hcn is a weak acid that does not like to be totally dissociated some of the cn  will react to form hcn again to calculate equilibrium concentrations and p h values you can use the same procedure that we used before lastly its possible that the dilution of a salt into water could result in the production of anions and cations that react with water to produce h 3 o  and oh  let the battle over the protons begin if the cation typically acting as the acid is stronger than the anion typically acting as the base then the cation will win and the solution will be acidic if the anion wins and is acting as base then the solution will be basic heres an example of the salt nh 4 f reacting with water when it dissolves in solution comparing the dissociation constants above shows that nh 4  is the stronger of the two ions since it is an acid it will beat out the f  anion and the solution will be acidic here are the rules for determining the p h of any salt solution if k a  k b the solution will have more h 3 o  and the p h will be less than 7 if k a  k b the solution will have more oh  and the p h will be greater than 7 if k a ≈ k b the solution will contain nearly equal amounts of h 3 o  and oh  and the p h will be approximately 7 if the dissociation constant values are approximately equal to or less than the dissociation constant for water 1 × 10 14 then the solution will have a p h value of approximately 7 back nextcite this page
