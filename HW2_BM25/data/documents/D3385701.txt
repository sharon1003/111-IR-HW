issue yes about the only time a seam might be a problem is when the rim joist also doubles as the beam carrying the joist weight with an 18 ft deck you would have two sets of beams carrying the joists the rim joist in that case keeps the joists from twisting much like solid bridging would edited by abledog  061612 1208 pmtop reply quote quick reply quick quote718948  061612 0523 pmre deck rim joist

joist  re ront02769 stevesmember registered 042710 posts 105 loc central njunless you are doing some sort of facing your rim joists by definition are going to be visible typcially when your deck is longer than one joist the joists overlap adjacent to each other on top of a beam this is fine for interior joists but on a rim joist you dont want this to be visible just think your layout through regarding how your seam will be visible and how you can hide it you may need additional timber just for visibility to give an even appearance over the length of the rim joist and just to reiterate you dont want to have a buttseam for the joist unless that joistmember is for purely aesthetic reasons all joists that will be carrying any sort of weight must cantilever over the beam in each direction

clint but then you would have to use joist hangers on every joist with an additional beam at the end of the deck for all the hangers this would have posts visible on the end beam rather than recessed in a bit if the joists were cantilevered out over the beam a few feet that end rim joist would have to be supported in order to carry the weight of the joists when using hangers top reply quote quick

talking about a rim joist not a girder you dont put joist hangers on a rim joist his question was is it okay to make the rim joist with more than once piece of lumber the answer is yes your point of appearance is a good one a 45 degree scarf joint is much better than a 90 degree butt joint top reply quote quick reply quick quote719097  061812 0410 pmre deck rim joist  re abledog cabin connection

think my earlier reply kinda derailed the thread sorry not my intention sometimes hard to put these things into a couple of sentences my goal was to caution against a scenario that i was picturing when i read the original post if two joists must be used to go from one end of the deck to the other ie from the ledger board to the front rim joist the seam should fall over a beam and more importantly if the two joists are butted up to each other end to end on top of the double beam then the short joist should not be cantilevered to the end it must be supported on both ends without seeing the detailed layout for this case i would try to cantilever the short joist from the beam to the rim joist by putting it alongside the first joist and sistering it properly to the other one also if this sidebyside joist layout is used then the rim joists on either side will have a gap and wont be continuous from the ledger out to the end that is where i said you may have to double up purely for aesthetic reasons to give a continuous uniform appearance all the way along top reply quote quick reply quick quote719387  062112 1131 amre deck rim joist  re steves abledog carpal tunnel registered 120703 posts 53374 loc so florida and more importantly if the two joists are butted up to each other end to end on top of the double beam disagree with that if two lengths are required to span from ledger to rim joist header then they should be lapped rather than butted if butted over a double bu beam you only have 112 inch bearing and you should have 3 inches of bearing in the case of the last joist rim do it exactly the same the same as the other joists but then simply double up the joist to make the outside flush you dont have to double the whole thing unless theres going to be a wall above or such and i would put a 45 on both outside pieces to make a better joint just as you would do on a fascia you dont butt join two pieces of fascia sure you can butt them but they will open slightly when both pieces shrink i also 45 the corners formed by the rim then the short joist should not be cantilevered to the end it must be supported on both ends as mentioned above the last joist is done just like all the others and is sufficient as is the doubling is for appearance not strength so it doesnt matter where the joint occursedited by abledog  062112 1203 pmtop reply quote quick

recommending a butt joint over a beam but the op asked about it completely agree only the rim joists need to be doubled again that was the title of the post so i was referring specifically to rim joists anyway we are on the same page if the front rim joist is supported properly ie a beam then you can use hangers and not have to lap any joists the top of the beam would be flush with the top of the joists for example if you are low to the ground and dont have much elevation to work with thats one time when the rim joists would have hangers and lastly i agree on the 45 deg cut i think no matter how tight you push the beams they will shrink and that butt joint will show a gap over time top reply quote quick reply quick quote page 1 of 2 1 2 previous topic index next topic tweet quick
