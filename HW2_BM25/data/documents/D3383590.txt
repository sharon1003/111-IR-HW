law enforcement agents cant just randomly arrest or search individuals that they believe to be involved in a crime in order to prevent police officers from trampling on the rights of citizens there is

action can be the arrest of a named individual or the search of a residence judges can sign off on three major types of warrants search warrants bench warrants and arrest warrants each one is different depending upon the situation what is an arrest warrant an arrest warrant is a legal document that is signed by a judge and enables law enforcement to make an immediate arrest of an

enter homes to apprehend a suspect if necessary how do you find out if someone has an arrest warrant against them some law enforcement agents will notify suspects of an arrest warrant via a letter at

justice in the eyes of the law this court order will allow the police to arrest you on sight and even enter your home in order to apprehend you its important to remember that there is no statute of limitations for a bench warrant this type of warrant never expires and will only be cleared upon your death or arrest what is a search warrant if the police believe that a crime has been committed or

your home to gather more evidence unless another search warrant is obtained if law enforcement officers violate any of the conditions of the warrant they will not be allowed to present the evidence in court what are outstanding warrants and active warrants outstanding warrants and active warrants are synonymous and used interchangeably in the court system active warrants are placed against an individual when they have either been suspected of committing a crime arrest warrant or if they did not appear for a court date bench warrant an active or outstanding warrant gives the police the right to immediately arrest the individual on sight using all necessary means the term outstanding warrant is generally used when describing an older warrant from a fugitive that has been avoiding
