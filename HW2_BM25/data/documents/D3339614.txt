wilhelm maximilian wundt is a problematic figure at several levels consider the contradictions he established the first laboratory in psychology at the university of leipzig though his research has been ignored for most of the last century he attracted some of the most important students of early psychology  cattell  kraepelin  bekterev  münsterberg  as his doctoral students and more than 100 of them completed degrees in psychology but most of these students rejected their mentors own form of psychology voluntarism and some eg cattell g s hall even disdained his competence and contributions to some degree he spent the last two decades of his life working intensively on a culturallysensitive approach to psychology  völkerpsychologie without training any students to follow after him in this work and experiencing an almost universal rejection of his approach even in his own lifetime futher throughout the first half of the 20th century and occasionally even today wundtian psychology has been mischaracterized as crudely introspective or a static structuralism  errors now seen as the invention or misappraisals of psychologists like edward titchener his student and william james blumenthal 1979 rather than an uncontrolled and subjective introspectionism most of wundts laboratory work was conducted according to objective and controlled methods of observation and selfreport wundt termed this approach experimentelle selbstbeobachtung experimental selfobservation leahy 2004 p 238 further wundts voluntarism reflected his belief that the mind is a creative dynamic and volitional force which must understood through an analysis of its activityits processes hothersall 2004 p 124 so we might ask who was this scholar and ultimately why is he important for the narrative viewpoint wundt was born in neckarau near mannheim baden in southwest germany on august 16 1832 in the first years of education he was a notably mediocre student despite coming from one of the most accomplished professional and academic families of the time that was to change he trained professionally in medicine at both tübingen and heidelberg under the supervison of his uncle friedrich arnold a noted physiologist after receiving his medical degree 1855 he spent a semester in berlin with the pioneer physiologists johannes müller and emil dubois reymond between 1858 and 1864 he served as an assistant to the great 19th century scientist herman ludwig von helmholtz in heidelberg during his years with von helmholtz wundt wrote several important volumes in his very first book contributions toward a theory of sense perception 1862 he set down a vision for psychology as an independent discipline containing three general subdivisions in the first psychology would follow the principles of the naturwissenschaften physical sciences and be conducted as an experimental inductive science the focus of this psychology would involve basic mental processes which were amenable to experimental observation and manipulation eg sensation perception reaction time to stimuli in a second complementary division wundt pictured psychology allied with the tradition of the geisteswissenschaften human or social sciences these would involve the higher mental processes which could not be brought under direct control in a laboratory eg religion social practices language myths etc hence their study would require other methods of investigation including the use of historical records naturalistic observation in the field and analyses of cultural products like literature this has often been termed the comparativehistorical approach a final form of psychology which he called scientific metaphysics would serve to intergrate the empirical work of the laboratory with other findings of science immediately following his work in helmholtzs physiological laboratory wundt became an independent tutor in physiology with only a few students and for four years beginning in 1866 served two twoyear terms as a member of the parliament of baden however he returned to the university world in 1871 when he assumed a position at heidelberg moved on to zurich briefly in 1874 and arrived at his final academic home leipzig in 1875 to take up a chair in philosophy in 1876 leipzig allowed him to begin using a room to store the instruments and equipment used to demonstrate his lectures and in 1879 he began to conduct experiments in that room unrelated to his course lectures this date has come to be regarded as the founding of the first experimental laboratory in psychology this lab was to remain unofficial until 1885 when the university began to list it in the schools catalog in 1900 wundt published the first of what would become by 1920 the year of his death ten volumes entitled völkerpsychologie eine untersuchung der entwicklungsgesetze von sprache mythus und sitte or ethnocultural psychology an investigation of the developmental laws of language myth and customs  morality  sometimes translated incorrectly as folk psychology this massive compendium of anthropological and social psychological materials traces the lawful development through cultural participation of the higher human mental processes cahan  white 1992 unremarkable for the 19th century wundt shared a belief with other european theorists that the movement of human societies followed a series of historical stages the delineation of these stages for wundt was closely related to the forms and complexity of language and the artefacts of language development such as myth epic drama etc his classification of historical development identified four stages or ages which are noted below with brief comments from his 1916 summary i the age of primitive man 2 the totemic age if we would define the concept of totemism as briefly as possible it might perhaps be said to represent a circle of ideas within which the relation of animal to man is the reverse of that which obtains in presentday culture in the totemic age man does not have dominion over the animal but the animal rules man its deeds and activities arouse wonder fear and adoration  wundt 1916 p 8  3 the age of gods and heroes in place of the eldest of the clan and the tribal chieftain of the totemic period this new age gives rise to the hero  the hero who is exalted as a leader in war belongs to a different world a world faithfully mirrored in the heroic song or epic all this is at the same time closely bound up with the origin of the state which now displaces the more primitive tribal institutions of the preceding period with national heroes and with states national religions come into being and since these religions no longer direct the attention merely to the immediate environment to the animal and plant world but focus it primarily upon the heavens there is developed the idea of a higher and more perfect world as the hero is the ideal man so the god becomes the ideal hero and the celestial world the ideally magnified terrestrial world  wundt 1916 p 9  4 the present age beyond gods and heroes thus there begins a development in which we of the present still participate it cannot therefore be referred to otherwise than as an age that is coming to be we may speak merely of an advance toward humanity not of a development of humanity this advance however begins immediately with the fall of the barriers that divide peoples particularly with regard to their religious views  wundt 1916 pp 910  note that wundt does not assign this period any special name wundt gathers together a farranging collection of datamostly drawn from ethnographic studies conducted by social scientist throughout the 19th centurywhich serve to portray the developmental stages expressed across diverse human cultures and to provide an understanding of the cultural influences exerted upon individuals within particular national communities in parallel to the constituents of individual consciousness imagination feeling and will wundt considered language myth and custom in their interrelationships as the fundamental constituents of the volksseele mind of a people cahan  white 1992 the first two volumes of his völkerpsychogie focus upon die sprache language vol 3 on die kunst the arts vols 46 on mythus und religion myth and religion vols 78 on die gesellschaft social organization vol 9 on das recht law and vol 10 on kultur und geschichte culture and history these ten volumes though were never translated from the german although a singlevolume summary in english did appear in 1916 as elements of folk psychology  wundt 1916 which was reviewed by george herbert mead in 1919 for the most part wundts efforts represented by the völkerpsychologie were ignored even in his own day wundt retired from his academic chair and assumed emeritus status in 1915 more than a decade after receiving an honorary citizenship by the city of leipzig 1902 in retirement he continued writing steadily wundt died at age 88 in grossbathen just outside of leipzig on august 31 1920 his death came only a short time after completing the manuscript of his final memoirs  erlebtes und erkanntes  what i have experienced and discovered  for narrative social science wundt represents the unfulfilled promise of what cahan  sheldon 1992 so persuasively argue might have been a second psychology to complement the laboratoryexperimental discipline appearing in the late 19th century wundts sensitivity to the role of language in particular as a entry point to understand social and cultural behavior
