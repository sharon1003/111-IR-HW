night terrors night terrors – research  treatments night terrors or sleep terrors are a parasomnia condition in which the subject reacts to a foreboding sense of fear or terror by screaming thrashing around or crying they may also get out of bed and walk or run around and adults are at a risk of performing violent acts during this time the subject is still in a sleep like state during night terrors outbursts and cannot be awoken without some difficulty the episode can last as long as 20 minutes after which the subject will either go directly back to rem or deep sleep without ever leaving their sleeping state or may wake up to extreme confusion people waking up from a sleep terror may experience amnesia for a short duration following the episode in which they cannot recall their name location or any other distinguishing features of themselves this usually passes within a couple of minutes night terrors are not the same as nightmares night terrors sleep terrors are often associated with or definitively considered a nightmare though they are in fact quite different nightmares occur in the rem stage of sleep and are traditional dreams from which the person experiencing them may recall imagery sound andor feelings typical nightmares include being chased by someone or something falling for an inordinate amount of time or things that the person finds particularly disturbing or frightful that are often rooted in their sub conscious sleep terrors  night terrors on the other hand occur before the dream state of rem sleep in the phase just before deep sleep called the slowwave sleep phase the person is not incited to the outburst through any form of imagery or sound that a nightmare would include but simply a deep sense of terror and fear that they cannot shake sleep terrors common in children not in adults sleep terrors are most common in children especially very young children under the age of 7 children with sleep terrors are also likely to talk in their sleep and sleepwalk or develop these parasomnias later after they stop having sleep terrors as many as 15 of children experience sleep terrors adults can also develop sleep terrors though this is uncommon and is usually brought upon by a deeply traumatic or emotional event or is developed in adults with a long history of depression anxiety or bipolar disorders adults with sleep terrors should consult a psychiatrist who should be able to help them deal with the issues that are plaguing them and causing the terrors as few as 2 of adults experience sleep terrors there is no link between sleep terrors in children and emotional disorders or disorders that will be developed later in life what are common causes of sleep terrors sleep terrors like many other parasomnias are deeply linked to genetics and those with a family history of sleep terrors are more likely to have them as well sleep terrors share the same root causes as sleepwalking as these can include head injuries hyperthyroidism encephalitis stress other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea fevers and medications signs  symptoms of night terrors sleep terrors are easily detectable in most cases as the person experience them will often let out loud screams or wails that will likely wake up most people in the household it can be a scary and traumatic experience for parents or loved ones to see their children or partners in such distress as the look of fear and terror is often easily visible on the person’s face it should be remembered that sleep terrors are not dangerous and many times the victim will not fully recall the experience but go through feelings of disorientation and embarrassment more than anything else it is important not to try and wake the victim from their state but to remain by them until it passes this gives them comfort when they snap out of it and assures you that they are not getting up and moving about while still in the state potentially harming themselves or others in the process do they require any treatment sleep terrors do not often require any treatment or tests and in most children they pass before their teen years if the problem persists or in the case of sleep terrors in adults it may be helpful to talk to your doctor or consult a sleep specialist an overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram will be advised which will help determine any other sleep related factors that may be contributing to the sleep terrors and how they can be limited the polysomnogram monitors brain wave activity and can chart the areas of the brain that are being actively used prior to an episode the majority of parasomnias  including night terrors occur in the stage before deep sleep and taking measures to achieve deep sleep faster and remain in it once there can limit the number of parasomnia occurrences having proper sleeping conditions limiting any caffeine intake or the intake of any other stimulants and having routine bed times can all lead to quicker and
