deforestation is caused by the growing demand for forest products and the conversion of forest to agriculture as the human population continues to expand in 1750 cropland and pastureland occupied 67 of the global land surface by 1990 cropland and pastureland occupied 3539 of the global land surface it is estimated that the world is currently losing over 9 million hectares per year which is an area the size of portugal deforestation not only affects the climate by increasing the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide but also affects the environment by inhibiting water recycling triggering severe flooding aquifer depletion soil degradation and the extinction of plant and animal species trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis see my posting entitled the carbon cycle  cutting down forests will cause a decline in photosynthetic activity which results in the atmosphere retaining higher levels of carbon dioxide forests also store an enormous amount of organic carbon which is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide when forests are cleared by burning clearly deforestation contributes to global warming and ocean acidification see my two postings entitled solar activity greenhouse gas levels and climate change on our earth and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and ocean acidification  water recycling is the movement of rain from the forest to land masses further inland when rain falls on forests the water is intercepted by the forest canopy some of this intercepted water is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration release of water vapor into the atmosphere through stomata on tree leaves while the rest is returned to the ocean as river runoff in a healthy forest about three fourth of the intercepted water is returned to the atmosphere as moisture laden air masses which move inland cool and are converted to rain land cleared by deforestation returns only about one fourth of the rain water to the atmosphere this air mass has less moisture and delivers less rain further inland deforestation inhibits water recycling and converts inland forest to dry land and potential waste land severe flooding is a result of deforestation because removal of the forest leaves little vegetative cover to hold heavy rains the inability of land void of forest to hold heavy rain water will also trigger mudslides like the ones that have occurred in recent years in california china and other parts of the world severe flooding and mudslides are extremely costly because they devastate homes and communities the excess water from land cleared of forest becomes runoff water and enters the ocean instead of seeping downward into the soil to recharge aquifers aquifer depletion is already becoming a serious problem in certain areas of the planet and as the human population continues to grow so will the demand for fresh wateradvertisementdeforestation also results in soil degradation forests store nutrients that are required for all plant life in the tropics almost all nutrients are stored in the vegetation because tropical soil has little organic matter and almost no nutrient storage capacity if tropical forests are cleared for cropland the land will yield crops for only a few years and when the nutrients are depleted they become waste land continue reading share your thoughts sharegayboi1011132015 95623 amsometimes when i get lonely i play with my dog but not in the way you play with yours gayboi1011132015 95602 amsometimes when i get lonely i play with my dog but not in the way you play with yours mitchelldavies8122014 115450 pmhi thisguy im going to shove my dick up your arsehole u faggot fucking b13 retarded cunt more comments start a 1acre selfsufficient homestead build an outdoor stove oven grill and smoker best tips for starting seeds indoors diy wind turbine growing and using chives ehandbook from the woodfired oven handy farm devices and how to make them 2nd edition shopshopshopshoprelated content
