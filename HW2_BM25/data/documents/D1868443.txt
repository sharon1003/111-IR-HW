single parent tips should i name the father on the birth certificate by jennifer wolf updated 011318share pin email karl schatz  getty images theres a lot of confusion surrounding the issue of single mothers fathers and birth certificates first you should know that legally including the fathers name on a stateissued birth certificate requires his participation so if he happens to be unavailable—because you dont know who he is or cannot locate him—its a nonissue even if you listed him on the application it wouldnt make it onto the actual birth certificate without his signature on a legal acknowledgement of paternity form how naming the childs father can benefit your child keep in mind too that if your babys father is involved then naming him on the birth certificate doesnt necessarily benefit him but it could benefit your child for example lets say that the father died while your child was still a minor if you legally acknowledge paternity by including the father on your childs birth certificate then your child will be eligible to receive social security death benefits plus the idea that including him on the birth certificate makes it easier for him to get custody is a misconception in reality your babys father can formally request custody or visitation at any time—whether hes on the birth certificate or not all he has to do is file a request with your local family court if he were not already on the birth certificate then the courts response would include paternity testing but it wouldnt make the judge more or less likely to grant him custody or visitation in addition if you currently receive state or federal assistance in the form of temporary assistance for needy families wic section 8 housing or any other form of assistance—or if you apply for benefits in the future—the government will require you to name your childs father so that they can attempt to recover child support payments from him the bottom line ultimately the decision of whether to include your babys father on the birth certificate is an intensely personal one my advice is to consider the conversations youve had with your babys father thus far about his intentions to be involved after the baby is born if he acknowledges that the baby is his and hes going to be an active part of the childs life then id recommend going through the process of formally acknowledging paternity when you complete the initial birth certificate application more birth certificate faqs deciding whether to name your childs father on their birth certificate doesnt end there here are some quick reference answers to more of the most frequently asked questions what does the father need to do to be included on the birth certificate you would both have to sign an affidavit legally acknowledging him as the birth father the hospital can provide you with this paperwork after the birth does the father have to be present at the birth in order to be listed on the birth certificate no if he happens to be there he can fill out the paperwork in person if not he can complete the affidavit later what if hes reluctant to sign an acknowledgement of paternity unfortunately this is not uncommon formally acknowledging paternity is a huge commitment and opens the door to him being responsible for the child financially as well if hes reluctant you could request paternity testing after your baby is born if you decide to file for child support the state will conduct paternity testing for you will my baby automatically be given her fathers last name if i include him on the birth certificate no you can choose to give your baby your last name the fathers last name or a hyphenated combination of both can i add the fathers name to the birth certificate later yes if you dont include him on the birth certificate at the time of your babys birth you can later have the birth certificate amended
