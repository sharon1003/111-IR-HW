just as a heterosexual child discusses their relationships with their mothers do so with your mother it helps build a bond with her on something she might not understand very much give your mom time to come to terms with your news letting very little change in other words dont start instantly strutting around in skin tight tinyts and flaming around with a lot of gay slang its going to be important for your mom to see that youre not a different person from the one she has always known  thats hard to sell if you suddenly begin wearing mascara and womens dresses when you never did before share only what your mom is comfortable handling especially at first dont expect that shell want to hear all the sordid details of your frolics at the dance clubs or whatever keep the details of your life private unless you were accustomed to sharing on this level previously let mom guide you as to how much she is ready to hear write it in an email or on wordpad write up an introduction and it will be easier because she will be reading it for herself it really works and it takes the stress out of coming out a good way to start the talk is to start a debate with your mother on gay rights that leads you to the subject and there are many things you can do with that you can see how strong her feelings are against gay rights therefore letting you see how gently you need to push the subject or whether you should at all at that moment or try to get her to see the other way add a hypothetical situation o k suppose i or perhaps a sibling told you iheshe was gay what would you do then judge her response so you can judge how to come on her if she reacts harshly to the gay rights topic you might be better off not telling her at that moment perhaps dropping subtle hints or maybe not even telling her until you are no longer within her legal control you know youre not the person they want you to be but you do know that your the person whos happy with themselves after all theres no them in you warnings sometimes but not always fathers are not as understanding about this as mothers try to get a sense of where your father stands on homosexuality before you tell him edit related
