supplements creatine health benefits and side effects by cathy wong ndupdated august 15 2017share pin email print article table of contents overview health benefits side effects and warnings forms back to top overview creatine is a compound thats involved in the production of energy in the body in the form of adenosine triphosphate atp made in the liver approximately 95 of the bodys creatine ends up being stored in skeletal muscles and the remaining 5 is found in the brain heart and testes once its used creatine is converted to a waste product called creatinine and excreted in urine health benefits so far scientific support for the potential benefits of creatine is fairly limited1 athletic performance preliminary research suggests that creatine may provide some benefit in improving performance in highintensity shortduration activities such as weight lifting and sprinting creatine increases production of atp an energy source for muscles during brief explosive periods of activity it hasnt been found however to help with aerobic or endurance sports such as marathon running creatine may also decrease muscle fatigue it appears to reduce lactic acid an energy waste product that causes muscle fatigue related natural relief for sore muscles more research is needed on the effectiveness of creatine excess creatine is removed by the kidneys so some experts question the use of creatine supplements in people with sufficient levels of creatine in their muscles creatine is extremely popular with athletes and bodybuilders many of whom consider it to have similar effects as anabolic steroids without the side effects it hasnt been banned by many athletic associations still some organizations question whether its ethical to permit athletes to take a supplement that could potentially enhance performance others have expressed concern that use of performanceenhancing supplements could lead to the use of other potentially risky supplements and drugs2 muscle mass some studies have shown an increase in lean muscle mass with creatine it may do this because creatine in muscle attracts water more research is needed however because not all studies have confirmed this finding also studies have used different doses of creatine so its unclear what a safe or effective dose would be3 muscle weakness because creatine may strengthen muscle it has been suggested as a complementary treatment for conditions in which muscle weakness occurs such as muscular dystrophy congestive heart failure huntingtons disease mc ardles disease also called glycogen storage disease type v amyotrophic lateral sclerosis myasthenia gravis parkinsons disease and after injury or surgery the cochrane collaboration analyzed previously published studies on creatine for muscle conditions twelve trials including a total of 266 participants met their selection criteria the researchers found no improvement in muscle strength in people with genetic diseases called metabolic myopathies such as mc ardles disease creatine was however effective at improving muscle strength in people with muscular dystrophies and was welltolerated side effects and warnings in the cochrane collaboration analysis of 12 trials there were no notable adverse events reported however research on the side effects and safety of creatine supplements is still limited possible side effects of creatine include stomach cramps nausea diarrhea loss of appetite muscle cramps weight gain creatine may cause water to be drawn away from other areas of the body and into muscle tissue which could increase the risk of dehydration high doses of creatine could potentially injure the kidneys liver and heart theoretically creatine may cause kidney damage because its byproduct creatinine is filtered through the kidneys into urine although studies havent found adverse events in recommended doses there have been a couple of case reports of people who have experienced kidney collapse and three deaths in people taking creatine but there is no definitive evidence that creatine was the cause people with kidney disease or liver disease should avoid creatine creatine supplements may cause asthmatic symptoms such as wheezing and coughing in some people people with mc ardles disease shouldnt use high doses of creatine because it has been found to increase muscle pain there is some concern that oral creatine supplements are metabolized in the body to a toxic waste product formaldehyde which could potentially damage cells dna molecules and blood vessels one of the main safety concerns is that individuals using creatine to enhance athletic performance or muscle mass particularly adolescents may exceed recommended dosages and take it without supervision because creatine could theoretically affect kidney function it should not be taken with prescription drugs that could also potentially affect the kidneys such as aminoglycoside antibiotics amikacin® nebcin® immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporine and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as aspirin ibuprofen motrin® advil® naproxen naprosyn® aleve® creatine supplements should not be taken with the herb ephedra because of increased risk of side effects there was one case of stroke in a person taking creatine and ephedra although there was no definite link between the combination of herbs and the stroke it is best to avoid the combination forms creatine is found in small amounts in red meat and fish however much of it is destroyed by cooking its also made naturally in the body from larginine lglycine and lmethionine amino acids that are principally found in animal protein insulin is needed for creatine to enter muscles so consuming carbohydrates with creatine may increase the amount of creatine available to muscles creatine supplements are available in capsules or as a powder at health food stores some drug stores and online one of the most popular forms of creatine is creatine monohydrate other names creatine monohydrate creatine phosphate creatine citrate a word from verywell supplements havent been tested for safety and due to the fact that dietary supplements are largely unregulated the content of some products may differ from what is specified on the product label also keep in mind that the safety of supplements in pregnant women nursing mothers children and those with medical conditions or who are taking medications has not been established you can get tips on using supplements here  but if youre considering the use of creatine supplements talk with your primary care provider first selftreating a condition and avoiding or delaying standard care may have serious consequences sources koshy km griswold e et al interstitial nephritis in a patient
