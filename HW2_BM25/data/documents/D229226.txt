total utility and marginal utility difference between total utility and marginal utility people buy goods because they get satisfaction from them this satisfaction which the consumer experiences when he consumes a good when measured as number of utils is called utility it is here to necessary to make a distinction between total utility and marginal utility total utility tu definition and explanationtotal utility is the total satisfaction obtained from all units of a particular commodity consumed over a period of time for example a person consumes eggs and gains 50 utils of total utility this total utility is the sum of utilities from the successive units 30 utils from the first egg 15 utils from the second and 5 utils from the third egg summing up total utility is the amount of satisfaction utility obtained from consuming a particular quantity of a good or service within a given time period it is the sum of marginal utilities of each successive unit of consumption formula tu x  ∑mu x marginal utility mu definition and explanationmarginal utility means an additional or incremental utility marginal utility is the change in the total utility that results from unit one unit change in consumption of the commodity within a given period of time for example when a person increases the consumption of eggs from one egg to two eggs the total utility increases from 30 utils to 45 utils the marginal utility here would be the15 utils of the 2 nd egg consumed marginal utility thus can also be described as difference between total utility derived from one level of consumption and total utility derived from another level of consumption formula mu  ∆tu∆qit may here be noted that as a person consumes more and more units of a commodity the marginal utility of the additional units begins to diminish but the total utility goes on increasing at a diminishing rate when the marginal utility comes to zero or we say the point of satiety is reached the total utility is the maximum if consumption is increased further from this point of satiety the marginal utility becomes negative and total utility begins to diminish the relationship between total utility and marginal utility is now explained with the help of following schedule and a graph schedule units of apples consumed daily total utility in utils per day marginal utility in utils per day1 7 72 11 4 1173 13 2 13114 14 1 14135 14 0 14146 13 1 1314the above table shows that when a person consumes no apples he gets no satisfaction his total utility is zero in case he consumes one apple a day he gains seven units of satisfaction his total utility is 7 and his marginal utility is also 7 in case he consumes second apple he gains extra 4 utils mu thus given him a total utility of 11 utils from two apples his marginal utility has gone down from 7 utils to 4 utils because he has a less craving for the second apple same is the case with the consumption of third apple the marginal utility has now fallen to 2 utils while the total utility of three apples has increased to 13 utils 7  4  2 in case the consumer takes fifth apple his marginal utility falls to zero utils and if he consumes sixth apple also the total showing total utility and marginal utility is plotted in figure below diagramcurve i the total utility curves starts at the origin as zero consumption of apples yield zero utility  ii the tu curve reaches at its maximum or a peak of m when mu is zero  iii the mu curve falls through the graph a special point occurs when the consumer consumes fifth apple he gains no marginal utility from it after this point marginal utility becomes negative  iv the mu curve can be derived from the total utility curve it is the slope of the line joining two adjacent quantities on the curve for example the marginal utility of the third apple is the slope of line joining points a and b the slope of such given by the formula mu  ∆tu∆qhere mu  2 relevant articles» cardinal utility analysis» total utility and marginal utility» law of diminishing marginal utility» law of equi marginal utility» derivation of the demand curve in terms of utility analysis
