splints happen over a period of time when constant pounding and stress are placed on the bones muscles and joints of the lower leg the result is irritation and inflammation both of which cause pain

the muscles on the front of your shin rather than distributing weight evenly through your foot sudden increase in training frequency duration or intensity – anytime you violate the 10 percent rule do not increase training routines by more than 10 percent a week there is a risk of injury including shin splints old shoes – as your running shoes wear down they don’t properly absorb shock and the arch
