surface finishes pool glossary pool librarylinks pool info swimming pool cleaning faqmy pool has a bathtub ring floating oils dirt  waste can combine to form a scum line around the pool this is why tile an easily cleanable surface is placed at water level around the perimeter of the pool there are many tile cleanser products available which are applied with a scrubbing pad or brush and a little elbow grease abrasive cleaners work well but should be avoided in vinyl lined pools or pools using products such as baquacil on vinyl pools use a vinyl cleaner and on baquacil treated pools use a cleanser made without chlorine cleaning the scum inside of the skimmer frequently will help to keep the tile cleaner as scum sticks itself to clean plastic using enzyme products can reduce or eliminate the amount of attention to the scum line as the work to eat scum producing substances using enzyme products can help prevent a bathtub ring around the tiles during summer and on the walls during winter my pool is covered in leaves and debris…put on your back brace heavy leaf removal can be hard work at this stage vacuuming through the skimmer or using automatic pool cleaners are very ineffective methods both will clog up too quickly the method of choice for the pool janitor is using a leaf rake attached to a telescopic pole slowly push the leaf rake along the floor scooping up leaves into the bag work the pool in sections trying not to create leafstirring currents it takes practice and a strong back but is the most effective way to remove large volumes of leaves another method is the use of a leaf master a product by jandy attached to a telescopic pole and a garden hose the leaf master or its many copycat leaf eaters use venturi action to suck leaves up into a large attached bag as you roll the unit over the leaves its slow going but you wont have to stop to empty the bag too often and works faster with high water pressure from the garden hose if you have a polaris or other pressure side pool cleaner with an adapter in the wall you can use the booster pump to power a leaf gulper or leaf bagger there is also a jumbo sized 5 ft tall leaf bag available for those heavy jobs my pool always has    floating on top firstly you want to check the influent valves before the pump the pool janitor recommends that the skimmer pull in about 75 of the total flow into the pump for example if your pool has two influent valves a main drain and a skimmer close the main drain halfway while leaving the skimmer valve fully open if your pool has an attached spa crack the spa drain valve open slightly or leave it closed altogether if you havent purchased a leaf rake or a drag bag as i sometimes call them and are holding on to that flat dip  flip net that your builder gave you you are creating your own hell i strongly encourage the purchase of a nice leaf rake there are also chemical products which are used to keep surface tension high moving small debris to the sides of the pool another possible problem could be the condition of the weir in the skimmer you know that flapper gate thing make sure it is operating properly so that it creates a draw or waterfall into the skimmer basket also check that the water level is not so high that it is above the opening of the skimmer lastly you may need to trim some of those trees and bushes near the pool my pool for example was specifically built with no vegetation anywhere within wind shotwhat about automatic pool cleaners automatic cleaners are terrific timesavers and they also help to distribute and circulate the water while some of them decreasing the work load required of the filter there is a wide range of cleaners available for all types of pools and budgets cleaners run from 9999 to 299999 the more expensive models will vacuum more debris more efficiently and without compromising the filter system refer to the automatic swimming pool cleaner section for available cleaners from poolcentercom do i need to brush my pool regularly your pool brush attaches to the telescopic pole and is most commonly used to brush algae off of the walls to quote the pool janitor plaster pools like to be brushed brushing your pool will keep dirt from occupying the small pores and starting small organic farms steel bristled brushes called algae brushes are very effective on you guessed it algae do not use a steel brush on a vinyl lined pool done regularly brushing can also reduce the time spent vacuuming brush from the shallow end towards the deep end in overlapping strokes circle the pool towards the main drain and much of the dirt will be swept up into the filter in this manner how do i vacuum my pool unless you have an automatic cleaner an infloor cleaning system or an automatic cover or sometimes even if you doyoull need to manually vacuum the debris and heres how roll your vacuum hose straight along the length of the pool attach one of the cuffed ends onto your vacuum head which is attached to your telescopic pole extend the pole and place the head with the hose attached into the water so that it rests on the floor of the pool point the head across the pool so that it doesnt roll down the slope towards the deep end and prop the pole up against the pools edge from the point where the hose surfaces begin pushing the hose straight down into the water hand over hand until you reach the other end this is filling the hose up with water so there is no air in it which may cause difficulties for the pump when you attach the hose to the skimmer another method of priming the hose is to hold the cuffed end firmly over a return fitting to force the air out of the end attached to the vacuum head once the hose is primed remove the skimmer lid and the basket and stick the hose end into the hole at the bottom of the skimmer if it sucks it in tightly great if not you may need a threaded hose adapter to achieve a tight fit now the suction that was at the hole is now at the vacuum head do not lift the head out of the water with the hose attached or you will fill the hose with air losing prime and possibly drawing air into the pump roll the vacuum head on the floor over the debris and voila youre vacuuming the suction will gradually decrease as the pump basket fills with vacuumed debris when the pressure gauge drops andor suction is sufficiently decreased stop the pump and empty the basket if pressure rises significantly stop the pump and backwash the filter continue in this manner until the pool is clean i get no suction when i try to vacuum most systems require adjustment to the valves to increase flow in the line through which you are vacuuming you may want to close all the valves except the one on the line you are vacuuming through on some systems closing too many suction valves will cause the pump to cavitate which occurs when it is starved for water if the pump begins to shudder and make interesting noises open the valves until this ceases if your suction still sucks check that the filter is clean and the pump basket has been cleaned before vacuuming debris into the pump basket always make sure the basket is locked into place properly so that debris cannot bypass it and clog the impeller my pump loses prime when i try to vacuum if you notice that your pump begins to draw in air when you connect the hose into the skimmer possibly drawing in so much air that the pump loses its prime of water it probably originates from an old dry rotted hose with holes in it or a cavitating pump drawing air in through the plumbing or valves to check the hose hold one end tightly against your thigh while you make a tight seal with the other end around your mouth blow into the hose you should feel very strong resistance if you can blow easily the hose has one or more holes or splits in it and you may be able to hear the air being drawn through when its hooked up for vacuuming when a vacuum hose is hooked into the skimmer and perhaps some valves are closed to increase suction we are increasing the vacuum pressure in the line creating a front pressure on the pump this can cause the pump to draw air in places it normally wouldnt under lower pressure this situation should be corrected by locating the air source and making appropriate repairs more info pumpswhen i vacuum the dirt passes right through when vacuuming fine silty dirt or debris you may notice a cloudy stream of dirt coming back into the pool via the return this can continue slowly long after you stop vacuuming and can create a frustrating cycle for the pool janitor at your pool more common in sand filters than in other types the dirt can be pushed right through the filter especially one which may need a sand replacement indeed this situation may indicate internal filter problems it may also indicate a problem with the filter control valve old loose multiport or pushpull valves can allow water to bypass the filter and return to the pool unfiltered for more info on valves click on link another possibility is that the pump is oversized for the filter and is pushing the water so hard it pushes dirt right through the filter medium a sand filter actually works a little better when its a little dirty the added dirt helps to trap more dirt so dont backwash prior to vacuuming a pool with a sand filter you may also use filter aids added through the skimmer which provide a gelatinous layer on top of the sand bed to help trap dirt another tip is to vacuum to waste especially if the debris is fine silt that can clog the filter quickly to do this overfill the pool first and set the multiport valve to the drain vacuum to waste position roll out the backwash hose and vacuum the dirt and water right out of the poolto waste my coping and deck have become discolored leaves and dirt may stain concrete surfaces or after removing the winter cover you may see a pronounced color difference pressure washing can remove these soils and restore original brightness to concrete and coping stones a light acid washing on the coping stones also works very well if you don’t want to use acid algae or mildew can be lightened or killed with a light bleach solution and a scrub brush on a pole an old pool opening technique is to bucket off the deck with pool water after shocking the pool use a 5 gal bucket and go around the pool splashing a bucket full of pool water in front of you about every 10 feet my tiles have crusty white deposits called efflorescence this calcium deposit usually originates from grout or setting mortar to remove scrape it off the tilewall andor acid wash it there are products available such as clr calcium lime rust remover which can be purchased at your local hardware store will work well for such tasks muriatic acid can also be used as well but be aware that acids will affect the pool p h as it enters the water another method for removing calcium deposits is the pumice stone pumice is a light porous glassy lava stone that can be rubbed over a pool stain to remove it you can use a pumice stone that can attach to your telepole or a pumice stone that has a handle you can swim with in some areas with hard water problems like the southwestern u s service companies offer to beadblast pool tiles to restore it to like new condition don’t use a pressure washer to try to clean pool tiles it could be too strong my plaster is stained dirt leaf tannins rust and other metals and minerals can stain the finish of your plastered pool if the stain is organic left from a leaf or acorn for example a small amount of granular chlorine pool shock added at that location and allowed to settle on the stain will usually remove it instantly other nonorganic stains will not be removed by sprinkling shock over the stain do not place chlorine tablets directly into the poolthey will stain and etch the plaster although sometimes rubbing a stain with a tablet can lighten or remove it from a plaster surface if chlorine doesnt work acid usually will draining and acid washing will remove a thin layer of plaster and stains exposing fresh new looking plaster beneath a nodrain acid wash can also be performed with varying results for localized stains a stain master tool can be used to deliver acid directly to the stain stains can also be sanded with pumice stones or wetdry sandpaper adding p h decreaser granular acid to a thin sock and placing over the stain for a few minutes can work for many stains stain free is an ascorbic acid vit c product that works well on all types of pool stains on all pool types my pool is being taken over by ducks frogs insects ducks and other waterfowl can really foul the water with bacteria and phosphates they may look elegant or bucolic swimming around your pool but they should be discouraged there is a product made by lochlor called duck off that can be poured into the pool to create a surface tension that ducks and geese don’t like they can also be scared away by plastic owls or loud noise frogs can also be a nuisance pest for some pool owners place a few plastic snakes around the pool deck and keep the chlorine level up in the pool if you see frog eggs floating in the water or inside the skimmer lower the pool p h to 72 and shock the pool frog log is a product that is used as an escape ramp for frogs and other small animals and insects to exit the pool safely snakes in the pool try spreading granular sulfur around the edge of the pool deck mint leaves and lemongrass are good groundcovers to discourage snakes dried or powdered garlic can also work to keep snakes away from a pool also helpful to keep vampires from using the pool small bugs on the surface can be controlled with a product called bugoff another surface tension reducing product made by lochlor just drops of it push everything floating on the pool to the edges the main way to fight pool surface debris is to make sure your skimmers are operating properly with a functioning skimmer weir direct your return nozzles just slightly toward the surface and all facing in the same direction to help push surface debris to the skimmers close your main drain partially to increase the skimmer suction and keep the pool surface cleaner my pool hasn’t been operating in years…an uncovered stagnant pool will last only a month or so before it turns into the black lagoon pools that are covered will last much longer but if it’s been 1 year or more the pool should be drained cleaned and refilled this is usually cheaper and faster than trying to bring it back with cleaning chemicals and filtering it also allows for a light acid wash on plaster pools to remove stains and restore the whitecoat while inspecting the pool closely for any damage or needed surface repairs if the pool debris load is not too great and if visibility into the water is 1224” – you can probably bring the pool back to blue in a few weeks  if you have a large effective pool filter and  50 in chemicals per 10000 gallons my caulking around the pool is dark and ugly…the expansion joint caulking around plaster inground pools can become faded by the sun and it can also grow algae in low spots where water accumulates this can be cleaned with a weak chlorine solution in a bucket or powdered chlorine cleanser scrub it with an acid brush or other stiff brush on a pole a pressure washer can damage the caulking if the gun or wand is held too closely my skimmers are dark and ugly inside…skimmers too can get dark ugly stains and scum on the inside and the skimmer lid can become stained especially after a long winter sparingly use a phosphate free chlorine based cleanser like clorox powder or bon ami wear gloves and use a hand held scrub brush to clean the skimmer lid the rim the body and throat and gently weir of the skimmer diving boards are also brightened by a chlorine cleanser scrub my vinyl pool steps are dirty or stained…on inground vinyl pools plastic steps sections can develop stains or discolorations for above the water stains and waterline rings use a chlorinated and phosphate free cleanser like clorox or bon ami mix a few ounces of the cleanser with a small amount of water to make a paste with a gloved hand spread the paste on a textured sponge and scrub it onto the surface using splashes of water as needed do small areas rinse and scrub surface clean before it dries for below the waterline stains for allover discoloration of the step a sort of a brownishorange color try jack’s magic step stuff and some products to control the minerals and metals
