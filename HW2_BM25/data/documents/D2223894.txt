be the same as with deadpool i think hes grown limbs back but usually he just sticks the limb back against the stub until it heals also would wolverine be able to grow teeth back if he lost them i do

doesnt need to grow back bones since they are adamantium but he can regrow muscular skin tissues veins capillaries etc deadpool does it faster than wolverine but they both can regrow limbs  i would not count that in this forum i want to talk about biological nature of the healing factor this i wolud say a spirit problem wolverine killed so many peolpe that death come to kill him logan has won and now when he dies he fights for his life when he wins he must have a body to enter that is why he regenerated from skelet my opiniongbanditsaid i think if it would grow back it would be in bone but i think only deadpool can grow arms back not him  i dont think so remember deadpool has wolverine healing but its power was increased so wolverine can grow lims but slower than deadpool  a little thing i want to show you httpwwwmedgadgetcomarchivesimglimb20regenerationjpg mammals can not regenerate like that but wolverine is a mutant maybe he has that ability think about that sorry for my

initial bone fusion with adamantium had an adverse reaction and caused it to be a part of his skeleton that can grow back this new adamantium is called betaadamantium towards the end of the most recent wolverine movie the wolverine the silver samurai chops off wolvies metal claws with his heated energy katana wolverine grows his claws a few minutes afterwards just in time to kill the samurai the betaadamantium wasnt shown because i guess it takes longer to regenerate than his bone and body parts but will most likely be reformed by the beginning of days of future past baronvonsanta follow

the xmen monitoring him thought he would die he was fully recovered broken bones and ruptured organs all in less than 5 seconds 10 at the most he has regrown an entire body in less than 60 seconds the adamantium makes his bones indestructible and preserves the bone processes there isnt anything normal that can kill his bone marrow because its inside withkut it he heals at pretty insane speeds fast
