for influencing public opinion died yesterday at his home in cambridge mass he was 103 mr bernays was one of the first people to expand what had been a narrow concept of press agentry or working to influence government policy into a far more ambitious  and controversial  realm of seeking to influence and change public opinion and behavior over the years he was instrumental in the formation of opinionshaping methods that were used on behalf of many business and industrial enterprises welfare and civic groups and governments at home and abroad he helped shape public relations by favoring the use of endorsements from opinion leaders celebrities doctors and other experts to strengthen the arguments his clients wanted to make in addition he favored surveys releasing the results of experiments and polls to make a better case for his clients positions and products mr bernays a nephew of sigmund freud was born in vienna grew up in new york and made the city his longtime home and base for his public relations work doris e fleischman was his wife and partner for more than 50 years they began working together in 1919 were married in 1922 and moved to cambridge in 1962 she died in 1980 several of the societal changes that mr bernays espoused for clients have had longlasting effects for instance he was instrumental in making it acceptable for women to smoke in public sponsoring on behalf of the american tobacco companys lucky strike cigarettes demonstrations in which debutantes gathered on street corners to light up the cigarettes were even called torches of freedom on behalf of lucky strike mr bernays also undertook to alter womens fashions when surveys showed that women objected to luckies because the green package with its red bullseye clashed with the colors of their clothes he swung into action to make green fashionable there followed a green fashion luncheon green balls at which green gowns were worn and window displays of green suits and dresses the campaign was a brilliant success according to sales figures he regarded himself as a professional opinion maker who by following precise principles could produce desired changes in attitudes public relations effectively used helps validate an underlying principle of our society  competition in the market place of ideas and things he wrote in 1971 but in an interview in 1991 when he turned 100 he said public relations today is horrible any dope any nitwit any idiot can call him or herself a public relations practitioner he said he was still consulting with clients and regarded public relations loftily as a social science by the 1990s his niche in cultural history seemed assured in 1995 ann douglas a professor of english and comparative literature at columbia university wrote in terrible honesty mongrel manhattan in the 1920s farrar straus  giroux that in that era freud was the chosen mentor of madison avenue and edward bernays often called the father of public relations who orchestrated the commercialization of a culture was freuds nephew and a selfconscious popularizer of his thought one of his early public relations strokes was on behalf of venida hairnets when women began to bob their hair after world war i they discarded hairnets much to the distress of hairnet manufacturers venida an industry leader called in mr bernays who conducted a public relations campaign for the product among other things he got artists to praise the greek coiffure look that hairnets gave their wearers and he got a labor expert to urge labor commissioners around the country to insist that women working with or near machines wear hairnets for their own protection much favorable publicity ensued in this as in similar campaigns mr bernayss approach was oblique the emphasis was on hairnets not on venida indeed venida was rarely mentioned at all born on nov 22 1891 mr bernays was one of five children of ely bernays and anna freud bernays the family moved in 1892 to the united
