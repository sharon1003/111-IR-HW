talk about whiskey great beers and yummy desserts tell people what you think tom beaty· february 18 2018ya’ know we have been here lots of times the mac and cheese used to be stuff of legend but yesterday we went for brunch and was extremely disappoint ed in the food quality service was okay but m  y wife had a burger that was dry overcooked and lifeless in flavor her side of mac and cheese was horrible the cheese sauce was curdled and was starting to separate my eggs benedict was also lacking in flavor and only had a drizzle of hollandais e on it i always thought they should be slathered in it my side grits were on the dry side like they have been in a pot or on a heat rack for a while we should have just stuck with the wings they are always killer see more trevor dunnell· march 23 2018very disappoint ed with how my family and i were treated on friday march 23 the man at the door treated us wonderfull y and helped us to our table but past that that was it the party behind us was  completely drunk and belligeren t at 630pm and kept flagging down our server for every little thing and she seemed more than obliged to wait on them rather than to say hello to us we watched 2 other servers walk around our table and serve the people that came in 5 minutes after us before we realized it was 20 minutes after we had sat down and no one had come to greet us at that time we decided to get up and leave and received a have a great night by some ignorant server bartender who had to of seen us come in and saw what was happening i know it wont hurt your business but that is sad how different your servers there treat people who are regulars vs people just coming in for the 1st time dont come here if you arent apart of a specific clientele they will ignore you see more mandi mull gillis· december 22 2017food service and atmosphere were all great walked right in tonight at 630 and ate on the heated patio quick service and our server was pleasant and prompt we will definitely return patrick bliss· august 10 2017good bar with good drinks and great bar staff my only complaint is that this place is prohibiti on in name only perhaps a couple decoration s typically we go in and the jukebox is roaring whatever  toptwenty nonsense is popular at the given moment some 20sera jazz and a bit more ambience would make this a standout place among all the loud sticky bars in new bern see more lawrence mickelson· march 14 2018always have a good time there and the fellow customers are always pretty cool and fun the bartender natasha rocks as welldylan young· march 26 2018awesome bartenders great food nice place to chill martha hudson cook· october 9 2017sunday brunch was perfect  the eggs benedict and steak and eggs were amazing the grits were different but really good id definitely go again  forrest fenton· december 4 2016went there saturday night after the new bern christmas parade arrived about 430 the place was busy but not nearly packed the service was the worst i have experience d in a very long time our wa  itress did not return to our table to take our order after serving our drinks so after 1520 mins the woman working the cash register stopped by and took our order at least 4 tables of patrons had arrived after us and received their food items before us after close to an hour my wife went up to see what the hold up was and the woman who i believe was the managerowner said our food should by our shortly had it not be for the fact that we had our 3 very young grand daughters with us we surely would have walked out which a few others tables did as well our food arrived about 5 mins later the food was average at best and certainly not worth the wait highly disappoint ed and would not recommend to our friends i can understand the cooks and wait staff being behind or overwhelme d but no communicat ing this to the customer only makes matters worse see more ted michaelsen· january 4 2017if you want a real cocktail check this place out the food is great too i work a couple of blocks away and love popping in to see the owners and staff after leaving the office if youre into nc cr  aft gin lime and cucumber ask for teds drink the bartenders tell me its actually a thing now see more alejandro merizalde· september 4 2016unfortunat ely the new grill food is subpart at best the wait was extremely long only to be disappoint ed by the burned medium burger that required a chisel and hammer to get through great bar and a  tmosphere but thats the best i can say ill try this place again in a half year and see if its improved assuming the kitchen stays open that long see more adam ciochetto· october 15 2016awesome time i wanted an old fashioned but made the comment that i prefer them without cherry mush in them the bartender natasha i think asked me a few questions about what i liked and didnt like  and came up with a custom cocktail for me on the spot that was amazing i got a blackberry honey old fashioned that was unique and fun wife had a great gin rickey too not from the new bern area but will swing by when back in town visiting family see more phillip murray· november 17 2017best wings in town great service what else could you ask for i like wednesday because the wings are 10 off vito finizio· june 23 2017drinks were good food was acceptable to say the least no shrimp on the shrimp stir fry just peppers onions and rice had to ask for the shrimp � and disappoint ed robert thomas mantilla· october 26 2016never had a bad time here the bartenders are skilled mixologist that love their jobs and taking care of the consumer natasha and aaron are fun to watch you can tell they enjoy their jobs if y  oure feeling adventurou s try the deep fried burger its amazing not for you kale

walking around new bern after dinner last night and stumbled upon this awesome spot hannah i believe was her name was our bartender and she was great we had an espresso martin  i which she suggested and she was right it was delicious and an irish coffee as we shared a yummy slice of tiramisu it really was the perfect after dinner drink and dessert choice we arrived around 830 and it was pretty quiet but it quickly filled by around 9 pm or so we couldnt stay for long last night but my birthday is next week and we will definitely be back i think we may have a new go to spot for drinks with friends see more kim solock· march 26 2017me and my sister had a girls night sarurday the staff was all very nice and friendly the bartenders in the bar were amazing my sister had a delicious raspberry martini and i had a mojito they were  the best drinks at any of the bars the only critique was do the make your customer a drink and then put your hands on the straw to take a picture other than that great night wonderful atmosphere will definitely go back see more matthew rogers· october 7 2017alrighty then wings are pretty good bartender was killer joe peters· september 20 2016great
