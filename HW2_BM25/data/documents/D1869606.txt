sunday when the 62 teams head out from willow with sights set on being the first to cross the finish line in nome roughly 1100 miles to the northwest sundays start comes after saturdays ceremonial carnivallike beginning on saturday in downtown anchorage which features large crowds lining 4th avenue downtown to cheer on the mushers and their 16dogs including lance mackey who is seeking his record fifth straight iditarod win lance mackey hits the trail from kyle hopkins on vimeo so what exactly is the iditarod its a sled dog race from anchorage to nome alaska roughly 1100 miles that starts on the first saturday in march every year beginning in 1973 its nicknamed the last great race on earth and is considered one of sports more grueling events as mushers and their dog teams battle the alaskan wilderness for 817 days jagged mountain ranges frozen river dense forest desolate tundra and miles of windswept coast at the mushers and their dog teams add to that temperatures far below zero winds that can cause a complete loss of visibility the hazards of overflow long hours of darkness and treacherous climbs and side hills and you have the iditarod a race extraordinaire a race only possible in alaska why is the iditarod the race honors alaskas pioneering and brave past much of which centered around dogsledding particularly the great run of mercy in 1925 when sled dog teams brought serum to nome to prevent a diphtheria epidemic see also balto how long does it take the winners reach nome in about nine days or so the record held by fourtime winner martin buser is 8 days 22 hours 46 minutes lance mackey did it last year in 8d 23h 59m 9s  it was a record fourthstraight win how far do they race its around 1100 miles  the official course map says 1131 miles this year but no one knows for sure even global positioning systems on sleds dont count every twist and turn of the route mushers say and the exact length of the trail is unknown they cover over 1000 miles in nine days when do they sleep the mushers dont sleep really thats why theres so many sleepdeprived hallucinations really is lance mackey the favorite this year again sure is hes the first ever to win four straight iditarods and a fifth consecutive victory is possible this year he didnt run in the yukon quest  another sled dog race run every february between fairbanks alaska and whitehorse yukon considered even more difficult than the iditarod  so his team is rested and ready and mackey is already considered one of the sports greatest mushers ever after his 2010 win fellow musher hugh neff said it best he could take your dogs and beat his team with your dogs thats how good of a musher he is so its a definite win for mackey well no nine of the topten mushing teams are entered in this years race so mackey will have his competition additionally mackey is racing with a young untested team but hes still confident if people didnt think i could do four and i did why shouldnt i do five mackey said i have the ability the confidence and the dog team to do it and it should be a great race oh yeah about the dogs dont they hate this not really the dogs love to run  its literally what theyre bred to do and new studies are showing that dogs unlike humans actually get stronger during an endurance event of course though it doesnt mean its not a grueling event on the dogs  2009 was the first iditarod in which a dog did not die as such the race has plenty of opposition from peta the sled dog action coalition and the association of veterinarians for animal rights all of which think the iditarod is animal cruelty the iditarod organizers have responded with veterinary checkups for every single dog both before the race starts and then at every checkpoint along the way more than the race officials however are the mushers themselves who continually put the dogs before themselves throughout the race in 2010 sebastian schnuelle gave up his chance of winning to better care for his team and fourtime winner lance mackey famously stops before crossing the finish line to individually thank each of his dogs individually mackey won the leonhard seppala humanitarian award in 2009 awarded by veterinarians to the musher who provides outstanding dog care while remaining competitive mackey the 40yearold champion from fairbanks alaska says critics have no insight into his sport if i had an opportunity to take people who are against what we do if they came to my yard and hung out for just one day theyd probably have another opinion he says what do they win the first person to cross the finish line gets 50400 and the top30 finishers split the 528000 purse down from 875000 in 2008 what about the mushers who finishes last they get the red lantern  in this storystream iditarod
