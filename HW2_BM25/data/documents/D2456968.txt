reviews i really enjoyed it8 january 2005  by idocamstuf – see all my reviews this was a highly entertaining sleeper about a naval ship that happens to go through a time warp and end up at pearl harbor just hours before the attack in 1941 realistic acting special effects and air scenes really make this movie stand out from other similar movies im really surprised that this film is not more popular because this was a very unique and fascinating concept for a movie especially back in 1980 i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good sciencefiction film im also surprised that it has such a low rating i was expecting it to be rated at least a 7 ill give it an 8 out of 10 well worth viewing87 of 94 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report
