gaelic family this in turn was a division of the 11th century kingdom of bréifne for this reason the county is colloquially known as the breffni county 9 a high degree of defence was achieved by using the natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs the poorly drained heavy clay soils contributed as an obstacle against invasion historically cavan was part of the western province of connacht but was transferred to ulster in 1584 when bréifne was shired and became the county of cavan in the south the lough sheelin area was part of leinster until the late 14th century parts of cavan were subjected to norman influence from the twelfth century and the remains of several motte and bailie fortifications are still visible mainly in the east of the county as well as the remains of stronger works such as castlerahan and clogh oughter castle the influence of several monastic orders also owes its origins to around this time with abbey remains existent in locations such as drumlane and trinity island the plantation of ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county that include bailieborough cootehill killeshandra and virginia existing towns such as cavan and belturbet became over time more important as trading centres wars during the midseventeenth century aimed at trying to unsettle the plantation only led to further plantations of english and scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry some areas of cavan were hard hit by the great famine potato blight between 1845–49 the winter of 1847 is particularly noted for the high levels of deaths nationally caused by diseases such as typhus and cholera several instances of eviction also occurred during the nineteenth century with one such story where the local landlord in mountnugent parish decided to evict over 200 people the famous ballad by lough sheelin side is based on this event witnessed by the local catholic priest edward saunderson founder of the ulster unionist council was born in the county however when the irish unionist party met on 9 june 1916 the delegates from cavan learnt that they would not be included in any temporary exclusion of ulster from home rule they agreed only with very great reluctance 10local government and politics  editfurther information cavan county council party seats  of votes fianna fáil
