peak hour factor traffic engineers focus on the peakhour traffic volume in evaluating capacity and other parameters because it represents the most critical time period and as any motorist who travels during the morning or evening rush hours knows itâ€™s the period during which traffic volume is at its highest the analysis of level of service is based on peak rates of flow occurring within the peak hour because substantial shortterm fluctuations typically occur during an hour common practice is to use a peak 15minute rate of flow flow rates are usually expressed in vehicles per hour not vehicles per 15 minutes the relationship between the peak 15minute flow rate and the full hourly volume is given by the peakhour factor phf as shown in the following equation if 15minute periods are used the phf is computed as where v  peakhour volume vph v15  volume during the peak 15 minutes of flow veh15 minutestypical peakhour factors for freeways range between 080 and 095 lower factors are more typical for rural freeways or offpeak conditions higher factors are typical of urban and suburban peakhour conditions
