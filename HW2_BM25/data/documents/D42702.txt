consumer electronics other  electronics how many amperes amps come out of a wall outlet hey i am looking to make a transformer to turn the 120v output from my wall socket into 40v in order to perform the necessary ohms law equations i need to know how many amps a typical 120 volt wall outlet outputs oddly enough i cant find this anywhere on the internet follow 9 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer 20 amps is the maximum current typically allowed by most building codes check your area for exact building codes most circuit breakers in the house will be 15 amp for lighting 20 amp for plugs warning 1 put a fuse in line before your circuit it might allow you to collect insurance after you burn your house down vacuum cleaners are a perfect example of a probably the highest current load you will plug into the wall in a normal household most are limited to 15 amps but the actual current is determined by the load 110 volt to 40 volt transformer using some simple calculations 3 turns on the primary 110 volts and 1 turn on the secondary side will get you 363volts close keep in mind that the ac voltage coming out of the socket will vary during the day from 120 down to 100 volts also the small number of windings will be inneficient due to the energy lost in the poor magnetic coupling the more windings the more efficient to a point your transformer will be 8 windings to 3 gets you 41 volts 11 windings to 4 gets you 40 volts keeping it below 15 amps lets say 10 amp load on the 110 side this would be 275 amps on the secondary 40 volt side but again it depends upon the load you are plugging in on the secondary side note current kills not voltage so you better be careful also wire does not have a resistance of zero if you use two thin of a wire it will heat up and could catch fire you might want to get a simple hvac controller transformer these convert 110 volts to 24 volts remove a few turns on the secondary side and your done seriously if you dont know what you are doing dont mess with it ive been an electrical engineer for over 20 years and i dont like messing with high voltage stuff i might have better recommendations

ago0 0 comment in the u s several different amperages are standard for household circuits dont take the standard for granted 1 theres no guarantee that the electrical work was done to standard by licensed electricians 2 even if the work was done by licensed electricians it may have been done years ago and not reflect the current national electrical code requirements 3 a lot of homes have had home handymen make changes quite often with no regard to nec standards easy enough to use a multimeter to measure the actual amperage voltage at any particular outlet luminaire light fixture switch etc that sais heres a quick overview 15a circuits living room hallway bedroom wall outlets light fixtures are generally on 15a circuits 20a circuits kitchen countertop receptacles are often wired with 20a circuits due to the higher loads required to operate multiple small appliances simultaneously 30a40a circuits some kitchen ranges are heavier load so the range circuits are often wired on a separate circuit with a higher capacity  generally wired to a separate fuse breaker in the breaker box laundry dryers quite often a 240 volt circuit may have different amperagedspcpa · 4 years ago0 0 comment amperage can vary say for instance you have a 120v outlet on a 15amp circuit breaker then you could say that the maximum amperage for that outlet is 15 amps assuming this is the only outlet on that circuit if i may ask what do you have that runs on 40volts ac are you sure you need ac not dc i do not know of anything that runs on 40vt ac hope this helps michael · 10 years ago1 0 comment your load will draw as many amps as it needs if it draws more than the circuit allows the circuit breaker or fuse with tripblow a typical 120v convenience outlet is protected with 15 or 20a protection it should draw no more than 80 of that what you need to be concerned with is va in that the va out does not exceed the available va in with a 120v 15a circuit you can use 1440va at 40v that is about 30a including transformer lossesclassicsat · 10 years ago0 0 comment it depends on what you plug into it the amount of current that flows along a path from one point to another is the voltage between the two points divided by the resistance along the path between them if nothing is plugged in then the current is 0 amps if you plug in a device with a resistance of 120 ohms then 1 amp will flow if you plug in a device with a resistance of 240 ohms then 05 amps will flow of course there are more complicated things that can happen too if the device plugged in is not as simple as a resistance michelle · 2 years ago0 0 comment in the uscanada its 15a you can pull more but you risk damage hence most circuits are fused at 15a so with a 100 efficient transformer you could have an output of 45a  40v which is a lot no transformer will be completely efficient though since youre making it yourself you should be aware you are working with lethal currents so please shield everything correctly and fuse the hell out of it why make one instead of buying a transformer theres many out there and for a small step down like this they will be cheap be safe eh mmal · 10 years ago0 0 comment most household circuits are 1015 amps look in your electrical box at the circuit breaker for the circuit you will be using read the amperage off the front of the breakerdoanenut · 10 years ago0 1 commentvoltamps
