123 0 0in the warmer months i crave cool white wines and fresh seafood being landlocked in the middle of the country here in st louis one would think i wouldn’t have much opportunity for good seafood luckily we have bob’s seafood it’s a hike for me from south county but so worth the trip and when i saw the grouper i couldn’t wait to get some home and on the grill grouper is not meaty like a swordfish or flaky like a roughy it’s sort of in between and to me it’s almost perfect ingredients2 grouper filets approximately 6 ounces each 4 tbsp butter 4 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp grated asiago any hard cheese will do 1 tsp garlic minced 1 tsp crawdad’s classics bbq rub 1 tbsp fresh herbs i used chives and tarragon but marjoram or basil will work as wellyield serves 2the ingredients now i didn’t use that entire hunk of grouper that chunk was a little over a pound i sliced it into three nice filets about 6 ounces each here are two of them with the chopped tarragon and chives filets and the chopped herbs melt the butter in a pan along with the garlic olive oil asiago and a teaspoon of crawdad’s classics bbq rub adding the crawdad’s classics the sauce remove the pot from the stove and let cool don’t let it get cold as it will solidify just allow it to come down from a simmer to warm hit each side of the grouper filets with some coarse salt and then prep the grill prepare the grill for high heat direct grilling and while grouper is not the flakiest of fish it can fall apart on the grill so a grill pan is highly recommended the grill pan now dunk the grouper in the pot to coat them in the buttergarliccheeseoilrub mixture dunking the filets flip over and brush the garlic over each grouper filet brushing the top with the garlic then put the grill pan right over the coals and allow it to heat up before putting the grouper on the pan pan searing on the grill expect a little flare up as the butteroil sauce is very liquid and very flammable but the grill pan should help to mitigate the effect don’t sweat the flare ups oh and i would highly recommend a nice big metal spatula as tongs can mangle grilled grouper even if cooked in a grill pan and ruin the presentation make sure you have a good spatula after about four minutes depending on the heat of your fire the pan grilled grouper should be nicely browned so flip browned and flipped then brush the grouper with the sauce brush the pan grilled grouper with the sauce after another four to five minutes over the high heat the grouper filets firm up nicely and is browned on the other side remove from the grill pan and plate plated then sprinkle the fresh herbs hit it with a little herbs and the other grouper filet the other filet this is a wonderful savory fresh pan grilled grouper recipe that was fantastic on a warm
