scientific classification and names  translations a bat by any other nameis a bat sowhat are these fancy names and what do they mean classification taxonomy scientific names these terms are enough to send chills down the backs of those who have taken an introductory zoology course and for the rest a miasma of terms that might as well be a foreign language well in fact it is as humans we seem to enjoy naming things – our cars pets and computers – but why do scientists need such complicated terms common names may or may not be of any help after all in nebraska a gopher is a rodent while in florida a gopher is a turtle  go figure other problems exist such as finding enough names to cover 45000 chordate species 120000 mollusk species and the five million or so insect species alive today on our planet to solve these problems carolus linnaeus 17071778 prepared a classification scheme that we still use today at the heart of it are latinized binomials ie twopart names that use rootwords of a language that most of us dont think very much about these days  latin sometimes greek often latinized names are intentionally descriptive  marmota flaviventris one who lives among the rocks  yellow belly  yellow bellied marmot sometimes they honor a special scientist  koopmania concolor  koopmans uniformlycolored bat named after the late karl koopman one of the worlds most respected bat taxonomists and sometimes they use common immediately recognizable commonlyheard terms  bison bison the american bison when mixed around there are plenty of latin roots and latinized terms to keep systematists quite content perhaps someday one of them will explain to me why the american robin was named turdus migratorius  when we use this detailed terminology we must relate the entire binomial genus and species capitalize the genus and if we need to save space we can abbreviate the genus name eg homo sapiens h sapiens equipped with our binomials we are faced with a greater challenge of fitting each taxon species into the greater framework keep in mind that of the nearly 4000 species of mammals that are still alive on our planet we are but one homo sapiens remember class order family genus species each category is progressively more narrowly defined such that humans are classified as vertebrata mammalia primates hominidae homo sapiens translation we are animals with backbones we are warm blooded and the females produce milk we are bipeds with relatively unspecialized skeletons and large brains for our body size we have really really large brains for those of us wishing to study vampire bats vertebrata mammalia chiroptera phyllostomidae desmodontidae desmodus rotundus for those of you wishing to wardoff vampires garlic monocotyledoneae liliales liliaceae allium sativum does quite nicely bats belong to the mammalian order chiroptera the term is derived from two words that pretty much sum it all up chirohand  pterowing  handwing bats fly with wings that are really greatly expanded hands within the order there are two distinct kinds infraorders of bats the megachiroptera and the microchiroptera literally the big and little bats note there is some argument as to the exact number of bat species and even bat genera herein i will follow the statistics listed in walkers bats of the world nowak 1991 isbn 0801849861 the megabats aka megas old world fruit bats flying foxes arent particularly huge as the name would imply but are goodsized animals in the grand scale of things note human beings are very large animals and are ranked in the top 5 of mammals on the basis of body size megabats have large eyes and large brains and range from 15 to 1500 grams in body size if converted to common weight say a quarter 25¢ then megas range from 3300 quarters  up to about 3 pounds megabats have never evolved true echolocation though several species within the genus rousettus do quite well at navigating using tongueclicking noises when they are in caves or in dark jungles megas are most often active during the daytime when they forage for fruit pollen and nectar several species have distinct faces that resemble those of foxes and it is incorrect to apply the term flying foxes to all megas most megabats are communal that is they live in family groups in tropical and subtropical regions of the old world africa asia australia south pacific there is only one family of megachiroptera pteropodidae that is further divided into three distinct subgroups subfamilies with 42 genera and 166 distinct species subfamily pteropodinae flying foxes subfamily macroglossinae longtongued bats subfamily nyctimeninae tubenosed bats the microsmicrobats arent really all that small actually many of the largest microbats are considerably larger than the smallest megabats range 2190 grams the weight of a single penny up to a small sack of 33 quarters microbats navigate through the night skies with the aid of ultrasonic echolocation  vocal cries produced in the voice box larynx as a group microbats exhibit an extraordinary degree of anatomical and ecological diversity their eyes may be large or small their faces may or may not be adorned with fleshy pads of skin that aid echolocation nose leafs are attached to bats that emit their echolocation calls through their noses their ears may be small and mouselike or the ears may be longer than the bats entire body they are found worldwide with the rule of thumb that if there are insects present microbats wont be too far behind though each species has specific dietary needs and tastes as a group the microchiroptera will eat just about everything fruit nectar pollen insects fish amphibians reptiles birds and mammals including other bats it is easiest to pool the microchiroptera into four distinct subgroups superfamilies of microbats with 135 genera and 759 distinct species the superfamily emballonuroidea these are small insectivorous plainfaced plaineared bats that are relatively primitive in form family rhinopomatidae mousetailed bats family emballonuridae sacwinged sheathtailed and ghost bats family craseonycteridae hognosed bats the superfamily rhinolophoidea these are nasalemitting bats that range in size and have very unique facial features including noseleaves that aid in echolocation family nycteridae slit faced bats family megadermatidae false vampire and yellowwinged bats family rhinolophidae horseshoe bats family hipposideridae old world leafnosed bats the superfamily phyllostomoidea this is an incredibly diverse group that includes carnivores frugivores and insectivores presently there is a great deal of research exploring the relationships within this complex group family mystacinidae new zealand shorttailed bats family noctilionidae fisherman bats family mormoopidae moustached and nakedbacked bats family phyllostomidae new world leafnosed bats alone the phyllostomids are a huge 148 species and incredibly diverse group including large carnivores vampire bats delicate nectarfeeding bats small insectivores and a large variety of fruit bats the superfamily vespertilionoidea are generally small insectivorous plainfaced bats family natalidae funnel eared bats family furipteridae thumbless bats family thyropteridae new world suckerfooted bats f family myzopodidae old world suckerfooted bats family molossidae freetailed and mastiff bats these are the bats found in carlsbad caverns the interstate bridge in austin texas or in bcis bracken cave family vespertilionidae vespertilionid bats are found worldwide all of our pacific northwest bats are vespertilionids pacific northwest bats now its your turn below you will find a listing of our local bats  all of them are microchiropteran vespertilionids perhaps the scientific names will be
