subscribe to our weekly outlook tips learn something new about outlook every weekemail first last privacy statement if you just want to know the technical details about using outlook flags for followup you can skip straight to the section on using outlook flags the importance of follow up in business and sales whether in web marketing or more traditional offline marketing followup is one of those fundamentals that everyone understands the importance of — but that few do wholeheartedly — and that even fewer do systematically a study done by the association of sales executives revealed that 81 of all sales in a businesstobusiness environment ie not the consumer goods marketplace happen on or after the fifth contact that is most prospects simply dont buy the first time they make contact with you they have to encounter a marketing message or engage with the company selling the particular product multiple times before making a purchasing decision this makes followup an essential ingredient in the selling process the tragedy is almost 80  of salespeople give up after the second contact usually not because they don’t want to or are not motivated to but because they simply do not have an organized mechanism to keep track of any ever increasing number of contacts who need return calls at differing times in the future obviously the frequency and amount of follow up needed depends on the complexity of what is being sold and its life span generally the higher the value of the item for sale the longer the associated sales cycle and corresponding usage cycle and therefore the greater the need for consistent followup so following up is an important aspect in developing your business it helps you build trusting ongoing relationships with your clients and the most significant sales are usually the result of these relationships there are at least four obvious advantages of the following up process winning the business as mentioned above if over 80  of sales are made after the 5th contact and these contacts may be made over a long period of time often several months or in some cases years it is imperative to be able to maintain contact with an increasing number of prospects and get back to each of them at the required point in time keeping your actual customers regularly following up with your customers will convince them they’ve made a good choice doing business with you gain their trust and the next time they will want to purchase they will look no further than you added to this is the fact that it will usually only cost 10 to 15 percent of your marketing budget to secure additional business from existing customers as opposed to consuming 100 percent of your marketing costs to get business from new customers put another way it’s 10 times harder to get business from a new customer than to win repeat or additional business from an existing customer generating referrals a satisfied client will usually tell his or her friends about you having already experienced the benefits of your services he will talk to them with firsthand knowledge and you may get valuable referrals as a result of this sustaining a longterm campaign your business grows in the moments between sales followup campaigns require a lot of your attention and effort but they are a step towards new deals there are at least four methods that you can use to make your followup efficient postsale feedback after completing a deal with a customer call him or her and ask if they were pleased with the service provided what they like most about working with you and

back systematic followup the effectiveness of followup is dramatically increased when it is done systematically and consistently many people think that they are capable of handling all their followups without an organized system but usually they are just not aware of how much business they’re losing because they actually cannot cope with the amount of followup required using a computerized contact management system to track your connections with people and to systematize the process will generally cause your business opportunities to explode outlook already has the basic mechanisms required to manage your contacts and keep track of when they should be called back the contacts calendar and tasks facilities are generally used for this for a system that enhances outlook’s capabilities in this area see the description of mxcontact at the end of this article which adds to outlook’s functionality however outlook has another mechanism that is very useful for basic followups namely flags using outlook flags flags are used as followups and reminders on email messages and contacts you use outlook flags to remind yourself to follow up on an issue or to indicate a request for someone else a reminder date and time can also be added and displays in the reminder window there are 6 different coloured flags available for emails you use the colored message flags to manage your incoming email items by flagging the items for different kinds of followup for example use the red flag to mark messages that require immediate attention and the blue flag for messages to read later when you add a message flag the background color of the flag status column changes color to make it easy for you to quickly find items in the message list while scrolling items you add a message flag to will automatically display in the for follow up search folder however an email item sent to you with a message flag will not appear in this search folder unless you add a flag to the item adding a flag to flag an email or contact for followup do the following in the message or contact click the follow up icon in the flag to list select the text you want or type your own in the flag color list select the color flag you want note the flag color option is not available for contacts enter a date and time in the due by boxes on clicking ok note that the email message is now marked to be followed up in this case read by monday 8 may at 1000 am on monday a reminder will automatically appear at 1000 am prompting you to read the email or call the contact as the case may be creating views to organize your followups once you marked various items to be followup you need to create a series of views to focus on items to be followed up create a view called flagged messages with the filter set to only items which have a colored flag you can group the view by follow up flag if necessary apply the view creating a selection of views sorted and grouped by flag status  color  follow up flag will help you organise yourself in terms of which items need action and what the priority of these followups is note for more details on creating views see the following article profiling contacts  creating views marking an item complete once you have done the followup you can mark the item complete do the following if it’s an email message clicking on the flag status column will mark the email complete alternatively you may rightclick on the email and select the options from the follow up menu creating a flag toolbar you might find it useful to add a text label to the colored quick flags you use to help you keep track of what each colorcoded flag means to name your quick flags just add them to an existing or custom toolbar and then label each flag you can name each flag anything you want adding a name to a quick flag does not apply a category or add functionality to a flag instead it is a just a way for you to remember what each flag color means to you in outlook rightclick any toolbar and then click customize on the toolbars tab click new and then after you name the toolbar drag that toolbar to where you want it to be in the customize dialog box on the commands tab under categories click actions and then drag a flag such as the red flag to the new toolbar rightclick the flag in the new toolbar and then on the shortcut menu click image and text rightclick the flag again and in the name box type the name for the flag for example urgent if you want to use a keyboard shortcut for the quick flag type  urgent which allows you to activate the flag by pressing altu note make sure you put the ampersand  before a letter that is not being used as a keyboard shortcut by another button on any toolbar in outlook for example call back allows you to activate the flag by pressing altk as long as no other buttons use altk as a keyboard shortcut after you have added all of the flags you want on the toolbar click close in the customize dialog box
