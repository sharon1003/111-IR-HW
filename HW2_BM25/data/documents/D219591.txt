britains influence in latin america was enormous after independence came in the 1820s britain deliberately sought to replace the spanish in economic and cultural affairs military issues and colonization were minor factors the influence was exerted through diplomacy trade banking and investment in railways and mines the english language and british cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young british business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers where they inviting locals into the british leisure activities such as organized sports and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as schools and clubs the british role never disappeared but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the british cashed in their investments to pay for their great war and the united states moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms 6sports  editthe british impact on sports was overwhelming as latin america enthusiastically took up football  called fútbol in spanish in argentina rugby polo tennis and golf became important in middleclass leisure cricket was ignored 7in some parts of the caribbean and central america baseball outshined soccer in terms of popularity the sport started in the late 19th century when sugar companies imported cane cutters from the british caribbean during their free time the workers would play cricket but later during the long period of us military occupation cricket gave way to baseball which rapidly assumed widespread popularity although cricket remains the favorite in the british caribbean baseball had the greatest following in those nations occupied at length by the us military especially the dominican republic and cuba as well as nicaragua panama and puerto rico all of these countries have emerged as sources of baseball talent since many players hone their skills on local teams or in “academies” managed by the us major leagues to cultivate the most promising young men for

then into latin america joaquín torres garcía and manuel rendón have been credited with bringing the constructivist movement into latin america from europe an important artistic movement generated in latin america is muralism represented by diego rivera david alfaro siqueiros josé clemente orozco rufino tamayo and many others in mexico and santiago martinez delgado pedro nel gómez in colombia

american literature see also list of latin american writers precolumbian cultures were primarily oral though the aztecs and mayans for instance produced elaborate codices oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of european colonizers as was the case with the popol vuh moreover a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day for instance among the quechua speaking population of peru and the quiché of guatemala from the very moment of europes discovery of the continent early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and crónicas of their experience—such as columbus s letters or bernal díaz del castillo s description of the conquest of mexico during the colonial period written culture was often in the hands of the church within which context sor juana inés de la cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays towards the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged including the first novels such as lizardis el periquillo sarniento 1816 the 19th century was a period of foundational fictions in critic doris sommer s words novels in the romantic or naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of civilization or barbarism for which see say domingo sarmiento s facundo 1845 juan león mera s cumandá 1879 or euclides da cunha s os sertões 1902 at the turn of the 20th century modernismo emerged a poetic movement whose founding text was rubén darío s azul 1888 this was the first latin american literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region and was also the first truly latin american literature in that national differences were no longer so much at issue  citation needed josé martí for instance though a cuban patriot also lived in mexico and the united states and wrote for journals in argentina and elsewhere however what really put latin american literature on the global map was no doubt the literary boom of the 1960s and 1970s  citation needed distinguished by daring and experimental novels such as julio cortázar s rayuela 1963 that were frequently published in spain and quickly translated into english the booms defining novel was gabriel garcía márquez s cien años de soledad 1967 which led to the association of latin american literature with magic realism though other important writers of the period such as mario vargas llosa and carlos fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework arguably the booms culmination was augusto roa bastos s monumental yo el supremo 1974 in the wake of the boom influential precursors such as juan rulfo alejo carpentier and above all jorge luis borges were also rediscovered contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied ranging from the bestselling paulo coelho and isabel allende to the more avantgarde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as giannina braschi diamela eltit ricardo piglia roberto bolaño or daniel sada there has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimony texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as rigoberta menchú finally a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic carlos monsiváis and pedro lemebel the region boasts six nobel prizewinners in addition to the colombian garcía márquez 1982 also the chilean poet gabriela mistral 1945 the guatemalan novelist miguel ángel asturias 1967 the chilean poet pablo neruda 1971 the mexican poet and

and herbert spencer in england exerted a strong influence on intellectuals experts and writers in most of the region 9 10intellectuals embraced positivism with enthusiasm as they say it as the key to modernization of their economies and societies and a weapon to break the old colonial patterns that still survived 11 positivism influenced government policy in mexico for example the administration of president porfirio díaz 1876 to 1911 relied heavily on a group of scientific and technocratic advisors who reflected positivist thinking 12music  editmain article music of latin america latin

andean flute music has played an important part in latin americas turbulent recent history for example the nueva canción movement latin music is very diverse with the only truly unifying thread being the use of the spanish language or in brazil its close cousin the portuguese language 13latin america can be divided into several musical areas andean music for example includes the countries of western south america typically peru bolivia argentina ecuador chile and venezuela central american music includes nicaragua el salvador belize guatemala honduras and costa rica caribbean music includes the caribbean coast of colombia panama and many spanish and frenchspeaking islands in the caribbean including haiti the dominican republic cuba puerto rico and the less noted martinique and guadeloupe the inclusion of the french west indies varies by scholars 14 brazil perhaps constitutes its own musical area both because of its large size and incredible diversity as well as its unique history as a portuguese colony although spain isnt a part of latin america spanish music and portuguese music and latin american music strongly crossfertilized each other but latin music also absorbed influences from the anglosaxon world and particularly african music one of the main characteristics of latin american music is its diversity from the lively rhythms of central america and the caribbean to the more austere sounds of southern south america another feature of latin american music is its original blending of the variety of styles that arrived in the americas and became influential from the early spanish and european baroque to the different beats of the african rhythms latinocaribbean music such as salsa merengue bachata etc are styles of music that have been strongly influenced by african rhythms and melodies 15 16other musical genres of latin america include the argentine and uruguayan tango the colombian cumbia and vallenato mexican bolero ranchera

brazil samba american jazz european classical music and choro combined into bossa nova recently the haitian kompa has become increasingly popular 17the classical composer heitor villalobos 1887–1959 worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of brazil the traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works 18 also notable is the much recent work of the cuban leo brouwer and guitar work of the venezuelan antonio lauro and the paraguayan agustín barrios arguably the main contribution to music entered through folklore where the true soul of the latin american and caribbean countries is expressed musicians such as atahualpa yupanqui violeta parra víctor jara mercedes sosa jorge negrete caetano veloso yma sumac and others gave magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach for examplethe uruguayan born and first latin american musician to win an oscar prize jorge drexler 19 latin pop including many forms of rock is popular in

dance singing of poetry song theatrical skits mime acrobatics and magic shows the performers were trained they wore costumes masks makeup wigs platforms had been erected to enhance visibility the ‘sets’ were decorated with branches from trees and other natural objects 21the europeans used this to their advantage for the first fifty years after the conquest the missionaries used theatre widely to spread the christian doctrine to a population accustomed to the visual and oral quality of spectacle and thus maintaining a form of cultural hegemony it was more effective to use the indigenous forms of communication than to put an end to the ‘pagan’ practices the conquerors took out the content of the spectacles retained the trappings and used them to convey their own message 22prehispanic rituals were how the indigenous came in contact with the divine spaniards used plays to christianize and colonize the indigenous peoples of the americas in the 16th century 23 theatre was a potent tool in manipulating a population already accustomed to spectacle theatre became a tool for political hold on latin america by colonialist theatre by using indigenous performance practices to manipulate the population 24theatre provided a way for the indigenous people were forced to participate in the drama of their own defeat in 1599 the jesuits even used cadavers of native americans to

colonizers primarily at the service of the administration 22after the large decrease in the native population the indigenous consciousness and identity in theatre disappeared though pieces did have indigenous elements to them 26 the theatre that progressed in latin america is argued to be theatre that the conquerors brought to the americas not the theatre of the americas 27progression in
