if you drive a vehicle less than 10 years old its probably equipped with some type of antilock brake system most drivers arent aware of using antilock brakes abs stands for antilock brake system but abs can prevent accidents especially in a panic stop with a less experienced driver the purpose of absto understand the purpose of abs you need to know some basics what makes a car stop im not going into how hydraulic brakes work see my article on brakes to learn more about what makes a car stop basically when you press the brake pedal the brakes slow the wheel and tire down slowing the vehicle down also in normal braking the wheel keeps constant contact with the road and the brakes make the car come to a full stop at some point however if you press the brake pedal hard enough and are going fast enough the wheel will lock up at this point the wheel is no longer turning but the vehicle is still moving the tire is skidding and a skidding tire has very little traction it is no longer slowing the car down nearly as fast as when the tire had traction and the brakes were slowing it down locking up the brakes is kind of like burning rubber on a hot rod but in reverse you can spin the tires on a hot rod and make a lot of smoke and noise but not move an inch squealing tires when you apply the brakes mean youre not slowing down much heres a hilarious video on youtube of a lamborghini driven by an idiot  notice how the car completely loses control after the wheels lock upthe old drivers trick for this is to release the brakes and then reapply them the old adage used to be that you should pump your brakes in a panic stop i never advocated pumping brakes exactly a good driver senses a skid and releases the brakes slightly maintaining a pressure just short of the tire skidding with antilock brakes abs a computer does this for you every driver on the road is not an expert driver an inexperienced driver will freeze in a panic stop press the brakes as hard as they can lock up all 4 wheels and skid into whatever they were trying to stop for antilock brakes abs to the rescue car makers developed antilock brakes abs stands for antilock brake system many years ago but recently with the advent of cheap computer stuff along with the encouragement of u s auto safety regulators theyve started putting abs brakes on just about every vehicle the abs computer senses the speed of the wheels through sensors at each wheel when a wheel slows down a lot slower than all the other wheels the computer releases the brakes on that wheel almost immediately the computer reapplies the brakes the computer is in effect pumping the brakes for you but doing it much faster than you could it also can release brakes on just the wheel s that are skidding something you cant do by pedal pumping abs could rescue you from a bad situationsafety warning a warning about abs operation and safety when the abs operates the rapid applying and releasing or pumping of the brakes by the computer can make a rather loud noise and vibration the first time i worked on a car with abs i thought id check it out when the abs kicked in during my test i thought i had broken something on the car the vibration freaked me outwhen abs brakes were first introduced a trend was noticed rear end collisions actually increased in cars with 4 wheel antilock brakes the theory was that the noise and vibration the brakes make when the abs operates freaked out drivers who released the brakes then rear ended the car in front of them my advice my advice is to get out on an open stretch of road with no one around and try stopping as hard as you can a few times get used to the abs experience so the vibration abs makes wont freak you out if the abs system activates in a panic stop if the abs kicks in during a panic stop dont release the brakes it should stop you as fast or faster than an expert driver in the same circumstance pumping his brakes remember the vibration of abs is just normal operationthe absolute fastest stop still happens when you are right on the verge of the wheel locking up but not quite when the abs activates it means the brakes have been applied too hard and a wheel has locked up thus an experienced or very careful driver may never use the antilock brakes or at least never notice its operation antilock can help even the best driversif a single wheel loses traction on braking like when one wheel hits a puddle or slick spot antilock can release the brakes on just that one wheel and leave the others alone thats why the first and most high tech antilock brakes appeared in the sports car and racing industry helping the best drivers in the world close to follow were tractortrailer rigs antilock brakes for the trailer and the rear wheels of the tractor have been common for quite some time antiskid systemssome cars now use the antilock brake system as a antiskid system also if a wheel breaks loose losing traction the brakes will apply to that wheel until its speed matches the other wheels this keeps traction on the wheel and distributes power to the other wheel s which have better grip on the road these cars cant get stuck in the mud with one tire still and the other one spinning digging a hole in the dirt heres the national highway and traffic safety administration article on antilock brake systems help support this website click here the

and opened my car repair business originally it was out of the back of a 1963 chevrolet wagon but in 1977 a fellow mechanic and i opened an auto repair shop with actual walls etc i stayed in the same location for 26 years and recently moved my operation to property i bought 15 miles east of gainesville i am doing most all the repairs myself now having reduced my overhead from 1500 per month to practically nothing i do work by appointment only i mostly work only on my established customers cars but i will occasionally take on new clients email me and i will either make arrangements to look at your car or i will recommend you to someone who will george g scott jr
