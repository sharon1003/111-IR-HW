configurations the use of each of the following firewall configurations allows direct internet access to your network please use caution and employ recommended best practices to keep your network secure configuration common setup port forwarding a small number of computers behind the residential gateway running a small number of programs that require open ports dmzplus only one computer needs to be listening to incoming connections but it needs to listen on a large number of discontinuous or changing ports all unspecified incoming connections will be routed to the computer using dmzplus mode but the pace firewall will still be in place lan subports the recommended configuration if youd like to use your own router behind the pace residential gateway this configuration allows a device plugged into a specified ethernet port to bypass the pace firewall and nat table and obtain its own public ip address this configuration will not work if your circuit has been assigned a single static ip address bridged mode best used when you do not want to use the residential gateway as a router or wireless access point this prevents it from downloading automatic firmware updates or allowing support access to it during troubleshooting support encourages the use of lan subports as an alternative port forwarding to enable port forwarding first browse to httpgatewaysonicnet or 192168421 while connected to your residential gateway browse to settings  firewall  applications pinholes and dmz start by finding your computer by its hostname in the list of connected machines and clicking on it you may be asked to type in the password for your residential gateway this can be found printed on a sticker below your wireless key on the side of your residential gateway next youll need to determine if the application for which you want to set up port forwarding is listed in the preset list of applications if you find your application simply select it and click add then click save at the bottom of the page custom application if you cannot find your application click the add a new userdefined application link below the list create an application profile name that you can remember easily and specify the protocol and port range for your application no other fields are required click add to list then click back to return to the previous screen make sure to reselect the computer you want to forward traffic to first then find the application profile name you just typed in the application list click add to add it to the list of hosted applications then click save lan subports lan subports allow you to bridge any number of ethernet ports on the gateway this setup is ideal for customers who want to use their own router behind the pace gateway lan subports will not work with single static ip address after enabling lan subports you will need to turn your gateway off and back on again setup log into the residential gateways interface by surfing to http192168421 old versions
