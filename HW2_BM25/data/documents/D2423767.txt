earthing electrode pipenext  earthing electrode pipe previous send inquiry product code  eep 02product description in todays life style we cant imagine human life without electricity as almost every works depends on it so we can say that electricity is a life saviour but if electricity is not handled properly it can also be a threat to life to avoid these scenarios earthing system have been developed earthing also known as grounding is the process of discharging the excess current to the ground basically it is done to immediately discharge the electrical energy built up in installations in order to prevent damages both to the equipment and human life to perform this process a path is created from an electrical instrument to earth with zero potential through gi earthing pipes or earthing electrode as the current flows from higher to lower potential to perform earthing earthing pipe earthing electrode is scientifically developed equipment which ensure proper earthing of electricity during domestic or industrial installation these earthing pipes are galvanised and planted in the ground by auger method technically earthing pipes are known as earthing electrode pipes these are suitable for all types of installation right from domestic to power stations these are widely used in electrical installation transmission line in transformer earthing and other such applications copper pipe is commonly used as earthing electrode pipeearthing pipe the size of the pipe depends upon the current to be carried and type of soil usually the pipe used for this purpose is of 38mm and 25m in length the depth at which the pipe must be buried depends upon the moisture of the ground based on latest technology we manufacture all types of electrical earthing pipes earthing pipe electrode earthing copper pipes and more our range of earthing electrode pipe assure safe and higher earthing provision because we use optimum quality raw material in the manufacturing of these pipes and our state of art manufacturing unit is well equipped with modern tools and machinery that enables us in the smooth production of our exclusive gamut in adherence to the demands and specification of our esteemed clients earthing electrode pipe features low electrical resistance and high corrosion resistance connectivity up to chamber or earth terminals reliable durable and easy to handle highly secure and well tested by using latest technology optimum quality performance and available in different sizes sanjay casting  engineering companycontact us   represents compulsory fields describe your requirements in detail tips on getting accurate quotes please include product name order quantity usage special requests if any in your inquiry i am interested in your products please contact me back on emailphone select a file to upload email mobile no other products in earthing materials category ball and socket cleavage send inquiry transmission line spacer send inquiry aluminium tension clamps send inquiry gi pipe electrode send inquiry cast iron earth plates send inquiry earthing strip send inquiry back
