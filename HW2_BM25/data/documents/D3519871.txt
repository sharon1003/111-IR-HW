insurance costs and healthcare reform are health insurers making huge profits not exactly but the more important question is what value they create democracy in america mar 5th 2010by m s yesterday barack obama dropped in on kathleen sibeliuss meeting with executives of americas top five health insurers and read a letter from a constituent natoma canfield a selfemployed house cleaner had carcinoma 16 years ago it has been in remission for 11 years last year anthem blue cross who provide her with a highdeductible 2500 individual plan raised her premiums 25 to 6075 this year theyre raising them another 40 to 8500 ms canfield closes her letter please stay focused in your reform attempts as i and many others are in desperate need of your help theres no doubt that the obama healthcare reform bill would help ms canfield shes exactly the kind of person lowincome preexisting condition selfemployed its designed to help but in their report abcs jake tapper and sunlen miller

health insurance industry policies of denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions or dropping coverage for individuals once they get sick but dr mark j perry a professor of economics and finance in the school of management at the flint campus of the university of michigan has noted that according to data from yahoo business the health insurance industry with an average profit margin of 33 percent is the 86th most profitable industry as the washington posts ezra klein notes thats a lower margin of profit than many other players in health care such as the pharmaceutical industry 165 percent health information services 93 percent home health care 84 percent medical labs and research 82 percent medical instruments and supplies 68 percent biotech firms 67 percent and generic drug manufacturers 66 percent its commendable that mr tapper and ms miller take the time to present the underlying issue but there are a couple of things that are off here the main problem is that profit isnt the right measure to use in this context profit is a deceptive measure when used with insurance because the amount of money that flows through insurance companies is vastly disproportionate to the work they do or the value they add just by the nature of the business to put it more simply private insurance companies costs are probably about half of all the healthcare spending in america since thats the proportion they cover and their revenues are somewhat higher than that currently about 43 higher according to yahoo business but its not as if theyre actually doing half the work in americas healthcare system theyre just collecting premiums and paying bills plus a lot of administration and advertising if i had a business that consisted of people giving me 100 bills and me paying them back 96 it would be silly to describe that as a very lowprofit industry this issue was well treated in a thread on tyler cowens website last fall as commenters suggested the better measurement is not profit but return on invested capital roic roic measures how much money it takes to set up and run an insurance company versus how much profit it brings in unfortunately its not so easy to find good roic figures the closest equivalent yahoo business has is return on equity roe but that can vary according to whether firms are financed through equity or debt still across the entire industry this hopefully evens out a bit and what it shows is that roe in health insurance is about 161 roughly the same as for the healthcare industry as a whole and a good deal higher than the average roe in most sectors of the economy if what youre interested in is how much we can cut healthcare spending by eliminating insurancecompany profits then what ezra klein says is true itll help but not too much but its misleading to use the industrys low apparent profit margins to make it appear as though insurance executives are selfless folks who are just trying to eke out a little profit while doing their best to help people the healthinsurance industry provides very healthy returns to investment and its executives want to make sure it continues to do so the question is whether their efforts to pursue healthy returns to investment are good for americans as a whole last year wellpoint which owns ms canfields insurer anthem blue cross showed profits of 18 far above the industry average its roe was 27 ms canfield paid them over 5000 more than they paid out in claims in 2009 and the following year they hit her with rate increases so punitive they seem designed to push her and her preexisting condition off their rolls so they can book their profit and drop her risk these are the incentives that exist for wellpoint this is how our system works its broken and with regard to these particular problems obamacare would help fix it photo dollar sign by andy warhol source christies images via bloombergnext the state of the union is fractious democracy in america mar
