factors to consider in the decision to renovate lease buy or build when a university unit is considering moving from existing space expanding its space or creating a new program that requires space a thorough analysis of space needs should be conducted the assistance of an architectural firm may be necessary to review programmatic needs and identify the appropriate amount and type of space required for minor projects the information contained in this document may be sufficient to determine the best option to address space needs for significant projects the analysis of the options for acquiring or using space should be part of a comprehensive business plan that considers other factors besides those identified below elements of a business plan are provided at the end of this paper with a good understanding of space needs the relative merits of the factors to be considered should be weighed first the critical factors must be identified then the others even though not determinant should be reviewed an explanation of the factors to consider follows in addition a matrix of decision factors has been provided to define the possible optimal solutions based on these factors note that not all projects fit neatly into this matrix it is simply meant as a guide and special circumstances will require exceptions availability of space and market first consideration should be given to existing university space that is or soon may become available business unit staff responsible for assignment of space should be consulted to discuss programmatic space needs in order to determine what space could be used when university space is not available lease or purchase may be considered each market differs over time some areas have an abundance of low cost facilities for rent while in others it is a buyers market before considering the relative advantages of leasing vs purchase the properties available in the local market should be compared even when other factors dictate a lease or purchase decision a comparison of available properties should be made if a property offered for sale meets other required criteria it must be available at a reasonable cost usually this is determined by having two appraisals prepared and negotiating for purchase at or below appraised value suitability of space when considering suitability of space questions which should be asked include is the internal layout of the space appropriate for the program what modifications would be necessary what costs will be incurred to prepare the space for use modifications can result in significant additional costs if space is being built or a new facility is to be finished out it can be designed to suit specific programmatic andor design specifications however when existing university facilities are used or existing space is leased or purchased any additional costs associated with renovations to retrofit the space to suit programmatic needs should be considered all construction on a universityoccupied facility must comply with appropriate codes any renovation buildout or construction with a cost above 25000 must be done by workers paid prevailing wages if the work is done specifically for the universitys occupancy work done by the landlord as part of a general finish does not require prevailing wages urgency of need the relative urgency of the space requirements may drive the decision to purchase lease or build immediate needs may require a lease if there is less urgency a longer lead time may allow renovation purchase or construction in some circumstances a combination of these options may be best  with an initial lease while a facility is renovated purchased or constructed duration of need generally purchase or construction of a facility should not be considered when the duration of the need for space is short or unknown for new programs it is often best to lease until the success of the program is proven the exception would be when there is such a significant general need for space that if the program that initially occupies the space is discontinued the space would be in demand by another program flexibility the future growth or contraction of the program should be considered generally more flexibility is achieved by leasing than by the other options location one of the first questions to ask is should this program be on or off campus proximity to an existing program can have a significant impact on the efficiency of operations the need to physically interact with other units should be reviewed â€“ including the frequency and type of interaction costs associated with staff travel and accessing services should be considered if the program seeking space would function most efficiently in close proximity to existing departments or programs identifying or building space in the vicinity should be considered in some cases this may be one of the primary factors governing the decision each campus has developed a master plan that identifies campus boundaries and areas to be acquired if a facility within the master plan is offered for sale both immediate and longterm needs should be considered an oncampus facility may be suitable as temporary space until the land is needed as a building site location in an offcampus facility may be desirable in order to serve a specific market typically the facilities are leased if an existing program is already occupying a facility in a highly desirable location but the facility is not suitable in its present configuration or finish renovation should be considered however an alternate site may be needed during the renovation and all associated costs should be included in the business plan services for lease or purchase of an offcampus facility the added costs of providing service should be factored into the decision installation and ongoing costs of obtaining secure internet access parking and services for computing mail maintenance utilities custodial lawn snow removal and security should all be calculated in an oncampus facility these services are usually readily available from the campus or contractors already serving the campus for an offcampus facility all costs associated with obtaining these services should be considered cost a full understanding of all costs is essential in developing a budget and determining the optimal solution costs to be considered may include design fees construction moving expenses and furnishings in addition to operating expenses for the services identified in the paragraph above a present value analysis should be prepared to help determine the relative merits of renovation lease purchase or construction it is particularly important when considering a long term lease to also consider the option to purchase if it is available all other factors being equal the present values analysis of alternatives generally will be the determining factor in the selection of a particular option type of funding departmental funds income from operations or grant funding are typically used for leases andor small renovation projects in some cases a landlord will be willing to provide upfront constructionrenovation funds and either absorb the cost over the length of a longterm lease or amortize the funding by increased rent over the life of the lease some leases are structured to provide a payment of the unamortized balance of construction costs if a lease is terminated early by the university the internal loan program is useful for smaller dollar shortterm construction or renovation projects the minimum loan size is 5000 amounts over 50000 or financed longer than 5 years must have special written justification loans exceeding 500000 andor 5 years in length require a complete financing plan and justification and the system facilities committee must approve the loan the project must generate sufficient revenue to pay back the loan system facilities revenue bonds may be used for large dollar longerterm construction projects there must be a debt coverage of 15 or better and the board must approve these projects in some instances these bonds can be repaid with facilities and administrative costs indirect cost recoveries funding availability capacity is becoming an issue both for system facilities revenue bonds and for internal loans funding options should be reviewed with the business office andor the treasurers office decision factors renovate lease buy build availability of suitable space space available but not suitably configured or finished suitable rentals available

program planning study pps is a document which describes and systematically justifies the need for improved or expanded facilities evaluates alternative solutions and prescribes a strategy for implementing a recommended solution it should clearly demonstrate how the recommended solution will address both qualitative and quantitative deficiencies identified for a particular program the pps permits objective evaluation of the relative needs for capital investment and facilitates prioritization of projects as a part of the capital budgeting process provides the foundation for project objectives scope and budget as a basis for agreements between stakeholders provides a guide for further planning design and development and provides supporting material which is required to include the proposed project in the universitys immediate capital budget cycle if necessary program and space allocation plan provide background information to the program s this information drawn from historical perspectives as well as recent experience and future trends should clearly describe the program requirements to facilitate a comparative analysis of each project and to allow for the evaluation of current capacity and projected costs information provided in this section should include the following detail summarize the programs current mission statement indicate projected growth
