fluctuating bp local kidney maintains a relatively constant gfr in the face of normal fluctuations in bpwhat is an important function of gfr autoregulation to protect the filtration barriers from high bp that might damage them what are the two mechanisms that are at work in autoregulation of gfr myogenic response tubuloglomerular feedback how does myogenic response work in gfr autoregulation in times of increased bp when smooth muscle stretches stretchsensitive ion channels open muscle cells depolarize which opens voltagegated ca2 channels and muscle contracts increases resistance to flow blood flow diminishes and filtration pressure decreases in responsewhat is myogenic response the intrinsic ability of vascular smooth muscle to respond to pressure changes what is tubuloglomerular feedback a paracrine signaling mechanism through which changes in fluid flow through the loop of henle influence gfrwhy isnt vasodilation as effective at maintaining gfr as vasoconstriction because normally the afferent arteriole is fairly relaxed how does myogenic response work in gfr autoregulation in times of decreased bp tonic level of contraction in arterioles disappears becomes maximally

lday reabsorption reabsorption of water and solutes from the tubule lumen to the ecf depends on active transport the filtrate flowing out of the bowmans capsule has a solute concentration that is  thanas the solute concentration of the ecf the same what are the four steps governing the tubular reabsorption of solutes and water na is reabsorbed by active transport electrochemical gradient drives anion reabsorption water moves by osmosis following solute reabsorption conc of other solutes increase as fluid volume in lumen decreases permeable solutes are reabsorbed by diffusion reabsorption involves what kind of transport 2 epithelial transport 9transcellular transport paracellular pathway describe epithelial transport of reabsorption in the kidneys substances cross both the apical and basolateral membranes of the tubule epithelial cell describe the paracellular pathway of reabsorption in the kidneys substances pass through the junction between two adjacent cells which route a solute takes in reabsorption passing through the tubule depends on what two things what are the two routes permeability of epithelial junctions electrochemical gradient for the solute epithelial transport paracellular pathway what is the primary driving force for most renal reabsorption active transport of nahow does na move across the apical membrane of the tubule cells 3 a variety of symport and antiport transport proteins or open leak channels in the proximal tubule the  plays a major role in na reabsorption nhe nah antiporter once inside the tubule cell how is na moved across the basolateral membrane into the  interstitial fluid nakatpase what are the three steps of sodiumlinked glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule na moves down its electrochemical gradient using sglt pro which pulls glucose into cell against its gradient glucose diffuses out the basolateral side of the cell using the glut pro na is pumped out by nak atpase how does urea move across the proximal tubule na is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule making the ecf more concentrated than the filtrate in the lumen water moves down its osmotic gradient which creates a filtrate gradient for urea because the same amount of urea is contained in a smaller volume moves into ecfhow does urea moves across the membrane which direction does it go facilitated diffusion transporters out of lumen into ecfthough most plasma proteins stay in the blood which can cross the filtration barrier how do they do this what happens once they are in the cell smaller protein hormones and enzymes they enter proximal tubule cells by receptormediated endocytosis at the apical membrane may be digested and released as aas or delivered intact to the ecf via transcytosis most transport in the nephron uses membrane proteins and exhibits what three characteristics saturation specificity competition what is saturation maximum rate of transport that occurs when all available carriers are occupied by are saturated with substrate at substrate concentration below the saturation point of transporters what is the transport rate directly related to substrate concentration at substrate concentration equal to or above the saturation point transport occurs at what rate maximum rate what is the transport maximum transport rate at saturation t submwhat happens if blood glucose concentrations become excessive in the kidney as in the case of diabetes mellitus glucose is filtered faster than the carriers can reabsorb it the carriers become saturated and are unable to reabsorb all the glucose that flows through the tubule as a result some glucose escapes reabsorption and is excreted in the urine does filtration exhibit saturation no does reabsorption exhibit saturation yes does excretion exhibit saturation no what is renal threshold the plasma concentration at which saturation of the transport occurs what is the equation for glucose excretion glucose excretion  glucose filtered  glucose reabsorbed no secretionif filtration equals reabsorption what is the algebraic difference between the two what does this mean for excretion once renal threshold is reached what happens to the
