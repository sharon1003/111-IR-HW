party rsdlp which split apart from the menshevik faction b at the second party congress in 1903 4 the rsdlp was a revolutionary socialist political party formed in 1898 in minsk in belarus to unite the various revolutionary organisations of the russian empire into one party in the second party congress vote the bolsheviks won on the majority of important issues hence their name 5 they ultimately became the communist party of the soviet union c the bolsheviks or reds came to power in russia during the october revolution phase of the russian revolution of 1917 and founded the russian soviet federative socialist republic rsfsr with the reds defeating the whites and others during the russian civil war of 1917–1922 the rsfsr became the chief constituent of the soviet union in december 1922 the bolsheviks founded by vladimir lenin and alexander bogdanov were by 1905 a major organization consisting primarily of workers under a democratic internal hierarchy governed by the principle of democratic centralism who considered themselves the leaders of the revolutionary working class of russia their beliefs and practices were often referred to as bolshevism contents  hide 1 history of

martov disagreed over the membership rules lenin wanted members who recognise the party programme and support it by material means 6 and by personal participation in one of the partys organisations julius martov suggested by regular personal assistance under the direction of one of the partys organisations lenin advocated limiting party membership to a smaller core of active members as opposed to  card carriers  who might only be active in party branches from time to time or not at all this active base would develop the cadre a core of  professional revolutionaries  consisting of loyal communists who would spend most of their time organising the party toward a mass revolutionary party capable of leading a workers revolution against the tsarist autocracy a main source of the factions could be directly attributed to lenins steadfast opinion and unwillingness to bear opinions which were contrary to his own 7  attribution needed it was obvious at early stages in lenins revolutionary practices that he would not be willing to concede on any party policy that conflicted with his own predetermined ideas it was the loyalty that he had to his own selfenvisioned utopia that caused the party split he was seen even by fellow party members as being so narrow minded that he believed that there were only two types of people friend and enemy—those who followed him and all the rest 8 leon trotsky one of lenins fellow revolutionaries though they had differing views as to how the revolution and party should be handled compared lenin in 1904 to the french revolutionary robespierre 8 lenins view of politics as verbal and ideological warfare and his inability to accept criticism even if it came from his own dedicated followers was the reason behind this accusation the root of the split was a book titled what is to be done that lenin wrote while serving a sentence of exile in germany the book was published in 1902 in russia strict censorship outlawed its publication and distribution 9 one of the main points of lenins writing was that a revolution can only be achieved by the strong leadership of one person or of a very select few people over the masses after the proposed revolution had successfully overthrown the government this individual leader must release power to allow socialism to fully encompass the nation lenin also wrote that revolutionary leaders must dedicate their entire lives to the cause in order for it to be successful lenin said that if professional revolutionaries did not maintain control over the workers then they would lose sight of the partys objective and adopt opposing beliefs and even abandon the revolution entirely 9 lenins view of a socialist intelligentsia showed that he was not a complete supporter of marxist theory which also created some party unrest for example lenin agreed with the marxist idea of eliminating social classes but in his utopian society there would still be visible distinctions between those in politics and the common worker most party members considered unequal treatment of workers immoral and were loyal to the idea of a completely classless society so lenins variations caused the party internal dissonance although the party split of bolsheviks and mensheviks would not become official until 1903 the differences originally began to surface with the publication of what is to be done through the influence of the book lenin also undermined another group of reformers known as economists who were pushing for economic reform while wanting to leave the government relatively unchanged and who failed to recognize the importance of uniting the working population behind the partys cause 10  nonprimary source needed  page neededother than the debate between lenin and julius martov lenin felt membership should require support of the party program financial contributions and finally involvement in a party organization whereas martov didnt see the need for joining party organizations internal unrest also rose over the structure that was best suited for soviet power 10  page needed as discussed in what is to be done lenin firmly believed that a rigid political structure was needed to effectively initiate a formal revolution this idea was met with opposition from his once close followers including julius martov georgy plekhanov leon trotsky and pavel axelrod 11  page needed georgy plekhanov and lenins major dispute arose addressing the topic of nationalizing land or leaving it for private use lenin wanted to nationalize to aid in collectivization plekhanov thought worker motivation would remain higher if individuals were able to maintain their own property those who opposed lenin and wanted to continue on the marxist path towards complete socialism and disagreed with his strict party membership guidelines became known as softs while lenin supporters became known as hards 12the base of active and experienced members would be the recruiting ground for this professional core sympathizers would be left outside and the party would be organised based on the concept of democratic centralism martov until then a close friend of lenin agreed with him that the core of the party should consist of professional revolutionaries but argued that party membership should be open to sympathizers revolutionary workers and other fellow travelers the two had disagreed on the issue as early as march–may 1903 but it was not until the congress that their differences became irreconcilable and split the party 13 at first the disagreement appeared to be minor and inspired by personal conflicts for example lenins insistence on dropping less active editorial board members from iskra or martovs support for the organizing committee of the congress which lenin opposed the differences quickly grew and the split became irreparable origins of the name  editthe two factions were originally known as hard lenins supporters and soft martovs supporters soon however the terminology changed to bolsheviks and mensheviks from the russian bolshinstvo majority and menshinstvo minority 14 on the other hand martovs supporters won the vote concerning the question of party membership neither lenin nor martov had a firm majority throughout the congress as delegates left or switched sides at the end the congress was evenly split between the two factions from 1907 on english language articles sometimes used the term maximalist for bolshevik and minimalist for menshevik which proved confusing since there was also a maximalist faction within the russian socialistrevolutionary party in 1904–06 which after 1906 formed a separate union of socialistsrevolutionaries maximalists and then again after 1917 15composition of the party  editthe average party member was very young in 1907 22 of bolsheviks were under 20 37 were 20–24 and 16 were 25–29 by 1905 62 of the members were industrial workers 3 of the population in 1897 16  17 22 of bolsheviks were gentry 17 of the total population 38 were uprooted peasants compared with 19 and 26 for the mensheviks in 1907 783 of the bolsheviks were russian and 10 were jewish 34 and 20 for the mensheviks total membership was 8400 in 1905 13000 in 1906 and 46100 by 1907 8400 18000 38200 respectively for the mensheviks by 1910 both factions together had fewer than 10000 members 18beginning of the 1905 revolution 1903–1905  editthe two factions were in a state of flux in 1903–04 with many members changing sides the founder of russian marxism georgy plekhanov who was at first allied with vladimir lenin and the bolsheviks parted ways with them by 1904 leon trotsky at first supported the mensheviks but left them in september 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with lenin and the bolsheviks he remained a selfdescribed nonfactional social democrat until august 1917 when he joined lenin and the bolsheviks as their positions assembled and he came to believe that lenin was right on the issue of the party all but one member of the central committee were arrested in moscow in early 1905 the remaining member with the power of appointing a new one was won over by the bolsheviks 19the lines between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks hardened in april 1905 when the bolsheviks held a bolsheviksonly meeting in london which they called the third party congress the mensheviks organised a rival conference and the split was thus formalised the bolsheviks played a relatively minor role in the 1905 revolution and were a minority in the saint petersburg soviet of workers deputies led by trotsky the less significant moscow soviet however was dominated by the bolsheviks these soviets became the model for those formed in 1917 the mensheviks the minority 1906–1907  editthis section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to

stockholm april 1906 when the mensheviks struck an alliance with the jewish bund the bolsheviks found themselves in a minority however all factions retained their respective factional structure and the bolsheviks formed the bolshevik centre the de facto governing body of the bolshevik faction within the rsdlp at the fifth congress held in london in may 1907 the bolsheviks were in the majority but the two factions continued functioning mostly independently of each other split between lenin and bogdanov 1908–10  edittensions had existed between lenin and bogdanov as early as 1904 lenin had fallen out with nikolai valentinov after the latter had introduced him to ernst mach s empiriocriticism a viewpoint that bogdanov had been exploring and developing as empiriomonism having worked as coeditor with plekhanov on zayra he had come to agree with the latters rejection of bogdanovs empiriomonism 20 with the defeat of the revolution in mid1907 and the adoption of a new highly restrictive election law the bolsheviks began debating whether to boycott the new parliament known as the third duma lenin grigory zinoviev lev kamenev and others argued for participating in the duma while alexander bogdanov anatoly lunacharsky mikhail pokrovsky and others argued that the social democratic faction in the duma should be recalled 21 the latter became known as recallists otzovists in russian a smaller group within the bolshevik faction demanded that the rsdlp central committee should give its sometimes unruly duma faction an ultimatum demanding complete subordination to all party decisions this group became known as  ultimatists  and was generally allied with the recallists with most bolshevik leaders either supporting bogdanov or undecided by mid1908 when the differences became irreconcilable lenin concentrated on undermining bogdanovs reputation as a philosopher in 1909 he published a scathing book of criticism entitled materialism and empiriocriticism 1909 22 assaulting bogdanovs position and accusing him of philosophical idealism 23 in june 1909 bogdanov proposed the formation of party schools as proletarian universities at a bolshevik miniconference in paris organised by the editorial board of the bolshevik magazine proletary in june 1909 however this was not accepted and lenin tried to expel him from the bolshevik faction 24 bogdanov was then involved with setting up vpered which ran the capri party school from august to december 1909 25final attempt at party unity 1910  editwith both bolsheviks and mensheviks weakened by splits within their ranks and by tsarist repression they were tempted to try to reunite the party in january 1910 leninists recallists and various menshevik factions held a meeting of the partys central committee in paris kamenev and zinoviev were dubious about the idea but were willing to give it a try under pressure from conciliator bolsheviks like victor nogin one of the more underlying reasons that aided in preventing any reunification of the party was the russian police the police were able to infiltrate both parties inner circles by sending in spies who then reported on the opposing partys intentions and hostilities 26 this allowed the tensions to remain high between the bolsheviks and mensheviks in turn it prevented them from uniting under common ground which could have possibly sped up the entire revolution lenin was firmly opposed to any reunification but was outvoted within the bolshevik leadership the meeting reached a tentative agreement and one of its provisions made trotskys vienna based pravda a partyfinanced central organ kamenev trotskys brotherinlaw was added to the editorial board from the bolsheviks but the unification attempts failed in august 1910 when kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations forming a separate party 1912  editthe factions permanently broke off relations in january 1912 after the bolsheviks organised a bolsheviksonly prague party conference and formally expelled mensheviks and recallists from the party as a result they ceased to be a faction in the rsdlp and instead declared themselves an independent party called russian social democratic labour party bolsheviks – or rsdlp b unofficially the party has been referred to as the bolshevik party throughout the century the party adopted a number of different names in 1918 rsdlp b became allrussian communist party bolsheviks and remained so until 1925 from 1925–52 the name was allunion communist party bolsheviks and from 1952–1991 communist party of the soviet union as the party split became permanent and politically recognized in 1912 due to an all bolshevik meeting of congress further divisions became evident one of the most notable differences was how each faction decided to fund its revolution the mensheviks decided to fund their revolution through membership dues while lenin often resorted to much more drastic measures since he required a higher budget 27 one of the common methods the bolsheviks used was committing bank robberies one of which in 1907 resulted in the party gaining over 250000 rubles which is the equivalent of about 125000 27 bolsheviks were in constant need of money because lenin practiced his beliefs exercised in his writings that revolutions must be led by individuals who devote their entire life to the cause to compensate he awarded them with salaries for their sacrifice and dedication this measure was taken to help ensure that the revolutionists stayed focused on their duties and motivated them to perform their jobs lenin also used the party money to print and copy pamphlets which were distributed in cities and at political rallies in attempts to expand their operations this was an obvious difference between the bolsheviks and mensheviks party beliefs both factions also managed to gain funds simply by receiving donations from wealthy supporters further differences in party agendas became evident as the beginning of world war i loomed near stalin was especially eager for the start of the war hoping that it would turn into a war between classes or essentially a russian civil war 28 this desire for war was fueled by lenins vision that the workers and peasants would resist joining the war effort and therefore be more compelled to join the socialist movement through the increase in support russia would then be forced to withdraw from the allied powers in order to resolve her internal conflict unfortunately for the bolsheviks lenins assumptions were incorrect and despite his and the partys attempts to push for a civil war through involvement in two conferences in 1915 and 1916 in switzerland the party remained in the minority in calling for the ceasefire by the russian army in world war i 28although the bolshevik leadership decided to form a separate party convincing probolshevik workers within russia to follow suit proved difficult when the first meeting of the fourth duma was convened in late 1912 only one out of six bolshevik deputies matvei muranov another one roman malinovsky was later exposed as an okhrana tsarist secret police agent voted to break away from the menshevik faction within the duma on 15 december 1912 29 the bolshevik leadership eventually prevailed and the bolsheviks formed their own duma faction in september 1913 one final difference between the bolsheviks and mensheviks was simply how ferocious and tenacious the party was willing to be in order to achieve its goals lenin was open minded to retreating on political ideas if he saw the guarantee of long term gains benefiting the party this practice was commonly seen trying to recruit peasants and uneducated workers by promising them how glorious life would be after the revolution his approach was land seizure for the peasants and national selfdetermination for the minorities – as nothing more than temporary concessions 27in 1918 at lenins suggestion the party renamed itself the russian communist party bolsheviks in 1925 this was changed to allunion communist party bolsheviks in 1952 at the 19th party congress according to stalin s suggestion the bolshevik party was renamed the communist party of the soviet union derogatory usage of bolshevik  editdown with bolshevism bolshevism brings war and destruction hunger and death
