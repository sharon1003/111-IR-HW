changing ambient environment and ageing characteristics collagenbased animal glues are widely used in the conservation of artefacts serving as adhesives binders and consolidants for organic and inorganic types of commercially available animal glue materials with a variety of different animal glues on hide glues are primarily derived from bovine skins the market such as hide and bone glues fish glues and those of smaller mammals although connective isinglass and gelatin their individual properties tissue may also be used bone glues are predominantly need to be well understood in order to choose a prepared from fresh ‘green’ bones or sometimes glue fit for a specific purpose this paper reviews extracted bones degreased and demineralised known a wide range of publications on currently available as ossein from cattle and pigs hide and bone glues are animal glues with respect to their specific physical produced and sold as coarse powders pearls cubes and cakes or plates though the latter two appear to be chemical and mechanical properties increasingly rare 9 commercial gelatin the purified active ingredient of any collagenderived glue pure introduction denatured collagen may be obtained from either skin animal glues are natural polymers derived from or bone sources 9 10 and is supplied in the form of mammalian or fish collagen – the major structural thin sheets plates or powder protein constituent of skins connective tissue cartilage as the name suggests rabbit skin glues should be and bones these glues may exhibit varied physical produced purely from rabbit skins 10 11 though chemical and mechanical properties depending on their collagenous waste from various small mammals may origin and method of preparation in the manufacture of also be used 12 some suppliers sell rabbit skin glue objects and artefacts an extensive traditional knowledge that is mixed with bovine hide glue to alter its properties exists on which animal glues are most suitable

glue used in japan as gelatin published in scientific journals on polymer a binder for some inks are now made from bovine or and biotechnology medical science and the food and porcine gelatin manufactured to match the properties of brewing industry however much of this literature the traditional genuine material 15 is not readily accessible to conservators and it can be ambiguous or contradictory this paper seeks to the skins of nonoily types of fish 16 17 as well as provide a review of the literature and to identify which their bones 10 12 18 19 are used to manufacture fish properties of glue need to be considered when making glues which are sold in liquid form the swim bladders decisions about conservation treatments of various species are the source for isinglass 20–24

commercial manufacturers given the molecular weight mw 38 46 as a general rule range of additives that may be present in industrial glue gentle processing is appropriate for the hides of young formulations minimally modified glues represent the mammals as well as all fish skin and swim bladders safest option for conservation because they are rich in collagen and the collagen is not so strongly stabilised by the additional chemical bonds chemical structure and properties that develop in older mammals furthermore glues that are derived from fish cleave more easily on extensive chemical structure and denaturation heating than those of mammalian origin owing to their chemical structure 40 46 conservators should thus collagen consists of long protein molecules composed be aware that when preparing a collagenbased solution of naturally occurring amino acids that are linked in a mild procedures should be employed 4 46 preparation specific sequence by covalent peptide bonds due to temperatures for collagenbased glues are generally the spatial conformation of some amino acid groups recommended to be around 55–63°c however there is notably proline and hydroxyproline and the many little loss of gel strength on heating at high temperatures ionisable and polar functional groups in the protein eg 80–90°c even in the case of isinglass but only if chain the individual chains form triplestranded helical the solution is kept at these temperatures for no more coils that are generally believed to be internally stabilised than a few minutes 46 47 by hydrogenbonding 7 25

misalignment of the single contain less crosslinkage within the collagen during strands means that renaturation causes nodes ‘junction extraction the bonds predominantly hbonds in the zones’ involving

from approximately 15°c for deep cold water fish such as cod used for fish glue 10 43 the ability to form a rigid gel on cooling which can be up to 29°c for most warm water species 31 33 44 repeatedly reliquefied by reheating is one of the unique which are the preferred source of isinglass produced for properties of collagenbased glues the temperature at commercial clarification of alcoholic beverages there which gelation of the glue solution occurs tgel depends are also a few tropical fish species that reach td levels of mainly on the collagen source but is also affected by up to 36°c 31 44 the degree of protein cleavage gelation temperatures decrease with lower denaturation temperature td the process of denaturation is necessary for collagen and also with increasing cleavage of the molecules to convert to gelatin which can be used as a glue mammalian gelatin gels at around 30–35ºc and cold cleavage of the single protein molecule may also occur water fish gelatin remains liquid down to around 8ºc during pretreatment extraction and dissolution and 14 43 53 however this temperature will be lowered will significantly affect the properties of the gelatinous if the preparation temperature of the glue is significantly glue the more vigorous the extraction process ie exceeded the more extreme the p h the longer the treatment and the higher the temperature during extraction the more bonds within the protein molecule are randomly gel strength cleaved leading to ever decreasing molecular weights gel strength is a measure of the gel rigidity of gelatinous 34 37 39 45 mild

according to than alkaline pretreated collagen derivatives type b several authors 35 39 the average molecular weight gelatins whose mw distribution is skewed towards amw of animal glues can range from around 20000 to lower mw fractions 9 34 46 250000 gmol1 it is thought that permanent gelling does not take place below an amw of 20000 gmol1 open gelling time tack and drying 38 p 43 isinglass from sturgeon if prepared under the setting time of animal glues depends primarily on mild conditions reaches average molecular weight values tgel and gel strength the lower the tgel and gel strength of well over 150000 gmol1 4 33 46 while liquid fish the longer the open time of the solution ie the longer glue has amw values of around 60000 gmol1 10 14 it takes for the glue to gel high bloom hot hide glues placing it at the lower end of the range for most other tend to gel rapidly as gelation occurs at comparatively commercial collagenbased adhesives information on high temperatures 10 11 14 39 59 gelatinous amw is not readily available glues derived from fish which have low tgel due to characterisation by amw is only common for fish their chemical structure 42 43 58 and coldset liquid glues which are liquid at room temperature most hide glues are convenient to use when long open times other gelatinous glues are usually characterised by their are required commercial fish glues usually contain gel strength as amw does not describe the molecular preservatives 60 and sometimes small amounts of weight distribution and therefore may not always other additives such as colour brightener deodorizing correlate reliably with the physical and mechanical agents or fragrance 10 liquid hide glues generally properties of a glue 34 p 60 table 1 however it have further additives to inhibit gelation at room would be expected that high amw adhesives such as temperature 17 28 these are typically salts eg skin glues have higher gel strength and viscosity gel urea thiourea or phenols that extend the setting time more rapidly and produce stronger bonds by inhibiting renaturation of the gelatinous matrix 28 52 some manufacturers claim that their liquid hide gel strength is strongly influenced by amw but also glue does not contain gelling inhibitors 17 in which shows a linear correlation with the degree to which case the gelatinous matrix must be considerably affected the protein solution renatures during gelation 55 by molecular cleavage to achieve the comparatively ie the higher the degree of formation of helical low mw that is necessary for the glue to be in a liquid structures the higher the gel strength the presence of state salts also influences gel strength which decreases with an increasing concentration of ions in solution 42 the ability of collagenbased glue to develop tack upon 56 gelation is a unique property in general glues of higher bloom strength develop tack faster than lower bloom gel strength also known as bloom strength is measured glues the tack ‘strength’ of glue can be empirically in grams g or bloom grams g b and equals the force tested by conservators between two fingertips isinglass required to make a specified depression into a gel sample solutions may appear to be less tacky than equivalent prepared under standard conditions 25 35 37 39 concentrations of mammalian gelatin or hide glue as manufacturers commonly distinguish between grades they take longer to set at room temperature since their of glue by their bloom strength which usually covers lower gelation temperature delays the development of a wide range being as low as 30 g for weak bone glues tack and rigorously extracted hide glues and up to around 500 g for very strong hide glue 10 11 35 37 57 drying time generally depends on the ambient gelatins derived from tropical fish have significantly temperature and relative humidity rh after gelation lower bloom values than mammalian gelatins 58 the glue matrix dries by evaporation of water and this since the degree of stabilisation of the triple helix by process can be accelerated by elevating the temperature hbonding is lower gelatins extracted from cold water however collagenbased adhesives should be allowed to fish do not have specified gel strengths as they are liquid dry as slowly as possible as a longer period of molecular at room temperature 42 mobility after gelation and during drying encourages the development of highly ordered network structures 52 as gel strength is dependent on the structural this maximises the elasticity and strength toughness of conformation of the gelatinous matrix it is useful the resulting glue film isinglass naturally develops highly for estimating the toughness strength and resilience stable and elastic films if dried at room temperature of the resulting bond furthermore bloom strength being slightly above its tgel 9 also correlates with the watersorption capacity of the glue in gel and solid state viscosity at least to some degree and gelling temperature tgel which generally properties of gelatinous glue solutions all increase with rising bloom value high bloom glues require a lower solid content in solution than glues with

although some authors still express some doubt 37 46 that there is a direct correlation between fat content isinglass has a much higher viscosity than hide glue at and tendency to foam 9 nevertheless skans 73 an equivalent solution concentration and temperature p 66 suggested that a natural fat content of above 5 above tgel which can be explained by its comparatively would inhibit the development

however where low on foaming while p h was established to have an viscosity values have been obtained for isinglass it is inconsistent effect likely that the particular preparation procedure of the glue used for the tests resulted in greater cleavage of the protein molecules 46 despite isinglass having a p h large fraction of high mw compounds its low gelling for conservation applications the choice of adhesive temperature compensates for this by allowing more may be dependent on the p h sensitivity of the substrate time for the glue to penetrate porous substrates at room 71 collagenbased glues can display varying p h temperature therefore improving its penetration ability values that are difficult to predict purely on the basis in comparison to gelatin and rabbit skin glue of similar

with plastic relaxation processes above 65 rh however even at high rh ageing characteristics levels plastic relaxation may not sufficiently compensate for these stresses and continuous cycling further reduces whilst substantial research has been published on the the ability for stress relaxation 48 this will result in behaviour of collagenderived glues in a fluctuating permanent shrinkage of the

substrate deformation or mechanical limited according to michel et al isinglass from destruction embrittlement of the glue film 48 sturgeon of all animal glues best retains its mechanical properties with thermal and ultraviolet uv light ageing at low rh levels more randomly coiled gelatinous and rh cycling 79 p 271 it shows markedly less structures such as bone glues which have comparatively change in strength and stiffness than pure mammalian low tensile strength and low resistance to stress induce gelatin mammalian gelatin increases in tensile strength relaxation at an early stage by developing cracks in the but becomes stiffer and more brittle upon artificial glue matrix thereby preventing high stresses on the ageing under uv light fluctuating rh and temperature substrate these glues also show a greater tendency to isinglass from sturgeon remains much tougher and more creep under stress at high rh levels 61 p 14 although elastic than gelatin 79 p 274 it also develops the least animal glues containing a high degree of helical structure permanent dimensional change whereas gelatin films exhibit comparatively high stress when exposed to swell or creep slightly during ageing and other animal extreme and fluctuating environmental conditions they glues show an even more marked effect still display greater stability in their strength properties than more randomly coiled structures the strength properties of hot hide glue have been shown to be less resolubility sensitive to fluctuating rh and temperature than those collagenderived glues unless they have been modified of cold liquid hide glue 6 28 liquid fish glues are even by the addition of tanning agents which causes them less stable than cold liquid hide glues under fluctuating to become relatively

which varied in the type of light individual properties source as well as cycles of exposure time temperature it has become evident that much important data that and rh would allow comparison of the
