drinking green tea to prevent cancer studies are mixed ctca april 07 2014on any given day 160 million of us fill our mugs with hot tea or pair our meals with a glass of iced tea half of all americans are drinking tea fueling its growing popularity as researchers find it may help prevent disease—including cancer most studies exploring the link between tea and cancer prevention focus on green tea which comes from the camellia sinesis plant the same one as the more popular black tea used for iced tea unlike green tea the leaves of black tea may have fewer healthy antioxidants because they’re fermented antioxidants may prevent or delay some types of cell damage if you’re a green tea drinker you’ve probably heard of the tea’s health benefits the research on its cancerfighting properties is promising but mixed here are two recent reviews of multiple studies five cups of green tea a day may help prevent cancer and recurrent colorectal cancer according to a research review in the journal of cancer research and clinical oncology green tea may reduce risk of ovarian prostate and breast cancers according to a research review in the journal of the american college of nutrition the second research review cited two studies one finding that asian american women who drink green tea had a decreased risk of breast cancer and another suggesting a lower risk of breast cancer recurrence in japanese patients drinking at least three cups of the tea daily the review also noted that breast cancer risk was unaffected in a larger study of more than 35000 japanese women daniel kellman clinical director of naturopathic medicine at our hospital outside atlanta says studies involving asians may not offer a direct parallel for americans genetics could be at play as asians have lower rates of breast cancer but higher rates of stomach and esophageal cancer since 2006 more than 50 studies have compared groups who drink green or black tea to those who do not the results have been inconsistent according to the national cancer institute but studies have linked the teas to reduced risk of colon breast ovarian prostate and lung cancers inconsistencies may be due to differences in preparation and consumption methods of tea production and lifestyle factors such as physical activity and tobacco use evidence suggests green tea’s anticancer effecs which supports its place in your diet kellman says green tea may act in two ways by altering genetic expression it may increase activity of the p53 “tumor suppressor gene” increasing programmed cell death of cancer cells by its antiangiogenic effect it may prevent tumorassociated blood vessel formation decreasing nutrient delivery to cancer cells kellman recommends choosing organic green tea to avoid pesticides patients who switched from conventional green tea to organic saw a decrease in their liver enzymes elevated liver enzymes are associated with inflammation and cell damage how much green tea should you get one 275 mg capsule of green tea extract equals two cups of green tea studies of large groups of people have found that those who drank eight to 12 cups of green tea daily had a lower incidence of cancer cancer patients

cups a day seems a little excessive no pat bridges • 4 months ago i agree i dont even drink coffee much less the caffeine id get from 810 cups of green tea id never get any sleep lol yfl • 1 year ago i gave a guy with cancer that was sick organic green tea and he stopped being sick within two days he says he drinks it everyday and hes just fine i think it cleanse toxins from the body or something patrick pourquoi • 1 year ago of all the research reports i looked at which had a high number of peer reviews emphasised that there is no link between lowering the risk of cancer and green tea there just is not evidence green tea is healthy in conjunction with a balanced diet and active lifestyle thats it it is no miracle cure all the papers i viewed that did show a weak link between lowering the risk of various types of cancer and the consumption of green tea were weak studies and contained little number of peer reviews jennifer clark • 4 years ago yes green tea is really very helpful in preventing cancer thanks for sharing such a knowledgeable post patrick pourquoi • 1 year ago i dont mean seem negative but i assure you that green tea does not prevent cancer in no part of this paper does it suggest that it states the possibility that it may lower the risk in fact the papers cited within this article that suggests a lowered risk of various cancers were not well constructed studies there is no harm in drinking regular amounts of green tea but the benefits have been extremely exaggerated or even made up because of either fad nutritionists or scientific illiterate consumersnutrionistskhampshire • 8 months ago patrick you obviously have not read the work of d james morre and his cancer team at purdue
