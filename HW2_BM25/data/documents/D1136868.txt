just 4 growers  indoor gardening and plants  hydroponic growing techniques tweet how to take care of your p h meter keeping track of the p h of your hydroponic nutrient solution is key to making sure that the right spectrum of nutritional elements are available to your plants as they grow and bloom but while you might be measuring your nutrient solutions p h every day are you taking care of the p h meter itself without regular maintenance p h meters can give increasingly inaccurate readings making your regular monitoring less effective so take our advice and take care of your p h meter we will show you howwhether in soil water or a hydroponic solution measuring p h levels is a critical aspect of successful gardening healthy plant growth depends on properly synthesizing the perfect environment for your fruits veggies and decorative plants and just as correcting the p h level in soil or water can help a plant thrive an incorrect p h level can lead to disease or potential death what is p hp h is the abbreviation for potential of hydrogen which indicates a substances acid or alkaline base properties the standard p h scale occasionally referred to as the acidity or alkalinity scale goes from 0 to 14 although it is possible to exceed these levels the higher the p h the more base or alkaline a substance is the lower the p h the more acidic it is and a p h level of 70 is of neutral acidity and alkalinity a note to all you beginning gardeners acid often has a dangerous connotation but a substance that is too alkaline can be just as dangerous for people and plants did you know that bleach has a p h level of 120 to 126 how can you measure p h although it is impossible to visually determine the p h level of a liquid the p h of soil will often affect its color a greener shade of soil is typically more alkaline while a yellow or orange tinted soil tends to be more acidic soil p h can be measured with a p h test kit or a meter that is specifically designed for soil testing the p h level of a liquid can be measured using reagents incorporated into paper strips or liquid drops or with a digital p h meter reagent testing strips and drops incorporate colormatching techniques while they are initially inexpensive they will ultimately cost more than a p h meter more importantly strips and drops have a shelf life do not provide pinpoint accuracy and the color matching is open to interpretation for example most strips will show an increase of p h levels by increments of 05 therefore when using a p h strip the difference between p h 70 and p h 80 will only be two different shades of pink and what about the roughly 7 of males in the united states that are color blind a digital p h meter on the other hand provides a p h level display screen so there is no interpretation required a user simply inserts the meter into a solution and views the digital reading it is important to note that soil and liquid p h meters have very different probes and should always be used accordingly make sure you have the right one for your needs how do p h meters work even though there are a variety of p h probe types ranging from inexpensive handhelds to laboratory models that cost tens of thousands of dollars the most common p h meters incorporate a glass sensor and a reference tube the p h probe measures the activity of hydrogen ions by generating a small amount of voltage across the sensor and the reference tube the meter then converts that voltage to a p h value and displays it on a digital screen also many digital p h meters have a builtin thermometer that automatically adjusts for any discrepancies off the baseline of 77Âºf 25o c this function is called automatic temperature compensation atc what is calibration and why is it necessary calibration is akin to tuning and just as a musical instrument must be tuned from timetotime a scientific instrument must be properly calibrated to achieve accurate test results while some humans may have perfect pitch and can tune a musical instrument without the use of a tuner the only certain way to determine if a p h meter is calibrated properly is by comparing it to a laboratorycertified standard reference point more commonly known as a buffer solution buffer solutions are liquid but can also be purchased in powder form and mixed with distilled or deionized water to create a fresh batch each time any scientific instrument should be calibrated as close as possible to the level that will be tested if testing a range then the meter should be calibrated in the middle of that range for example if testing an acidic solution a p h meter should be calibrated to p h 40 to achieve the most accurate results most waters fall into the range of p h 60 to p h 80 therefore to test the p h of water calibrating your meter to p h 70 will suffice the three most common p h levels for calibration are 40 70 and 100 these points cover the p h range of 0 to 14 but other values are available a p h meter will require single two or threepoint calibration for accurate results some meters can be calibrated to a single point but the manufacturer will recommend at least two points for optimum testing the differences will depend on the technology of the meter and the type of sensor it uses once you have a p h buffer solution calibrating a p h meter is typically a simple process a p h meter whether analog a needle points to the p h level or dialog displays the p h level as a number on the screen will incorporate either analog or digital calibration analog calibration is done by using a small screwdriver to adjust the reading until it matches the value of the buffer solution digital calibration is done by pressing up and down buttons until the reading matches the value of the buffer solution a digital p h meter can have analog calibration some meters also offer automatic calibration in which case the meter will automatically recognize the value of the buffer solution and calibrate itself to that value this is by far the simplest method of calibration but it is important that these meters also have manual calibration for fine tuning andor troubleshooting many brands of p h meters are factory calibrated and ready to use right out of the box however the factory calibration should only be considered a convenience for a few uses the calibration could shift during shipping and its also possible that the factory calibration may not be ideal for your needs and as mentioned above all p h meters will need to be recalibrated at some point regardless of what method of calibration your meter employs always carefully read your meters instructions and perform calibration according to the manufacturers recommendations for best results a p h meter should be calibrated with regular useat least once per week if not usedat least once per month if you think the readings are incorrect if testing aggressive liquids very acid or basic liquidsif testing a wide range of liquids going back and forth between acids and baseswhenever the sensor is replaced how should a p h meter be properly cared for although there are general maintenance techniques for p h meters each brand and model will have its own requirements always follow the directions for your meter and you will enjoy it for a longer time with fewer issues in addition to frequent calibration properly maintaining the p h sensor will ensure a longer life and more accurate results many p h meters incorporate glass sensors and reference tubes that must be stored in specially formulated solutions if using a handheld meter the storage solution will often be in the meters cap dont spill this solution  you need it for most p h sensors its critical that the sensor be stored wet in the appropriate solution to clean most p h sensors rinse in distilled or deionized water shake off any excess water and return the sensor to its storage solution the majority of p h sensors have a lifespan of approximately 12 years if you are experiencing erratic readings and having difficulty calibrating it may be time to replace the sensor or your meter if the meter doesnt have a replaceable sensor tips and tricks always read the instruction manual prior to use sure the instructions may be boring but theyll answer your questions and those answers will protect your investment always be sure your p h meter is properly calibrated if your handheld meter includes a storage solution in the cap store the meter upright for more effective saturation never touch a sensor electrode or reference cell with your fingers skin oils will affect readings and can permanently damage a p h sensor always lightly swirl a meter in the water or solution to dislodge any trapped air bubbles never store a p h meter in high heat or humidity never store a p h sensor in distilled water a p h meter is a sensitive scientific instrument and should always be treated as such words rob samborn
