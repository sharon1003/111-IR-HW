civil war is coming to the united states december 10 2013 659 pm by james bailey 31 comments this morning i had a prophetic dream regarding the future of the united states this dream had three parts describing future events in the economy the value of the dollar and a civil war when the dream started i was looking for a way to make some income the first place i looked was the job market but the only jobs i could find were driving transport vehicles i saw different people driving these vehicles but i realized i was not qualified to do that and was not interested either then i had an idea to start my own mailing service however i then realized the government was soon going to be implementing major changes in the mailing system that was going to make my idea obsolete so that idea was also a dead end then i was standing on my property which was a 2500acre farm in a remote rural area i do not own anything like that in real life the land on this farm was used for growing pine trees so i had an idea to harvest the trees and make some money that way however i looked at the trees and realized they were nowhere near ready for harvest the trees were only about ten feet tall then i remembered what someone told me they said the cost of harvesting the trees had gotten so high that there was not much profit left after selling the wood so that idea was also a dead end then i saw my brotherinlaw sitting near the barn on my property i walked over to him to ask what he was doing he was holding a quarter in his hand and he had a silver dollar sitting on top of a box next to him he said “they keep doing everything they can to prop it up but the value keeps going down down down”i reached down to pick up the silver dollar as i told him “i have a few of these too”right at that moment i heard two very loud explosions up in the sky at first i thought it was thunder but it was different from thunder it was much louder and shorter like a blast it was very startling at first i could not see what it was because the barn blocked my view however just moments after the explosions off to the right side of the barn i saw two large aircraft falling rapidly towards the ground with big trails of black smoke behind them they were large helicopters like the ch47 chinook helicopters shown in the above image which are used to transport troops or cargo when we realized the aircrafts were shot down we were confused because all of the aircrafts flying above us were from the united states military our own military shot down two of our own aircrafts it made no sense the aircrafts crashed down not too far from my farm it was about a mile away from us so we immediately ran towards the crash site to see if we could help any of the survivors as we ran we saw some of my neighbors who also heard the explosions and like us they were running to help the survivors it only took us a few minutes to reach the crash site which is why we were amazed by what we saw the whole area was already covered with at least twenty government vehicles and people wearing emergency uniforms including some people wearing hazmat suits designed for protection against hazardous materials there was even a news reporter already set up there with his microphone in his hand we knew there was no way these people could have possibly arrived at this rural location as fast as they did there just wasn’t enough time the crash had just happened they had to have known ahead of time these aircrafts were going to crash and they also knew exactly where they were going to crash the whole event was planned there was something very sinister happening within our own government our military was divided against itself and waging war against its own members my interpretationi believe the first part of the dream is a warning that america is heading for a time when jobs will be very hard to find even being selfemployed will be much harder due to the actions of our government i am not referring to the unemployment rate touted by the government and promoted by the news media that is one way they are already lying to us i am referring to the real unemployment rate which is measured by the labor force participation rate which is already the lowest it has been since the recession caused by president jimmy carter’s administration today we are being told the unemployment rate is moving down but the reality is there are nearly ten million fewer americans in the labor force today than when president obama came into office in january 2009 we are already seeing the actions of our government making it harder for people to find jobs or any means of income obamacare is a great example of that but there are many others the second part of the dream is a warning that the american dollar is going to lose value rapidly and there is nothing that can be done to stop it the federal reserve will have exhausted their bag of tricks their policies that previously succeeded in propping up the value of the dollar will no longer work and the dollar will lose value the value of the dollar has already declined by 97 since the federal reserve bank was established in 1913 the actions of the federal reserve continue to weaken the dollar today however the rest of the world is already very weary of the way america has abused the privilege of being the world’s reserve currency other nations are already pushing to bring an end to the dollar including russia and china who have already begun using gold to pay for their purchases of oil when we see the first two events happening americans losing their jobs and their means of income and the federal reserve no longer able to stop the dollar from spiraling down then civil war will come to america suddenly and secretly the united states government is going to wage war against the american people which will lead to civil war even within the military those who take sides with the government will be divided against those who take sides with the people evil conspiracies will abound as our government leaders plot to betray and destroy anyone who stands in their way their strategy will be to fight under cover relying on deception and lies to hide their true intentions they will present themselves as being the good guys hoping to keep the american people on their side while they work to destroy and enslave them they will rely on corrupt members of the news media to help spread their lies to the american people to mislead them and cover up what is really happening even in the midst of the war millions of americans will not be aware of what is really happening because they will believe the lies told to them by the government and the news media that is why i saw the news reporter already at the crash site he was already holding his microphone in his hand but he showed no interest in talking to us or any of the local people even though many of us were eye witnesses of the crash he already had his story and he knew we had nothing to contribute to it in fact we could ruin it by telling what really happened i could tell by the look on his face that he was not happy to see us and had no interest in talking to us he was included in the dream as a warning he represented the larger mainstream news media let those who are wise take heed the mainstream news media is filled with liars do not believe their reports be on the alert against their liesa nation walking close with the lord would not be deceived but america has strayed away from the lord as a result many will be vulnerable and will believe the lies those who stay close to the lord are already being warned ahead of time to be on the alert watching for these things aware of their evil intentions and questioning everything they tell us this is one example of how the holy spirit guides us into all truth he gives us discernment to know when we are being lied to he tells us things ahead of time so we know to be on guard knowing the schemes of the enemy will help us avoid the traps they will set for us many will be deceived and there will be much confusion resulting from that but those who stay close to the lord will be informed and will know what to do my recommendationour country is currently on a collision course with these problems but it does not have to be this way the events that are coming are directly connected to the choices we have made in the past and are continuing to make today if our country changes course by turning to the lord we can avoid much of the heartache that is now heading our way now is the time to draw closer to the lord than ever before god will provide for his people and protect them from harm no matter what craziness comes god’s people are not victims who should cower in fear those who stay filled with the spirit will rise above every adversity and will remain in the peace and joy of the lord that he has given to those who follow him god’s people must turn away from every sin and be filled with the holy spirit we must allow him to pray through us for his will to be done in our country our prayers can stop the schemes of the enemy causing them to be foiled before they are carried out hard times may be coming but there are different levels of hardships if the devil has his way the days ahead will bring total devastation if the lord has his way his people will pray and cause the schemes of the devil to be stopped do not trust the words of our government leaders or our news media betrayal will be at work among them as they spread lies to manipulate anyone foolish enough to listen to them even now many lies are already being told by them if we seek the lord he will reveal the truth to us and connect us with trustworthy sources if you don’t know the lord but would like to find out how you can click
