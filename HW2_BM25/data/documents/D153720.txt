introduction the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster has been extensively studied for over a century as a model organism for genetic investigations it also has many characteristics which make it an ideal organism for the study of animal development and behavior neurobiology and human genetic diseases and conditions why what makes it such a good model its more like us than you think to benefit medical studies a good model organism needs to share on the molecular level many similar features and pathways with humans it turns out that approximately 60 of a group of readily identified genes that are mutated amplified or deleted in a diverse set of human diseases have a counterpart in drosophila studying these genes in drosophila lets scientists bypass some of the ethical issues of biomedical research involving human subjects theyre easy to keep and work with the fruit fly has many practical features that allow scientists to carry out research with ease a short life cycleease of culture and maintenance anda low number of chromosomesa small genome size in terms of base pairs butgiant salivary gland chromosomes known as polytene chromosomes  lets explore these advantages a bit more and then dive into how the fly has helped us understand a wide range of human conditions image source carolina biological supply company the life cycle of drosophila  12 days lots of offspring the female fruit fly about 3 mm in length will lay between 750 and 1500 eggs in her lifetime the life cycle of the fruit fly only takes about 12 days to complete at room temperature 25°c after the egg at a mere half a millimeter in length is fertilized the embryo emerges in 24 hours the embryo undergoes successive molts to become the first second and third instar larva the larval stages are characterized by consumption of food and resulting growth followed by the quiescent pupal stage during which there is a dramatic reorganization of the body plan metamorphosis followed by the emergence of the adult fly easy to grow easy to keep easy to study because the flies themselves are quite small 1 mg you can raise a lot of them at once traditionally flies have been raised in quarterpint milk bottles using a wellripened banana as food although more often a cornmeal agar mixture is now used genetic experiments can be done in a shell vial with just a few flies thus many different mutant stocks can be maintained and numerous experiments carried out in a small lab space when large amounts of material are needed large population cages which hold up to 50000 flies in a cage that is 1’ diameter x 15’ long can be used that means that scientists can collect and harvest hundreds of grams of embryos larvae or adults at a time the material can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then used as the starting point for preparing enzymes such as rna polymerase ii or for purifying chromosomal proteins such as the histones or for analysis of chromatin structure see chromatin module web mission lifestyles of the tiny and numerous pete geiger of the university of arizona has developed several informational pages on the drosophila life cycle and on the details of maintaining a stock of flies for the lab first visit the page on the drosophila life cycle focus in particular on the short section at the end under the heading life cycle of d melanogaster  to get a handle on how the flies develop and what can affect that development also skim the separate page on culturing and maintaining drosophila in the lab what would you say are the important factors in the environment that researchers need to consider in setting up a fly lab a manageable number of chromosomes the giant polytene chromosomes found in the flys salivary glands compared here with the chromosomes from the flys ovary are another characteristic that makes the fruit fly an important organism for laboratory studies these easily visualized chromosomes provided a road map for early geneticists image source modified from t s painter j hered 25 465476 1934 the genetic information  dna in all cells is carried in the chromosomes literally colored bodies  a complex of dna plus specialized proteins  histones packed in the cells nucleus as with humans the chromosomes of drosophila melanogaster come in pairs  but unlike humans which have 23 pairs of chromosomes the fruit fly has only four a pair of sex chromosomes two x chromosomes for females one x and one y for males together designated chromosome 1 along with three pairs of autosomes nonsex chromosomes labeled 2 through 4 chromosome 4 is the smallest and is also called the dot chromosome it represents just 2 of the fly genome the low manageable number of chromosomes was a key attraction of this organism in early genetic studies indeed some classic genetic analyses of mutations and mapping of mutants to specific chromosomes in drosophila were used to determine the ground rules for the transmission of genes web mission the eyes have it wondering about those amazing eyes red eyes are normal in  wildtype  drosophila but in 1910 the fly lab of thomas hunt morgan at columbia university discovered a mutant strain of flies that had white eyes and using that difference in phenotype as a jumpingoff point conducted an elegant series of experiments that ultimately led to fundamental discoveries about the physical basis of heredity in the bodies we call chromosomes for that work morgan was awarded the 1933 nobel prize in physiology and medicine for this mission go to the dna learning centers short interactive exhibit on morgans work note in particular how morgan and his team began with a simple difference in phenotype to construct a rigorous series of genetic rules particularly for sexlinked inheritance how do you think the characteristics of the fly  particularly its short life span  helped make these experiments possible of course theres more to a fly than its eyes go to the exploratorium page showing the variety of phenotypes that scientists have used to tease out the flys genetic map in the diagram of fly chromosomes notice where the yellowbody and whiteeye genes are located how does that line up with the observations from morgans lab a note on gene names remember that when morgan and his colleagues were working out the rules of fly genetics they did not have any information on the structure of dna or how the information used by the organism might be coded hence they did not know the actual functions of the genes they studied their knowledge of a gene was based simply on the inherited phenotype the white gene is required to have a fly with red eyes so you might have named the gene red but the name always refers to the mutant phenotype – here white eyes – so the name given to the gene was white  structure and organization of the drosophila genome as weve already seen we have learned a tremendous amount about general genetic rules from studies analyzing fly phenotypes across multiple generations and tying those phenotypes to specific locations on chromosomes but to make the leap to using the fly as a model for other organisms we need to drill down deeper to the actual sequence of base pairs within the dna itself sequencing of the genome lets us make direct comparisons between organisms at the molecular level and puts us in the realm of molecular biology  where things really start to get interesting image source science the genome sequence of drosophila melanogaster was published in the journal science in march 2000 studies of the sequence and comparisons with the sequence of the human genome published around a year later have uncovered some key facts in thinking about drosophila as a model organism in terms of base pairs the fly genome is only around 5 of the size of the human genome  that is 132 million base pairs for the fly compared with 32 billion base pairs for the human in terms of the number of genes however the comparison isnt nearly so lopsided the fly has approximately 15500 genes on its four chromosomes whereas humans have about 22000 genes among their 23 chromosomes thus the density of genes per chromosome in drosophila is higher than for the human genome humans and flies have retained the same genes from their common ancestor known as homologs over about 60 of their genome based on an initial comparison approximately 60 of genes associated with human cancers and other genetic diseases are found in the fly genome use of drosophila for studying human behavior development and disease image source j craig venter institute the parallels between the genomes of drosophila and humans are central to using these tiny flies to explore human development behavior and genetic diseases often the genes associated with these attributes in humans have closely matched fly counterparts  and there are many examples of conditions in drosophila that parallel human conditions and that can provide an opportunity to study the function of these genes and perhaps help in the development of valuable drugs genes associated with neurological diseases cancer the hypoxic response infectious disease etc are currently under study a searchable database of such genes is available on ucsds superfly server  the number of human conditions for which drosophila has been used as a model for study is surprising and the story of these explorations can be fascinating each of the following vignettes digs deeper into the role of drosophila in revealing the genetic basis of a common or uncommon human disorder or condition in several of the

all about development much of what is known about animal development comes from the studies on drosophila  and though the products of the developmental process are obviously quite different many of the genes and activation pathways in development are the same in human and the fly to start out visit the chapter on drosophila development from an online textbook for a geneticsanddevelopment introductory course at kenyon college note here the initial point that human and fly development are homologous processes  that is much of the genetic machinery under the hood of development for both organisms derives from genes inherited from a common ancestor thats a key to the ability to use something as seemingly different as a fruit fly to study aspects of embryonic development in humans work through the kenyon page and note the discussion toward the end of the socalled hox homeoboxcontaining genes these genes encode for transcription factors  proteins that regulate the expression of genes in this case in development as is suggested here certain details of the hox genes organization and function are conserved across a huge swath of evolutionary time  for example the hox gene order is the same in the fruit fly and the mouse even though the last common ancestor of these two organisms existed hundreds of millions of years ago evolution of course operates by natural selection on genes that have mutated or changed over time  thats why mice dont look much like fruit flies why would the process of evolution be so disinclined to mess with these genes in particular in development a picture is worth a thousand words and a moving picture worth many thousands so next head over to the fly move web site an online project gathering information images and movies about drosophila
