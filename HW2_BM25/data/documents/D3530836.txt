solid i have had plenty of issues w hollow doors especially the bifold closet doors not only do they tend to break the doors are almost all made entirely of glued up mdflike material which makes it almost impossible to screw anything securely into them ie hinges hooks or rip to slightly smaller size i have seen countless holes punched into them from door stops as well like save february 13 2014 at 550amthank you for reporting this comment undo fred smasonite doors come with at least 3 options for stiles and rails at least 4 options for core material and several different skins dont compare

full mdf doors you see at the big box store they get them with wood stiles and even in a fire rated door to match for the garage to house passage door door stops should not be busting through hollow core doors unless the installer hasnt even passed bumper installations 1013 likes save february 13 2014 at 1111amthank you for reporting this comment undosmileyface2013i think that wood doors are
