the best tool for treating atrial fibrillation march 20 2011 by dr john filed under af ablation atrial fibrillation general cardiology today i would like to tell you about the most effective way to treat the most common heart ailment atrial fibrillation af it’s not the novel anticoagulant drugs though it’s obvious that having stroke prevention options other than warfarin represents a significant advance it’s not burning the left atrium with an ablation catheter though it’s clearly true that we can ablate af much more safely and efficiently than we did in past years it’s not freezing the atria with cryoballoons i tried that strategy and found it equivalent to rf ablation you know it’s definitely not dronedarone — or any other antiarrhythmic drugs by far the most effective way to treat af patients is to provide them information knowledge is king af patients need to know stuff about their crazy new disease af is nuts it can cause heart failure and stroke or it can cause nothing it can disable some and others don’t know they have it its incidence increases with age degree of inflammation and general wearandtear but it can also afflict the athletic and nimble though there is little doubt that doctors lawyers and engineers have more af than yoga instructors here are 13 things i tell af patients i am sorry that you have af welcome to the club there are many members six million americans and counting i know how it feels your fatigue shortness of breath and uneasiness in the chest are most likely related to your af af may pass without treatment important new work suggests af is modifiable with lifestyle measures as in you can help yourself af isn’t immediately lifethreatening though it feels so worrying about af is like worrying about getting gray hair and wrinkles plus excessive worry makes af more likely to occur emergency rooms treat all af in the same way one hammer — often a big one there is no “cure” for af see 5the treatment of af can be worse than the disease the worst and most nonreversible thing that can happen with af is a stroke for af patients with more than one of these conditions age 75 high blood pressure diabetes heart failure or previous stroke the only means of lowering stroke risk is to take an anticoagulant drug sorry about the skin bruises a stroke is worse know you chadsvasc score the treasure of af ablation includes eliminating af episodes without taking medicines but af ablation is not like squishing a blockage or doing a stress test it will be hard on you it works 6080 of the time has to be repeated onethird of the time and has a list of very serious complications if your af heart rate is not excessive it’s unlikely that you will develop heart failure likewise if you have none of the 5 risks for stroke or you take anticoagulant drugs af is unlikely to cause a stroke in these cases you don’t have to take an afrhythm drug s or have an ablation you can live with af you might not be as good as you were but you will continue to be there’s obviously more than 13 things to say about af it’s a complicated disease with many different ways to the same end we need adequate time with our patients to give them this kind of powerful knowledge they need time to digest all the possible treatments or perhaps no treatment patients need to weigh the disease against the treatments all this is why af treatment should not be rushed jmmemail linked in facebook twitter google more related posts how does one treat atrial fibrillation in the unmotivated and uninsured atrial fibrillation ablation in women…are there any real differences congratulations your atrial fibrillation has passed…atrial fibrillation ablation in the news some good science…tagged with pulmonary vein isolation
