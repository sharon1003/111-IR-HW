teaching in france what can you teach and what are the requirements services jobs in paris find thousands of job opportunities in one place through the jobsin network in paris the perfect job board if you’re looking for englishspeaking employment abroadmore france  jobs guide forums articles for many expatriates teaching in france means only one thing teaching english as a foreign language although this is a popular option there are other teaching avenues available such as teaching french to foreigners teaching a musical instrument and running courses in an art or craft although the french are inordinately proud of their own language they’re increasingly albeit reluctantly accepting the necessity of learning english and even allowing the anglosaxon tongue to invade their own by using a growing number of anglicisms this means that english teachers generally have a certain degree of job security at least until governments decide to teach english at a much earlier age in schools and with more efficient methods whether you’re a young graduate wanting experience of another country and culture someone planning to live and work in france long term or a professional taking a career break who wants to try something different teaching english can be a relatively easy way to earn a living what’s more teaching english is one job where you really don’t need any french unless you work in the french education system or teach schoolchildren on a freelance basis your customers will be adults teaching english as a foreign language or indeed any other language or subject to adults cannot be compared to teaching children in a school first and foremost the students are there for a specific usually professional reason someone usually their employer is paying for their course the advantage of this is that the students are motivated – at least in theory for many success or failure could mean promotion or demotion most training sessions – the french generally refer to lessons as ‘training’  formation  – are on a onetoone basis groups are usually small this means that there are seldom problems of discipline and no rigid curriculum to be adhered to on the other hand results are expected – often in a short time – and you may be under intense pressure to achieve those results working conditions for teachers in france teaching english is anything but routine work – and not only in terms of what and how you teach but where and when you teach teachers can be required to work in the centre or away from it as classes are as often held on company premises as in the language school itself this can also mean a lot of travelling from company to company so a car is almost essential although the actual teaching hours may not seem onerous preparation is an important part of the work for fulltimers the ratio is 35 hours paid for 25 hours taught ie ten hours’ preparation moreover teaching adults is rarely a 9to5 job which can be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your circumstances and attitude people want classes after work or at weekends but don’t expect to pay more – and the french want a lot for their money in any case a teacher must be very flexible to accommodate students and company schedules this can mean starting very early and finishing very late sometimes with big gaps in the middle of the day contracts for teaching english abroad are normally shortterm you’re simply called upon when there’s a demand for additional teachers and ignored when there isn’t even with a contract there’s little job security qualifications for teaching english speaking english well isn’t a sufficient qualification for teaching it note in particular that the french are taught grammar in school and you will be expected to name verb tenses and moods and parts of speech although it may come more naturally to some than others teaching is a skill and certain techniques must be learnt requirements vary from centre to centre and language schools don’t always require a specific teaching qualification a university degree and a respectable appearance may suffice the formal qualifications for teaching english as a foreign language are a mass of confusing
