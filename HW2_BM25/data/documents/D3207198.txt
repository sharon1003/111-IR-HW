hydraulic horsepower hhpgpm x psi  1715  hydraulic horsepoweris the horsepower equivalent of “lifting” a continuous volume rate of fluid to the height in ft represented by the pressure involved as if a tall open overflowing standpipe were connected to measure the pressure the weight of fluid directly controls the pressure in a standpipe 520 psi is the bottom pressure of a 1000ft column of 10 lbgal ppg fluid to pump in a gallon at the bottom and move a gallon out the top is equivalent to lifting 10 pounds through 1000 ft or 10000 ftlb a volume of 33 galmin gpm at these conditions is 33000 ftlbmin or 1 horsepower hp because it is the calculation of fluid relations it is referred to as hydraulic horsepower it can be calculated for any part of the system according to the pressure relations for that part of the system thus 33 gpm and 520 psi or 1715 gpm and 1 psi means 1 horsepower for any other properties of fluid pumped 520 psi represents a different height but always the same ftlbgal pumped back to glossary
