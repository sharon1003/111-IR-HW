in verse many traditional verse forms prescribe a specific verse metre or a certain set of metres alternating in a particular order the study and the actual use of metres and forms of versification are both known as prosody within linguistics  prosody  is used in a more general sense that includes not only poetic metre but also the rhythmic aspects of prose whether formal or informal that vary

identified when classifying poetry and its metre qualitative versus quantitative metre  editthe metre of most poetry of the western world and elsewhere is based on patterns of syllables of particular types the familiar type of metre in englishlanguage poetry is called qualitative metre with stressed syllables coming at regular intervals eg in iambic pentameters usually every evennumbered syllable many romance languages use a scheme that is somewhat similar but where the position of only one particular stressed syllable eg the last needs to be fixed the metre of the old germanic poetry of languages such as old norse and old english was radically different but was still based on stress patterns some classical languages in contrast used a different scheme known as quantitative metre where patterns were based on syllable weight rather than stress in the dactylic hexameters of classical latin and classical greek for example each of the six feet making up the line was either a dactyl longshortshort or a spondee longlong a long syllable was literally one that took longer to pronounce than a short syllable specifically a syllable consisting of a long vowel or diphthong or followed by two consonants the stress pattern of the words made no difference to the metre a number of other ancient languages also used quantitative metre such as sanskrit and classical arabic but not biblical hebrew  finally nonstressed languages that have little or no differentiation of syllable length such as french or chinese base their verses on the number of syllables only the most common form in french is the alexandrine with twelve syllables a verse and in classical chinese five characters and thus five syllables but since each chinese character is pronounced using one syllable in a certain tone classical chinese poetry also had more strictly defined rules such as parallelism or antithesis between lines feet  editin many western classical poetic traditions the metre of a verse can be described as a sequence of feet 1 each foot being a specific sequence of syllable types — such as relatively unstressedstressed the norm for english poetry or longshort as in most classical latin and greek poetry iambic pentameter a common metre in english poetry is based on a sequence of five iambic feet or iambs each consisting of a relatively unstressed syllable here represented with × above the syllable followed by a relatively stressed one here represented with  above the syllable — dadum  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  so long as men can breathe or eyes can see ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  so long lives this and this gives life to thee this approach to analyzing and classifying metres originates from ancient greek tragedians and poets such as homer pindar hesiod and sappho however some metres have an overall rhythmic pattern to the line that cannot easily be described using feet this occurs in sanskrit poetry see vedic metre and sanskrit metre although this poetry is in fact specified using feet each foot is more or less equivalent to an entire line it also occurs in some western metres such as the hendecasyllable favoured by catullus and martial which can be described asx x — ∪ ∪ — ∪ — ∪ — — where —  long ∪  short and x x can be realized as — ∪ or — — or ∪ —classification  editfoot type style stress pattern syllable count iamb iambic unstressed  stressed two trochee trochaic stressed

tetrameter five is pentameter six is hexameter seven is heptameter and eight is octameter for example if the feet are iambs and if there are five feet to a line then it is called a iambic pentameter 1 if the feet are primarily dactyls and there are six to a line then it is a dactylic hexameter 1caesura  editsometimes a natural pause occurs in the middle of a line rather than at a linebreak this is a caesura cut a good example is from the winters tale by william shakespeare the caesurae are indicated by  it is for you we speak  not for ourselves you are abused  and by some putteron that will be damnd fort  would i knew the villaini would landdamn him  be she honourflawdi have three daughters  the eldest is eleven in latin and greek poetry a caesura is a break within a foot caused by the end of a word each line of traditional germanic alliterative verse is divided into two halflines by a caesura this can be seen in piers plowman a fair feeld ful of folk  fond i ther bitwene—of alle manere of men  the meene and the richewerchynge and wandrynge  as the world asketh somme putten hem to the plough  pleiden ful seldein settynge and sowynge  swonken ful hardeand wonnen that thise wastours  with glotonye destruyeth enjambment  editmain article enjambment by contrast with caesura enjambment is incomplete syntax at the end of a line the meaning runs over from one poetic line to the next without terminal punctuation also from shakespeares the winters tale i am not prone to weeping as our sex commonly are the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities but i have that honourable grief lodged here which burns worse than tears drown metric variations  editpoems with a welldefined overall metric pattern often have a few lines that violate that pattern a common variation is the inversion of a foot which turns an iamb dadum into a trochee dumda another common variation is a headless verse which lacks the first syllable of the first foot yet a third variation is catalexis where the end of a line is shortened by a foot or two or part thereof  an example of this is at the end of each verse in keats la belle dame sans merci and on thy cheeks a fading rose 4 feetfast withereth too 2 feetin various languages  editsanskrit  editmain articles sanskrit prosody and vedic metre versification in classical sanskrit poetry is of three kinds syllabic verse akṣaravṛtta metres depend on the number of syllables in a verse with relative freedom in the distribution of light and heavy syllables this style is derived from older vedic forms and found in the great epics the mahabharata and the ramayana syllaboquantitative verse varṇavṛtta metres depend on syllable count but the lightheavy patterns are fixed quantitative verse mātrāvṛtta metres depend on duration where each verseline has a fixed number of morae usually grouped in sets of four standard traditional works on metre are pingalas chandaḥśāstra and kedāras vṛttaratnākara the most exhaustive compilations such as the modern ones by patwardhan and velankar contain over 600 metres this is a substantially larger repertoire than in any other metrical tradition greek and latin  editmain article prosody latinfurther information prosody greekthe metrical feet in the classical languages were based on the length of time taken to pronounce each syllable which were categorized according to their weight as either long syllables or short syllables indicated as dum and di below these are also called heavy and light syllables respectively to distinguish from long and short vowels the foot is often compared to a musical measure and the long and short syllables to whole notes and half notes in english poetry feet are determined by emphasis rather than length with stressed and unstressed syllables serving the same function as long and short syllables in classical metre the basic unit in greek and latin prosody is a mora which is defined as a single short syllable a long syllable is equivalent to two morae a long syllable contains either a long vowel a diphthong or a short vowel followed by two or more consonants various rules of elision sometimes prevent a grammatical syllable from making a full syllable and certain other lengthening and shortening rules such as correption can create long or short syllables in contexts where one would expect the opposite the most important classical metre is the dactylic hexameter the metre of homer and virgil this form uses verses of six feet the word dactyl comes from the greek word daktylos meaning finger since there is one long part followed by two short stretches 2 the first four feet are dactyls  daaduhduh  but can be spondees  daadaa  the fifth foot is almost always a dactyl the sixth foot is either a spondee or a trochee  daaduh  the initial syllable of either foot is called the ictus the basic beat of the verse there is usually a caesura after the ictus of the third foot the opening line of the æneid is a typical line of dactylic hexameter armă vĭ  rumquĕ că  nō troi  ae quī  prīmŭs ăb  ōrīs i sing of arms and the man who first from the shores of troyin this example the first and second feet are dactyls their first syllables ar and rum respectively contain short vowels but count as long because the vowels are both followed by two consonants the third and fourth feet are spondees the first of which is divided by the main caesura of the verse the fifth foot is a dactyl as is nearly always the case the final foot is a spondee the dactylic hexameter was imitated in english by henry wadsworth longfellow in his poem evangeline this is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocksbearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilightstand like druids of old with voices sad and propheticstand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms notice how the first line this is the  for est pri  me val the  mur muring  pines and the  hemlocks follows this patterndum diddy  dum diddy  dum diddy  dum diddy  dum diddy  dum dum also important in greek and latin poetry is the dactylic pentameter this was a line of verse made up of two equal parts each of which contains two dactyls followed by a long syllable which counts as a half foot in this way the number of feet amounts to five in total spondees can take the place of the dactyls in the first half but never in the second the long syllable at the close of the first half of the verse always ends a word giving rise to a caesura dactylic pentameter is never used in isolation rather a line of dactylic pentameter follows a line of dactylic hexameter in the elegiac distich or elegiac couplet a form of verse that was used for the composition of elegies and other tragic and solemn verse in the greek and latin world as well as love poetry that was sometimes light and cheerful an example from ovid s tristia vergĭlĭ  um vī  dī tan  tum nĕc ă  māră tĭ  bullō tempŭs ă  mīcĭtĭ  ae  fātă dĕ  dērĕ mĕ  ae virgil i merely saw and the harsh fates gave tibullus no time for my friendship the greeks and romans also used a number of lyric metres which were typically used for shorter poems than elegiacs or hexameter in aeolic verse one important line was called the hendecasyllabic a line of eleven syllables this metre was used most often in the sapphic stanza named after the greek poet sappho who wrote many of her poems in the form a hendecasyllabic is a line with a nevervarying structure two trochees followed by a dactyl then two more trochees in the sapphic stanza three hendecasyllabics are followed by an adonic line made up of a dactyl and a trochee this is the form of catullus 51 itself an homage to sappho 31  illĕ mī pār essĕ dĕō vĭdēturillĕ sī fās est sŭpĕrārĕ dīvōsquī sĕdēns adversŭs ĭdentĭdem tē

so after noticing that poems consisted of repeated syllables in each verse in his first book alard  arabic العرض alʿarḍ  he described 15 types of verse alakhfash described one extra the 16th a short syllable contains a short vowel with no following consonants for example the word kataba which syllabifies as kataba contains three short vowels and is made up of three short syllables a long syllable contains either a long vowel or a short vowel followed by a consonant as is the case in the word maktūbun which syllabifies as maktūbun these are the only syllable types possible in classical arabic phonology which by and large does not allow a syllable to end in more than one consonant or a consonant to occur in the same syllable after a long vowel in other words syllables of the type āk or akr are not found in classical arabic each verse consists of a certain number of metrical feet  tafāʿīl or ʾaǧzāʾ and a certain combination of possible feet constitutes a metre  baḥr  the traditional

classical arabic even though these are quite different in both origin and structure this has led to serious confusion among prosodists both ancient and modern as to the true source and nature of the persian meters the most obvious error being the assumption that they were copied from arabic 3persian poetry is quantitative and the metrical patterns are made of long and short syllables much as in classical greek latin and arabic anceps positions in the line however that is places where either a long or short syllable can be used marked x in the schemes below are not found in persian verse except in some metres at the beginning of a line persian poetry is written in couplets with each halfline hemistich being 1014 syllables long except in the rubai quatrain where either of two very similar metres may be used the same metre is used for every line in the poem rhyme is always used sometimes with double rhyme or internal rhymes in addition in some poems known as masnavi the two halves of each couplet rhyme with a scheme aa bb cc and so on in lyric poetry the same rhyme is used throughout the poem at the end of each couplet but except in the opening couplet the two halves of each couplet do not rhyme hence the scheme is aa ba ca da a rubai quatrain also usually has the rhyme aa ba a particular feature of classical persian prosody not found in latin greek or arabic is that instead of two lengths of syllables long and short there are three lengths short long and overlong overlong syllables can be used anywhere in the line in place of a long  a short or in the final position in a line or half line 4 5 when a metre has a pair of short syllables u u it is common for a long syllable to be substituted especially at the end of a line or halfline about 30 different

the actual scansion of the metre is complicated by various factors including linguistic changes and variations encountered in dealing with a tradition extending over a geographically extensive regional area for a continuous time period of over some twoandahalf millennia beginning with the earlier recorded forms the classic of poetry tends toward couplets of fourcharacter lines grouped in rhymed quatrains and the chuci follows this to some extent but moves toward variations in line length han dynasty poetry tended towards the variable linelength forms of the folk ballads and the music bureau yuefu jianan poetry six dynasties poetry and tang dynasty poetry tend towards a poetic metre based on fixedlength lines of five seven or more rarely six charactersverbal units tended to predominate generally in couplet quatrain based forms of various total verse lengths the song poetry is specially known for its use of the ci using variable line lengths which follow the specific pattern of a certain musical songs lyrics thus ci are sometimes referred to as fixedrhythm forms yuan poetry metres continued this practice with their qu forms similarly fixedrhythm forms based on now obscure or perhaps completely lost original examples or urtypes not that classical chinese poetry ever lost the use of the shi forms with their metrical patterns found in the old style poetry  gushi and the regulated verse forms of  lüshi or jintishi  the regulated verse forms also prescribed patterns based upon linguistic tonality the use of caesura is important in regard to the metrical analysis of classical chinese poetry forms old english  editthe metric system of old english poetry was different from that of modern english and related more to the verse forms of most of the older germanic languages such as old norse it used alliterative verse a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number usually four of strong stresses in each line the unstressed syllables were relatively unimportant but the caesurae breaks between the halflines played a major role in old english poetry 7in place of using feet alliterative verse divided each line into two halflines each halfline had to follow one of five or so patterns each of which defined a sequence of stressed and unstressed syllables typically with two stressed syllables per half line unlike typical western poetry however the number of unstressed syllables could vary somewhat for example the common pattern dumdadumda could allow between one and five unstressed syllables between the two stresses the following is a famous example taken from the battle of maldon a poem written shortly after the date of that battle ad 991 hige sceal þe heard ra  heor te þe cēn remōd sceal þe mā re  swā ūre mægen lȳt lað will must be the harder courage the bolder spirit must be the more as our might lessens in the quoted section the stressed syllables have been underlined normally the stressed syllable must be long if followed by another syllable in a word however by a rule known as syllable resolution two short syllables in a single word are considered equal to a single long syllable hence sometimes two syllables have been underlined as in hige and mægen  the german philologist eduard sievers died 1932 identified five different patterns of halfline in anglosaxon alliterative poetry the first three halflines have the type a pattern dumda dadumda while the last one has the type c pattern da dadadumdumda with parentheses indicating optional unstressed syllables that have been inserted note also the pervasive pattern of alliteration where the first andor second stressed syllables alliterate with the third but not with the fourth modern english  editmost english metre is classified according to the same system as classical metre with an important difference english is an accentual language and therefore beats and offbeats stressed and unstressed syllables take the place of the long and short syllables of classical systems in most english verse the metre can be considered as a sort of back beat against which natural speech rhythms vary expressively the most common characteristic feet of english verse are the iamb in two syllables and the anapest in three see foot prosody for a complete list of the metrical feet and their names metrical systems  editthe number of metrical systems in english is not agreed upon 8 the four major types 9 are accentual verse accentualsyllabic verse syllabic verse and quantitative verse 10 the alliterative verse of old english could also be added to this list or included as a special type of accentual verse accentual verse focuses on the number of stresses in a line while ignoring the number of offbeats and syllables accentualsyllabic verse focuses on regulating both the number of stresses and the total number of syllables in a line syllabic verse only counts the number of syllables in a line quantitative verse regulates the patterns of long and short syllables this sort of verse is often considered alien to english 11 it is to be noted however that the use of foreign metres in english is all but exceptional 12frequentlyused metres  editthe most frequently encountered metre of english verse is the iambic pentameter in which the metrical norm is five iambic feet per line though metrical substitution is common and rhythmic variations practically inexhaustible john milton s paradise lost most sonnets and much else besides in english are written in iambic pentameter lines of unrhymed iambic pentameter are commonly known as blank verse 13 blank verse in the english language is most famously represented in the plays of william shakespeare and the great works of milton though tennyson  ulysses the princess and wordsworth  the prelude also make notable use of it a rhymed pair of lines of iambic pentameter make a heroic couplet 14 a verse form which was used so often in the 18th century that it is now used mostly for humorous effect although see pale fire for a nontrivial case the most famous writers of heroic couplets are dryden and pope another important metre in english is the ballad metre also called the common metre which is a fourline stanza with two pairs of a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of iambic trimeter the rhymes usually fall on the lines of trimeter although in many instances the tetrameter also rhymes this is the metre of most of the border and scots or english ballads in hymnody it is called the common metre as it is the most common of the named hymn metres used to pair many hymn lyrics with melodies such as amazing grace 15amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like mei once was lost but now am found was blind but now i see emily dickinson is famous for her frequent use of ballad metre great streets of silence led away to neighborhoods of pause —here was no notice — no dissent —no universe — no laws french  editin french poetry metre is determined solely by the number of syllables in a line a silent e counts as a syllable before a consonant but is elided before a vowel where h aspiré counts as a consonant at the end of a line the e remains unelided but is hypermetrical outside the count of syllables like a feminine ending in english verse in that case the rhyme is also called feminine whereas it is called masculine in the other cases the most frequently encountered metre in classical french poetry is the alexandrine composed of two hemistiches of six syllables each two famous alexandrines are la fille de minos et de pasiphaë  jean racine the daughter of minos and pasiphae and waterloo  waterloo  waterloo  morne plaine  victor hugo waterloo waterloo waterloo gloomy plain classical french poetry also had a complex set of rules for rhymes that goes beyond how words merely sound these are usually taken into account when describing the metre of a poem spanish  editin spanish poetry the metre is determined by the number of syllables the verse has still it is the phonetic accent in the last word of the verse that decides the final count of the line if the accent of the final word is at the last syllable then the poetic rule states that one syllable shall be added to the actual count of syllables in the said line thus having a higher number of poetic syllables than the number of grammatical syllables if the accent lies on the second to last syllable of the last word in the verse then the final count of poetic syllables will be the same as the grammatical number of syllables furthermore if the accent lies on the third to last syllable then one syllable is subtracted from the actual count having then less poetic syllables than grammatical syllables spanish poetry uses poetic licenses unique to romance languages to change the number of syllables by manipulating mainly the vowels in the line regarding these poetic licenses one must consider three kinds of phenomena 1 syneresis 2 dieresis and 3 hiatus syneresis a diphthong is made from two consecutive vowels in a word which do not normally form one poeta lealtad instead of the standard poeta poet lealtad loyalty dieresis the opposite of syneresis a syllable break is inserted between two vowels which usually make a diphthong thus eliminating it ruido cielo for the standard ruido noise cielo sky or heaven this is sometimes marked by placing a dieresis sign over the vowel which would otherwise be the weak one in the diphthong rüido cïelo synalepha spanish sinalefa  the final vowel of a word and the initial one of the next are pronounced in one syllable for example cuando salí de collores fue en una jaquita baya por un sendero entre mayas arropás de cundiamores this stanza from valle de collores by luis lloréns torres uses eight poetic syllables given that all words at the end of each line have their phonetic accent on the second to last syllables no syllables in the final count are added or subtracted still in the second and third verse the grammatical count of syllables is nine poetic licenses permit the union of two vowels that are next to each other but in different syllables and count them as one fue en has actually two syllables but applying this license both vowels unite and form only one giving the final count of eight syllables sendero entre has five grammatical syllables but uniting the o from sendero and the first e from entre gives only four syllables permitting it to have eight syllables in the verse as well hiatus it is the opposite phenomenon to synalepha two neighboring vowels in different words are kept in separate syllables cabello  de  ángel with six poetic syllables instead of the more common cabello  de ͜ ángel with five there are many types of licenses used either to add or subtract syllables that may be applied when needed after taking in consideration the poetic rules of the last word yet all have in common that they only manipulate vowels that are close to each other and not interrupted by consonants some common metres in spanish verse are septenary a line with seven poetic syllables octosyllable a line with eight poetic syllables this metre is commonly used in romances narrative poems similar to english ballads and in most proverbs hendecasyllable a line with eleven poetic syllables this metre plays a similar role to pentameter in english verse it is commonly used in sonnets among other things alexandrine a line consisting of fourteen syllables commonly separated by two hemistiches of seven syllables each in anglosaxon or french contexts this term refers to twelve syllable lines but not in the spanish context italian  editin italian poetry metre is determined solely by the position of the last accent in a line the position of the other accents being however important for verse equilibrium syllables are enumerated with respect to a verse which ends with a paroxytone so that a septenary having seven syllables is defined as a verse whose last accent falls on the sixth syllable it may so contain eight syllables  ei fu siccome im mo bile or just six  la terra al nunzio sta  moreover when a word ends with a vowel and the next one starts with a vowel they are considered to be in the same syllable synalepha so gli anni e i giorni consists of only four syllables gli an ni e i gior ni evensyllabic verses have a fixed stress pattern because of the mostly trochaic nature of the italian language verses with an even number of syllables are far easier to compose and the novenary is usually regarded as the most difficult verse some common metres in italian verse are sexenary a line whose last stressed syllable is on the fifth with a fixed stress on the second one as well  al re travi cel lo  pio vu to ai ra noc chi giustiseptenary a line whose last stressed syllable is the sixth one octosyllable a line whose last accent falls on the seventh syllable more often than not the secondary accents fall on the first third and fifth syllable especially in nursery rhymes for which this metre is particularly wellsuited hendecasyllable a line whose last accent falls on the tenth syllable it therefore usually consists of eleven syllables there are various kinds of possible accentuations it is used in sonnets in ottava rima and in many other types of poetry the divine comedy in particular is composed entirely of hendecasyllables whose main stress pattern is on the 4th and 10th syllable  citation neededturkish  editapart from ottoman poetry which was heavily influenced by persian traditions 16 and created a unique ottoman style traditional turkish poetry features a system in which the number of syllables in each verse must be the same most frequently 7 8 11 14 syllables these verses are then divided into syllable groups depending on the number of total syllables in a verse 43 for 7 syllables 44 or 53 for 8 443 or 65 for 11 syllables the end of each group in a verse is called a durak stop and must coincide with the last syllable of a word the following example is by faruk nafiz çamlıbel died 1973 one of the most devoted users of traditional turkish metre derinden deri ne ırmaklar ağ lar uzaktan uza ğa çoban çeşme si ey suyun sesin den anlayan bağ lar ne söyler şu da ğa çoban çeşme si in this poem the 65 metre is used so that there is a wordbreak  durak  stop or caesura after the sixth syllable of every line as well as at the end of each line ottoman turkish  editin the ottoman turkish language the structures of the poetic foot تفعل tefile and of poetic metre وزن vezin were imitated from persian poetry about twelve of the commonest persian metres were used for writing turkish poetry as was the case with persian no use at all was made of the commonest metres of arabic poetry the tawīl basīt kāmil and wāfir  17 however the terminology used to described the metres was indirectly borrowed from the arabic poetic tradition through the medium of the persian language as a result ottoman poetry also known as dîvân poetry was generally written in quantitative moratimed metre the moras or syllables are divided into three basic types open or light

early indoeuropean languages the earliest known unambiguously metrical texts and at the same time the only metrical texts with a claim of dating to the late bronze age are the hymns of the rigveda that the texts of the ancient near east sumerian egyptian or semitic should not exhibit metre is surprising and may be partly due to the nature of bronze age writing  citation needed there were in fact attempts to reconstruct metrical qualities of the poetic portions of the hebrew bible eg by gustav bickell 21 or julius ley 22 but they remained inconclusive 23 see biblical poetry  early iron

idea that metre is a fundamental part of poetry 20thcentury american poets marianne moore william carlos williams and robinson jeffers were poets who believed that metre was imposed upon poetry by man and not a fundamental part of its nature in an essay titled robinson jeffers  the metric fallacy dan schneider echoes jeffers sentiments what if someone actually said to you that all music was composed of just 2 notes or if someone claimed that there were just 2 colors in creation now ponder if such a thing were true imagine the clunkiness  mechanicality of such music think of the visual arts devoid of not just color but sepia tones  even shades of gray jeffers called his technique rolling stresses moore went further than jeffers openly declaring her poetry was written in syllabic form and wholly denying metre these syllabic lines from her famous poem poetry illustrate her contempt for metre and other poetic tools even the syllabic pattern of this poem does not remain perfectly consistentnor is it valid to discriminate against business documents andschoolbooks all these phenomena are important one must make a distinction however when dragged into prominence by half poets the result is not poetry williams tried to form poetry whose subject matter was centered on the lives of common people he came up with the concept of the variable foot williams spurned traditional metre in most of his poems preferring what he called colloquial idioms another poet that turned his back on traditional concepts of metre was britains gerard manley hopkins hopkins major innovation was what he called sprung rhythm he claimed most poetry was written in this older rhythmic structure inherited from the norman side of the english literary heritage  citation needed based on repeating groups
