from philippines 4 likes received18 likes given visitor subclass 600 visa tourist or sponsored family stream hi i am planning to get my parents to come here in oz to take care of my baby most likely for maximum of 12 months my questions are 1 which visitor visa is best in our circumstances  would it be the tourist stream or sponsored family stream 2 if sponsored family stream will they require a bond 3 if i will show a bank statement to show that i could support them about how much money do i need in the bank 4 when is the best time to apply for their visa if they will be flying in may 2014 is it too early to apply now 5 if i will apply early next year i would be on maternity leave with no income aside from my husbands which we spend for our everyday expenses will that matter here are the circumstances 1 my parents are between 5566 yo 2 they dont own any property under their names as the house where they live is under my brothers name 3 they are both retired from their work and are currently taking good care of my niece 4 they dont have their own bank accounts to show that they can support themselves while here in oz i will be responsible for all the expenses that they will incur here ie food accommodation etc i really hope that someone could help me on this thanks 2  permalink 09192013 0337 amkmarees1986senior member join date apr 2012location yeppoon qldposts 531 from

requested the situation youre describing means your parents are not genuine tourists as they intend to live here for a year  this may mean it will be hard to get either kind of visa especially since they will be expected to have atleast 1000 per month each of their own money on the visitor visa i would go for the family sponsored visa as it suits your situation more and you can support them plus theres the opportunity to pay the bond if the co requires it as assurance they will leave you should consult a migration agent with this case also 3  permalink 09192013 0813 ammish moderator join date

would confirm that with a phone call to immigration looks like the sponsored family visa is a no go in this case i am not so sure immigration will allow your parents to visit for 12 months to live with you and look after your child on a tourist visa but stranger things have happened 6  permalink 09192013 0257 pmcollege girl moderator join date nov 2012posts 9004 from usa 4401 likes received6233
