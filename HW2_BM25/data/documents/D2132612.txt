common names turbot french sole long jaw flounder top range arrowtooth flounder range from baja california to the eastern bering sea and is most abundant at the northern part of its range little is known about the stock structure on the pacific coast the population of arrowtooth flounder off the west coast of vancouver island is thought to be separate from the population in hecate strait another population is distinguished in queen charlotte sound but again it is unknown if this stock is separate or contiguous with the stock in hecate strait or west coast vancouver island top habitat and distribution arrowtooth flounder off the bc coast inhabit depths between 50 and 900 m and show preference for a narrow range of bottom temperature between 7 and 8 °c as adults they show little preference for bottom type but juvenile s apparently prefer sand and mud bottoms arrowtooth flounder occupy separate winter spawning and summer feeding areas undertaking a seasonal bathymetric movement from shallower water in summer to deeper water in winter in the bc bottom trawl fishery adults are found on the continental shelf in summer the median depth of catch is 140 m with 90 of catch between 75 and 175 m in the winter they move to the continental slope with the median depth of catch at 360 m and 90 of the catch between 275 and 525 m arrowtooth flounder commercial fishery catch distribution maps are at the following links bc bottom trawl fishery 19962003overall janmar aprjun julsep octdec the seasonal depth distribution of arrowtooth flounder catch in the bc bottom trawl fishery from 1996 to 2003 is shown below top reproduction limited research has been carried out on the species life history arrowtooth flounder are batch spawners and peak spawning occurs in fall and winter at depths deeper than 350 m the mature population off washington migrates seasonally from depths of about 183 m in summer to depths exceeding 475 m in winter there is some evidence to suggest that the time of first spawning and the time of peak spawning vary between years the species produces pelagic eggs that drift with the ocean currents fecundity of arrowtooth flounder is not known larvae remain in the upper 100m of the water for about 4 weeks however there is some evidence of an extended larval period of several months young of the year as well as one and twoyearolds are found in shallow waters whereas three and fouryearolds are generally found in deeper water with the adults top growth arrowtooth flounder exhibit sexual dimorphism as juvenile s  38 cm males and females grow at the same rate however after sexual maturity at about five years of age females grow faster than males and attain larger maximum size the maximum length observed for males in biological samples over the last 20 years is 75 cm the maximum length for females over the same period is 84 cm the maximum weights of males and females determined from biological samples are 17 kg and 31 kg respectively the lengthweight relationship for arrowtooth flounder was calculated using data collected during research surveys of hecate strait from 1998 to 2002 the weightatlength was similar for males and females the calculated functional regression relationship for males was w  15210 5  l 291lengthatage has been examined by applying the von bertalanffy growth curve to data for both males and females using the equation l a  l ∞ 1e  k atawhere l a is length at age a in mm l ∞ is the maximum average length k is the growth rate coefficient and t o is the estimates age where l  0 female arrowtooth flounder are larger at age than males the parameters for the different relationships are given in the table below male female l ∞ 476 618k 0265 0193t o 0266 0266 top maturity age at 50 maturity of arrowtooth flounder males is 4 years and for females is 5 years males mature at a size of about 31 cm compared to females at about 38 cm the rate of maturityatlength is different among the sexes with males maturing at smaller lengths than females l 100  the length at which 100 of the fish are mature is 43 cm for males and 55 cm for females top longevity and mortality the maximum age recorded for arrowtooth flounder in bc is 25 years although most of the fished population is less than 15 years of age it has been estimated that approximately 18 of adult fish die of natural causes each year put another way it would take 15 years for 95 of the fish of the same age to die of natural causes fishing increases the total mortality rate under average fishing conditions it has been estimated that about 30 of the adult fish die each year under these conditions it would take 9 years for 95 of the fish of the same age to die top diet juvenile arrowtooth flounder feed on mobile prey such as cumaceans carideans and gammarid amphipods adults are more piscivorous and cannibalistic feeding on herring juvenile pollock and pacific sandlance in hecate strait a study of groundfish diet over 1984 1987 showed that adult arrowtooth flounder fed mainly on unidentified fish 53 herring 14 forage fish 11 and macrobenthos 9 juvneiles also fed primarily on unidentified fish 38 but ate greater amounts of macrobenthos 26 as well as euphausiids 11 and shrimp 8 but less forage fish 5 than adults top predators a study of groundfish stomach contents in hecate strait from 1984  1987 found arrowtooth flounder eaten by pacific halibut pacific cod bocaccio rockfish pacific sanddab and rock sole other studies have shown that juvenile arrowtooth flounder are prey for large walleye pollock top fishery arrowtooth flounder is an important component of the bottom trawl fishery although over the past 45 years most of the arrowtooth flounder catch has been discarded this is because the species is softfleshed and after death there is rapid proteolysis deterioration of the muscle tissue resulting in a mushy flesh thus there was little market demand for the filets and arrowtooth flounder were mainly caught as bycatch in other directed fisheries in 2003 the landed value of the fishery was  13 million the reported catch of arrowtooth flounder in the bc bottom trawl fishery by trawl management area is shown below top population trends biomass estimates for arrowtooth flounder are available for the west coast of vancouver island from us triennial surveys and for hecate strait from the fisheries and oceans canada longterm multispecies survey however there are no biomass estimates for queen charlotte sound despite the presence of a substantial population in that region size composition of the surveyed arrowtooth flounder areas has remained relatively constant since 1984 biomass appeared to increase in hecate strait between 1980 and 1991 then declined from 1991 to 1998 increasing again in 2000 to 1991 levels catch per unit effort  cpue of arrowtooth flounder in bc has shown no overall trend but there have been fluctuations from relative lows in 1984 to high levels in 1989 followed by a decline in 1993 and another increase in 2000 results from an analysis of observer data indicate that the variability in the cpue index from the commercial fishery is mainly due to area and seasonal effects and in some cases depth and that these variables can change among years top references di cosimo j d 1998 groundfish of the gulf of alaska area a species
