for agencies not funded gateway bhs phs savannah  170966 why is our co c losing funds year after year the simple answer is that our total community co c score is low as compared to other communities competing for funds receipt of communitywide hud funding is based on an overall co c score all of chatham county and scores for individual projects the underlying theme of a strong score is reducing homelessness  frankly we are not successful as a community in this area see the five project headings above for a list of community funded projects for many years we built a system of  serving  the homeless with limited success via success in other communities we have learned that we need to build a system of  solving  homelessness serving often makes individuals feel good serving a meal donating clothes a night in emergency shelter however only access to housing solves homelessness and once housed data reveals that persons are more successful in addressing the myriad of issues contributing to their homeless status those issues personal to the individual as a community we have responsibility to address those issues that are about policy and decision makingsuch as short and longterm planning that ensures there is enough housing for everyone who needs it our community faces critical shortages of very affordable and affordable housing as well as high rents and other problematic barriers like a high eviction rate and the recent law suit challenging crime free housing in garden city from huds perspective all these elements contribute to problematic system performance hud has provided co c planning dollars for the past two years and for the coming year csah has utilzed the funds for a variety of efforts to build community engagement we are confident overall awareness of the sitution is better among local goverment leaders business leaders nonprofits and the community at large it has become clear that policy work is essential to make headway to reduce our annual homeless count annual homeless count results 2014  3997 persons 2015  4224 persons 2016  4513 persons job openings none at presenttiny house big heart event – see folks having a good timephotos provided by richard leo johnson atlantic archives inc fine architectual and interior photograph the cove at dundee tiny house project for homeless veterans  update february 26 2018 finallylast thursday evening a csah board committee selected the contractor for the substantial infrastructure work at 75 dundee the tiny house for homeless veterans project three contractors bid on the job the work includes tree removal installation of the main road connection to the sewer and addition of water lines an unexpected cost driver is the cost of fill basicallydirt this element of the work has increased the infrastructure budget to adjust we are implementing a three phase approach this means phase i includes the critical infrastructure one clubhouse and completion of villages one and two 24 units phase ii includes two additional villages and the second clubhouse phase iii is the same as phase ii with the possible additional of fencing on the property as many of you know the pace of the project has been slow as most of the predevelopment work was provided inkind by local businesses we are so grateful for their significant contribution to the project a big project disappointment in 2017 was the denial of funding requests from chatham county and the city of savannah for a small portion of the project 11 each we hope that in 2018 as the first two villages are completed that we may see a change in local governments priority in the area of very affordable housing some of you may remember that in our most recent annual homeless count of 4513 persons that 286 are homeless veterans ck tiny house project  older progress notes thank you to the city of savannah for their support in pulling down an old brick building on the property that was in danger of collapsing the building removal was the first step in clearing the land for the infrastructure installation we also has a basic road cut through the front of the property and removed some fallen trees from our neighbors property i want to note that a difficult part of project progress required us to move about 50 homeless individuals from the tiny house property despite recommendations we have provided to local goverment leadership we do not have a plan for the many individuals who live outside  rather these individuals many who are chronic homeless persons move from place to placetoplace as new development and roads displace them this situation has caused some of our homeless residents to move three or more times over the past 15 months we can report more tension among the many individuals forced to live outside due to lack of housing options for them it has become a frustrating experience for our homeless residents and our staff who are caught between local government entities unwilling to find a solution to this problem i should note that csah has recommended a solution but no action has been taken on it as an interim solution we recommend the development of a basic campground with toilets and running water to ensure acceptable sanitation is maintained make it easier for policesocial service oversight and to reduce the growing tension among camp residents about the ongoing shuffle we believe this change would be the first step in rethinking affordable housing options for homeless residents tiny house project description the tiny house project also known as the cove at dundee completed the approval process in september 2016 at present csah staff are working to raise the 17 million needed to fund the project the project was approved for up to 80 units although we anticipate that given site conditions that we will house 72 veterans additionally three clubhouses shared by the members will be located on the site what will the cove at dundee be like ideas about how to work effectively with homeless persons have changed in recent years it can take time for homeless service providers to embrace new ideas and adjust programs to meet research based best practices most chatham area programs in existence today began with the program model of providing services and ensuring that individuals comply with certain requirements including our agency before housing was an option at times these requirements could be quite harsh given what is known about hierarchy of needs in humans basic needs must be met in order for humans to move up the ladder to selfactualization best practice today indicates that a service approach is problematic a better approach is to provide persons with housing firs t and then offer servicessupport when there is readiness to receive them living without housing is traumatic an individuals ability to be focused productive and successful is compromised severely when housing is not present most of us simply take for granted the refuge our homes are to us this refuge provides the foundation for our lives and our ability to meet our needs these ideas are present in our program approach to serving homeless veterans in the tiny house project each village of twelve persons will be a selfmanaged entity with a selected resident manager initially appointed but eventually elected by residents residents will meet regularly to make decisions about how to live in community determine basic rules of behavior and allow for individual needs and creativity residents will not be required to see a case manager or attend aa meetings or attend other services however such services will be available for the time a resident is interested in such support villages will need to work together to coordinate efforts for activities such as grocery shopping medical appointments maintaining the interior and exterior of their homes and maintenance of the common areas village residents will also elect a representative to sit on a council of villages 6 anticipated villages of 12 persons to plan for larger activities and problem solve for community wide efforts or concerns we anticipate that it will take some time for the smooth operation of each village csah will provide staff leadership to support village efforts to determine what works best for them we expect mistakes but also expect villages and individuals will improve with time as residents heal they will have opportunities to work volunteer and give back to the community at large tour the tiny house model the tiny house model parked at 704 wheaton street in the parking lot of the savannah baptist center the tiny house is available for tours by calling or emailing the csah executive director cindy kelley at 9126447945 or ckelleyhomelessauthorityorg  groups and individuals are welcome to tour the model general information about the tiny house project the location at 75 dundee is on the site of a former cotton mill a homeless camp had been on the site for decades we anticipate building 72 homes on the site over 5 years our tiny homes are 16x8 128 square feet the four americans with disabilities ada compliant units are 18x8 144 square feet they are well built homes with exterior cladding in cement board and a metal roof if you drive by to see the model you will notice we have selected white and red exterior paint for the model the interior of the unit is tongue and grove pine on walls and ceiling 11 feet 4 inch celing height it has two windows an entrance door with six light panels a small kitchen with microwave refrigerator and hotplate a bathroom with shower and a single bed that works as a sofa during the day the floors are ceramic tile and there is plenty of storage under the bed broader community enhancements will include outdoor tables grills and gardens plans are also in place for a small chapel on the site the materials cost for each tiny house is 10000 the total project cost is 17 million land 3 clubhouses 72 homes site preparation this total cost divided by 72 units reveals a cost per housing unit at 23611 this is incredibly affordable housing and we are proud to show what can be done with creative alternative approaches to housing development we hope that individuals and groups will want to raise funds to support the building of one or more units the nonprofit hbi is coordinating the build of the first village of twelve units thereby keeping our costs low they also built the model with materials cost contributed by an anonymous donor architect and artist bede van dyke has put in many hours in the design of the tiny house and most recently in the development of the site plan housing developer gary wiggin has provided project leadership and supported our efforts to build housing development competence and expertise this project is only possible due to the willingness of many to give of their time expertise and financial gifts housing is a basic need most of us take for granted without housing a persons ability to build a sustainable existence is severly compromised we are proud to embrace housing first and provide very low cost very affordable permanent housing for those most in need watch here for more updates about this exciting project cindy csah strategic plan 2016  2020  we are pleased to present our current strategic plan our plan is a departure from past plans this departure is a result of embracing research about effective approaches to reducing homelessness around the country we are confident that savannahchatham area leaders and
