according to the new testament elders are responsible for the primary leadership and oversight of a church the function and role of an elder is well summarized by alexander strauch in his book biblical eldership “elders lead the church 1 tim 517 titus 17 1 peter 51–2 teach and preach the word 1 timothy 32 2 timothy 42 titus 19 protect the church from false teachers acts 2017 28–31 exhort and admonish the saints in sound doctrine 1 timothy 413 2 timothy 313–17 titus 19 visit the sick and pray james 514 acts 64 and judge doctrinal issues acts 156 in biblical terminology elders shepherd oversee lead and care for the local church” 16“elder” and “pastor” are not two different offices as john piper argues in section five of the booklet “ biblical eldership ” they are simply two different words for the same office he gives three reasons first in acts 2028 elders are encouraged in the “pastoral” duties of overseeing and shepherding second in 1 peter 51–2 elders are exhorted to “shepherd” the flock of god that is in their charge which is the role of a pastor third in ephesians 411 the one time that the word pastor occurs in the nt pastors are treated as one group with teachers this suggests that the chief role of the pastor is to feed the flock through teaching which is a primary role of elders titus 19 hence the nt seems to indicate that “pastor” is another name for “elder” an elder is a pastor and a pastor is an elder some have thought that the bible speaks of a category of church leaders above elderspastors called “overseers” however the biblical evidence indicates that “overseer” is simply another term for elder as well paul refers to the elders at ephesus as “overseers” in his farewell sermon of acts 2017–35 likewise “overseer” in titus 17 seems to be a synonym for the term “elder” used in verse 5 most scholars now acknowledge this as j b lightfoot pointed out already in the 19th century “it is a fact now generally recognized by theologians of all shades of opinion that in the language of the new testament the same officer in the church is called indifferently ‘bishop overseer’ episkopos and ‘elder’ or ‘presbyter’ presbyteros” quoted in strauch 180 john piper summarizes the biblical use of the terms “elder” “pastor” and “overseer” the new testament only refers to the office of pastor one time ephesians 411 it is a functional description of the role of elder stressing the care and feeding of the church as god’s flock just as “bishopoverseer” is a functional description of the role of elder stressing the governing or oversight of the church we may conclude therefore that “pastor” and “elder” and “bishopoverseer” refer in the new testament to the same office this office stands alongside “deacon” in philippians 11 and 1 timothy 31–13 in such a way as to show that the two abiding officers instituted by the new testament are elder and deacon further resources alexander strauch biblical eldershipinclude virtualincludestqaarticlefooterhtml
