remote controller are emitting during the upgrade here is some information on these beeping sounds i have videos below which will also take you step by step through the update process ready to update sound from the gimbal similar to dddd dddd you don’t have to do anything at this point fast beeping noise indicates the firmware is updating this can take up to 25 minutes sound is similar to dddd dddd slow beeping sound when firmware update is complete similar sound to d—dd d–dd at this point you would restart the phantom 3 manually note a long beeping sound means the update has failed fail to update firmware signs here are a few signals which show you if the phantom 3 firmware upgrade has failed long beeping sound after the firmware has been updating for some time camera indicator light is solid red after the update after the update the sd card will contain a txt file where the result will show “fail” if the phantom 3 firmware update fails try the following download the package again onto a clean memory card make sure that you downloaded the correct package for your phantom 3 and follow the best practices below firmware update best practices take these steps to insure a smooth firmware update of your quadcopter these are great best practice for any firmware update whether it is a drone cellphone or a computer if a firmware update goes wrong there are a number of outcomes having to start the process all over again is one outcome however if the firmware update had a fix for a mother board or another component and the firmware file was corrupt you could damage the component with these steps you will avoid a sloppy or unsuccessful firmware update take your time never rush a firmware update for the phantom 3 give at least 15 hours to be on the safe side be sure to also update the remote controller firmware to the latest version you complete the upgrade as follows phantom 3 quadcopter dji go app remote controller check your parts while it is not a requirement as part of the update you might as well give you phantom 3 a nice close look over check all parts to make sure nothing is bent cracked or dirty give your drone a nice gently clean with a soft cloth if need be note view this large selection of of dji phantom 3 parts and accessories here this includes batteries chargers cables cases landing gear shell motors gimbal lens filters and much more safety and the right place have plenty of space and a quiet area so you can concentrate on the upgrade you definitely don’t want the family pet to knock over the phantom 3 or remote controller during the update do not perform firmware update while the aircraft is still flying in the air only carry out firmware update when the aircraft is landed also remove the propellers before starting the firmware update charge all batteries have at least 50 in your batteries before starting the update best practice is to have fully charged batteries in both the quadcopter and remote controller sd card this should be formatted for fat32 the ex fat file systems are also supported for aircraft and remote controller firmware updates from the shop sd cards should have the correct file system clean sd card it is very important to have a clean sd card to use to download and install the firmware update sd cards hold huge amounts of data now your phantom 3 will know exactly what type of file to pull off your card for the update however if you had similar file names on your sd card or a virus on your card and your phantom 3 pulls these files off then the phantom 3 firmware is going to fail at the very least but you could end up replacing hardware in some cases dji recommend an sd card with 100 mb free definitely delete or move any older phantom 3 firmware updates and log files off the memory card reformat the sd card with fat32 file system if you need to downloading the firmware package make sure you have a good internet connection when downloading the firmware update package if you loose internet connection while downloading the firmware package it would be better to delete the part of the package which downloaded and start again the firmware file is too important to go wrong turn on
