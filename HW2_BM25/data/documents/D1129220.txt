facial swelling a doctor might also check inside the mouth to see the position of the tonsils  when infected with mumps a persons tonsils can get pushed to the side take the patients temperature take a sample of blood urine or saliva to confirm diagnosis take a sample of csf cerebrospinal fluid from the spine for testing  this is usually only in severe cases prevention of mumps the mmr vaccine will prevent mumps measles and rubella the mumps vaccine is the best method for preventing mumps it can come on its own or as part of the mmr vaccine the mmr vaccine also defends the body against rubella and measles the mmr vaccine is given to an infant when they are just over 1 year old and again as a booster just before they start school anyone born after the 1990s would most probably have been given the mmr vaccine but if unsure it is always good to check with a doctor the mumps vaccine is routinely given to children in 82 countries in many of these countries encephalitis and deafness related to mumps have nearly disappeared an adult can be given the mmr at any age a doctor may advise someone to take the vaccine before traveling abroad to certain regions including india some parts of africa southeast asia japan pakistan other reasons someone may be advised to have the mmr vaccine in adulthood is if they are working in healthcare eg hospital or medical facility working or attending somewhere with lots of young people such as a college working in a school or around lots of children if suffering from cancer or a disease that lowers the immune system a doctor would need to be consulted before the mmr vaccine is considered however individuals are not advised to have the mmr vaccine if the patients immune system is seriously compromised the patient has had an allergic reaction to neomycin a type of antibiotic or gelatin the patient is pregnant or soon to be pregnant in the next 4 weeks mmr vaccine side effects most people given the mmr vaccine do not suffer side effects and the disease itself cannot be contracted from the vaccine a small percentage might develop a rash or fever and possibly aches in their joints less than one in a million will suffer a severe allergic reaction from the mmr vaccine preventing the spread of mumps there are a number of precautions that help prevent the spread of infection these are washing hands with water and soap frequently
