describe and account for differences between wind and insect pollinated flowers posted on august 16 2011 by lutheryap there are several differences between wind and insect pollinated flowers on account of their structure they include petals anther stigma and pollen grain they are different in terms of petals the wind pollinated flowers usually have dull and less elaborate petals for they do not have a need to attract insects to help them pollinate on the other hand the insect pollinated flowers tend to have bright and colourful petals so that insects would be attract to the flower also they might have nectar near the receptacle on the interior of the flower so the insects will enter the flower and can aid in pollination where the pollen grains from the anther in the flower gets scraped onto the insect to be transferred to the stigma of another flower they are different in terms of anthers the wind pollinated flowers have anthers that protrude out of the flower with long and flexible filaments that would sway in the wind furthermore their pollen grains are also easily shaken off this is to ensure that the wind can carry more pollen grains when it blows across the anther aiding in pollination however the insect pollinated flowers have anthers that are held firmly in place by the filament within the flower this ensures than when insects fly into the flower they do not break the filament or remove the entire anther while bombarding against it they are different in terms of stigma the stigma of a wind pollinated flower is protruding out from the flower with a large surface area with a larger surface area it can more effectively capture pollen grains carried by the wind the stigma of an insect pollinated flower is sticky small and rigid this ensures that once the pollen grains are scraped onto the stigma it is not easily taken off – this will ensure that further friction resulting from the insect’s activity in the flower will not remove the pollen grains from the stigma they are different in terms of the pollen grains the wind pollinated flower has pollen grains that are light so that they can be easily carried by the wind the pollen grains are also in large quantities for only a small percentage of the pollen grains carried by the wind lands on the stigma the insect pollinated flower has pollen grains that are sticky and heavy so that they can cling onto the insect’s body more easily the pollen grains are also in small quantities because it is very likely that insects will enter another flower and the pollen grains would have a higher chance of landing on the stigma as such there is no need for production of pollen grain in large quantities overall there are many differences between the wind and insect pollinated flowers all part of nature’s diverse design such that each organism can most appropriately survive advertisements loading this entry was posted in uncategorized bookmark the permalink
