creek next to levis stadium levis stadium was constructed immediately east of the san tomas aquino trail a paved multiuse path installed by the city of santa clara in 2004 21 that connects to a continuous 100mile network of offstreet paths including the regional san francisco bay trail the city announced in march 2013 that the san tomas aquino trail would be temporarily detoured between agnew road and tasman drive for approximately 1 year starting april 15 and ending when the stadium is open 22  but this onemile section of the trail remained closed to the public before and during stadium events since they began in august 2014 requiring the continued use of the twomile onstreet detour the stadium projects final environmental impact report eir disclosed no such ongoing temporary closures of the trail but stated instead that while there will likely be a sizeable increase in pedestrians on the san tomas aquino creek trail before and after nfl events the creek trail is open to

stadium which is named after the theme park to the south naming rights  editon may 8 2013 the 49ers announced that san franciscobased levi strauss  co purchased the naming rights to the new stadium the deal calls for levis to pay 2203 million to the city of santa clara and the 49ers over 20 years with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around 75 million 24 on september 14 2015 espns chris berman coined the name the big bellbottom in reference to the stadium in a deadspin article covering the 49ers on august 18 2015 article writer drew magary coined the nickname the jeanhole for the stadium 25reception  editlevis stadium has been praised for its excellent sightlines beautiful architecture plentiful amenities technological advancements convenient public transportation access and environmental sustenance 26 however the stadium has been heavily criticized for its highly corporate atmosphere and lack of a football atmosphere that candlestick park had with the stadium having the most expensive ticket prices in the league during its inaugural season many longtenured and loyal fans that had contributed to the football atmosphere at candlestick park could not afford to buy season tickets with the added cost of the stadium builders license also with the several distractions inside the stadium that include multiple bars and lounges fans would often hang out in those places while the game is going on rather than watching the game from their seats 27levis stadium has received some backlash from season ticket holders who are unhappy regarding rules that won’t allow them to print their tickets until 72 hours before the game making resale very difficult 28 in addition older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at levis stadium in comparison to candlestick park leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience 29 levis stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during earlyseason afternoon games the majority of fans are seated on the east side of the stadium and during these afternoon games they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs with the climate of santa clara being much warmer than san francisco it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hotweather climates several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games this has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days 30pilots flying into san jose international airport have frequently complained of being blinded or disoriented by the lights from the light towers and scoreboards the stadium is directly in the flight path of one of the airports runways 31 according to bay area nbc affiliate kntv there have been at least 43 complaints about the lights since the stadium opened in response santa clara mayor lisa gillmor promised to work with the 49ers and the stadium authority to determine if the lights need to be recalibrated 32previous plans  editthe san francisco 49ers played at candlestick park from 1971 to 2013 the stadium was a sentimental fan favorite and housed all 5 super bowl championship teams it was however the oldest unrenovated stadium in the nfl and was beginning to show its age the 49ers pursued a new stadium since 1997 when a plan for a stadium and a mall at candlestick point passed a public vote when the plans failed to move forward the san francisco 49ers presented an alternative plan on july 18 2006 to construct a new 68500seat open air stadium as part of a mixed use development featuring housing commercial and retail space in november 2006 the team announced that plans for a new stadium at candlestick point were not feasible “citing extensive costs for infrastructure parking accommodations and other changes that would cost more than the stadium itself” 33 the 49ers turned their focus to making santa clara the home to their new stadium the 1997 plan  editsan francisco voters in 1997 approved 100 million in city spending to build a new stadium and an attached shopping mall at candlestick point however even after voter approval to grant economic help for the project the stadium was not constructed this was because owner eddie de bartolo jr was facing legal troubles which led him to surrender ownership of the team to his sister denise de bartolo york and brotherinlaw john york mills corporation the company chosen by the 49ers was unable to put together a plan to successfully construct a new stadium for the team 34 nfl owners had gone as far as awarding the new stadium the rights to host super bowl xxxvii when stadium plans stalled the game went to san diego s qualcomm stadium instead for years the city and team ownership were embattled over attempts to gain funding and a greenlight for construction of a new stadium none of these attempts proved to be successful  citation neededthe 2006 plan  editthe city of san francisco received a new incentive to get a new stadium built mayor gavin newsom wanted to bring the 2016 summer olympics to the city and a new stadium would sweeten the citys proposal for selection by the united states olympic committee as the official us submission to the ioc the announcement came in november 2006 it called for a new stadium that would be converted into a 68600seat stadium for the 49ers after the olympics the olympic village would be converted into lowincome housing after the games were over 35the new stadium was to be built at candlestick point on land just southeast of candlestick park the cost of the stadium would be 916 million lennar corporation would build housing retail and office space around the stadium area 34 originally part of the area surrounding candlestick park was to be zoned for retail space and housing the new 49ers stadium was to be combined with such elements bringing muchneeded attractions to the historically blighted neighborhood of hunters point 36the stadium would be stocked with 150 luxury suites 7500 premium club seats and an increased number of seats lower and closer to the field called bowl seating potentially raising the 49ers franchise value up as much as 250 million and offering at least 300 million in advertising and concession deals the majority of which from paid corporate naming 37 the architectural design would be reminiscent of san francisco buildings the project planning did not get off to a good start however with contention between the 49ers and the city of san francisco over viable locations for the new stadium initially the idea was to build a stadium in the parking lot of candlestick park and later demolish the aging stadium team ownership feared that construction of the village and the stadium would severely limit the amount of land available in candlestick point creating a parking problem for fans and increasing traffic along the roads that link the stadium to the freeway moreover with residents in the lowincome housing by 2016 traffic would be permanently increased further damaging the alreadylimited methods of transportation to the park 38with san francisco slow to come up with better locations for the stadium or ways to circumvent the problems posed by construction at candlestick point team owners denise de bartolo york and john york announced on november 9 2006 that the 49ers were shifting their efforts to create a new stadium to the city of santa clara home to the team offices and training facility since 1987 approximately 40 miles 64 km south of san francisco 38the sudden removal of the planned stadium forced the san francisco olympics bid group to cancel its proposal 39 which engendered great anger not only from mayor newsom but also from such 49ers legends as joe montana and ronnie lott who were part of the effort to bring the olympics to the bay area in addition many fans were outraged at the suggestion to move the 49ers out of the city that it had shared history with for decades the yorks insisted that the legacy of the franchise would be respected in the sense that the 49ers would not be renamed nor moved out of the bay area this was met with much opposition from mayor newsom and senator dianne feinstein who was mayor of san francisco between 1978 and 1988 the senator stated that the team should be unable to use the san francisco name if its operations were not based in the city 40 on january 3 2007 california state senator carole migden introduced a bill entitled sb49 that would bar the 49ers from building a new stadium within a 100mile 160 km radius of san francisco if they were to leave the city the 49ers organization announced its strong opposition to the legislation and retorted that passing such a bill would only encourage the team to move out of the bay area altogether 41 the bill died without being acted upon 42santa clara city council negotiations  editthe santa clara stadium project had been in the works since 2007 with negotiations beginning in 2008 two years later the

possibility that the oakland raiders might share the stadium allowing its costs to be split between the two teams 58 the stadium is designed to accommodate two teams with the exterior leds being programmable for alternate colors and two hometeam locker rooms 59 the 49ers 58 and raiders 60 have publicly said it would be an option if possible while nfl commissioner roger goodell is strongly in favor of the two sharing a stadium 61 fans of both teams reacted negatively to the idea along with the new york metropolitan area where the new york giants and new york jets shared giants stadium from 1984 to 2009 and currently share its successor met life stadium the dcbaltimore metro area and los angeles the bay area is one of 4 nfl markets with two teams the 49ers and raiders sharing a stadium would not be a first as the two shared kezar stadium for part of 1960 62 it would also fulfill the late raiders owner al davis  goal of a new stadium something he had strongly desired since moving the team from los angeles back to oakland in 1995 63 the raiders as it stands play at the oaklandalameda county coliseum and are the only nfl team still sharing its home field with a major league baseball team the raiders lease on the coliseum has been on yeartoyear extensions since the expiration of the last longterm lease in 2013 64in the wake of davis death the possibility of the 49ers and raiders sharing the stadium became a stronger possibility however by october 2011 the 49ers were far enough along on the stadium to have reportedly already sold over a quarter of the luxury suites meaning the raiders would be forced to be secondary tenants 65 in october 2012 oakland raiders owner mark davis told reporters he had no plans to share the santa clara stadium with the 49ers according to the report discussions remained open although davis wanted to keep the team in oakland or a nearby site in dublin california 66when the stadium had its grand opening on july 17 2014 goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the raiders and that it was up for the team to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the oakland coliseum while the 49ers remain open to sharing the stadium with the raiders the raiders said that their personal preference was the coliseum site 67on february 20 2015 the raiders announced that they would be seeking a joint stadium in carson california with the san diego chargers should they not receive public funding to replace the oakland coliseum reducing the likelihood of the raiders sharing levis stadium with the 49ers 68 in january 2016 after losing their bid to relocate to los angeles to the los angeles rams the raiders withdrew their request to move to los angeles and joint tenancy at levis again surfaced in general discussion 59 however with the raiders getting approved for a move to las vegas and securing a local agreement for stadium funding there it seems unlikely the raiders will ever pursue a move to santa clara financing and construction  editin december 2011 the santa clara city council voted for an agreement that calls for the city’s stadium authority to borrow 850 million from goldman sachs bank of america and u s bank this will cover most of the construction costs with the remainder to be made up via funding from the nfl a hotel tax and city redevelopment funds interest fees and terms for this loan have not been disclosed 69 70 the 850 million building loan plus interest and fees will be assumed by the citys stadium authority where additional interest and fees will be applied on february 2 2012 nfl owners approved a loan to the 49ers of 200 million for use in constructing the new stadium and to be taken from a new g4 stadium loan fund 71 terms of the loan were not specified but under the previous g3 plan money was repaid directly into the leagues account from the borrowing teams share of gate receipts from road games construction  editlevis

steel beams for the stadium were laid down 72 the first seats in levis stadium were installed on october 1 2013 construction was halted on june 11 2013 after a mechanic working on an elevator was struck by a counterweight and then fell down the shaft to his death 73 work resumed two days later after officials from the california occupational safety and health administration calosha declared the site safe but as of october 2013 the accident remained under investigation 74 75the santa clara stadium was constructed on a cityowned parking lot on tasman drive located adjacent to the north of californias great america theme park and leased to great america for overflow parking as with candlestick park there are relatively few amenities in the stadiums immediate vicinity for sports fans besides the 49ers headquarters and training facility the santa clara convention center is northwest of the stadium site and there are two hotels on tasman drive next to the convention center but the closest significant concentration of hotels and restaurants is on the mission college boulevard corridor almost a mile to the south on the other side of great america opening  editthe stadium opened on july 17 2014 76 it was originally scheduled to open on july 11 but was pushed back due to construction delays the first game played at the new stadium was a major league soccer match on august 2

first preseason game 34–0 against the denver broncos at levis stadium one fan at the game collapsed due to the heat and had to be rushed to a local hospital where he died 78the first 49ers regularseason game at the stadium was held during week 2 on september 14 2014 when the team hosted the chicago bears on sunday night football 79 the bears won the game 28–20 80 in front of a 49ers home record attendance of 70799 81weekdays and parking  editin november 2013 stadium and 49ers officials initially requested the nfl to not schedule any monday or thursday night home games during levis stadiums inaugural season due to parking issues in the area surrounding the stadium during weekdays 82 two months later in january 2014 the santa clara city government was able to secure more than the 21000 necessary parking spots by approving use of the fairways at the cityowned santa clara golf and tennis club which is located to the north of the stadium across tasman drive this arrangement is similar to and was modeled upon a longstanding arrangement between the rose bowl in pasadena california and the adjacent brookside golf course where the golf course was modified to allow for vehicular access to the fairways they are used for parking only when dry to minimize damage and any damage that does occur is repaired afterward with access to the golf course fairways levis stadium now had 31600 potential parking spaces meaning that tailgating and weeknight games were now a possibility however the nfl decided not to schedule any weeknight home games at levis stadium in 2014 until traffic flow within the area is figured out with the exception of a thanksgiving game between the 49ers and the seattle seahawks on november 27 2014 parking prices which averaged 30 in the 49ers final season at candlestick park will increase to 40 at levis stadium 83anticipating significant traffic from levis stadium visitors the nearby city of mountain view instituted a threehour parking limit on downtown streets during game days while residents received exemptions via permit tags stadiumgoers must park in paid lots or far from mountain views caltrainvta light rail station this station is the closest vta light rail station to san francisco and receives transferring passengers heading south to san jose via light rail including people using the light rail to go directly to the levis stadium station 84in spring 2015 49ers officials offered the city of santa clara 15 million to take over the adjacent santa clara youth soccer park and convert these soccer fields into additional parking lots this money along with a large percentage of parking fees would have then been used for the city to build a new youth sports complex elsewhere 85 the plan was opposed by the youth soccer leagues that use the fields and critics calling it a land grab 86 after many youth soccer players attended a city council meeting on april 29 to protest the proposal the 49ers withdrew the 15 million offer 87 the team then gave the city an unsolicited offer of 3 million to help improve various youth athletic fields and facilities which was cited as a peace offering by san francisco chronicle columnists phil matier and andrew ross and other bay area media 88 but the city council turned the offer down 89other events  editlevis stadium on august 2 2014 hosting its first soccer
