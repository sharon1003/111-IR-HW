what does back pain have to do with indigestion“unfortunately the established medical approach tends to view us as parts and parts of parts dr patrick most of us in the chico and redding areas of california know that the human body is a complex matrix of interconnected systems you’re probably familiar with the names of many of the body’s systems such as the circulatory nervous digestion and musculoskeletal systems but what most of us don’t realize is how these systems interact to maintain optimal health and how many pains we have may be related to the food we eat unfortunately the established medical approach tends to view us as parts and parts of parts we see specialists who give medications that cause side effects that harm the organs and systems that other specialists treat you may see a specialist about your headache and he or she prescribes a medication that may irritate your stomach create ulcers constipate you and damage the liver if we fail to approach the body as a whole we disrupt it’s own natural regulation processes what may be good for relieving headaches or back pain may not be good for the stomach liver and kidneys why not consider an integrated approach that includes all of the whole body’s systems without the side effects of medications a tension headache for example can result from a number of systems that are not functioning properly tension headaches are often caused by muscle contractions in the neck which misalign the bones of the neck when the bones in the neck become misaligned the nerves that give us sensation to the head become irritated and we feel pain the digestion system plays a role in tension headaches as well excessive amounts of simple sugars or poor carbohydrate digestion create a mineral imbalance that causes the muscles of the neck to contract and the nerves to become more sensitive this eventually pushes the body into the flight or fight mode and we become tense irritable and edgy and our head aches that’s why headache and migraine relief may start in your gut when we have a problem such as a tension headache we often focus on the symptom and forget that we are collection of interconnected systems we may be focusing our attention on our headache or back pain but the real source of our pain may be coming from an organ or system that is stressed or in need of nutrients here’s another example some people frequently experience pain between the shoulder blades they may even go to a chiropractor frequently to have this part of their spine adjusted but the pain keeps coming back if the skeletal system were the only system in your body adjusting the spine would be the prefect solution but the body is more complex because the nerves that exit the spine in the midback interconnect with other organs the body needs to be evaluated and treated from a systems perspective pain between the shoulder blades can actually be coming from the esophagus stomach gallbladder small intestine or liver just ask anyone who has had a gallbladder attack to verify this for you a third example of approaching the body from a systems perspective is lower back pain ad digestive problems did you know that up to a third of the people i see in my practice experiencing chronic low back pain have back pain because their kidneys are stressed from incomplete digestion and because the nerves that exit from the lower back go to the small intestine and colon its quite common to see lower back pan with indigestion lower back pain and digestive problems often accompany each other other people may experience low back pain as a result of bowel problems such as constipation diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome this is because the nerves that go to and from the bowel originate in the lumbar spine these same nerves also go to the muscles and ligaments that stabilize the low back when the bowel is stressed the muscles that share the same nerve root will contract and cause pain your lower back pain may not be caused by a misaligned vertebra or disc problem now that’s an uncommon viewpoint coming from a chiropractorcall dr patrick today to schedule an evaluation to learn how you can get relief from
