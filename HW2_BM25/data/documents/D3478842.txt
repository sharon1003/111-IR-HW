is word press premium worth it 6 important things to know fritz jan 2 2018 blog 0 comments are you wondering is word press premium worth it should you actually pay 99 a year i will help you with making the right decision if the question is should you go premium with word press or continue with the free account then the answer is obvious choose premium because the completely free word press is terrible you have to have an ugly domain annoying ads you will have terrible storage space etc stay away from the free word press it is not meant for serious bloggers there are way too many limitations and it is not meant for the future don’t make this big mistakealthough premium word press is a far better option then the free wp it would not be wise to choose it i know that you are wondering what i mean by this it would not be wise to choose it over self hosted word press why would you pay 99 for premium when you can have a selfhosted blog which is what all serious bloggers have getting your own hosting is going to be cheaper than 99 a year and it is better all of my blogs are selfhosted with word pressorg it would not be wise for me or anyone else to purchase the premium plan over it because there are still limitations it costs way more than hosting it has less features it has less plugins etc let’s talk more about the word press premium vs self hosted word press price once again word press premium costs 99 a year per blog and that is not including the domain you have to purchase with 99 why don’t you just get site ground hosting which is the top word press hosting company it is only going to cost you either 395 a month 795 a month or 1495 a month depending on your needs you end up saving more and you get more custom features with site ground and you get to use word press to the fullest extent as you can see the selfhosted option is better for the price and you will receive more which will help you save more money and it will result in more success selfhosted is better for themes premium word press premium does not offer that much themes for you to choose from and not all of their themes are free most likely you are going to end up paying 50 dollars and up for a theme and you will still be subject to customization restrictions the worst thing is that you can’t buy themes from other places on the internet which is a real drag as a site owner you want to fulfill the many ideas that you have in your head a creative site owner wants the most design options available to them selfhosted with word press and your own hosting you will be given thousands of free and paid themes to choose from that means you are most likely going to find the perfect theme for you for a better price my first word press theme cost 30 that’s before i switched to genesis and thesis i strongly recommend that you get your own hosting and purchase  genesis  which is the most popular blogging theme word press premium is still not your site you are still renting just because you are upgrading does not mean your tos is going to change you still don’t truly own the site and it can be shutdown for any reason without your knowledge if you are not careful for professional purposes and safety purposes getting your own hosting company is always the best choice do your blog a favor and get your own host just to be on the safe side getting your own hosting gives you more storage space many people think about going premium just so that they can have more storage space if you want more storage space you might as well get your own hosting with site ground that way when you do that you are going to have your own hosting and you will get more storage space for your website if your reason for thinking about the premium option is strictly because of storage space then it would be extremely wise to just get your own hosting premium doesn’t give you any extensions when you go premium you get more designs more videos more space and no ads that is about it you still will not be able to access the word press plugin database to give your site extra features these plugins are why most people get their own hosting provider it only takes one click and your blog will be able to do extraordinary things you can make your blog faster you can give your blog better seo you can sell on your blog you can switch your interface you can add different security features you can start a forum section you can install a scheduler you can install comment moderators you can add video galleries and more there is nothing that you can’t do and the good
