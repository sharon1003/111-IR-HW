the pacific ocean average depth of 1 mile 5280 ft prey none predators insignificant some species of crab shrimp etc are known to nibble at the worms red plume if exposed lifespan unknown lifespan dictated by the activity of hydrothermal vents significance the giant tube worm  riftia pachyptila is a very unique species adapted to survive in one of earths most extreme and inhospitable environments its evolutionary adaptions in the face of such adversity include some not seen in any other organism on earth adaptions thought to be impossible prior to the worms discovery in1977 although the life of the giant tube worm is still not fully documented or understood samples taken by submersible crews on deep sea expeditions in combination with limited first hand observation of these organisms in their environment have led to a better understanding of this bizarre species and have opened scientists eyes in a world devoid of natural light and alien to our own this page discusses some of the adaptions of this organism that make it so fascinating while identifying this species value in a broader global context environment darkness utter darkness a mile or more below the surface of the ocean in the aphotic zone not a glimmer of sunlight penetrates sometimes referred to as the midnight zone there is no natural light in these vast regions of the ocean only blackness to live down here organisms cannot rely on photosynthesis and most are predators feeding on other organisms or on biological matter that sinks down to them from further up in the unseen sunlit world above in addition the water is very cold generally only a few degrees above freezing and to make matters worse the pressure caused by miles of ocean bearing down from above can be upwards of 1 ton per square inch roughly 1 ton per mile in depth at these depths a human being outside the safety of a submersible would be crushed like an egg and it is here on the ocean floor that geological features known as hydrothermal vents occasionally occur these vents mark places in the earths crust where cracks and fissures have opened up allowing sea water to flow in and meet in a violent reaction with magma and heat welling up from deep within the earth this reaction causes jets off scalding hot water at temperatures of up to 400 c prevented from boiling due to the immense pressure to roar out into the freezing ocean water surrounding these vents accompanied by a shower of minerals and chemicals that would be lethal to most living organisms and yet these vents form oasis in the freezing blackness oasis of life in a vast landscape that is otherwise very sparsely populated the secret to life lies in the existence of specially adapted bacteria with the rare ability of generating biological energy in the complete absence of sunlight instead they utilize hydrogen sulfide spewed from the hydrothermal vents to produce carbon compounds that are the key to life it is through these bacteria that the giant tube worm is able to survive physiology if the giant tube worm merely fed on the bacteria that produce organic energy from hydrogen sulfide a process known as chemosynthesis then they would hardly be so unique many species live in clusters around hydrothermal vents the world over that feed on these forms of bacteria such species include various kinds of shrimps and crabs that spend their entire lives living on the walls of hydrothermal vents in fact these vents are spread so far apart that each site produces a unique ecosystem of organisms that may be found nowhere else on earth but what makes the giant tube worm so special is the unique relationship that it has formed with a certain species of this bacteria the worm has no mouth no stomach no digestive tract and since it does not produce its own energy through either photosynthesis or chemosynthesis it would seem that this species should not be alive and yet they do live in fact they are the fastest growing marine invertebrate known with a growth rate of over two feet a year their secret is that they maintain a symbiotic relationship with a species of this special bacteria that live in massive colonies inside the worms body the worm provides shelter and ingredients from the surrounding sea water that the bacteria need and in turn the bacteria produce food for the worm the process for doing this begins with the worms plume a soft bright red structure at the nonanchored end of the worms body this apparatus draws hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide and oxygen from the sea water which it circulates inside its body by means of a specially adapted hemoglobin it is the hemoglobin that give the bloom is vibrant red color from there these compounds go to the trophosome where the bacteria reside the bacteria here exist in great quantities packed close together approximately 285 million bacteria per ounce of the worms tissue the bacteria use the ingredients supplied by the worm to create a controlled chemical reaction from which they gain a carbon compound that serves as food for both the bacteria and their host worm the trophosome which continues for most of the trunk of the worm is protected by the worms exterior tube the tube is made out of a material call chitin which is a hard substance that also makes up the shells of crabs this chitin tube forms a protective container for the worms body into which it can draw its vulnerable plume if a potential predator happens by the vestimentum located between the plume and the trunk houses the worms other primary organs including its primitive brain heart and reproductive organs so what does it all mean the giant tube worm is a wonder of evolution it has adapted over time to thrive in an environment that would be not only inhospitable but lethal to most of the worlds living organisms but the most fundamental adaption contributing to its success is one inseparable from another species the bacteria that through chemosynthesis produces the worms food it is incredible really that two distinct species should form an unspoken pact through the processes of evolution by which they must ensure one anothers survival in an environment among the most forbidding on earth without one the other would perish in this way one begins to question whether these two species inseparable in life can truly be considered separate perhaps over time they may evolve into one organism is this possible it seems unlikely but then prior to the discovery of these symbiotic organisms in their most unlikely of environments the mechanisms by which they survive were not believed to exist perhaps then only time and the miracle of life can reveal the wonders which nature in its infinite complexity and adaptability may perform and what does the ability of these organisms to survive by means of chemosynthesis say about the possibility of life on other planets if indeed life can occur away from sunlight in an environment other than those most common on earth is it possible that bacteria could evolve on other planets or perhaps on one of the moons in our own solar system in turn giving rise to other forms of life these are mysteries that have yet to be answered but are within the realm of possibility thanks to the evolutionary testimony of organisms such as the giant tube worm yet we must not forget how fragile such organisms can be in the case of the giant tube worm and its life sustaining bacteria evolution has made them entirely reliant on the nutrients and conditions supplied by hydrothermal vents yet these vents are unpredictable and hardly constant they are known to spontaneously emerge or extinguish without warning leaving the organisms around them suddenly without a food source in an expansive landscape devoid of alternatives under such conditions entire colonies of giant tube worms and other organisms have been known to entirely die out it is clear then that the more an organism becomes adapted to a very specific environment with unique conditions the more their very existence is subject to the existence of that environment without it they cannot survive thus the giant tube worm illustrates in the extreme the incredible adaptability of evolution and also its incredible fragility whatever the lens through which they are viewed they are fascinating and informative creatures
