song hopefully makes things a lot easier teaching the months of the year is quite tricky as there a lot of them  one great idea is to take photos of the kids in each class who are born in each month and make these into picture cards this really personalises the lesson the key with this song is that at first kids only learn their own birthday month this is easy to do and as its something thats important to each kid they learn it quickly then they gradually pick up the names of the months of their friends birthdays the trick is to sing the song with everyone sitting when it comes to each students birthday they stand up and sing the month louder then sit back down this works great the download pack also has the new 1st 2nd 3rd song  great for th pronunciation 1st 2nd 3rd song genki

fingers on one hand 3 when you say go the two students must turn to face each other 4 the first student to correctly say the sum of the fingers shown by both hands is the winner for the months of the year version they have to say what the month is eg july if the total is 7 fingers once youve done the demo like this get all the kids to do it in pairs other games i mentioned the banana tree game above but one really good game for larger groups is to do something like the  where are you from worksheet game  this time all the kids do is write down the numbers 112 on a piece of paper you say go and they go round the class asking when everyones birthday is if they hear a month they can cross that number off their list keep going until all 12 months are crossed off sit down if there arent enough people to do this well  statistically you need a couple of hundred you can periodically shout out bonus time the kids then all ask you when is your birthday and you shout out a month that is not too popular all the kids can cross this off their list remember that if anyone speaks a language other than english they have to start with a fresh list from 112 with nothing crossed off or you could try it where they have to see how many people from each month they can interview in a set time bonus printables explanation of the months cards months cards can be some of the trickiest cards to produce for an english lesson most people in japan use japanese based cards with japanese festivals etc but whilst thats fine for japanese lessons here were supposed to be teaching international understanding so ive tried to make them a lot more internationally themed fun and having lots of hints to make them easy to remember january  new year with big ben and fireworks over sydney harbour

enkatype intro to the when is your birthday song was a little weird but when i used it in my class it immediately grabbed the attention of my students they thought it was so funny and have requested to do to the song again just because they like the intro so much sometimes the stuff i think is the strangest ends up being what the students like the best you really know what makes the kids
