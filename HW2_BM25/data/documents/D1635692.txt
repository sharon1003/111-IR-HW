many people but some people have better luck with certain breeds allergy friendly dogs are those that dont have very much dander some people will tell you that dogs that shed very little are the low dander breeds but chihuahuas shed a ton but theyre low dander my fiance has two they dont bother my allergies as long as i dont touch my face to them while cuddling these breeds are considered low dander the dander is what causes allergies not the fur airedale australian terrier bichon frise bouvier des flandres cairn terrier chihuahua chinese crested giant schnauzer irish water spaniel italian greyhound maltese miniature schnauzer norfolk terrier norwich terrier poodle all types portuguese water dog puli schnauzer softcoated wheaten terrier tibetan terrier welsh terrier xoloitzcuintli yorkshire terrier some people are only allergic to some breeds of dog my mom cant be around german shepherd at all of she breaks out in hives i suggest researching the breeds on the list above to find out what their personalities are like once youve narrowed it down to some you would be interested in owning call some reputable breeders near you and ask if your mom can spend some time with their dogs if shes allergic to the breed im sure shell find out shortly thereafter  as far as good with other pets goes you want to avoid terriers it is true like you said that the animals behavior is how theyre raised but terriers were bred to instinctively hunt small animals my mom has a yorkiemaltese mix and he chases down our cat and chews on her its not aggressive but it isnt pleasant either of the breeds above the ones that have a reputation for being good with other pets as far as im aware others may be good too are as follows bichon frise chihuahua italian greyhound maltese poodle check this out you can figure out a good breed for your family it includes pet friendly and better for allergy sufferers good luck let us know what you decide and just so you are aware dogs that are mixed with poodle and something else like a lab xpoodle mix are not always good for allergy sufferers like all inherited traits the amount of dander produced can be from the labrador parent or the poodle parent there are some labradoodles out there causing intense allergies just like a lab mix breed dogs can inherit any trait of either parent if you get a mix try to find a mix of two or more of the dogs listed above if mom has low dander and dad has low dander kid will have low dander a lot of the smaller breeds listed above are frequently found in shelters even mixed together so you should have a good chance of being able to save a life if you choose to do so  · 2 years ago0 0 comment it may have been what some call an english labrador my sister has one and it is significantly smaller than
