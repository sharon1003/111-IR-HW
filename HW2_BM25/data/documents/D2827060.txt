saw prom night back when i was 10 years old but didnt appreciate it as a film until rewatching it at 19 watching it a second time was like discovering a priceless gem and i must say as a screenwriter i still look to this movie as motivation and inspiration unlike most hollywood horrorslasher movies it did what most of the latter cannot which is provide a combination of good lucks and good acting therefor ensuring we care about the characters scream most definitely took a page from this movie as inspiration for its mystery theme though the budget was low and this movie was made in 1980 i feel that it still has enough of a story to keep us entertained and also enough of a punch to make us jump a bit but what really makes prom night a success is its actors jamie leigh was wonderful as always but one character i felt that stole the show was the character of wendy as vile and wicked as they made her the actress portraying her gave her depth i felt as a viewer that she was more than just the typical bitch character with killer lines a beautiful face and a chase scene that has been the foundation of future horror movie chase scenes this girl makes the movie worth watching if you happen to see this movie on or notice it in a video store i would suggest giving it a look i would love to see a remake only if they kept the plot the same but intensified the horror much like what was done in ttcm remake and of course to have edie benton and jamie leigh make an cameo or guest appearance somewhere29 of 46 people found this review helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report this
