therapeutic proteins especially for frequent treatments longterm regimens or selfadministration it is currently believed that the maximum volume for sc injections is approximately 15 m l larger sc injection volumes are considered to be associated with injection pain and adverse events at the injection site however no controlled clinical studies and actual evidence exist to support this assumption in this review we discuss current and publically available data related to sc administration volumes we conclude that injection volumes higher than 35 m l are worth exploring if required for the development of efficacious drug treatments studying tissue back pressure injection site leakage local tolerability and injectionrelated adverse events such as injection pain should be considered for the development of higher sc injection volumes previous article next article keywordssubcutaneous injection injection volume injection paincombination products hypodermis health care abbreviations used ecm extracellular matrix m abs monoclonal antibodies scsubcutaneous introduction over the past decades recombinant proteins have become a standard therapeutic modality for the treatment of severe diseases 1 monoclonal antibodies m abs and new antibody formats are dominating the biopharmaceutical market as they offer numerous benefits including target specificity 2 and long serum halflife 3administration into the subcutaneous sc tissue is a typical route to deliver therapeutic proteins especially for frequent treatments longterm regimens or selfadministration particularly combination products such as prefilled syringes and autoinjectors enable selfadministration shifting the point of care from the hospital to the patients home 4 prefilled syringes also improve patient compliance and safety as well as minimize dosing errors and microbial contaminations 4 despite these benefits several challenges associated with the sc administration route remain currently it is believed that the maximum volume for sc injections is up to 15 m l and would in no case be higher than 25 m l 58 sc injection volumes larger than 2 m l are associated with various issues including injection pain adverse events at the injection site and injection site leakage ie backflow of injected solution 7 however to the best of our knowledge no controlled clinical studies and actual evidence exist to support this assumptionm abs typically require high doses usually ranging from 80 mg per patient 5 up to 1000 mg per patient on account of the perceived volume limitation m ab formulations often need to be developed at very high concentrations of 150200 mgm l and in some cases even higher 59 this leads to several specific challenges associated with highly concentrated protein solutions for example protein concentration may impact protein stability by increasing the propensity for aggregation and protein particle formation during shelflife in addition protein concentration may impact protein stability and bioavailability after injection in the sc tissue for example for smaller proteins that are mainly absorbed by passive diffusion over blood capillaries distribution in the sc tissue may impact adsorption kinetics 10 however controlled studies to investigate in vivo protein stability remain missing an increased viscosity rising exponentially with protein concentration influences processability the ability to filter and deliver administration 5 the drug product viscosity can be influenced by formulation parameters such as p h and excipients and solution temperature 11 depending on the type of underlying molecular interactions for example temperature p h and ionic strength were found to possibly influence the viscosity of m ab formulations 12 however for conjugated molecules such as pegylated peptides or proteins these parameters do not significantly influence viscosity 11 in contrast polymer type size eg 20 vs 40 k d polyethylene glycol size distribution and structure eg linear vs branched polyethylene glycol matter for highly viscous solutions the choice of an adequate injection needle is critical as the inner diameter of the needle decreases the required injection forces increase following the hagen–poiseuille law to the power of 4 in cases where very thin needles such as 30g are used the viscosity at the temperature of administration cannot exceed 10 c p assuming a maximum injection force of 10 n 13 is desired an increased sc dose volume would offer the option to significantly reduce the protein concentration which may positively influence protein stability and lower viscosity an alternative to larger sc injection volumes which also allows for formulating the product at lower protein concentration is the application of multiple sc injections of smaller volumes as an example a 200mg dose can be achieved in several ways •200 mgm l in 1m l injection volume•100 mgm l in 2 × 1–m l injections•100 mgm l in a 2m l injection volume•50 mgm l in 4m l injection volume in this review we discuss the current and publically available data related to sc administration volumes we delineate the injection volume of commercialized sc administered biopharmaceuticals in the context of the current standard of care furthermore tissue back pressure local tolerability injection site leakage and injectionrelated adverse events including injection pain are discussed finally we evaluate the possibilities of injecting larger volumes through the sc route by formulating the drug product with and without the functional excipient hyaluronidase physiological structure of the skin—considerations for subcutaneous injection volume sc administration refers to the application of the drug product into the hypodermis specifically the sc tissue the sc tissue is located between the muscle tissue and the skin the hypodermis thickness differs across body sites and shows significant persontoperson variability absorption and thus the bioavailability of therapeutic proteins after sc administration is a complex process an oversimplified model describes that on administration therapeutic proteins with a molecular weight larger than 16 k da reach systemic circulation by the lymphatic vessels 8 however several other molecular properties such as charge or hydrophobicity as well as formulation composition or variability between patienttopatient and the chosen injection site may also influence absorption and bioavailability of a protein 1415adipose tissue comprises the main part of the hypodermis and is separated by the fibrovascular network into lobules the size and shape as well as the structure of the fibrovascular network show variability across body sites and people for example gender or the body mass index of a person influences the structure of the hypodermis 16fibroblasts in the sc connective tissue produce components of the extracellular matrix ecm the ecm mainly consists of collagen and glycosaminoglycans 78 and is a physiological barrier for scadministered drugs the ecm specifically the collagen fibers determines the mechanical properties of the sc tissue the glycosaminoglycans mainly hyaluronan are responsible for the gellike phase of the ecm and control its hydraulic conductivity the low hydraulic conductivity of the sc ecm prevents rapid spreading of the scadministered drug product after sc administration therapeutic proteins are transported by diffusion through the interstitial space where the lymphatic capillaries drain the injection site 8 administration of an injection volume of 2 m l may lead to a bulge or injection site induration the observation of bulge formation in these cases may have contributed to the dogma of 25 m l maximum “allowed” injection volume however the injection site induration is usually considered only a cosmetic issue and there is no relevant clinical evidence that injection site indurations are related to injection pain the ecm is also a contributor to injection back pressure especially for viscous drug products and larger sc injection volumes where the required injection forces increase significantly while the injection needle is the main contributor to injection forces 17 tissue back pressure is another component that requires consideration studies performed in sc tissue of minipigs showed a quantifiable and significant result for back pressure in the range of 06129 n depending on solution viscosity 18 interestingly in this study injection volumes of 25 versus 45 m l did not show any difference in tissue back pressure the ecm p h is believed to be approximately 72 although the exact ionic composition of the sc matrix and its exact p h remain unknown however the makeup and p h of the sc matrix may have important influence over the stability of sc injections for example molecules that are unstable under the sc tissue conditions may undergo physical or chemical changes such as protein aggregation or precipitation interestingly limiting the molecular diffusion of the injected molecule may slow down these in vivo instabilities several models were proposed for studying sc administration of drug products for example attempts were made to study the interactions and stability of a protein within the ecm 141519 however these in vitro models often do not translate into the actual in vivo situation and as a result are of limited value while in vitro testing is desirable the sc tissue and in vivo mechanisms are poorly understood which makes modeling of the complex in vivo situation a challenge instead preclinical animal tests are usually performed on products intended for sc administration into humans patients or healthy volunteers however the structure of the hypodermis shows variability across animal species for example sc tissue in rats features loose connective tissue with weak mechanical properties 8 which allows the administration of large sc injection volumes common animal models for sc administration are the pig or minipig as the hypodermis of these species features a fibrous network similar to that of humans thus the spreading of sc administered fluid in pigs is more relevant as compared with the observations made in rats or mice 818 nevertheless the comparability to humans is highly dependent on the site selected for injection informative methods to investigate the spreading of the injected volume in the interstitial space are μct scans 20 or the application of a dye 21 often cynomolgus monkeys are used for the preclinical evaluation of safety and bioavailability before first entryintohuman studies 22 although their sc tissue is also not quite representative to humans in summary the hypodermis the sc injection space is a highly variable tissue which significantly differs across body sites and between patients several knowledge gaps remain and no clinical evidence of an upper injection volume limit currently exists injection pain injection pain is believed to depend on various factors  table 1  table 1 factors influencing injection pain injection pain influencing factor explanation injection speed slow injection speed is considered to cause less injection pain 2325injection site the hypodermis is a highly variable tissue which significantly differs across body sites 7active pharmaceutical ingredient limited

pain type of used combination product prefilled syringe vs autoinjector no relevant clinical data available skill of medical care person no relevant clinical data available pretreatment application of topical anesthetics before actual injection is considered to reduce injection pain 33current subcutaneous injection volumes chronic diseases such as rheumatic arthritis require frequent and longterm administration in many cases sc administration is intended for selfadministration by a patient however injection by a health care professional is also a possibility a number of products for sc administration are commercially available in prefilled syringes or autoinjectors table 2 lists currently marketed products for sc administration interestingly the vast majority of these use an

ranging between 1 and 15 m l while shire et al 5 state “…because of the small 15 m l volume that can be given by the sc route” frost et al 7 described the physiological properties of the hypodermis and concluded that “subcutaneous injections are generally limited to less than 2 m l” numerous other health care organizations including regional palliative care programs community care services and the caritas health group suggest an sc injection volume at a single injection site of ≤225 m l injection volumes of 25 m l are considered to be associated with injection pain leakage and tissue distortion in addition tissue back pressure is another factor to be considered 18 as it increases the required injection force and may lead to drug leakage although only limited data exist on this topic how can higher doses be achieved via the subcutaneous route several strategies can be considered to overcome the challenges of sc administration of biologics requiring significant dosing traditionally high concentration formulations are developed aiming to be administered at low volumes by the sc route  fig 1  5 alternatively the required dose can be administered by several low volume injections across different injection sites of a patient download fullsize image figure 1 the relation between sc injection volume and required protein concentration for a 200mg dose higher volumes for sc injection have recently also been evaluated with or without the use of permeation enhancers and are discussed in the following section pushing the boundaries of subcutaneous injection volume a recent study by dias et al 23 evaluated and compared pain scores and adverse events including injection site reactions and swelling in a randomized crossover singlecenter study 48 healthy adults were treated in different abdominal quadrants a 12 m l bolus injection over 5 s and 35 m l injections over 1 4 and 10 min were explored all injection durations were well tolerated injection pain was assessed by a 100mm visual analog scale during the injection and 1 h after the injection in this study injection time seemed to have a greater impact on injection pain than injection volume interestingly longer injection times seem to lead to less injection pain even if not statistically significant no subject n  48 developed a serious adverse event all injection volumes and injection time combinations showed acceptable tolerability shapiro et al 34 reported the sc administration of immunoglobulin without any further permeation enhancer in this study the sc injection volume per site ranged from 3 to 20 m l in 520 min interestingly a rapid push sc injection was initially preferred over sc infusion by 71 of the patients in this study and more patients changed from sc infusion to rapid push sc injection during the study higher sc injection volumes 25 m l have also been evaluated and developed using permeation enhancers the enzyme hyaluronidase was identified in 1928 during the first description of a spreading factor in rabbit extracts tested it was named after its activity to cleave hyaluron as mentioned earlier hyaluron controls the hydraulic conductivity and the spreading of an scinjected fluid in the ecm cleavage of hyaluron by hyaluronidase enables significant reduction of tissue back pressure and enables fast administration of sc injection volumes 25 m l with a reduced induration at the injection site the use of a permeation enhancer also minimizes the risk of drug leakage at the injection site 3536 owing to the rapid turnover of hyaluron in the human body hyaluron cleavage is reversible within 12 days 7 hyaluronidase was used for decades to administer larger injection volumes by the sc route 3738 human hyaluronidase r hu ph20 can be manufactured by recombinant dna techniques and a number of products with hyaluronidase as a functional excipient were developed and commercialized  table 3  for example herceptin sc™ and mabthera sc™ are liquid m ab hyaluronidase coformulations for sc injections of 5 and 117m l injection volumes respectively 3536 hyqvia™ includes 2 separate vials first vial containing a liquid immune globulin the api and a second vial containing the hyaluronidase table 3 examples of commercialized products containing hyaluronidase therapeutic protein brand name disease injection volume trastuzumab herceptin sc™ oncology 5 m lrituximab mabthera sc™ oncology 117 m limmune globulin 10 hyqvia™ primary immunodeficiency 100 m ldespite the benefits hyaluronidase may offer in facilitating delivery of larger sc injection volumes challenges remain a coformulation that includes this permeation enhancer 39 needs to be carefully developed so that stability of the active ingredient eg protein as well as stability and activity of the enzyme is maintained 40 in addition analytical methods including sample preparation need to be carefully developed and selected because the enhancer may demonstrate analytical interference in cases where a coformulation is not found acceptable development of a dual chamber system is advisable 41 another alternative is to provide the product and hyaluronidase in 2 separate vials as is performed for hyqvia™ however separate vials further complicate development manufacturing and administration of the drug product 41conclusion the most convenient route of administration for therapeutic proteins which requires frequent and longterm treatments is sc injection the maximum tolerated sc injection volume was believed to be 1525 m l with injection volumes 25 m l assumed to be associated with injection pain leakage and adverse events at the injection site however to the best of our knowledge no clinically relevant evidence exists to support this limitation injection pain is not exclusively influenced by the sc injection volume but is a combination of several factors eg injection time injection site drug product formulation composition and individual patient characteristics several products using hyaluronidase with injection volumes 25 m l have been successfully developed and commercialized in addition more recent evaluations suggest that the boundary of sc injections volumes can be pushed to possibly allow sc injection of volumes 25 m l without coinjection of permeation enhancers however productspecific clinical evaluations are suggested to evaluate injection volume and frequency in the context of injection speed site and the selected formulation acknowledgments the authors would like to thank stephanie ferrell and anne moschella for reviewing
