strokes may be straight as in k l v w x z or curved as in c o s if straight they may be horizontal vertical or diagonal if curved open or closed typographers also speak of an instroke where one starts writing the letter as at the top of a c f and an outstroke where the pen leaves off as at the bottom of c e j k t y 3typefaces are born from the struggle between rules and results squeezing a square about 1 helps it look more like a square to appear the same height as a square a circle must be measurably taller the two strokes in an x arent the same thickness nor are their parallel edges actually parallel the vertical stems of a lowercase alphabet are thinner than those of its capitals the ascender on a d isnt the same length as the descender on a p and so on for the rational mind type design can be a maddening game of drawing things differently in order to make them appear the same hoefler  frerejones 4a main vertical stroke is called a stem the letter m has three the left middle and right stems the central stroke of an s is called the spine 5 when the stroke is part of a lowercase 2 and rises above the height of an x called the x height is called an ascender 6 letters with ascenders are b d f h k l a stroke which drops below the baseline is a descender 6 letters with descenders are g j p q y an arching stroke is called a shoulder as in the top of an r 2 or sometimes just an arch as in h n m a closed curved stroke is called a bowl in b d o p q d o p q  b has two bowls a trailing outstroke as in j y j q r is called a tail the inferior diagonal stroke in k is called leg 7 a short horizontal stroke as in the center of e f and the middle stroke of e f is called a bar when the strokes connect as in a and h or cross strokes as in t is also known as crossbar 7 a longer horizontal stroke at the top or bottom as in e t is called an arm 2 the bottom of the twostory g is called a loop the very short stroke at the top is called the ear 8 i j each have a dot jot or tittle 8 angles of strokes are called apices if at the top and vertices if at the bottom w has one apex and two vertices v has one vertex 8the font shown in the example is stressed strokes have varying widths in this example the stroke at the top of the g is thinner at the top and bottom than on the sides – a vertical stress terminals  editthe terminals ends of instrokes and outstrokes often end in serif or sansserif a seriffed terminal may be described as a wedge bulbous teardrop slab etc depending on the design of the type sorting typefaces can be practical based on its look a clue feature is to define the serif style 7 some designs also have spurs which are smaller than serifs and appear on angles rather than at a terminal as on e or g space  editareas of negative space white space formed by straight or curved strokes are called counters closed counters are found in a b d e g o p q a b d o p q r and open counters in a c e f h m n r s t u the close counter in e is also named eye 7 angles of white space as in w are corners  w has three corners the term is not used for angles of strokes the small corner formed by a serif whether curved or angular is called the serif bracket proportions  edita subtle change in proportion impacts weight perception measure and legibility the letterform height compared to its stroke width modifies the aspect this slight change in weight sometimes helps to create emphasis the disparity between thick and thin strokes known as stress alters optical perception as an example the initial san serif typefaces used a constantly thin stroke the technological advances allow drawing thinner strokes condense type occupies less space than expanded type then the text written on a page can be reduced to half a page the capline and xheight ratio improve or decrease word legibility 2metal type era  editduring the late metal type period many fonts particularly in american typefounding were issued to common line this meant that they were made to standardised proportions so that fonts of different typefaces could be mixed with no difficulty this made it possible to mix typefaces from completely different genres such as sansserifs and serifs and have the cap height baseline and linespacing match perfectly something not possible with most digital fonts it even allowed mixing of different sizes of type with a consistent baseline it however had the disadvantage of often forcing typefaces to be issued with cropped descenders compared to historical typefaces to allow tight linespacing a script line or art line was used for more delicate fonts with long descenders titling capitals meanwhile were issued taking up the whole space of the metal type area with no room for descenders see also  edittype design
