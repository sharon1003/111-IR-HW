characterization  editthe royals is loosely based on the michelle ray novel falling for hamlet 2 alessandra stanley of the new york times described the show as a tongueincheek nighttime soap and a dynasty about a real dynasty 46 creator schwahn said of the series its a family drama its about a family and it just happens to be a royal family  but not the royal family 47 hurley called the royals a very nice combination of what the public sees and what the public will never see 48 of the concept schwann said i just thought it would be really interesting to take a look behind the curtain  who are these people what do they want what will they do to get it i thought it was really fascinating and a great idea for the foundation of a story 48schwahn said of hurley i tell her every day that this was the role that she was meant to play  she has found her lot in life 49 of her character hurley commented this queen is very matriarchal  she has a lot of power and i think she knows how to use it 49 she noted however that theres no correlation at all between her majesty queen elizabeth and my queen helena if princess diana  sic  for example had become queen of england that would be a more similar age group 50 hurley later said that the character of helena was inspired by diana but some of it we picked from cruella de vil the disney character 47 noting that most of the characters on the royals are going to be walking a fine line between good and bad 47 schwahn said elizabeth has been very brave in approaching the more villainous aspects of the character  i was working with elizabeth on wardrobe and she asked why not add in bits of fur i think the queen should wear bits of cruelty once in a while 47regan said of his character the softspoken king simon hes coping with a great deal of grief for the loss of his eldest son robert  hes coping with that and trying to work out how the royal family can exist in the world theyre now in 49 moseley commented on his own storyline as playboy prince liam its like if prince harry was thrown into being the next king of england sic 50 he basically is sort of a rebel  doesnt really care what anybody thinks does whatever he wants to do when he wants to do it he later added 49 park said of her wild princess eleanor shes young and trying to find where her place is in the world shes a party girl 49 austen said of bodyguard jasper hes a very mysterious character  you never know what to expect from him theres a lot of stuff that only mark schwahn and me know about so theres a lot of secrets on set 51 calling the show uncompromising austen added its about the lives of these people and it doesnt try to pretend that they would try to do anything different than the way they would theyre all human beings with flaws some more than others and the show doesnt shy away from that 51episodes  editmain article list of the royals episodes season episodes originally aired first aired last aired1 10 march 15 2015 may 17 20152 10

i know there’s been a lot of excitement about it in the british press 17 hurley suggested that fans of dynasty and gossip girl would enjoy the series 50in march 2015 a viral video of a naked man climbing out a window of buckingham palace on a bedsheet during the changing of the queens guard presumed to be a hoax was publicized internationally by a variety of sources including cosmopolitan and the daily mail 53 54 the video turned out to be a publicity stunt to promote the royals via the shows own fictional tabloid dthroned 55reception  editthe initial reviews were largely negative jane mulkerrins of the telegraph described the royals as a sexy and soapy portrayal of palace life but noted that it lacks the sophistication of gossip girl and the compelling melodrama of the o c 56 alessandra stanley of the new york times called the show a mischievous sendup and hurley amusing but said overall that the series gets old and dull very quickly 46 nancy dewolf smith of the wall street journal described the royals as a trashy soap opera thats not bad enough to be funny and is best when it wallows in melodrama 57 and david wiegand of sfgate called the show entertaining but disappointingly toothless 58 the sydney morning herald described the series as possibly the worst show in the history of tv criticizing it as a bunch of bedhopping halfwits saddled with  very very lousy dialogue 59 the independent agreed calling the royals probably the worst series ever made 60 vicki hyman of njcom said the show was a royal failure describing it as crass and for long stretches tedious 61the hollywood reporter described the royals as being like an extended mtv music video interspersed with dialogue and called it interminably boring 62 the los angeles times panned the series declaring that camp requires courage and the royals has none 63 while margaret lyons of vulture said the show was flaccid weirdly paced and badly cast 64variety called the royals bloody bad 2 and the chicago reader advised viewers to think of the worst hourlong primetime soap operas to have assaulted our senses over the past 30 or so years then go ahead and add this one to your brains trash heap 65conversely david hinckley of the new york daily news wrote that the royals doesn’t pretend to be much more than good fun and it delivers that 66 diane gordon of the wrap described the show as addictive naughty and just the right amount of silly  it left me wanting more 67 calling it an escapist fantasy amanda michelle steiner of people wrote that  the royals is everything thats been missing from your life since gossip girl and the o c  36 ellen gray of phillycom also called it silly but potentially addictive 68 kevin fallon of the daily beast added that once you commit yourself to the trashy abandon of the royals the one critique of the show might be that the abandon isn’t reckless or campy enough 69 jeff jensen of entertainment weekly agreed noting that the show actually isnt bad  if anything youll wish the royals were trashier 70the performances have generally received praise jensen called the acting uniformly good 70 and fallon deemed hurley fantastic in this role 69 wiegand added the unquestionable highlight of the series is the motheranddaughter reunion between queen helena hurley and the grand duchess of oxford joan collins 58 dewolf smith singled out parks eleanor as the best and worst of what the royals has to offer and noted that hatty preston and lydia rose bewley steal their scenes in an absolutely fabulous sort of way 57 steiner concurred writing  preston and bewleys banter is possibly the best part of the premiere 36u s ratings  editno episode air date time slot est ratingshare 18–49 viewers m1  stand and unfold yourself  march 15 2015 sunday
