text plugin that will open whatever is in your current viewtab if the file current open is new and has not been saved a temporary file is created in your default temp directory for your os with the extension of htm and your browser will open it however if the current open file is saved and has a name this plugin will open it in whatever you have set to handle its type by default the keystroke assigned to this plugin is ctrl  alt  v installation using the sublime text package control plugin  httpwbondnetsublimepackagespackagecontrol press ctrl  shift  p and find package control install package and press enter find this plugin in the list by name view in browser configuring browsers by default this plugin will open files in firefox you can configure it to open using another browser of your choice to do this choose settings  user from preferences  package settings  view in browser the browser you wish to use to open files is set in the key named browser the following is a list of browsers configured for use out of the box firefox  mac os linux windows chrome  mac os linux windows chrome64  windows yandex  windows safari  mac osinternet explorer  windows chromium  linux other browsers view in browser also provides key bindings to open your current view in browser other than your browser setting below is a listing of the keys and what browser open with those key bindings ctrl  alt  f  firefox ctrl  alt  c  chrome ctrl  alt  i  internet explorer ctrl  alt  s  safari like any other key binding in sublime these can be changed below is an example of the key configuration you can remap these in your user key bindings configuration file    keys    ctrlaltv    command   viewinbrowser     keys    ctrlaltf    command   viewinbrowser   args    browser   firefox      keys    ctrlaltc    command   viewinbrowser   args    browser   chrome      keys    ctrlalti    command   viewinbrowser   args    browser   iexplore      keys    ctrlalts    command   viewinbrowser   args    browser   safari    windows considerations one of the things you may notice in the windows configuration for chrome is a variable in the command path that looks like local app data this is a reference to your windows installations app data folder in your user profile directory there is a variable there because this value will differ for each user on your computer and chrome installs to your app data folder here is a list of supported variables app data  your main application data folder for your profile usually roamingpersonal  your documents location desktop  the path to your desktop location may be unreliablestart menu  the path to your start menu items location local app data  your local application data folder for your profile my video  path to your videos location my pictures  path to your pictures location my music  path to your music location note that many of these are not terribly useful for determining browser location unless you have decided to install firefox in your my music folder configure to view on local server the view in browser plugin also supports the ability to view files in the context of a local server so if you have a local apache tomcat or some other server application running you can configure this plugin to open your file prefixed with a url to configure this the view in browser plugin reads the configuration of your currently loaded project you can edit a project file by opening the sublimeproject file by choosing project  edit project in your project file you will need to specify two thingsbase url  the root url to prefix files withbase path  the base path where your siteapplication lives heres how that looks   folders     path   homeusernamecodepythonmycoolwebsite     settings    sublimeviewinbrowser    base url   httplocalhost8080    base path   homeusernamecodepythonmycoolwebsite    notice the key named settings which is a dictionary that contains another key named sublimeviewinbrowser this is where you will put your base url and base path settings now when you activate view in browser your file will open with the http protocol instead of the file protocol change history03112016 fix issue where parenthesis in paths would
