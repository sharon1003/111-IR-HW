science chemistry q how can you determine which liquid will evaporate the fastest a quick answer the rate of evaporation of liquid depends on the temperature of the liquid the surface area vapor pressure and the air movements of the surroundings of the liquid these factors all play a part in the process continue reading keep learning what is the vaporization that occurs on and below the surface of a liquid what is the equation for vapor pressure does temperature affect the rate of evaporation full answer the speed at which a liquid evaporates depends on these factors because the liquids molecules have to use a certain amount of energy during evaporation each of these things affects the amount of energy the liquid can expend to turn into a gas liquids like rubbing alcohol will evaporate faster than a thick liquid such as cooking oil this is because the molecules in the alcohol are much more loosely packed than those of the oil which is a thicker denser liquid when performing an experiment on the evaporation rate of liquids the researcher has the ability to influence the rate of evaporation by increasing air flow heating the liquid or exposing it to a larger surface area learn more about chemistry sources anlgov fsuedu related questions q what is standard enthalpy change a standard enthalpy change is the energy exchange that occurs when the surroundings are at standard conditions which includes constant atmospheric pressure full answer filed under chemistry q how can a chemical reaction be shown to be endothermic a a chemical reaction can be shown to be endothermic if it absorbs heat and causes a decrease in the temperature of its surroundings illustrative lab experi full answer filed under chemistry q why is boiling a cooling process a boiling can be considered as a cooling process because as a liquid reaches its critical temperature heat escapes through rapid evaporation essentially b full answer filed under thermodynamics q what is the temperature of liquid nitrogen a nitrogen is a liquid when it is cooled to a temperature between minus 346 degrees fahrenheit and minus 32044 degrees fahrenheit liquid nitrogen resembles full answer filed under chemistry you may also like q what is the difference between chrome and stainless steel q what is abs plastic used for q what is the head of the carbon family known as the basis of life q how do you neutralize ammonia q how is the identity of an element determined q how much water can a sponge absorb
