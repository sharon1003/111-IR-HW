how to write a conclusion to a science research paper anna tower updated june 13 2017science research papers follow a particular structure including an introduction review of methods report on results and discussion of the meaning this discussion is often considered the conclusion for the paper this differs from other research papers which can often include many more sections such as a literature review or annotated bibliography science research papers are typically focused on a specific scientific inquiry whereas other research papers may only be based on printed material purpose all conclusions are meant to summarize the results and implications of a topic under study this can seem like repetition most of the time but the discussion is one of the most important parts of a science research paper because its where a researcher should interpret results discuss data raise unanswered questions be specific and give recommendations for future studies in short the discussion or conclusion section provides the most indepth analysis of the findings in the study and gives readers a sense for what they should do with the information goals different scientific papers will require varied goals so its beneficial to check the specific assignment requirements for each paper however in general the discussion should draw conclusions that are supported by the given evidence present information in a format that demonstrates the major results clarify what should not be concluded from the results explain implications and give suggestions for how to use the information the discussion section enables the writer to frame how others should understand the study in question it does not need to be lengthy just enough to provide a full interpretation warnings some common problems in the discussion include overloading the reader with too much information ignoring negative results that do not support the original hypothesis or the conclusion that the writer wants to draw making statements that are too broad and unspecific drawing conclusions that are not supported by the given evidence and focusing too much on problems and not solutions most of the time its best to stick to the evidence and draw straightforward conclusions rather than explaining results that the researcher wishes were there but arent actually present considerations the value of the conclusion is to demonstrate a writers critical thinking skills especially the ability to synthesize analyze and reason well the concluding argument should be structured logically all points should flow and transition well from one to the next outside theories do not need to be discussed as in a research paper in another discipline scientific research papers are only concerned with the specific topic at hand avoid repetition and stick to the main points to be made the best conclusions will link interpretations directly to findings and hypotheses discussed earlier in the paper cite this article choose citation style mlaapachicago btower anna how to write a conclusion to a science research paper  httppenandthepadcomwriteconclusionscienceresearchpaper5659html accessed 10 april 2018 tower anna nd how to write a conclusion to a science research paper retrieved from httppenandthepadcomwriteconclusionscienceresearchpaper5659html tower anna how to write a conclusion to a science research paper accessed april 10 2018 httppenandthepadcomwriteconclusionscienceresearchpaper5659html copy citation note depending on which text editor youre pasting into you might have to add the italics to the site name references george mason university conclusions how and why for scientific papers massachusetts institute of technology writing a scientific research paper yale university writing a scientific research paper about the author anna tower has a b a in history and journalism from washington  lee university and a m a ed from the college of william and mary she has been writing since 2003 at various publications including the rockbridge report the fairfax county times and usa today tower is certified to teach social studies english and journalism in grades 612 the difference in the introduction and background of a dissertation elissa hansen how to write an experiment report erin pollard how to write a conclusive statement angeliki coconi how to write a proposal for a doctorate trudie longren
