by jim sulski from the pages of right at home daily on paper it seems simple 30000 for a kitchen redo 16000 for a new bathroom 44000 for a family room addition but what are the true costs of those home improvement projects for example that kitchen redo could actually be done for as little as 20000 and the new bathroom may actually cost just 12000 on the other hand a family room addition that costs 44000 on paper may end up costing twice that much when you factor in decorating and furnishing that room the true cost of home improvements can often differ from the onpaper costs and those costs can go up or down depending on the type of project for example the way you finance the project can affect the true cost the biggest savings can come from a tax deduction if you pay for the improvement through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit the interest on a home equity loan or line of credit can be deducted from your federal income taxes as most loans are set up so that the homeowner only makes interest payments or payments that are heavily interestoriented the savings can be substantial on the other hand stretching out the cost of a home improvement over 15 years or more can add to the total cost home value appreciation can help offset the onpaper costs for example if you add a 44000 family room addition to a home valued at 200000 its likely youll be able to turn around after a couple of years and sell the home for more than 250000 especially if you bought one of the smaller less expensive homes in your immediate neighborhood if youre able to sell that home for 250000 your addition added 6000 in value the danger however is that you might overimprove your home by the standard of the neighborhood and actually add to the total cost of the home improvement take the above example what if you were able to sell the same home for only 234000 that addition cost you an extra 10000 you can also lower the total cost of a home improvement project with energy efficiency savings if you add insulation while putting a new roof on your home youll see a drop in your heating bills the following winters new appliances  from furnaces and central air conditioners to refrigerators and ceiling fans  can also trim your heating and electric bills while energyefficient devices may be more expensive upfront theyll pay for themselves quickly look for those products that have an energy star label home improvement projects can save you money over time on maintenance for example if you add vinyl windows or siding to a home youll never have to paint that home again that can save tens of thousands of dollars over the years you spend living there
