worldview can be an intimidating topic to discuss let alone teach to your children but this does not have to be the case a biblical worldview is best presented by concepts that are clearly and easily grasped such is the case with the christmas carol “joy to the world” let’s look at each of the hymn’s four verses and see how they combine to offer a compelling worldview that brings honor to god the first verse focuses on the blessing that jesus christ has come to be our king isaac watts’ christmas carol is one of the most beloved of all the christmas hymns the words to this hymn at least the first verse are known throughout the world this hymn is a call to joy but what is there to be joyful about for watts the joy is based upon the advent of jesus christ the king of creation was born as a baby to live a life that would accomplish the rescue of multitudes of lost souls the only fitting response is joyful submission to the lord of lords and king of kings apart from the rule of christ man is hopelessly lost a slave to his own misguided and failed attempts at selfatonement watts’ carol brims with joy and a call to bow before the one true king see how this plays out in the first verse joy to the world the lord is comelet earth receive her kinglet every heart prepare him roomand heaven and nature sing…“joy to the world” is based on psalm 98 the four verses of the hymn continuously intersect with the truths proclaimed in the psalm you can see this by comparing verses 47 with the carol’s first verse4 shout for joy to the lord all the earthburst into jubilant song with music5 make music to the lord with the harpwith the harp and the sound of singing6 with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn—shout for joy before the lord the king7 let the sea resound and everything in itthe world and all who live in it“joy to the world” does shout for joy the cursed creation receives her king with song our first parents doubted god and brought sin and god’s curse to all creation despite all of the brightly colored distractions of an ungodly culture there ultimately is no hope no reason for joy without christ why “joy to the world” because now there is hope there is a good and powerful king who will set all things right watts’ hymn may be likened to a first primer on embracing a biblical worldview yes the world is a mess a mess to which each human who has ever lived save one has contributed but the lord has come in response to the cynicism of modern culture we can declare the truth joy to the worldthis is a first step to building a biblical worldview in the next few posts we will look at the remaining verses of this great hymn sign up for our weekly newsletter youll get our latest blog posts special discounts news about upcoming resources plus a free ebook and a chance to win our monthly 50 coupon giveaway first name last name email share this facebook google twitter pinterest email print like this loading jay younts john a jay younts is the shepherd press blogger and is a ruling elder serving at redeemer associate reformed presbyterian church in moore south carolina he has written everyday talk everyday talk about sex  marriage finding the right track the in touch with paul stewardship series and what about war he has studied and taught about biblical childrearing for 30 years he and his late wife ruth have five adult children
