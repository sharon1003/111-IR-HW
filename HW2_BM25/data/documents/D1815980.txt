water seawater greenhouses produce tomatoes in the desertby renee cho  february 18 2011 comments according to the world health organization about 20 percent of the world’s people live in regions that don’t have enough water for their needs with the global population increasing by 80 million each year a third of the planet will likely face water shortages by 2025 this looming water crisis is inextricably linked to food production because agriculture accounts for 70 percent of all fresh water used and obtaining irrigation water in arid regions has serious environmental impacts drilling wells can deplete groundwater and desalination is energyintensive and leaves behind concentrated brine the seawater greenhouse however provides what may be an economical and sustainable way of producing fresh water and crops in hot dry regions near the ocean marco goldschmied president of the royal institute of british architects said in 2000“the seawater greenhouse is a truly original idea which has the potential to impact on the lives of millions of people living in waterstarved areas around the world”photo credit world bank photo collection a seawater greenhouse produces crops yearround in hot dry areas using only seawater and sunlight tomatoes cucumbers peppers lettuce strawberries herbs—anything that can be grown in traditional greenhouses—can be grown in seawater greenhouses the awardwinning technology invented by seawater greenhouse ltd founder charlie paton  was inspired by the natural water cycle where seawater heated by the sun evaporates cools to form clouds and returns to earth as precipitation the humidification and dehumidification that result from differences in temperature between surfaces heated by the sun and cold water from the sea are the keys to the seawater greenhouse system photo credit seawater greenhouse ltd seawater is pumped into pipes in the greenhouse and is trickled down over the first evaporator a large spongy honeycomblike surface as air is drawn through the honeycomb and into the greenhouse by fans it is cooled by the seawater and becomes more humid the cool humid air creates favorable growing conditions for the greenhouse crops at the back of the greenhouse the cool air is drawn through a second evaporator containing seawater that has been heated by the sun in the ceiling pipes the air then becomes hot and humid to the saturation point when the hot humid air meets an array of vertical pipes containing cold seawater fresh water condenses just like hot steamy air in your shower condenses on the cooler mirror and tile surfaces the fresh pure water is then piped to a storage container and used to irrigate the crops the sustainable system is clean efficient and elegant in its design the greenhouse control system pumps and fans are powered by electricity produced completely by solar power the honeycomb evaporator filters out pollen and pests that are killed by the saline water so the greenhouse doesn’t need much pesticide nutrients harvested from the brine are pumped back into the irrigation system to fertilize the crops and the rest of the salt is made into gourmet salt crystals that seawater greenhouse ltd sells because the greenhouse produces its own fresh water and uses no fossil fuels or pesticides its operating costs are 10 to 25 percent less than those of a traditional greenhouse its fixed costs are 10 to 15 percent less because it doesn’t need to purchase cooling heating or desalination equipment and because it is usually built on cheap land where little can grow seawater greenhouse technology works best in arid regions by the sea and near consumer markets so crops can be easily transported areas of europe such as crete france greece italy portugal and spain california and mexico in north america large parts of china india pakistan and turkey in asia and much of australia the middle east and northern africa are good candidates for seawater greenhouse projects the seawater greenhouse concept was first developed in 1991 by light works ltd in the uk a successful pilot project on tenerife in the canary islands in 1992 led to research projects on alaryam island in abu dhabi and muscat oman in 2005 seawater greenhouse began collaborating with the architects nicholas grimshaw  partners on the harbor redevelopment of las palmas de gran canaria exploring the use of its technology to cool a more urban environment they are designing the 19mile promenade botanic garden and water theatre using some of the same principles to produce fresh water and cooling photo credit port augusta greenhouse seawater greenhouse ltd in 2009 private investors backed the first commercial seawater greenhouse in port augusta south australia the 2000squaremeter structure which draws seawater from the spencer gulf is capable of producing 100000 kilos of tomatoes each year the excess fresh water it produces will be used to grow citrus plants outdoors the port augusta greenhouse which cost 2 million produced its first crop of tomatoes in december this january waterscarce jordan and norway joined forces on the sahara forest project a 200000squaremeter demonstration center near aqaba on the red sea that will produce fresh water food energy and sustainable biomass the project is being developed by londonbased seawater greenhouse max fordham consulting engineers and exploration architecture and the bellona foundation a norwegian environmental ngo the sahara forest project will use water from the red sea in seawater greenhouses to produce fresh water for the crops and grow algae in open ponds for fuel and food the project will also grow halophytes plants tolerant of salty conditions that have potential to be an energy crop because each 10000 square meters of seawater greenhouse evaporates 50 tons of water daily the greenhouse will help restore vegetation on the surrounding arid land through ventilating the “lost” humidity to create a cooler and more humid microclimate downwind of the greenhouse the “lost” humidity will also increase the chance for precipitation in the area the algae crops and other plants will sequester carbon dioxide from the air extra fresh water produced by the seawater greenhouse will be heated by a concentrated solar power plant csp generating steam that will turn a turbine to produce electricity the csp’s excess heat will be used to desalinate seawater for drinking water a single sahara forest project facility with 50 mw of concentrated solar power and 50 hectares of seawater greenhouses would produce 34000 tons of produce employ over 800 people export 155 gwh of electricity and sequester more than 1500 tons of co 2 each year if the demonstration project is successful aqaba will provide 200 hectares for a larger scale facility photo credit the sahara forest project foundation  screenergy construction on the demonstration center will start in 2012 with the commercial scale development scheduled to begin in 2015 the creators are planning a largescale commercial facility comprised of a 10millionsquaremeter area of seawater greenhouses csp towers orchards native species such as jatropha for biofuel and a desalination facility“the sahara forest project is a fiercely ambitious effort…but ambitious is exactly what we must be” said bellona’s president frederic hauge “a critical prerequisite for solving both the climate crisis and the world’s food problem is to enable developing countries to produce their own food their own water and their own clean energy…”–columbia water

thoughts on “ seawater greenhouses produce tomatoes in the desert ”zaka imam february 19 2011 at 841 am excellent development shall follow development as these are very important for countries having long coastline and rain fed agriculture zaka imam ph dmatthew stewart february 20 2011 at 210 pm so i have some questions how often do they need to change out the honeycomb cardboard evaporators due to salt build up is the salt retrievable in a manner that is economical and possibly would allow the reuse of the evaporator i am hoping that the salt and used evaporators are not merely discarded as waste renee cho february 21 2011 at 959 am hi matthew i will try to find out the answers to your questions renee cho february 21 2011 at 1053 am matthew this information is from the science and development manager of the sahara forest project the cardboard evaporative pads will need to be changed out eventually but not often in the early seawater greenhouse built in oman the original pads were still working after more than two years when they do require replacement the retired pads will be reused — potentially as building materials as for the salt  one of the great advantages of the sahara forest project is that it can derive benefits from the brine left over from desalination — which is typically treated as a waste and returned to the original seawater source where it can eventually cause significant environmental damage instead in the sahara forest project brine is repeatedly recycled for evaporative cooling and humidification — both inside and outside of the greenhouses — to facilitate more plant growth when it finally reaches a very concentrated state the brine is then placed in evaporative ponds where it remains until it becomes dry salt the contents of this salt has a range of uses whether as traditional road salt or — at large scales — as a potential resource from which valuable minerals can be extracted glennert riedel february 22 2011 at 1104 pm i’m from curacao in the caribbean in the past i tried to promote the seawater greenhouse here on the island but the interest was low now with the rising vegetable prices and import from the mainland becoming less available the government is looking for alternatives i have an appointment the day after tomorrow with people from the government my questions what is the minimum economical viable size for a seawater greenhouse how much labor man hours does it cost to produce the above mentioned 100000 kilo’s of tomatoes renee february 23 2011 at 601 pm glennert seawater greenhouses says on their website that their systems can fit a wide range of scales and can start on a smaller scale then expand gradually however i’m trying to get a more specific answer for you and also find out about man hours glennert riedel february 23 2011 at 949 pm thank you renee tai mesches and kat klett february 23 2011 at 1150 pm hello reneeexcellent article thanks for all your caring responses and help to those interested in pursing this technology in their own country keep up the good work renee february 25 2011 at 625 am glennert to answer your questions your best bet would probably be to contact the seawater greenhouse company wwwseawatergreenhousecom directly and charlie paton the inventor of the greenhouse — they would know the key economic data for the greenhouse as a standalone entity glennert riedel february 25 2011 at 1118 pm thanks renee i will do that keep up the good work thomas bjelkemanpettersson february 27 2011 at 248 pm glennert i have worked with charlie paton at seawater greenhouse for some time looking at the economic parameters and investment alternatives for the seawater greenhouse i visited the australian installation in january there are a lot of variables you need to look at to understand what is a minimum economically viable installation costs of vegetables imports including transport costs wastage storage duty etc costs of local land labour and many different operational components is there a market for premium products for example you could start selling products which are hard or impossible to import i generally say that a minimum installation should be 12 hectares but it depends on the answers to the above questions if you are on a very small island maybe you need to export to other islands in your local area to reach a viable size we have an economic model we use to calculate this when we have all the data we need to come up with a more precise answer hope that helps thomas bjelkeman glennert riedel march 3 2011 at 959 pm hi thomas we have met back in 2008 in curacao there is a growing market for premium products there are more than 5000 hotel rooms at the moment and the number is growing in order to be compeitive you must be able to sell for example tomatoes for less than 211 per kilo and make a profit i’ve been asked to give some input to the government on how to increase local agriculture production and am preparing a presentation for the minister of economic afairs this is a one shot opportuity in the sense that if he is not convinced he will continue shopping elsewhere do you have a list of all the data needed for the economic model are there costs invoved to have this clculation made thanks and best regardsglennert jessica janes march 16 2011 at 251 pm this is a brilliant way to capture and utilize this natural resource since it is hard to control population growth we have to develop alternative agricultural supplies such as this pingback the middle east dries up—another case study in

is good… but is this water distilled water  are tomatoes ok with it  does some pinch of salt be added back to it for nutrient balancing  what about fish… the fish tank keeping with the greenhouse sounds very working… would fish be ok with that water  if not what would need to be done to that water before fish grant their approval and dung for the plant fertilization  renee october 26 2011 at 1115 am max – the fresh water is condensation of water vapor from humid air it is essentially distilled water and has no nutrient content a small amount of seawater can be added back to provide some nutrients but seawater greenhouse ltd uses a form of seaweed extract as a general fertilizer it is a more concentrated nutrient formula but with less sodium than straight seawater charlie paton inventor of the seawater greenhouse said that he is sure that aquaculture would also work but thinks getting the nutrient balance would be tricky bret  green global travel december 31 2011 at 710 pm genius concept with the growing fresh water crisis and the polar ice caps melting at an everincreasing rate finding ingenious ways to put salt water to use for sustainable agriculture will likely become increasingly crucial steve january 11 2012 at 119 pm the water is condensation of water vapor from humid air it is essentially drinking water and has no nutrient content a bit of sea water can be added back to provide some nutrients but seawater greenhouse ltd uses a form of seaweed extract as a general fertilizer excellent sharing and appreciate for nice bloggingwolf krusemark february 13 2012 at 452 pm we need to start implementing smart ideas like this all over the world asap i’m glad that their are smart people out there that are part of the solution frank kern february 14 2012 at 1153 am when i heard about this i initially thought there had been a breakthrough in some kind of reverse osmosis plant system but of course evaporation and condensate recovery is the best and least resourcehungry method i have used it myself whilst driving down western morocco to obtain drinking water from seawater using a plastic rain poncho the true genius part is taking the waste salt and selling it on as gourmet cooking saltdanny february 20 2012 at 204 pm this sounds interesting and very well thought out i am presently involved in the development of high tech irrigation that requires on average 40 less water and fertilizer when compared to conventional agriculture with drip irrigation i believe it will complement projects like this and result in lower operating cost and more water left for additional agriculture who could i contact to share this information liz karschner march 2 2012 at 1015 am this is a great concept and would make use out of otherwise unusable land more projects like this need to be implemented and having the ability to remove the salt and then resell makes the whole project practically zero waste which is the bestadrien brisbane builder march 6 2012 at 306 am this is absolutely awesome isnt it funny how nature herself has given everything required to enable us to harness the power as a builder i too wondered about the salt build up in the filters but selling it on as “gourmet salt” is brilliant mind you it is in direct competition with the salt farm located in south australia brilliant article rav april 10 2012 at 820 am yes…down in mexico the tomato growers have just about used up the last available water growing tomato’s and have seriously lowered the water tables this is an obvious solution to that dilemma especially considering that mexico is having the worst drought in history jack pearsall may 25 2012 at 816 am back in the early 70’s i worked on desalinization plants for the government…there were 6 of them if i recall correctly we mostly looked at material viability due to the highly corrosive nature of salt water at the time we found no sustainable way to use salt water due to the costs i’ll bet there are far more economical ways to do desalinization now and utilize the remaining salts i’ll be doing a new blog on httpwwwtomato411com shortly and i’ll mention the “desert tomato growth” and see if there are others that frequent my site that have any experience with all of this…great articleanthony  cultureist mag june 1 2012 at 1146 pm it’s a fantastic concept as climate continues to amplify the world’s water crisis it’s increasingly important to utilize technology like desalinization to help sustain the world’s need for clean drinking water although costly i’d love to see more countries in drought prone regions finance desalinization plants – ultimately it can be a significant life saving investmenthome and garden centre july 31 2012 at 230 pm hello there would you mind if i share your blog with my myspace group there’s a lot of people that i think would really enjoy your content please let me know thank you renee cho july 31 2012 at 427 pm not at all please do thanks aquatic supplies august 9

student in water resources i just want to start my thesis about sea water using for irrigation the method that you use is so interesting for me would you mind giving me a text or document in which i can study more about the details of your work  with best regards renee cho august 15 2012 at 934 am hi nazila if you click on the second link in my blog you can access a paper charles paton wrote about the technology he used if you click on the first link you can go to the seawater greenhouse website – i would recommend contacting them directly for more information rudresh november 21 2012 at 243 am i really appreciate the concept of using seawater as an alternative to fresh water in water scarce areas my only doubt is on the characteristic of soil in the coastal areas i have visited a coastal area in gujarat india and found that the salt content is very high in the soil and growing plants is impossible what kind of steps have been taken to grow tomatoes in these areas are these crops genetically modified to grow under such conditions your inputs would be appreciable renee november 26 2012 at 1203 pm hi rudesh i would suggest that you contact seawater greenhouse directly and they will be able to answer your questions the website is httpwwwseawatergreenhousecom alfredo alvarez january 17 2013 at 501 pm excelent concept for taking care of our environment while we take advantage of it i wonder there is technical information to build one of this greenhouses available somewhere danny i would be glad if you could share that information with me aealvaregmailcom regards

angelomarianoinformacom j macallister march 2 2013 at 1020 pm hi dalmarit seems you are thinking about the dry season sunlight being too intense for food production i am just guessing that some form of shading would be easy enough to construct or perhaps some treatment to the greenhouse material such as polarization or surface treatment to reduce the incoming light intensity it appears that in some cases there is surplus water so that another possibility maybe to have evaporative coolers act as air conditioners to avoid runaway high temperatures jacqueline april 2 2013 at 900 pm amazing innovation and technology that hopefully will bring help where it is needed most imagine if that was coupled with the wealthy giving to help the poor on a regular sustained basis instead of spending thousands on yet another luxury fatma april 20 2013 at 330 pm dear renee choi live in oman can you please let me know where is this salt water green house because i am interested in hydroponics thanks renee cho april 23 2013 at 1126 am hi fatma you should contact the seawater greenhouse directly for the information httpwwwseawatergreenhousecomcontacthtml daniel july 1 2013 at 945 pm sorry but i don’t see the thermodynamics logic in this design as everyone knows containing anything in plastic in a desert or anywhere else for that matter results in the greenhouse effect hence higher heat not lower dr a jagadeesh september 17 2013 at 227 pm great achievement in desert regions with sea water amazing i was in israel and could see the innovative way they produce fruits in the desert type of conditions dr a jagadeesh nellore apindia lisa january 31 2014 at 608 pm this is such a great concept hopefully human ingenuity can solve our problems as a planet great work scientistsali february 24 2014 at 428 amhi renee i’m trying to gather information about paton’s innovation and try to construct a little one in framwork of charlie’s details are provided in his articles and etc so i have a questions about details of greenhouses materials what type of evaporative pad is used in this greenhouses what is gender of that renee march 3 2014 at 546 pm for that kind of technical information i think it would be best for you to contact seawater greenhouse directlyhttpwwwseawatergreenhousecommohammed junaid may 7 2014 at 717 am how does evaporative cooling work  where high humidity climate available at coastal areas in gulf region and how can it gives certain temperature to crop like tomato which require average 2428 degree c with relative humidity up to 75  inside  most of the coastal areas having max humidity my question is how they control humidity inside humidity play a important role in plants growth  james july 14 2015 at 219 am water is a major requirement in crop production regions that experience little rains have greater challenges green houses help in controlling the environment and makes it conducive for crop production especially the horticultural crops thanks for sharing with us grace july 16 2015 at 208 am this can be a perfect solution especially in africa thanks for sharing on green houses which facilitates food security wachiuri july 17 2015 at 600 am this is innovation at its best wish i could borrow the concept and present at the oncoming trade fair on enhancing technology in agriculture for food security grace july 20 2015 at 128 am thats right
