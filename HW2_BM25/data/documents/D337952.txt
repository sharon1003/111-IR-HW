html5 video000  437trailer made a tires sidewall is where you learn everything dimensions capacities age and most important purpose a tire made for a boat trailer is going to have st on the sidewall or the words trailer use only unlike tires on your car trailer tires have strengthened sidewalls to handle the weight of a boat especially when rounding corners trailer tires are either bias ply or radial biasply sidewalls are stiffer less expensive than radials and are preferred if the trailer isnt used for long trips if you take long trips then radials are a better choice because theres reduced heat buildup as compared to bias ply greater load capacity and less road noise use all bias ply or all radials never mix them inflation check inflation prior to going on the road when the tires are cold the tire pressure measured in pounds per square inch psi will increase as the tire heats up when used boat us trailer assist service providers say tires are the main reason theyre called to help members experiencing trouble on the road under inflation is the cause of most tire trouble because temperatures increase when the tire pressure is too low so check inflation prior to going on the road its marked on your tire remember boat trailer tires typically need to be inflated to higher psi than tow vehicle tires and be sure to also check the psi of the spare tire load range every tire has a load range and trailer tires are no different marked on the sidewall the load range runs from the lightest weight the tire can carry load range b to the heaviest load range e load range is a measure of an individual tires maximum capacity to carry a boat and trailer most boat trailer tires have a load range of b c or d if a tire has load range c it can carry 1820 pounds if its on a singleaxle trailer this means both tires can carry a total of 3640 pounds which includes the weight of the trailer the boat the engine fuel and anything else inside the boat singleaxle trailers can carry 100 percent of the load rating doubleaxle trailers require the load be reduced by 12 percent as load range increases psi increases tire wear your tires will tell you when somethings wrong and usually give plenty of hints before becoming the topic of conversation tire pressure thats too high causes center wear on the tire while low tire pressure causes wear on the outside edges sidewall inspect the sidewalls for spiderweb cracks which is evidence of dry rot and imminent failure tread a lincoln penny is a good measure for tread depth on both car and boat trailer tires place the penny upside down on the tread if you can see the top of the presidents head the tread is worn and its time to start looking for new tires valve stem often overlooked the valve stem may be the cause of continued low psi press your finger against one side of the stem and listen for any loss of air balance and rotate tires the answers are yes and maybe like tires on your car or tow vehicle trailer tires that are balanced ensure proper tire wear and reduce vibration single axle boattrailer tires usually dont need to be rotated a tandem axle trailer rotation isnt necessary unless you notice increased wear thats occurring faster than normal in that case rotate the tires from front to back preferably in an x configuration if the trailer sits outside trailer tires face a pair of threats outside sun prolonged exposure to the suns uv rays will deteriorate trailer tires causing spiderweb cracks this can be easily resolved by putting tire covers over the tires if the trailer is going to be parked for an extended period of time moisture the worst thing you can do to a trailer tire is to park it on grass for a long period of time where moisture is going to slowly get into the tires protective surface this can be solved by either removing the tires during the winter also deters theft or positioning the trailer tires on concrete or plywood motion is good a parked trailer means the tires are bearing the weight in the same position on the tire for a long period of time this can result in flat spots on a tire if the trailer is parked for a while check the tire pressure from time to time to ensure the tires are properly inflated speed most trailer tires have a maximum speed of 65 mph however if speeds from 66 to 75 mph are used the tire inflation pressure can be increased by 10 psi without any increase in load however the tire and rim association which sets standards for tires suggests decreasing the load capacity of the trailer by 10 percent if you are running at these higher speeds the psi  a tire pressure monitoring system after all the noise weve made about the importance of checking tire pressure it can be done without getting out of your truck with a tire gauge a number of monitoring systems are available for recreational vehicle owners but heres one designed with a trailer boat owner in mind the 507rv made by truck system technologies is part of a larger system already in use on semitrucks throughout the country freightliner mhc kenworth to name a few its simple to set up a monitor is screwed into the tire stem and a screen is plugged into the tow vehicle cigarette lighter and once programmed will provide the psi of each tire as well as the temperature inside the tire the latter being important to warn that a bearing or brake rotor is going bad it works when trailers are dunked in fresh water or saltwater too how old r u your tires age whether for a boat trailer truck or passenger car has a dot department of transportation time stamp that provides the tires date of manufacture the last four digits tell you everything you need to know in this example the tire was manufactured in the second week of 2008 what does it mean stthis tire is designed for a trailer205width of the tire in millimeters75the ratio of height to width in this example the tires height is 75 percent of its width the smaller the aspect ratio the wider the tire in relation to height dthis indicates a bias ply tire d stands for diagonal r would mean this is a radial tire14wheel diameter this trailer has 14 rims this article was published in the summer 2012 issue
