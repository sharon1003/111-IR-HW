the medical medium—and what’s potentially at the root of medical mysteries in the foreword to medical medium alejandro junger m d writes “as a man of science i have been taught to the point of indoctrination that i must only trust what i can observe measure test and reproduce” but junger then goes on to explain his careerlong fascination with healers—those who can bring sight back through touch or restore the mysteriously ailing to health sure it sounds really out there but one of the reasons we lean on junger so heavily over here at goop is because he’s always willing to question the status quo—and to acknowledge that he might not have all the answers one of the unlikely places where junger has found surprising—and according to him spoton—answers is from anthony william a selftitled medical medium who has heard a force he calls spirit in his ear since he was a toddler as he recounts in his book the vision of a man appeared at the dinner table one night when he was four years old and beckoned him to stand in front of his grandmother put his hand on her chest and say “lung cancer” plagued by curiosity his parents took his grandmother to the doctor a few weeks later and sure enough she had a late stage lung cancer that had metastasized and according to william spirit—though not visibly present—has been with him ever since william has a robust business—apparently the waiting list is yearslong half of his clients are doctors looking for advice on behalf of incurable patients and he attends to callers by lottery—but he’s put some of his foundational knowledge into a book which he’s quick to point out has absolutely nothing in the way of medical study footnotes or citations as he explains “it’s all new” the focus is on “mystery illnesses” ie a group of diseases that many physicians have been quick to dismiss as psychosomatic—and which primarily affect women—including chronic fatigue syndrome fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis lyme disease rheumatoid arthritis hashimoto’s and epsteinbarr virus more on ebv below the book is a fascinating read whether plausible or not his personal story is compelling and his discussion of disease and disease states is really interesting even if you’re not personally affected below you’ll find a chapter about epsteinbarr virus from medical medium secrets behind chronic and mystery illness and how to finally heal for more from anthony william on goop see a heavy metal detox mysteries of the thyroid and why we shouldn’t dismiss iodine epsteinbarr virus chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgiaby anthony william the epsteinbarr virus ebv has created a secret epidemic out of the roughly 320 million people in the u s over 225 million americans have some form of ebv epsteinbarr is responsible for mystery illnesses of every category for some people it creates fatigue and pain that go unnamed for others ebv symptoms prompt doctors to prescribe ineffective treatments such as hormone replacement and for so many people walking around with ebv it gets misdiagnosed among the reasons ebv is thriving so little is understood about it medical communities are aware of only one version of ebv but there are actually over 60 varieties epsteinbarr is behind several of the debilitating illnesses that stump doctors as i said in the introduction it’s the mystery illness of mystery illnesses doctors have no idea how the virus operates longterm and how problematic it can be the truth is ebv is the source of numerous health problems that are currently considered mystery illnesses such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome ebv is also the cause of some major maladies that medical communities think they understand but really don’t—including thyroid disease vertigo and tinnitus this chapter explains when the epsteinbarr virus arose how it’s transmitted how it operates to create untold havoc in strategic stages no one knows about and the steps never revealed before that can destroy the virus and restore health epsteinbarr origins and transmissionthough epsteinbarr was discovered by two brilliant physicians in 1964 it had actually begun taking hold in the early 1900s—over half a century before ebv’s initial versions—which are still with us—are relatively slow to act and might not even create notable symptoms until late in life even then they’re only mildly harmful many people have these nonaggressive ebv strains unfortunately ebv has evolved over the decades and each generation of the virus has grown more challenging than the one before until the publication of this book those with ebv would typically be stuck with it for the rest of their lives doctors seldom recognize ebv as the root cause of the myriad of problems it creates plus doctors have no idea how to address the epsteinbarr virus even when it is recognized there are many ways to catch ebv for example you can get it as a baby if your mother has the virus you can also get it through infected blood hospitals don’t screen for the virus so any blood transfusion puts you at risk you can even get it from eating out that’s because chefs are under tremendous pressure to get dishes prepared quickly they often end up cutting a finger or hand slapping on a bandaid and continuing to work their blood can get into the food…and if they happen to have ebv during a contagious phase that can be enough to infect you transmission can also happen through other bodily fluids such as those exchanged during sex under some circumstances even a kiss can be enough to transmit ebv someone with the virus isn’t contagious all the time though it’s most likely to spread during its stage two which brings up something else that until now hasn’t been revealed ebv goes through four stages epsteinbarr stage oneif you catch ebv it goes through an initial dormant period of floating around in your bloodstream doing little more than slowly replicating itself to build its numbers—and waiting for an opportunity to launch a more direct infection for example if you physically exhaust yourself for weeks and give yourself no chance to fully recover or allow your body to become deprived of essential nutrients such as zinc or vitamin b12 or undergo a traumatic emotional experience such as a breakup or the death of a loved one the virus will detect your stressrelated hormones and choose that time to take advantage ebv will also often act when you’re undergoing a major hormonal change—for example during puberty pregnancy or menopause a common scenario is when a woman goes through childbirth afterward she may feel various symptoms including fatigue aches and pains and depression in this case ebv isn’t exploiting your weakness but the fact that hormones are a powerful food source for it—their abundance acts as a trigger the hormones flooding through your body effectively does for the virus what spinach does for popeye ebv is inhumanly patient this stage one period of fortifying itself and waiting for an ideal opportunity can take weeks months or even a decade or longer depending on a variety of factors the virus is especially vulnerable during stage one however it’s also undetectable through tests and causes no symptoms so you normally wouldn’t know to fight it because you wouldn’t be aware it was there epsteinbarr stage twoat the end of stage one the epsteinbarr virus is ready to do battle with your body that’s when ebv first makes its presence known…by turning into mononucleosis this is the infamous mono that we all grow up hearing about as the “kissing disease” it’s what thousands of college students contract every year when they run themselves down with allnight partying and studying medical communities are unaware that every case of mononucleosis is only stage two of ebv this is the period when the virus is most contagious it’s therefore advisable to avoid getting exposed to blood saliva or other bodily fluids from someone who has mono…or to avoid exposing anyone to your fluids if you have mono during this stage two your body’s immune system goes to war with the virus it sends identifier cells to “tag” virus cells ie place a hormone on them that marks them as invaders it then sends soldier cells to seek out and kill the tagged virus cells this is the power of your immune system coming to your defense how severely this battle rages will vary from person to person because everyone is different and it will also depend on what ebv strain or variety a person has you can have mono for just a week or two with a mild scratchy throat and tiredness in which case you aren’t likely to realize what’s really happening so you most likely won’t visit a doctor for a blood test then again you can get hit hard with fatigue sore throat fever headaches rashes and more that hang on for several months if this happens the chances are you’ll go see a doctor who’ll test your blood and the epsteinbarr virus will show up as a form of mono…most of the time it’s during this stage that ebv seeks a longterm home by making a run for one or more of your major organs—typically your liver andor spleen ebv loves being in these organs because mercury dioxins and other toxins are likely to accumulate there the virus thrives on these poisons one other secret about ebv is that it has a best friend a bacterium called streptococcus in such cases your body is dealing with not only a virus but also bacteria that further confuse the immune system and produce their own array of symptoms this is epsteinbarr’s number one cofactor during ebv’s stage two streptococcus can travel up to create strep throat andor infest the sinuses nose or mouth it can also travel down to create infections in the urinary tract vagina kidneys or bladder    eventually causing cystitis epsteinbarr stage threeonce the virus settles into your liver spleen andor other organs it nests there from this point on when a doctor tests for epsteinbarr she or he will find antibodies and take these to indicate a past infection when ebv was in its mono phase the doctor will not find the ebv presently active in the bloodstream the confusion here is one of the biggest blunders in medical history—this is how this virus has slipped through the cracks unless you have already followed the measures outlined in this book to kill the ebv the virus is in fact still alive and causing new symptoms…and it’s eluding the tests that’s because it’s living in the liver spleen or other organs and the test to detect this has not yet been invented with the virus hiding undetected in your organs your body assumes it’s won the war and the invader has been destroyed your immune system returns to its normal state your mononucleosis ends and your doctor tells you that you’re healthy unfortunately the epsteinbarr virus has barely begun its voyage through your body if you have a typical variety ebv could lie dormant in your organs for years—possibly for decades—without your knowing it if you have an especially aggressive variety though ebv may create serious problems even while it’s nesting for example the virus may burrow deep into your liver and spleen causing those organs to become inflamed and enlarged and once again keep in mind that your doctor does not know to connect the dots between past ebv and its present activity in the organs the virus also creates three types of poison ebv excretes toxic waste matter or viral byproduct this becomes increasingly significant as the virus grows more cells and its expanding army keeps eating and excreting poisonous byproduct this waste matter is often identified as spirochetes which can trigger false positives on tests such as lyme titers screening tests for lyme disease and lead to a false diagnosis of lyme when a cell of the virus dies—which happens often as the cells have a sixweek life cycle—the corpse that is left behind is itself toxic and so further poisons your body as with viral byproduct this problem becomes more severe as ebv’s army grows creating fatigue the poisons ebv creates through these two processes have the ability to generate a neurotoxin—ie a poison that disrupts nerve function and confuses your immune system it will secrete this special toxin at strategic periods during stage three and continuously during stage four to prevent your immune system from zeroing in on the virus and attacking it the issues that may result from an aggressive variety of ebv nesting in your organs include your liver performing so sluggishly that it does a poor job of flushing toxins out of your system hepatitis c ebv is actually the primary cause of hepatitis cyour liver’s sluggish performance leading to the lowering of your stomach’s hydrochloric acid and your intestinal tract starting to become toxic this in turn can result in some food not being fully digested and instead putrefying in your intestinal tract resulting in bloating andor constipation your developing sensitivities to foods that never caused you problems before this happens when the virus consumes a food it likes such as cheese and transforms it into something your body doesn’t recognize the virus bides its time until it senses stressrelated hormones indicating you’re in an especially vulnerable state—say as a result of burning the candle at both ends enduring a severe emotional blow or suffering a physical jolt such as being in a car accident—or when it senses you’re undergoing hormonal upheaval such as during pregnancy or menopause when the virus is nearly ready to spring it begins excreting its neurotoxin this adds to the burden on your system already created by ebv’s byproduct and virus corpses all this poison in your system finally triggers your immune system—and also thoroughly confuses it because it has no idea where the toxins are coming from lupus the immune system response i’ve just described triggers the mysterious symptoms that doctors can diagnose as lupus medical communities have no understanding that lupus is just the body reacting to epsteinbarr’s byproducts and neurotoxins it’s the body having an allergic reaction to these neurotoxins which then elevates the inflammatory markers that doctors search for to identify and diagnose lupus in truth lupus is just a viral infection of epsteinbarr hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders while your immune system is in disarray ebv takes advantage of the chaos by leaving the organs it’s been nesting in and making a run for a different major organ or gland—which this time is your thyroidmedical communities aren’t yet aware that ebv is the actual cause of most thyroid disorders and diseases—especially hashimoto’s but also graves’ thyroid cancer and other thyroid ills thyroid disease is also sometimes caused by radiation but in over 95 percent of cases the culprit is epsteinbarr medical research has not yet uncovered the true causes of thyroid disorders and it’s still decades away from discovering that ebv is the virus that causes them if a doctor gives you a hashimoto’s diagnosis it really means that she or he doesn’t know what’s wrong the claim is that your body is attacking your thyroid—a view that arises from misinformation in truth it’s the ebv—not your body—attacking the thyroid once in your thyroid ebv begins drilling into its tissues the virus cells literally twist and spin like drills to burrow deep into the thyroid killing thyroid cells and scarring the organ as they go creating hidden hypothyroidism in millions of women from mild cases to the more extreme your immune system notices this and tries to intervene causing inflammation but between ebv’s neurotoxin viral byproduct and poisonous corpses confusing things and with ebv hiding in your thyroid your immune system can’t tag the virus for complete destruction while the above may sound unnerving don’t let it rattle you your thyroid has the ability to rejuvenate and heal itself when it’s given what it needs and never underestimate the power of your immune system which by the end of this chapter will become activated just by you learning the truth as a fallback option your immune system tries to wall off the virus with calcium creating nodules in your thyroid however this doesn’t hurt ebv first most of its cells evade this attack and remain free second a virus cell that your immune system successfully walls off typically remains alive and turns its calcium prison into a comfortable home where it feeds on your thyroid draining it of energy the virus cell might even eventually transform its prison into a living growth called a cyst that creates further strain on your thyroid meanwhile these attacks against ebv can hurt you if you aren’t eating enough calciumrich foods that’s because if your immune system can’t get the calcium to wall off the virus from your bloodstream it’ll extract what it needs from your bones…which can lead to osteoporosis simultaneously the hundreds of virus cells that aren’t imprisoned in nodules can weaken your thyroid making it less effective at producing the hormones your body needs to function this lack of adequate thyroid hormones coupled with ebv’s toxins can in turn lead to weight gain fatigue mental fogginess impaired memory depression hair loss insomnia brittle nails muscle weakness andor dozens of other symptoms some especially rare aggressive varieties of ebv go even further they create cancer in the thyroid the rate of thyroid cancer in the u s has been rising rapidly medical communities don’t know that the cause is an increase in rare aggressive forms of ebv the epsteinbarr virus invades your thyroid for a strategic reason—it’s seeking to confuse and place stress on your endocrine system the strain on your adrenal glands produces more adrenaline which is a favored food of ebv that makes it stronger and better able to go after its ultimate target your nervous system epsteinbarr stage fourthe ultimate goal of the epsteinbarr virus is to leave your thyroid and inflame your central nervous system your immune system normally wouldn’t allow this to happen but if ebv has successfully worn you down in stage three by entering your thyroid and if on top of that you abruptly get clobbered with some physical or severe emotional injury the virus will take advantage of your vulnerability and start to cause a multitude of strange symptoms that range from heart palpitations to generalized aches and pains to nerve pain a common scenario is being in an accident getting surgery or suffering some other physical damage and then feeling awful for much longer than would be expected from the injury alone a typical reaction is to “feel like a truck hit me”blood tests xrays and mris will reveal nothing wrong so doctors won’t be aware of the virus inflaming the nerves stage four epsteinbarr is therefore a major source of mystery illnesses—that is problems that cause doctors massive confusion what’s actually happening is that your injured nerves trigger an “alarm” hormone to notify your body that the nerves are exposed and need repair in stage four ebv detects that hormone and rushes over to latch onto those damaged nerves a nerve is similar to a string of yarn with little root hairs hanging off it when the nerve is injured the root hairs pop off the sides of the nerve sheath ebv looks for those openings and grabs onto them if it succeeds it can keep the area inflamed for years as a result you can have a relatively small injury that remains flared up and causes you continual pain the issues that result from this viral inflammation can include muscle pain joint pain painful tender points back pain tingling andor numbness in the hands and feet migraines ongoing fatigue dizziness insomnia unrestful sleep and night sweats patients with these issues are sometimes diagnosed as having fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis all of which are collections of symptoms that medical communities admit they don’t understand and for which they have no cure in such cases the patients are given inappropriate treatments that don’t begin to address the real culprit—because these mystery illnesses are really stage four epsteinbarr one of the greatest missteps of all time is mistaking women’s epsteinbarr symptoms for perimenopause and menopause symptoms such as hot flashes night sweats heart palpitations dizziness depression hair loss and anxiety were and are frequently misinterpreted as hormonal change—which is what launched the disastrous hrt movement to learn more see chapter 15 “premenstrual syndrome and menopause”let’s take a closer look at the chronic illnesses that have puzzled doctors for decades and are the result of stage four epsteinbarr chronic fatigue syndrome there’s a long history of womankind facing denial that there’s a physical cause of their suffering like those with fibromyalgia see below people with chronic fatigue syndrome cfs—also known by names such as myalgic encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome mecfs chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome cfids and systemic exertion intolerance disease seid—often hear that they are liars lazy delusional andor crazy it’s an illness that affects women in disproportionately large numbers and chronic fatigue syndrome is on the rise it’s becoming common for young women in college to return home midsemester with the condition unable to do anything but lie in bed contracting cfs as a woman in your late teens or early 20s can be particularly devastating as you watch friends move on with relationships and jobs meanwhile feeling stuck and unable to live up to your potential women who get cfs in their 30s 40s or 50s have their own obstacles while you’re old enough at this point to have an established life and support network you also have established responsibilities you’re likely trying to be everything to everybody taking care of more than you can handle and so you feel the pressure to act normal when cfs hits compounding the isolation for both age groups are the feelings of guilt fear and shame that accompany their misdiagnoses i’m sure that if you have cfs you’ve been in the depths of physical suffering and had someone say “but you look perfectly healthy” it is so disheartening to feel unwell and hear from practitioners friends or family that there’s nothing wrong with you chronic fatigue syndrome is real it’s the epsteinbarr virus as we’ve seen those with cfs have an elevated viral load of ebv which systematically afflicts the body by creating a neurotoxin that inflames the central nervous system this can eventually weaken the adrenals and digestive system and create the feeling that you have a low battery fibromyalgia we’ve had over six decades of medical denial that fibromyalgia is a legitimate problem now medical communities are finally accepting it as an actual condition the best explanation doctors are given by the establishment though is that fibromyalgia is overactive nerves what this really translates to is…no one has a clue it’s not the doctors’ fault there’s no magic book they receive that tells them what will help their fibromyalgia patients or what is genuinely causing their pain the medical system is still years from discovering the illness’s true root—because it’s viral and it takes place at a nerve level that medical tools currently can’t detect those suffering from fibromyalgia are under a very real and debilitating attack it’s the epsteinbarr virus that is causing this disorder inflaming both the central nervous system and nerves throughout the body which creates ongoing pain sensitivity to touch severe fatigue and a host of other issues tinnitus tinnitus or ringing in the ear is usually caused by ebv getting into the inner ear’s nerve channel called the labyrinth the ringing is the result of the virus inflaming and vibrating the labyrinth and the vestibulocochlear nerve vertigo and meniere’s disease vertigo and meniere’s disease are often attributed by doctors to calcium crystals or stones becoming disrupted in the inner ear however most chronic cases are actually caused by ebv’s neurotoxin inflaming the vagus nerve other symptoms anxiety dizziness chest tightness chest pain esophageal spasms and asthma can also be caused by ebv inflaming the vagus nerve insomnia and tingling and numbness in hands and feet can be caused by phrenic nerves becoming perpetually inflamed by ebv and heart palpitations can result from buildup of ebv’s poisonous virus corpses and byproduct in the heart’s mitral valve if you have ebv or suspect you do you may find the virus in stage four beyond frustrating take comfort if you take the right steps—which medical communities don’t know about yet but which are covered at the end of this chapter—you can recover rebuild your immune system return to a normal state again and regain control of your life types of epsteinbarras i’ve noted earlier there are over 60 varieties of the epsteinbarr virus that number is so large because ebv has existed for well over 100 years it’s had generations of people to move through mutating and elevating its various hybrids and strains in that time the strains can be organized into six groups of escalating severity with roughly ten types per group ebv group 1 is the oldest and mildest these versions of the virus typically take years even decades to transition from one stage to another their effects might not be noticeable until you’re in your 70s or 80s and then result in little more than back pain they might even remain in your organs and never reach stage three or stage four ebv group 2 moves from stage to stage a bit quicker than group 1 you might notice symptoms in your 50s or 60s these varieties may partially linger in the thyroid and send only some of their virus cells out to inflame nerves resulting in relatively mild nerve inflammation the only variety of ebv that medical communities are aware of is in this group ebv group 3 will transition between stages faster than group 2 so its symptoms might be noticeable around age 40 also these viruses fully complete stage four—that is they entirely leave the thyroid to latch onto nerves viruses in this group can cause a variety of ills including joint pain fatigue heart palpitations tinnitus and vertigo ebv group 4 will create noticeable problems as early as age 30 its aggressive actions on nerves can result in symptoms associated with fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome brain fog confusion anxiety moodiness and everything caused by groups 1 to 3 this group can also create symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder even if a person never underwent any trauma beyond getting inflamed by the virus ebv group 5 will create noticeable issues as early as age 20 this is an especially nasty form of the virus because it strikes just when a young person is setting out to start an independent life it can create all the problems of group 4 and it feeds off negative emotions such as fear and worry doctors who can’t find anything wrong and perceive these patients as young and healthy often declare “it’s all in your head” and send them to psychologists to convince them what’s actually happening in their bodies isn’t real unless that is a patient happens upon a doctor who’s up on the lyme disease trend in which case the patient will probably walk away with a lyme misdiagnosis the worst type however is ebv group 6 which can strike hard even in young children in addition to everything group 5 does group 6 can create symptoms so severe that they’re misdiagnosed as leukemia viral meningitis lupus and more plus it suppresses the immune system which can lead to a wide variety of symptoms including rashes weakness in the limbs and severe nerve pain healing from the epsteinbarr virusbecause it’s very easy to catch and hard to detect and can cause a number of mysterious symptoms you might understandably find the epsteinbarr virus overwhelming and its effects disheartening the good news is that if you carefully and patiently follow the steps detailed in this section and in part iv of the book you can heal you can recover your immune system free yourself of ebv rejuvenate your body gain full control over your health and move on with your life how long the process takes varies for each individual and depends on myriad factors some people conquer the virus in as little as three months however a more typical period is a full year and there are some people who need 18 months or more to destroy ebv healing foods certain fruits and vegetables can help your body rid itself of ebv and heal from its effects the following are the best ones to incorporate into your diet listed in rough order of importance try to eat at least three of these foods per day—the more the better—rotating your consumption so that in a given week or two you get all of these foods into your system wild blueberries help restore the central nervous system

her firm and made a point of going to work throughout her pregnancy leaving only when she was about to go into labor after giving birth michelle instantly fell in love with her new son jordan she couldn’t have been happier i have it all now she thought a career i love and a family i love even more but michelle’s bright future started to dim when she was struck with a fatigue she couldn’t shake no matter how many vitamins she took or how much she exercised she felt rundown all the time so michelle visited her doctor after giving her a physical he dismissed her concerns “you look fine to me it’s natural for a new baby to be exhausting just get more sleep and don’t worry about it”michelle took care to sleep more after another week she felt worse than ever suspecting a postpregnancy issue michelle went to see her obgyn this doctor drew her blood for a number of tests including several for thyroid disease when the lab results came in the obgyn correctly diagnosed michelle as having hashimoto’s—ie her thyroid was no longer producing the level of hormones needed michelle was put on thyroid medication to get her hormone levels back to normal this made her feel a little better…though not quite as well as she had before her pregnancy she’d been aiming to return to work a month after having her son and now she had to postpone those plans after about six months michelle’s fatigue was back—and much more severe that’s when michelle’s troubles really began soon she had trouble taking care of jordan matthew agreed to help out until she felt better instead michelle grew worse on top of being tired she started to feel aches and pains especially in her joints michelle returned to her obgyn who ran another set of tests the lab results showed nothing wrong thanks to the thyroid medication michelle was continuing to take her thyroid levels were perfect so were all her vitamin and mineral levels the obgyn was baffled suspecting that michelle’s symptoms were related to her thyroid condition the obgyn referred michelle to a top endocrinologist a doctor who specializes in hormonal issues the specialist conducted a thorough thyroid profile and tested michelle’s other hormone levels from a variety of angles he ended up telling michelle she had “mild adrenal fatigue”there was some small truth to that michelle’s adrenal glands were being strained by the epsteinbarr virus which her pregnancy had triggered and which was now inflaming her thyroid the endocrinologist told michelle to take it easy and avoid stress on his recommendation michelle handed off the freelance consulting projects she’d been working on from home in reality michelle’s job had nothing to do with her condition her source of stress wasn’t her work but the illness that was eating away at her life…and her seeming helplessness to understand it or do anything about it michelle continued to get worse her knees flared up and swelled making it difficult to walk she bought knee supports…and decided to pursue help more aggressively michelle’s intuition told her an invader was present in her body so she went to see an infectious disease specialist this would be precisely the right thing to do—if infectious disease doctors actually knew how to recognize and treat past infections of ebv unfortunately they don’t so after running an exhausting battery of tests and noticing that michelle had an antibody from a past ebv infection he dismissed it as a problem right away this doctor told her she was physically fit he added that she might be depressed and offered to refer her to a psychiatrist infuriated at being made to feel she was crazy for trying to address what she deeply sensed was a real physical problem michelle painfully rose and strode out of the room with increasing desperation michelle now visited doctors across the spectrum they put her through ultrasounds xrays mris ct scans and loads of blood tests she was told she had candida fibromyalgia ms lupus lyme disease and rheumatoid arthritis none of it was right she was put on immunosuppressant drugs antibiotics and loads of different supplements none of the treatments helped michelle became an insomniac suffered heart palpitations and developed chronic vertigo that caused dizziness and nausea she dropped from 140 to 115 pounds soon michelle was spending most of her days in bed she was wasting away her husband matthew was terrified after michelle had spent four years exploring all other options and based on the recommendation of the naturopath michelle visited matthew called my office as a last resort when my assistant answered matthew burst into tears “what’s wrong” she asked he replied “my wife is dying”for our first appointment matthew planned to do most of the talking while sitting next to michelle who was in bed less than a minute after matthew started telling me michelle’s story i interrupted him “it’s okay” i said “spirit tells me it’s an aggressive form of the epsteinbarr virus”the virus’s neurotoxin was inflaming all of michelle’s joints her insomnia and foot pain were the result of her phrenic nerves being perpetually inflamed her vertigo stemmed from ebv’s neurotoxin inflaming her vagus nerve and her heart palpitations were being caused by buildup of ebv virus corpses and viral byproduct in her mitral valve“don’t worry” i told michelle and matthew “i know how to beat this virus”michelle exclaimed with as much joyful energy as she could muster “i knew it was a virus”it was the first critical step in her recovery i recommended a blend of celery juice and papaya which is great for boosting someone in michelle’s condition eg low weight not being able to eat high number of virus cells i followed that up with the recommendations for healing in this chapter including a list of helpful supplements as well as the recommendations from part iv “how to finally heal”the cleanse diet immediately stopped feeding michelle’s ebv within a week there was a noticeable reduction of the swelling in her knees the llysine shut down michelle’s vertigo and the other supplements started killing virus cells andor dampening the production of new ones in three months michelle was regularly up and walking again in nine months she was once again working parttime at her challenging corporate job and in 18 months michelle’s pain and suffering were just a memory—she’d taken control over ebv today michelle has fully recovered her health she’s returned to juggling her job and her family energetically and happily an end to cfs confinement cynthia was a mother of two shortly after her youngest sophie was born cynthia began experiencing fatigue it took everything she had to push through the day and she relied on increasing her coffee intake just to function within a few years she had to quit her parttime job at a clothing store because long naps were taking up her afternoons she needed the rest so she could be strong enough to meet her kids at the school bus make dinner and help them with their homework cynthia noticed herself becoming irritable and arguments arose often with her husband mark who didn’t understand why she was tired all the time after all the tests that cynthia’s doctor had run indicated nothing was wrong the doctor said she was healthy and concluded that maybe she was just unhappy or depressed this made cynthia want to walk out of the doctor’s office without another word any blue mood she experienced was because she was tired all the time and could barely function—not the other way around yet her husband sided with the doctor and became increasingly resentful toward her the ongoing stress put cynthia on overload life felt impossible to keep up with she couldn’t find the energy to brush her hair and the mere thought of running the vacuum cleaner or washing the dishes exhausted her from the outside it looked like she was giving up on life mark got angrier—he was talking separation now “i work too long and hard at the office all day to worry about taking care of things at home” he said “this is supposed to be your department”cynthia felt more pressure than ever to get better but the worries about her marriage and what would happen to her children put her fatigue at an alltime high she could barely drive to the grocery store or make dinner for her family all she could do was lie in bed or on the couch this is what a moderatetosevere case of undiagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome can look like when cynthia called me her life had fallen apart her husband had left her and her daughter sophie now seven years old and her son ryan age nine had lost their family unit what her doctor had misconstrued as a psychiatric condition was an actual physical problem epsteinbarr virus the same story applies to far too many women i set to work informing cynthia that she had a case of ebv that her doctor had missed with an emphasis on getting her viral load under control and addressing nutritional deficiencies i laid out the background on cfs that i described earlier in this chapter and i explained the protocols outlined here and in part iv like her life depended on it—because it did—cynthia followed spirit’s advice slowly cynthia began to get better her adrenals recovered normal function and her stamina returned once again she could tend to her children run errands keep the house in shape and do her hair—all without the gallons of coffee she used to rely on cynthia finally had the energy to return to work too after witnessing this change in his wife mark called cynthia and asked her out to dinner—his mother would look after the kids he said when they arrived at the fancy restaurant which had long ago been the deli where they had flirted as college students mark told cynthia he’d called ahead and ordered a special healingfood meal for her—and that he’d ordered the same for himself out of solidarity over sundriedtomato hummus and vegetable nori rolls mark didn’t exactly cry some things would always stay the same but he did have to dab at his eyes as he apologized for how he’d behaved cynthia was quiet then answered with a playful smile “you can make it up to me”after a few weeks of testing the waters—cynthia wanted to make sure mark didn’t just want her back as a security blanket and housekeeper—they moved back in together as a family mark now wakes up early every saturday morning so he can get to the farmers’ market before they run out of salad greens fibro pain forgotten stacy a 41yearold parttime receptionist in a doctors’ office had been married to rob who worked at a car dealership for over 15 years she never had the energy to keep up with the outings rob planned with their daughters in fact she couldn’t remember ever feeling that well she always felt slightly achy and more tired than her friends seemed to be and since she’d given birth to her second child who was now 11 the fatigue and muscle soreness had been more pronounced one weekend while rob and the kids were at a museum she went for a longer walk than usual—she’d decided to push herself to lose some unwanted weight she’d gained in the last few years afterward she noticed an unusual pain in her left knee thinking back to her college basketball coach’s advice to “walk it off” she tried to ignore it it didn’t go away two weeks later she scheduled time for an exam with a doctor at her office stacy limped out of the appointment with a prescription for an mri—which revealed nothing visibly wrong with her knee because stacy’s balance was off from leaning on her “good” leg she found herself tripping easily—stairs curbs and corners of rugs had become major obstacles then her right knee started to hurt even though it hadn’t gotten injured in any of her falls and exams showed nothing amiss stacy’s worry escalated to fear—something was really wrong the doctors in her office ruled out rheumatoid arthritis though and guessed that the extra 30 pounds stacy was carrying were to blame for her pain soon stacy started to hurt in other places now she couldn’t raise her hands over her head without her arms and neck hurting she was unable to work anymore and depression set in as she started to spend hours at home on the sofa at night rob would make dinner for the family and send their daughter to serve stacy her plate of food on the couch a specialist concluded that stacy had fibromyalgia when stacy asked what caused it the doctor responded “we don’t know it’s what we think is oversensitive nerves this should help though” she handed stacy a prescription for a medicine popular for treating depression and fibromyalgia pain at her next visit to the specialist when stacy reported no progress the doctor referred her to me after i explained what her fibromyalgia really was that the real cause was the epsteinbarr virus and that it had been in her system since childhood stacy recalled having a bout of mononucleosis at age 14 she finally felt she had a real answer she understood now that poor diet nutritional deficiencies and increased stress had triggered the formerly dormant ebv to surface as fibromyalgia not knowing what was wrong with her—the powerlessness—had been scarier than knowing the true cause the mystery of her mystery illness had been the hardest part now she had direction and felt confident in her ability to heal within six months of our first call following the same suggestions i describe in this chapter and part iv “how to finally heal” she was free from fibromyalgia back to work and living life again she told me she felt happier and healthier than ever and that she’d planned the next family outing—apple picking at an organic orchard knowledge is powerthe first step of the healing process is to know the cause of your suffering is epsteinbarr—and to realize it’s not your fault your ebvrelated health problems aren’t the result of anything you did wrong or any moral failing you didn’t make this happen and you’re in no way to blame you did not manifest this you did not attract this you’re a vibrant wonderful human being and you have every godgiven right to heal you deserve to heal much of ebv’s effectiveness stems from hiding in the shadows so that neither you nor your body’s immune system can sense its presence this not only allows it to commit its mayhem unchecked it leads to negative emotions such as guilt fear and helplessness now things are different for you if you have ebv you now have a mindbody understanding of what’s causing your health problems from this alone your immune system will strengthen and the virus will naturally weaken so when it comes to fighting ebv in a very real sense knowledge is power for over twentyfive years anthony william has devoted his life to helping people overcome and
