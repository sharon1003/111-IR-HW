ecigarettes vaping may not be as safe as smokers think research suggests study of mice finds that ecigarettes generate free radical toxins and may harm the lungs and immune system press association wed 4 feb 2015 1516 est1856 estthis article is over 3 years old8389 312research conducted on mice suggests that ecigarettes generate toxic chemicals similar to those found in tobacco and may harm the lungs and immune system photograph yui mokpaecigarettes generate toxic chemicals similar to those found in tobacco and may harm the lungs and immune system new research suggests the findings from a study of mice indicate that vaping may not be as safe an alternative to smoking tobacco as many people believe in the experiments mice exposed to ecigarette fumes suffered mild damage to their lungs and became far more susceptible to respiratory infections their immune responses to both viruses and bacteria were weakened by such an extent that two out of ten animals died scientists also found that ecigarette vapour contained free radical toxins similar to those found in cigarette smoke and air pollution – although at around 1 of the level of conventional cigarettes free radicals are highlyreactive molecules that can damage dna and cell membranes this came as a surprise to the researchers because ecigarette vapour does not contain combustion products or tar released by tobacco burning the findings will be a concern for users who have moved off tobacco to a healthier alternative there are an estimated 13 million ecigarette smokers in the uk and the rapidlygrowing market is expected to be worth £340m this year professor shyam biswai from johns hopkins university in the us who led the research published in the online journal public library of science one said “our findings suggest that ecigarettes are not neutral in terms of the effects on the lungs“we have observed that they increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections in the mouse models this warrants further study in susceptible individuals such as copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder patients who have switched from cigarettes to ecigarettes or to new users of ecigarettes who may have never used cigarettes”for two weeks mice were exposed to ecigarette vapour in a chamber in amounts equivalent to the doses inhaled by humans puffs from menthol ecigarettes entered the chamber every 10 seconds and the mice were exposed twice a day for one and half hours the animals were then infected with pneumonia bacteria or a strain of flu virus to test how well their immune systems could cope compared with other nonexposed mice they were much more likely to develop a weakened immune response coauthor dr thomas sussan also from johns hopkins said “ecigarette vapour alone produced mild effects on the lungs including inflammation and protein damage“however when this exposure was followed by a bacterial or viral infection the harmful effects of ecigarette exposure became even more pronounced“the ecigarette exposure inhibited the ability of mice to clear the bacteria from their lungs and the viral infection led to increased weight loss and death indicative of an impaired immune response”the study is thought to be the first to investigate an animal’s response to ecigarette inhalation ecigarettes generated just 1 of the amount of free radicals in tobacco smoke but this still posed a potential health risk said the researchers“we were surprised by how high that number was considering that ecigarettes do not produce combustion products” said dr sussan “granted it’s 100 times lower than cigarette smoke but it’s still a high number of free radicals that can potentially damage cells”ecigarette sales in the us are expected to overtake sales of cigarettes in the next 10 years in 2013 more than 250000 american teenagers who had never smoked a cigarette reported using ecigarettes topics ecigarettes smoking news reuse this contentmost viewed in ussex for rent … the rogue landlords who offer a ‘free’ room in return for ‘favours’trump invited putin to white house during congratulatory call last month trump claims caravans of migrants in mexico mean us is being stolentexas protest planned for unarmed black man killed by police officer tiangong1 crash chinese space station comes down in pacific ocean
