speaker but that is used in the locale of that person in contrast a foreign language is a language that is learned in an area where that language is not generally spoken by the community as a whole some languages often called auxiliary languages one of them being english are used primarily as second languages or lingua francas more informally a second language can be said to be any language learned in addition to ones native language especially in the context of secondlanguage acquisition that is learning a new foreign language a persons first language is not necessarily their dominant language the one they use most or are most comfortable with for example the canadian census defines first language for its purposes as the first language learned in childhood and still spoken

blackboard used in class at harvard shows students  efforts at placing the diaeresis and acute accent diacritics used in the spanish orthography main article secondlanguage acquisition the distinction between acquiring and learning was made by stephen krashen 1982 as part of his monitor theory according to krashen the acquisition of a language is a natural process whereas learning a language is a conscious one in the former the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations in the latter error correction is present as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language not all educators in second language agree to this distinction however the study of how a second language is learnedacquired is referred to as secondlanguage acquisition sla research in sla focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language and a knowledge of secondlanguage acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults spada  lightbown p 115 sla has been influenced by both linguistic and psychological theories one of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a device or module of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge many psychological theories on the other hand hypothesize that cognitive mechanisms responsible for much of human learning process language other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies which examine if l1 findings can be transferred to l2 learning verbal behaviour the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response morpheme studies behaviourism error analysis stages and order of acquisition structuralism approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics 1st language acquisition studies contrastive analysis approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities and interlanguage which describes l2 learners’ language as a rulegoverned dynamic system mitchell myles 2004 these theories have all influenced secondlanguage teaching and pedagogy there are many different methods of secondlanguage teaching many of which stem directly from a particular theory common methods are the grammartranslation method the direct method the audiolingual method clearly influenced by audiolingual research and the behaviourist approach the silent way suggestopedia community language learning the total physical response method and the communicative approach highly influenced by krashen’s theories doggett 1994 some of these approaches are more popular than others and are viewed to be more effective most language teachers do not use one singular style but will use a mix in their teaching this provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed effect of age  editthe defining difference between a first language l1 and a second language l2 is the age the person learned the language for example linguist eric lenneberg used second language to mean a language consciously acquired or used by its speaker after puberty in most cases people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language these views are closely associated with the critical period hypothesis 1 2 3 4in acquiring an l2 hyltenstam 1992 found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cutoff point for bilinguals to achieve nativelike proficiency after that age l2 learners could get nearnativelikeness but their language would while consisting of few actual errors have enough errors to set them apart from the l1 group the inability of some subjects to achieve nativelike proficiency must be seen in relation to the age of onset ao “the age of 6 or 8 does seem to be an important period in distinguishing between nearnative and nativelike ultimate attainment more specifically it may be suggested that ao interacts with frequency and intensity of language use” hyltenstam 1992 p 364 later hyltenstam  abrahamsson 2003 modified their age cutoffs to argue that after childhood in general it becomes more and more difficult to acquire nativelikeness but that there is no cutoff point in particular furthermore they discuss a number of cases where a nativelike l2 was acquired during adulthood as we are learning more and more about the brain there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty that is the time that accents start before a child goes through puberty the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication whereas after puberty the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth as far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in sla is concerned krashen long and scarcella say that people who encounter foreign language in early age begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult however when it comes to the relationship between age and rate sla “adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children where time and exposure are held constant”  krashen long scarcella 573 also “older children acquire faster than younger children do again in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant” 573 in other words adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education as for the fluency it is better to do foreign language education at an early age but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “weak identification” billiet maddens and beerten 241 such issue leads to a double sense of national belonging that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to brian a jacob multicultural education affects students relations attitudes and behaviors jacob 364 and as children learn more and more foreign languages children start to adapt and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made” pratt 35 due to such factors learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one’s perspective of his or her native country similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency  editspeed  editthis section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and

language will never become fully nativelike in it although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved 5 however children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of vocabulary and a few grammatical structures correction  editerror correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language instruction may affect the rate of learning but the stages remain the same adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not in the first language children do not respond to systematic correction furthermore children who have limited input still acquire the first language in the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students’ errors in the 1950s and 60s the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs little thought went to students’ feelings or selfesteem in regards to this constant correction russell 2009 in the 1970s dulay and burt’s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a predetermined inalterable order and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this russell 2009 in this same decade terrell 1977 did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students russell 2009 he contested that the affective side of students and their selfesteem were equally important to the teaching process russell 2009 a few years later in the 1980s the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students’ learning it was hindering them russell 2009 the main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them stephen krashen was a big proponent in this handsoff approach to error correction russell 2009 the 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the sla process at this time more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students in 1998 lyster concluded that “recasts” when the teacher repeats a student’s incorrect utterance with the correct version are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction russell 2009 his studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors russell 2009 mackey gas and mc donough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student’s active participation in the corrective processes 6depth of knowledge  editlearners in both languages have knowledge that goes beyond the input they received in that they are able to construct correct utterances eg phrases sentences and questions that they have never seen or heard before success  editsuccess in language learning can be measured in two ways likelihood and quality first language learners will be successful in both measurements it is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions they will be fully successful for second language learners success is not guaranteed for one learners may become fossilized or stuck as it were with ungrammatical items fossilization occurs when language errors become a permanent feature see canale  swain 1980 johnson 1992 selinker 1972 and selinker and lamendella 1978 the difference between learners may be significant finally as noted elsewhere l2 learners rarely achieve complete nativelike control of the second language similarities and differences between l2 and l1  clarification neededl2 l1speed na acquisition is rapid stages systematic stages of

possible fossilization  inevitable success 2 rarely fully successful successful being successful in learning a second language can seem like a daunting task research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others stern 1975 rubin 1975 and reiss 1985 are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject they have worked to determine what qualities make a good language learner mollica neussel 1997 some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication he also monitors himself and his learning has a strong drive to communicate and has a good ear and good listening skills mollica neussel 1997 foreign language  edita german student learning french english 15 billion learners french 82 million learners and chinese

massachusetts in pedagogy and sociolinguistics a distinction is made between second language and foreign language the latter being learned for use in an area where that language is not generally spoken arguably english in countries such as india pakistan bangladesh the philippines the nordic countries and the netherlands can be considered a second language for many of its speakers because they learn it young and use it regularly indeed in southern asia it is the official language of the courts government and business the same can be said for french in algeria morocco and tunisia although—as with english in the scandinavian countries and the netherlands—french is nominally not an official language in any of these arabicspeaking countries in practice french is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries and public signs are normally printed in both arabic and french a similar phenomenon exists in postsoviet states such as the ukraine uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan where russian can be considered a second language and there are large russophone communities there in china with the exception perhaps of hong kong  however english must be considered a foreign language due to the lack of a number of characteristics such as historical links media opportunities for use and similar vocabulary likewise french would be considered a foreign language in romania and moldova this is despite romanian and french being romance languages unlike chinese and english which come from two different language families this is also despite romania and moldova
