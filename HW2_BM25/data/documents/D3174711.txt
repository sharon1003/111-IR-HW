food waste is a bigger problem than you thinkby rp siegel on friday oct 31st 2014share food waste is a horrendous problem in this country that no one seems to want to talk about yet food is the one product type that everyone consumes and while a surprising number of people don’t have it those that do are shockingly wasteful as recently as 2012 close to 50 million people experienced food insecurity not in africa or bangladesh but right here in the usa worldwide that number is over 1 billion people that makes the fact that somewhere between a quarter and a third of all food produced worldwide is never eaten all the more shocking america is the worst offender by far here in the states the portion of food production that goes to waste is closer to 40 percent a report by the national consumer league called wasted solutions to the american food waste problem came out last week it maps the magnitude of the problem and as the title suggests offers a number of practical suggestions let’s start with a look at the problem most of the food waste in the developing world occurs in the supply chain either the farmers suffer crop failures due to weather insects or disease or they are unable to harvest the crops efficiently due to inadequate equipment inefficient transportation and lack of refrigerated trucks lead to more losses in transit consumers despite the lack of refrigeration waste less food since they have so little to begin with and they value it the situation is inverted in developed countries consumers waste more food american consumers waste 10 times as much food as their counterparts in southeast asia why do we waste so much well one reason is because it’s become so cheap americans today spend only 6 percent of their total household expenditures on food back in 1982 that number was 12 percent but as the saying goes perhaps you get what you pay for according to nadya zhexembayeva in her book “ overfished ocean strategy ” the nutritional value of american food has been declining dramatically a study of 43 vegetable crops over the period from 19501999 shows declines of 20 percent in vitamin c 15 percent in iron and 38 percent in riboflavin american food waste has risen by 50 percent since the seventies at the same time that prices and nutrition have declined today’s american family of four throws away anywhere from 1350 to 2275 worth of food each year put that all together and we are looking at 165 billion as a nation being wasted the energy water and land implications of this are enormous in essence this means that at a time of increasing resource scarcity 20 percent of our land 4 percent of our energy and 25 percent of our water is used to produce food that ends up being thrown out unfortunately the story does not end once that wasted food is grown after the plates are scrapped and refrigerators cleaned out the food in the trash bin must be hauled to the landfill costing more energy where it ultimately breaks down into methane a highly potent greenhouse gas one study in the u k found that eliminating all food waste from landfills would be equivalent to taking 1 in 4 cars off the road one has to wonder if the true environmental cost of our food were priced in would we be so willing to waste it hunger in the streets will not simply be solved by reducing waste but the report tells us that if we could reduce our level of waste by 30 percent that would be enough food to feed our 50 million hungry if only we could get it to them so much for the bad news though it surely represents opportunities for those with a mind to address them let’s take a look at some of the solutions addressing the food waste issue requires a multifaceted approach first retailers need to move away from the buyonegetonefree mentality that might be a good way to move product but much of it gets moved right into the landfill with a brief stopover in the home that used to be considered acceptable as long as the company was generating profits those days will soon be gone attitudes can also change about food that is less attractive but still perfectly safe to eat perishable foods near expiration can be sold at marked down prices where if used promptly it can provide excellent value more retailers can participate in programs to donate overstock foods to those who are hungry but the biggest opportunities are with consumers perhaps the biggest barrier is consumer attitudes because of the fall in food prices food is not valued as it was in earlier times people need better information about how to store foods properly and expiration dates must be clearly labeled labels should indicate the date at which food will become unusable perhaps tomorrow’s refrigerators will scan the inventory as they are being stocked and issue reminders such as this one “expiring tomorrow milk and cheese use it while it’s still good”public education programs aimed at reducing food waste have been quite effective in europe the u s epa has a food recovery hierarchy that spells out the most effective use of unusable food — starting with donating it and ending with composting rochester new yorkbased epiphergy followed this hierarchy in its extensive food waste recovery program middle stages include producing animal feed followed by energy cities can help by providing composting services and also by charging for waste collection by the pound instead ofusing a flat rate that would encourage people to think twice before throwing things away these are all small steps but when people understand the larger picture that ties them all together it changes their attitude and their behavior experiences in europe have proven that out we need to raise awareness here and set ambitious targets for food waste reduction and we need to do it

true do they think nobody bothers to check the facts raise your hand if you think 40 of the food we produce in the us is thrown away if your hand is raised you are clearly not a critical thinker ok what do you think they mean by 50 million people suffered from “food insecurity” well included in that definition is anyone who at anytime during the yearreports of reduced quality variety or desirability of diet but with little or no indication of reduced food intake by making the definition that broad the make the number meaningless the actual number not reported that would have meaning would be more along the traditional definition reports of multiple indications of skipping meals low quality food and reduced food intake log in to reply david  ncp november 2 2014 at 742 amhere are the facts on food waste attributed from a notexactlyliberal tome httpwwwforbescomsitesbethhoffman20130207whatfooddowethrowouthowtostopfoodwasteathome and i certainly agree that obesity is a huge issue as well–log in to reply arthur doucette november 2 2014 at 806 am except they don’t actually specify what that entails do they they don’t actually do anything to specify how those numbers were generated do they consider what the fao considers as waste for seafood fish1 discards are the portion of total catch which is thrown away or slipped it comprises the following componentsa species which are intended to be caught but get spoilt and rendered unfit for consumption by the act of catching these discards are food lossb species which are intended to be caught but do not meet the regulatory or quality standards such as size these discards are food loss see few would consider these waste but they are part of the definition being used here’s a challenge for you find the original source of these numbers and then see if you agree with the method and assumptions good luck log in to reply rod averbuch november 4 2014 at 1024 am here is a link to united nations report about world food waste levels httpwwwfaoorgnewsstoryenitem74192icod here is a link to bbc regarding the food waste levels reported by tesco in the uk httpwwwbbccomnewsuk24603008there are many more log in to reply arthur doucette november 4 2014 at 438 pm so what does the fao actually show food waste is more a problem in industrialized countries most often caused by both retailers and consumers throwing perfectly edible foodstuffs into the trash per capita waste by consumers is between 95115 kg a year in europe and north america so 100 kg per person per year so 220 lbs per person per year so 6 lbs per person per year so assuming 4 meals a day largest meal considered to be equal to 2 meals that means you are wasting about 2 oz of food at breakfast and lunch and 4 ounces at dinner clearly not a huge problem log in to reply rod averbuch october 31 2014 at 1108 am the large amount of fresh food waste is a loselose situation for the environment the struggling families in today’s tough economy and for the food retailers there is no single cure or silver bullet for food waste reduction therefore we should address the food waste problem in every link in our food supply chain for example the excess inventory of fresh perishables close to their expiration on supermarket shelves combined with the consumer “last in first out” shopping behavior might be the weakest link of the fresh food supply chain the new open gs1 data bar standard enables applications that encourage efficient consumer shopping by offering him automatic and dynamic purchasing incentives for fresh perishables approaching their expiration dates before they end up in a landfill the “end grocery waste” app which is based on the open gs1 data bar standard encourages efficient consumer shopping behavior that maximizes grocery retailer revenue makes fresh food affordable for all families and effectively reduces the global carbon footprint log in to reply arthur doucette november 2 2014 at 812 am there is no great amount of food loss if you think so provide reliable data to support that statement assertion is not equal to proof regardless of who asserts it log in to reply rod averbuch november 4 2014

doucette thinks that no food is wasted here and is asking for facts to back up the argument i notice that he is not offering any facts to back up his position there is a link in the story to my original source if you open that you will see their sources in the references section specifically their data about food waste in the us came from this source httpwwwplosoneorgarticleinfo3adoi2f1013712fjournalpone0007940 their study was funded by the nih log in to reply arthur doucette november 4 2014 at 441 pm i didn’t say no food is wasted lie much as to that study shirely you jestthe latter was estimated using a validated mathematical model of metabolism relating body weight to the amount of food eaten so they estimated the weight of the population vs estimates of the amount of food grown and used the difference to claim that we are wasting food how obtuse can you get log in to replydave shires november 19 2014 at 1135 am angry little rascal
