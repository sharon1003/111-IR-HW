salgar santo tomas son bou son xoriguer playa de fornells arenal den castell arenal d’en castell hugs the cliffs on menorca’s rugged northern coast the surrounding woodland gives the place a relaxed feel while the waterfront bars and restaurants add a lively buzz to the evenings it’s the golden sandy beach here though that pulls in so many repeat visitors binibeca binibeca sits on the pretty southeast coast of menorca it’s a compilation of three different places stretching from cala torret through binibeca nou – where you’ve got a lovely little sandy beach – and onto whitewashed charmer

relaxed town – sits on the west coast of menorca where the sunsets are legendary it has a good mix of shops bars and restaurants scattered around the place – with more at neighbouring cala santandria and between the two there are some great little coves to relax in cala canutells set in a steep gorge on menorca’s southern tip this onetime fishing hamlet retains its rustic feel it’s a cosy destination home to lowrise sugar cube villas and hotels and not much else but with the island capital mahon just a 15minute drive away you’ve no need for anything more cala galdana cala galdana known affectionately as the queen of the calas is one of the most picturesque resorts in menorca its a small familyfriendly setup on the south coast of the island built around a perfectly symmetrical horseshoeshaped cove the middle of the village is sliced in half by the algendar gorge which has a tiny port crisscrossed by wooden gangways cala dalcaufar one beach one bar one restaurant – no wonder cala alcaufar is the goto place to get away from it all set on menorca’s southeast coast there’s just one big relaxed vibe here and that extends to its equally chilledout neighbours s’algar and punta prima when more of a buzz is needed the capital mahon is on hand with chic tapas joints and lots and lots of shops calan bosch cala’n bosch on menorca’s southwest coast was purposebuilt in the eighties it’s an easygoing place with whitewashed villas and a small golden beach the real focal point though is the marina ringed with shops bars and restaurants – it’s the goto place for lazy lunches that transforms into a lively nighttime hub calan forcat this purposebuilt town first popped its head above the radar in the eighties it teamed up with close neighbours cala’n blanes and los delfines and together they woke up this sleepy part of menorca’s west coast it may not be buzzing by ibiza’s standards but the british bars and restaurants keep the nightlife lively calan porter as far as settings go cala’n porter has got itself a beauty on menorca’s south coast it sits high up on cliffs looking down onto a pretty bay in a protected nature area you’ve got a fairly small place here – you can walk from end to end in 20 minutes – and most of the shops bars and restaurants are right in the centre it’s handily close to the capital mahon too ciutadella ciutadella is set on the western edge of menorca with its cobbled streets clustered around a smart yachtfilled harbour it was the island’s capital until the early 18thcentury and the city is crammed full of stately buildings and grand summer mansions built in its heyday es castell es castell is a charming seaside town on menorca’s southeast coast it’s a relaxed peaceful place that revolves around its harbours – cales fonts and cala corb these two spots are where you’ll find bars rustic eateries and souvenir shops selling ornate ceramics along both harbours there are views across a sweeping bay while a 15minute drive brings you to menorca’s capital mahon mahon menorca’s capital mahon sits proudly on the east coast of the island it’s been doing the job since 1721 so it comes with lots of elegant 18thcentury mansions among the churches and gothic cathedral that’s just the sights though mahon loves its shopping and it’s really into its nightlife too so you’ll be spoilt for choice in terms of restaurants bars and clubs and there are some fantastic beaches nearby as well punta prima punta prima on the southeast coast of menorca is one of the oldest holiday towns on the island you’d think it would’ve got too big for its boots by now but instead the place has kept its traditional charm and laidback attitude and it’s still as popular as ever thanks to the whitesand beach not to mention its easy access to the capital mahon salgar the town of s’algar is nestled in the southeast corner of menorca next to punta prima on the map it was one of the first purposebuilt resorts on the island but despite being an oldtimer it’s managed to retain its sleepy fishing village roots there’s little here aside from a handful of lowrise hotels and villas which sidle up to a palmlined waterfront santo tomas santo tomas is a small laidback town on menorca’s south coast it’s a compact place with just one main street really which is handy for getting around the modest selection of bars and restaurants sizewise the beach is another matter – you’ve got a very long strip of sand here as for exploring you’re in a great position for days out to the capital mahon son bou set on menorca’s south coast son bou starts on a wooded hillside and sweeps down to a nature reserve that lines the longest beach on the island it’s a familyfriendly place with shops bars and restaurants all conveniently placed together in a couple of commercial centres and from son bou you’re in a great position for visiting ciutadella and the capital mahon son xoriguer son xoriguer is a peaceful little place on the southwestern tip of menorca it comes with a very relaxed vibe from the clutch of shops bars and restaurants to the mini train that gets you around it’s a different story down at the beach where watersports rule as for getting to know the rest of the island you’re within easy reach of former capital ciutadella playa de fornells set on menorca’s rugged northern shores this smart resort hugs the hillside overlooking the horseshoeshaped bay of cala tirant it’s a relatively undiscovered corner of the island so easygoings the watchword here with just a handful of goslow bars and restaurants
