section 164 gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are reciprocally regulated gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are coordinated so that within a cell one pathway is relatively inactive while the other is highly active if both sets of reactions were highly active at the same time the net result would be the hydrolysis of four nucleotide triphosphates two atp plus two gtp per reaction cycle both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are highly exergonic under cellular conditions and so there is no thermodynamic barrier to such simultaneous activity however the amounts and activities of the distinctive enzymes of each pathway are controlled so that both pathways are not highly active at the same time the rate of glycolysis is also determined by the concentration of glucose and the rate of gluconeogenesis by the concentrations of lactate and other precursors of glucose the interconversion of fructose 6phosphate and fructose 16bisphosphate is stringently controlled  figure 1630  as discussed in section 1621 amp stimulates phosphofructokinase whereas atp and citrate inhibit it fructose 16bisphosphatase on the other hand is inhibited by amp and activated by citrate a high level of amp indicates that the energy charge is low and signals the need for atp generation conversely high levels of atp and citrate indicate that the energy charge is high and that biosynthetic intermediates are abundant under these conditions glycolysis is nearly switched off and gluconeogenesis is promoted figure 1630reciprocal regulation of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis in the liver the level of fructose 26bisphosphate is high in the fed state and low in starvation another important control is the inhibition of pyruvate kinase by phosphorylation during starvation morephosphofructokinase and fructose 16bisphosphatase are also reciprocally controlled by fructose 26bisphosphate in the liver  section 1622  the level of f26bp is low during starvation and high in the fed state because of the antagonistic effects of glucagon and insulin on the production and degradation of this signal molecule fructose 26bisphosphate strongly stimulates phosphofructokinase and inhibits fructose 16bisphosphatase hence glycolysis is accelerated and gluconeogenesis is diminished in the fed state during starvation gluconeogenesis predominates because the level of f26bp is very low glucose formed by the liver under these conditions is essential for the viability of brain and muscle the interconversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate also is precisely regulated recall that pyruvate kinase is controlled by allosteric effectors and by phosphorylation  section 1623  high levels of atp and alanine which signal that the energy charge is high and that building blocks are abundant inhibit the enzyme in liver conversely pyruvate carboxylase which catalyzes the first step in gluconeogenesis from pyruvate is activated by acetyl co a and inhibited by adp likewise adp inhibits phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase hence gluconeogenesis is favored when the cell is rich in biosynthetic precursors and atp the amounts and the activities of these essential enzymes also are regulated the regulators in this case are hormones hormones affect gene expression primarily by changing the rate of transcription as well as by regulating the degradation of m rna insulin which rises subsequent to eating stimulates the expression of phosphofructokinase pyruvate kinase and the bifunctional enzyme that makes and degrades f26bp glucagon which rises during starvation inhibits the expression of these enzymes and stimulates instead the production of two key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose 16bisphosphatase transcriptional control in eukaryotes is much slower than allosteric control it takes hours or days in contrast with seconds to minutes the richness and complexity of hormonal control are graphically displayed by the promoter of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene which contains regulatory sequences that respond to insulin glucagon glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone  figure 1631  figure 1631the promoter of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene this promoter is approximately 500 bp in length and contains regulatory sequences response elements that mediate the action of several hormones ire insulin response element gre glucocorticoid morego to1641 substrate cycles amplify metabolic signals and produce heat a pair of reactions such as the phosphorylation of fructose 6phosphate to fructose 16bisphosphate and its hydrolysis back to fructose 6phosphate is called a substrate cycle as already mentioned both reactions are not simultaneously fully active in most cells because of reciprocal allosteric controls however the results of isotopelabeling studies have shown that some fructose 6phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose 16bisphosphate in gluconeogenesis there also is a limited degree of cycling in other pairs of opposed irreversible reactions this cycling was regarded as an imperfection in metabolic control and so substrate cycles have sometimes been called futile cycles indeed there are pathological conditions such as malignant hyperthermia in which control is lost and both pathways proceed rapidly with the concomitant generation of heat by the rapid uncontrolled hydrolysis of atp despite such extraordinary circumstances it now seems likely that substrate cycles are biologically important one possibility is that substrate cycles amplify metabolic signals suppose that the rate of conversion of a into b is 100 and of b into a is 90 giving an initial net flux of 10 assume that an allosteric effector increases the a → b rate by 20 to 120 and reciprocally decreases the b → a rate by 20 to 72 the new net flux is 48 and so a 20 change in the rates of the opposing reactions has led to a 380 increase in the net flux in the example shown in figure 1632 this amplification is made possible by the rapid hydrolysis of atp it has been suggested that the flux down the glycolytic pathway may increase 1000fold at the initiation of intense exercise because it seems unlikely that allosteric activation of enzymes alone could explain this increased flux the existence of substrate cycles may partly account for the rapid rise in the rate of glycolysis figure 1632substrate cycle this atpdriven cycle operates at two different rates a small change in the rates of the two opposing reactions results in a large change in the net flux of product b the other potential biological role of substrate cycles is the generation of heat produced by the hydrolysis of atp a striking example is provided by bumblebees which must maintain a thoracic temperature of about 30° c to fly a bumblebee is able to maintain this high thoracic temperature and forage for food even when the ambient temperature is only 10°c because phosphofructokinase and fructose 16bisphosphatase in its flight muscle are simultaneously highly active the continuous hydrolysis of atp generates heat this bisphosphatase is not inhibited by amp which suggests that the enzyme is specially designed for the generation of heat in contrast the honeybee has almost no fructose 16bisphosphatase activity in its flight muscle and consequently cannot fly when the ambient temperature is low go to1642 lactate and alanine formed by contracting muscle are used by other organs lactate produced by active skeletal muscle and erythrocytes is a source of energy for other organs erythrocytes lack mitochondria and can never oxidize glucose completely in contracting skeletal muscle during vigorous exercise the rate at which glycolysis produces pyruvate exceeds the rate at which the citric acid cycle oxidizes it under these conditions moreover the rate of formation of nadh by glycolysis is greater than the rate of its oxidation by aerobic metabolism continued glycolysis depends on the availability of nad  for the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate the accumulation of both nadh and pyruvate is reversed by lactate dehydrogenase which oxidizes nadh to nad  as it reduces pyruvate to lactate  section 1617  however lactate is a dead end in metabolism it must be converted back into pyruvate before it can be metabolized the only purpose of the reduction of pyruvate to lactate is to regenerate nad  so that glycolysis can proceed in active skeletal muscle and erythrocytes the formation of lactate buys time and shifts part of the metabolic burden from muscle to other organs the plasma membrane of most cells contains carriers that render them highly permeable to lactate and pyruvate both substances diffuse out of active skeletal muscle into the blood and are carried to the liver much more lactate than pyruvate is transported out because the high nadh  nad  ratio in contracting skeletal muscle favors the conversion of pyruvate into lactate the lactate that enters the liver is oxidized to pyruvate a reaction favored by the low nadhnad  ratio in the cytosol of liver cells pyruvate in the liver is converted into glucose by the gluconeogenic pathway glucose then enters the blood and is taken up by skeletal muscle thus the liver furnishes glucose to contracting skeletal muscle which derives atp from the glycolytic conversion of glucose into lactate contracting skeletal muscle supplies lactate to the liver which uses it to synthesize glucose these reactions constitute the cori cycle  figure 1633  studies have shown that alanine like lactate is a major precursor of glucose in muscle alanine is formed from pyruvate by transamination  section 2422  the reverse reaction takes place in the liver the interplay between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is summarized in figure 1634 which shows how these two pathways help to meet the energy needs of different cell types figure 1633the cori cycle lactate formed by active muscle is converted into glucose by the liver this cycle shifts part of the metabolic burden of active muscle to the liver figure 1634cooperation between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are coordinated in a tissuespecific fashion to ensure that the glucosedependent energy needs of all cells are met isozymic forms of lactate dehydrogenase in different tissues catalyze the interconversions of pyruvate and lactate lactate dehydrogenase is a tetramer of two kinds of 35kd subunits encoded by similar genes the h type predominates in the heart and the homologous m type in skeletal muscle and the liver these subunits associate to form five types of tetramers h 4 h 3 m 1 h 2 m 2 h 1 m 3 and m 4 the h 4 isozyme type 1 has higher affinity for substrates than does the m 4 isozyme type 5 and unlike m 4 is allosterically inhibited by high levels of pyruvate the other isozymes have intermediate properties depending on the ratio of the two kinds of chains h 4 is designed to oxidize lactate to pyruvate which is then utilized as a fuel by the heart through aerobic metabolism indeed heart muscle never functions anaerobically in contrast m 4 is optimized to operate in the reverse direction to convert pyruvate into lactate to allow glycolysis to proceed under anaerobic conditions we see here an example of how gene duplication and divergence generate a series of homologous enzymes that foster metabolic cooperation between organs go to1643 glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are evolutionarily intertwined the metabolism of glucose has ancient origins organisms living in the early biosphere depended on the anaerobic generation of energy until significant amounts of oxygen began to accumulate 2 billion years ago the fact that glycolytic enzymes with similar properties do not have similar amino acid sequences also provides a clue to how the pathway originated although there are four kinases and two isomerases in the pathway both sequence and structural comparisons do not suggest that these sets of enzymes are related to one another by divergent evolution the absence of such similarities implies that glycolytic enzymes were derived independently rather than by gene duplication the common dinucleotidebinding domain found in the dehydrogenases  section 16110 and the αβ barrels are the only major recurring elements we can speculate on the relationship between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis if we think of glycolysis as consisting of two segments the metabolism of hexoses the upper segment and the metabolism of trioses the lower segment the enzymes from the upper segment are different in some species and are missing entirely in some archaea whereas enzymes from the lower segment are quite conserved in fact four enzymes of the lower segment are present in all species this lower part of the pathway is common to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis this common part of the two pathways may be the oldest part constituting the core to which the other steps were added the upper part would vary according to the sugars that were available to evolving organisms in particular niches interestingly this core part of carbohydrate metabolism can generate triose precursors for ribose sugars a component of rna and a critical requirement for the rna world thus we are left with the unanswered question was the original core pathway used for energy conversion or biosynthesis
