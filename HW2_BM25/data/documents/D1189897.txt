what are the differences between fatty acids and glycerolby laura fischer oct 03 2017glycerol is a carbohydrate that can be made in the body from glucose and obtained through the diet as a food additive it also exists naturally in triglycerides tgs and phospholipids pls glycerol has applications in food manufacturing as a sweetener thickener solvent and preservative fatty acids which are fats can also be made in the body and obtained through the diet in tgs and pls fatty acids supply more energy per gram and play a more significant role in human health than glycerol video of the day error loading player flash plugin failed to load triglycerides and phospholipids in tgs and pls glycerol acts is the backbone that fatty acids attach to the glycerol backbone is like a christmas tree with room for three ornaments fatty acids are like the different types of “ornaments” that can hang on the glycerol “tree” tgs contain three fatty acid ornaments and pls contain two fatty acids and a phosphate group the fatty acid ornaments that decorate the glycerol tree of a tg or pl determine its biological chemical and physiological properties unlike fatty acids there is only one type of glycerol and it has less significance on the properties of the tg and pl structure and biological function glycerol is a simple threecarbon molecule with a hydroxyl group on each carbon unlike glycerol fatty acids are complex molecules that vary in length from four to 28 carbons long and can contain one or more double bonds a fatty acid with one double bond is called monounsaturated more than one double bond makes a polyunsaturated fatty acid experts agree the presence of double bonds in a fatty acid has implications for its biological activity and impact on human health there is only one glycerol structure and it has less impact on human health than fatty acids some fatty acids are essential most fatty acids can be made in the body however there are two essential fatty acids  linoleic acid and alphalinolenic acid  that cannot be made and must be obtained from the diet good sources of essential fatty acids are flax fish and walnuts biological importance glycerol can be used as a source of energy unlike glycerol fatty acids are important sources of fuel because they yield a large amount of energy as part of pls in the cell membrane the most important biological role of glycerol is to maintain a cell’s physical structure fatty acids also play a role in maintaining cell membrane structure but play a bigger role in the cells function and signaling unlike glycerol fatty acids alter the “fluidity” of cell membranes the type of fatty acids that comprise a cell membrane alter the movement of ions in and out of a cell immunity inflammation and cognition rely on fatty acids to act as signaling molecules between cells lose weight feel greatchange your life with my plate by live strong  comgoalgender ageweight heightget my calorie goalyou might also likeside effects of omega 369 what is the function of fat cells natural sources of omega 3 monolaurin health benefits fat in indian foods differences between cis and transfatty acids is it safe to take flaxseed oil with other medications fat burning process what is monolaurin what role do lipids play in the human body foods containing omega3 fatty acids for vegetarians fish and shellfish with high levels of omega3 fatty acids what is glycerin made from why you need to eat fat to burn fat herbs high in llysine fish containing highest levels of epa  dha what does taking fish oil do for you the pros vs cons of omega 3 oil medicinal uses of glycerin side effects of vegetable glycerin
