how to use if function in excel programming in microsoft office march 18 2014 by jennifer marsh logical statements are a part of any programming language you don’t need to know programming to use specific functions in excel but you do need to understand how the excel if statement works the if statement is also a part of other programming languages so it’s easy to grasp if you already program in languages such as c or even visual basic if you’re not used to programming languages you just need to understand the logical flow of an if statement to properly set up the function in your spreadsheets new to excel get started at udemycom the excel if statement syntax the if statement has an easy syntax to remember the following is the pseudocode to better understand the function if logical condition if true this if false thisthe basic structure of an if statement is a logical condition or comparison if the logical condition is evaluated to “true” then the next statement is what the code should do if the condition evaluates to “false” then the second block of code is executed you can also embed if statements but they are usually frowned upon because they are too complex and make the code difficult to read this is true for your excel code as well but it’s an option if you feel the need to embed functions in the above code example the logical condition is the first parameter in your function the second parameter is executed if the statement is true if the logical statement is false then the third parameter is executed instead understand financial functions in excel you can use several types of logical statements in an if function you can compare two values such as evaluating if one value is greater or less than the other you can also evaluate if two values are equal either numerically or as a string a string is a list of characters so you can evaluate if two spreadsheet fields have the same word or sentence writing your own if functions in excel now that you know how to write an if statement you must be able to integrate it into your spreadsheets as you probably know your spreadsheet is set up as rows and columns columns are letters and rows are numbers the crosspoint is a spreadsheet field for your if statements you need to know your field name to enter it into your function’s parameters to set up your if statement you need to use three fields the two fields you want to compare and then a field to display your results your displayed results can be a static string or you can calculate the result based on your logical condition for instance you might want to calculate commission based on a sale’s amount if the sale’s amount is 5000 or less you want to give the sales person 5 in commission if the sale’s amount is over 5000 the commission is 6 the following is how you would set up the if statement if a1  5000 a105 a105in the above statement the sale’s amount is located in the a1 field if the a1 field has an amount of 5000 or less the if statement multiplies 05 of that amount if the sale’s amount is greater than 5000 06 is multiplied learn how to create powerful reports in excel you can also display strings as your results for instance taking the above scenario you could also display a static string just to know when the salesperson made a sale higher than 5000 take the following if statement if a1  5000 “under 5000 sale” “over 5000 sale”the logical statement executes the same as the previous statement except with this function a static string is displayed in the result’s field in this case the text “under 5000 sale” is displayed if a1 has a value under 5000 if a1 has a higher value than 5000 the string “over 5000 sale” is displayed as you can see the if statement is a simple little coding function that provides some powerful dynamic content for your spreadsheets you can also use the “fill down” function to quickly copy one typed if statement to several rows at once excel is smart enough to know to match the next row’s values with the subsequent copied function after you figure out how to use this function you’ll find that it’s a convenient way to make dynamic field content learn how to use vba for excel today filed under business students
