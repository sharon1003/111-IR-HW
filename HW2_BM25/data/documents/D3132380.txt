changes including reorganization of the police department starting with eight men the town marshal frank h matthews was renamed police chief the same year the city built a city hall and hired its first city manager despite the construction moratoriums created by world war i the crown jewel of palm beach county and south florida experienced a land boom that lasted into the twenties this

sold land many times sight unseen at alarming rates in 1926 a terrible hurricane caused significant damage to south florida that caused investors to lose confidence in florida real estate northern newspapers and investors also began publicizing reports of unscrupulous real estate deals when the florida east coast railroad put a moratorium on shipping construction materials building came to a halt local banks started to fail which affected commercial and land investments to top it all off a second and even more damaging hurricane hit south florida in 1928 this second hurricane laid waste to most of palm beach county and killed at least three thousand people in the glades area the lake okeechobee dike failed flooding the communities on the southeastern lakeshore these factors
