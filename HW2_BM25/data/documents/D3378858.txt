1787 when wayne county was formed a town named waynesborough grew around the countys courthouse in 1787 william whitfield iii son of william whitfield ii and his son were appointed directors and trustees for designing and building the town 7 8 located on the east bank of the neuse river the town became the county seat population growth in waynesborough continued through the 1830s however this changed once the wilmington and weldon railroad was completed in the early 1840s by then a hotel had been built at the intersection of the railroad and new bern road which grew into a community after the train started to transport passengers from there more and more citizens soon relocated from waynesborough to this growing village named eventually goldsboroughs junction after major matthew t goldsborough an assistant chief engineer with the railroad line later this was shortened simply to goldsborough in 1847 the town was incorporated and became the new wayne county seat following a vote of the citizens of wayne county local legend has it the goldsborough supporters put moonshine in the towns well to encourage people to vote for goldsborough in the following decades goldsboroughs growth continued in part by new railroad connections to charlotte and beaufort by 1861 the towns population was estimated to be 1500 it was the trading center of a rural area that started with yeoman farmers by this time it had been developed as large cotton plantations dependent on the labor of enslaved african americans as the invention of the cotton gin had enabled profitable cultivation of shortstaple cotton in the upcounties because of its importance as railroad junction goldsborough played a significant role in the civil war both for stationing confederate troops and for transporting their supplies the town also provided hospitals for soldiers wounded in nearby battles in december 1862 the battle of goldsborough bridge was waged in which both sides fought for possession of the strategically significant wilmington and weldon railroad bridge union general john foster arrived with his troops on december 17 aiming to destroy this bridge in order to put an end to the vital supply chain from the port of wilmington he succeeded on that same day his troops overpowering the small number of defending confederate soldiers and burning down the bridge on their way back to new bern fosters men were attacked again by confederate troops but they survived with fewer casualties than the enemy the important bridge at goldsborough was rebuilt in a matter of weeks goldsborough was the scene of another union offensive in 1865 during union general sherman s carolinas campaign after the battles of bentonville and wyse fork shermans forces met with the armies of schofield their
