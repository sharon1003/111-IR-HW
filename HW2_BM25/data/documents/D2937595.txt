maundy thursday on march 24 or april 7 a d 1300 shortly before dawn of good friday 3 4 the narrator dante himself is thirtyfive years old and thus midway in the journey of our life  nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita 5 – half of the biblical lifespan of seventy  psalm 8910 vulgate psalm 9010 kjv the poet finds himself lost in a dark wood  selva oscura 6  astray from the straight way  diritta via 7 also translatable as right way of salvation he sets out to climb directly up a small mountain but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade a lonza 8 usually rendered as  leopard  or  leopon  9 a leone 10  lion  and a lupa 11  shewolf  the three beasts taken from the jeremiah 56 are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of hell according to john ciardi these are incontinence the shewolf violence and bestiality the lion and fraud and malice the leopard 12 dorothy l sayers assigns the leopard to incontinence and the shewolf to fraudmalice 13 it is now dawn of good friday april 8 with the sun rising in aries the beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error a lower place  basso loco 14 where the sun is silent  l sol tace 15  however dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born sub iulio 16 ie in the time of julius caesar and lived under augustus it is the shade of the roman poet virgil author of the aeneid a latin epic canto ii on the evening of good friday dante is following virgil but hesitates virgil explains how he has been sent by beatrice the symbol of divine love beatrice had been moved to aid dante by the virgin mary symbolic of compassion and saint lucia symbolic of illuminating grace rachel symbolic of the contemplative life also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by virgil the two of them then begin their journey to the underworld vestibule of hell  editcanto iii dante passes through the gate of hell which bears an inscription ending with the famous phrase  lasciate ogne speranza voi chintrate  17 most frequently translated as abandon all hope ye who enter here nb 1 dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the uncommitted these are the souls of people who in life took no sides the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil but instead were merely concerned with themselves among these dante recognizes a figure implied to be pope celestine v whose cowardice in selfish terror for his own welfare served as the door through which so much evil entered the church 18 mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the rebellion of angels these souls are forever unclassified they are neither in hell nor out of it but reside on the shores of the acheron naked and futile they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive wavering banner symbolic of their pursuit of evershifting selfinterest while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets who continually sting them 19 loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners feet drink the putrid mixture of blood pus and tears that flows down their bodies this symbolizes the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin  citation needed this may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived gustave dorés illustration of canto iii arrival of charon after passing through the vestibule dante and virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river acheron and to hell proper the ferry is piloted by charon who does not want to let dante enter for he is a living being virgil forces charon to take him by declaring vuolsi così colà dove si puote  ciò che si vuole it is so willed there where is power to do  that which is willed 20 referring to the fact that dante is on his journey on divine grounds the wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering charons boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the purgatorio the passage across the acheron however is undescribed since dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side nine circles of hell  editoverview  editcanto ivvirgil proceeds to guide dante through the nine circles of hell the circles are concentric representing a gradual increase in wickedness and culminating at the centre of the earth where satan is held in bondage the sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes each punishment is a contrapasso a symbolic instance of poetic justice for example later in the poem dante and virgil encounter fortunetellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward unable to see what is ahead because they tried to see the future through forbidden means such a contrapasso functions not merely as a form of divine revenge but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life 21 people who sinned but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in hell but in purgatory where they labour to become free of their sins those in hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant dantes hell is structurally based on the ideas of aristotle but with certain christian symbolisms exceptions and misconstructions of aristotles text 22 dantes three major categories of sin as symbolized by the three beasts that dante encounters in canto i are incontinence violence and bestiality and fraud and malice 22 23 sinners punished for incontinence also known as wantonness — the lustful the gluttonous the hoarders and wasters and the wrathful and sullen — all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites desires and natural urges according to aristotles ethics incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of upper hell circles 25 these sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to lower hell located within the walls of the city of dis for committing acts of violence and fraud — the latter of which involves as dorothy l sayers writes abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason 23 the deeper levels are organized into one circle for violence circle 7 and two circles for fraud circles 8 and 9 as a christian dante adds circle 1 limbo to upper hell and circle 6 heresy to lower hell making 9 circles in total incorporating the vestibule of the futile this leads to hell containing 10 main divisions 23 this 9110 structure is also found within the purgatorio and paradiso lower hell is further subdivided circle 7 violence is divided into three rings circle 8 simple fraud is divided into ten bolge and circle 9 complex fraud is divided into four regions thus hell contains in total 24 divisions first circle limbo  editthe harrowing of hell in a 14thcentury illuminated manuscript the petites heures de jean de berry dante wakes up to find that he has crossed the acheron and virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss limbo where virgil himself resides the first circle contains the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans who although not sinful did not accept christ dorothy l sayers writes after those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice they could not that is choose christ they could and did choose human virtue and for that they have their reward 24 limbo shares many characteristics with the asphodel meadows thus the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of heaven without baptism the portal of the faith that you embrace 25 they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive when dante asked if anyone has ever left limbo virgil states that he saw jesus a mighty one descend into limbo and take noah moses abraham david and rachel see limbo of the patriarchs into his allforgiving arms and transport them to heaven as the first human souls to be saved the event known as the harrowing of hell would have occurred in a d 33 or 34 dante encounters the poets homer horace ovid and lucan who include him in their number and make him sixth in that high company 26 they reach the base of a great castle – the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity – surrounded by seven gates and a flowing brook after passing through the seven gates the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and dante encounters the inhabitants of the citadel these include figures associated with the trojans and their descendants the romans electra mother of troys founder dardanus  hector aeneas julius caesar in his role as roman general in his armor falconeyed 27 camilla penthesilea queen of the amazons  king latinus and his daughter lavinia lucius junius brutus who overthrew tarquin to found the roman republic  lucretia julia marcia and cornelia africana dante also views saladin a muslim military leader known for his struggle against the crusaders as well as his generous chivalrous and merciful conduct dante next encounters a group of philosophers including aristotle with socrates and plato at his side as well as democritus diogenes either diogenes the cynic or diogenes of apollonia  anaxagoras thales empedocles heraclitus and zeno either zeno of elea or zeno of citium  he sees the scientist dioscorides the mythical greek poets orpheus and linus and roman statesmen marcus tullius cicero and seneca dante sees the alexandrian geometer euclid and ptolemy the alexandrian astronomer and geographer as well as the physicians hippocrates and galen he also encounters avicenna a persian polymath and averroes a medieval andalusian polymath known for his commentaries on aristotles works dante and virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey although dante implies that all virtuous nonchristians find themselves here he later encounters two  cato of utica and statius in purgatory and two  trajan and ripheus in heaven in purg xxii virgil names several additional inhabitants of limbo who were not mentioned in the inferno 28second circle lust  editgustave dorés depiction of minos judging sinners at the start of canto vcanto vdante and virgil leave limbo and enter the second circle – the first of the circles of incontinence – where the punishments of hell proper begin it is described as a part where no thing gleams 29 they find their way hindered by the serpentine minos who judges all of those condemned for active deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a corresponding number of times virgil rebukes minos and he and dante continue on in the second circle of hell are those overcome by lust these carnal malefactors 30 are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason these souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm without rest this symbolizes the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly as the lovers drifted into selfindulgence and were carried sway by their passions so now they drift for ever the bright voluptuous sin is now seen as it is – a howling darkness of helpless discomfort 31 since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not therefore completely selfcentered dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within hell proper 31 32 the ruined slope 33 in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of christ gianciotto discovers paolo and francesca by jean auguste dominique ingres in this circle dante sees semiramis dido cleopatra helen of troy paris achilles tristan and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life dante comes across francesca da rimini who married the deformed giovanni malatesta also known as gianciotto for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother paolo malatesta the two began to carry on an adulterous affair sometime between 1283 and 1286 giovanni surprised them together in francescas bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death francesca explains love which in gentlest hearts will soonest bloom seized my lover with passion for that sweet body from which i was torn unshriven to my doom love which permits no loved one not to love took me so strongly with delight in him that we are one in hell as we were above love led us to one death in the depths of hell caïna waits for him who took our lives  this was the piteous tale they stopped to tell 34francesca further reports that she and paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between lancelot and guinevere in the old french romance lancelot du lac francesca says  galeotto fu l libro e chi lo scrisse  35 the word galeotto means  pander  but is also the italian term for gallehaut who acted as an intermediary between lancelot and guinevere encouraging them on to love john ciardi renders line 137 as that book and he who wrote it was a pander 36 inspired by dante author giovanni boccaccio invoked the name prencipe galeotto in the alternative title to the decameron a 14thcentury collection of novellas the english poet john keats in his sonnet on a dream imagines what dante does not give us the point of view of paolo but to that second circle of sad hell where mid the gust the whirlwind and the flaw of rain and hailstones lovers need not tell their sorrows pale were the sweet lips i saw pale were the lips i kissd and fair the form i floated with about that melancholy storm 37as he did at the end of canto iii dante – overcome by pity and anguish – describes his swoon i fainted as if i had met my death  and then i fell as a dead body falls 38third circle gluttony  editthe third circle illustrated by stradanus cerberus as illustrated by gustave dorécanto vi in the third circle the gluttonous wallow in a vile putrid slush produced by a ceaseless foul icy rain – a great storm of putrefaction 39 – as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite cerberus described as  il gran vermo  literally the great worm line 22 the monstrous threeheaded beast of hell ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud dorothy l sayers writes that the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary selfindulgence 40 the gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves sightless and heedless of their neighbors symbolizing the cold selfish and empty sensuality of their lives 40 just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality – which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink but also other kinds of addiction 41in this circle dante converses with a florentine contemporary identified as ciacco which means hog 42 a character with the same nickname later appears in the decameron of giovanni boccaccio 43 ciacco speaks to dante regarding strife in florence between the white and black guelphs which developed after the guelphghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the ghibellines in the first of several political prophecies in the inferno ciacco predicts the expulsion of the white guelphs dantes party from florence by the black guelphs aided by pope boniface viii which marked the start of dantes long exile from the city these events occurred in 1302 prior to when the poem was written but in the future at easter time of 1300 the time in which the poem is set 42fourth circle greed  editin gustave doré s illustrations for the fourth circle the weights are huge money bags canto vii the fourth circle is guarded by a figure dante names as pluto this is plutus the deity of wealth in classical mythology although the two are often conflated he is a distinct figure from pluto dis the classical ruler of the underworld nb 2 at the start of canto vii he menaces virgil and dante with the cryptic phrase papé satàn papé satàn aleppe but virgil protects dante from him those whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle they include the avaricious or miserly including many clergymen and popes and cardinals 44 who hoarded possessions and the prodigal who squandered them the hoarders and spendthrifts joust using as weapons great weights that they push with their chests here too i saw a nation of lost souls far more than were above they strained their chests against enormous weights and with mad howls rolled them at one another then in haste they rolled them back one party shouting out why do you hoard and the other why do you waste 45relating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it lust and gluttony dorothy l sayers writes mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite now that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people indifference becomes mutual antagonism imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering 46 the contrast between these two groups leads virgil to discourse on the nature of fortune who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty as she shifts those empty goods from nation unto nation clan to clan 47 this speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that virgil tells dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them – indeed they have lost their individuality and been rendered unrecognizable 48fifth circle wrath  editthe fifth circle illustrated by stradanus the barque of dante by eugène delacroix in the swampy stinking waters of the river styx – the fifth circle – the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime while the sullen the passively wrathful lie beneath the water withdrawn into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in god or man or the universe 46 at the surface of the foul stygian marsh dorothy l sayers writes the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another at the bottom the sullen hatreds lie gurgling unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them 46 as the last circle of incontinence the savage selffrustration of the fifth circle marks the end of that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion 46canto viiiphlegyas reluctantly transports dante and virgil across the styx in his skiff on the way they are accosted by filippo argenti a black guelph from the prominent adimari family little is known about argenti although giovanni boccaccio describes an incident in which he lost his temper early commentators state that argentis brother seized some of dantes property after his exile from florence 49 just as argenti enabled the seizing of dantes property he himself is seized by all the other wrathful souls when dante responds in weeping and in grieving accursed spirit may you long remain 50 virgil blesses him with words used to describe christ himself  luke 1127  literally this reflects the fact that souls in hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen but allegorically it reflects dantes beginning awareness of his own sin 51entrance to dis  editin the distance dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques virgil informs him that they are approaching the city of dis dis itself surrounded by the stygian marsh contains lower hell within its walls 52 dis is one of the names of pluto the classical king of the underworld in addition to being the name of the realm the walls of dis are guarded by fallen angels virgil is unable to convince them to let dante and him enter and dante is threatened by the furies consisting of alecto megaera and tisiphone and medusa canto ix an angel sent from heaven secures entry for the poets opening the gate by touching it with a wand and rebukes those who opposed dante allegorically this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that philosophy and humanism cannot fully understand virgil also mentions to dante how erichtho sent him down to the lowest circle of hell to bring back a spirit from there 51lower hell inside the walls of dis in an illustration by stradanus there is a drop from the sixth circle to the three rings of the seventh circle then again to the ten rings of the eighth circle and at the bottom to the icy ninth circle sixth circle heresy  editcanto x in the sixth circle heretics such as epicurus and his followers who say the soul dies with the body 53 are trapped in flaming tombs dante holds discourse with a pair of epicurian florentines in one of the tombs farinata degli uberti a famous ghibelline leader following the battle of montaperti in september 1260 farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of florence at the meeting of the victorious ghibellines he died in 1264 and was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1283 and cavalcante de cavalcanti a guelph who was the father of dantes friend and fellow poet guido cavalcanti the political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of florentine politics in response to a question from dante about the prophecy he has received farinata explains that what the souls in hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future not from any observation of the present consequently when the portal of the future has been shut 54 it will no longer be possible for them to know anything farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are emperor frederick ii commonly reputed to be an epicurean and ottaviano degli ubaldini to whom dante refers to as il cardinale canto xi dante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to pope anastasius ii – although some modern scholars hold that dante erred in the verse mentioning anastasius  anastasio papa guardo  lo qual trasse fotin de la via dritta  lines 89 confusing the pope with the byzantine emperor of the time anastasius i 55 56 57 58 pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foulsmelling seventh circle virgil explains the geography and rationale of lower hell in which the sins of violence or bestiality and fraud or malice are punished in his explanation virgil refers to the nicomachean ethics and the physics of aristotle with medieval interpretations virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth natural resources nature and human labor and activity art usury to be punished in the next circle is therefore an offence against both it is a kind of blasphemy since it is an act of violence against art which is the child of nature and nature derives from god 59virgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars positions the wain the great bear now lies in the northwest over caurus the northwest wind the constellation pisces the fish is just appearing over the horizon it is the zodiacal sign preceding aries the ram canto i notes that the sun is in aries and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at twohour intervals it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise 400 a m on holy saturday april 9 59 60seventh circle violence  editcanto xii the seventh circle divided into three rings houses the violent dante and virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the seventh circle from the sixth circle having first to evade the minotaur  linfamia di creti the infamy of crete  line 12 at the sight of them the minotaur gnaws his flesh virgil assures the monster that dante is not its hated enemy theseus this causes the minotaur to charge them as dante and virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of christs death  matt 2751 at the time of the harrowing of hell ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of upper hell the entrance of the second circle canto v along the brink of the vermilion boiling  wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments  people i saw within up to the eyebrows  61ring 1 against neighbors in the first round of the seventh circle the murderers warmakers plunderers and tyrants are immersed in phlegethon a river of boiling blood and fire ciardi writes as they wallowed in blood during their lives so they are immersed in the boiling blood forever each according to the degree of his guilt 62 the centaurs commanded by chiron and pholus patrol the ring shooting arrows into any sinners who emerge higher out of the boiling blood than each is allowed the centaur nessus guides the poets along phlegethon and points out alexander the great dionysius either dionysius i or dionysius ii or both they were bloodthirsty unpopular tyrants of sicily  ezzelino iii da romano the cruelest of the ghibelline tyrants obizzo deste and guy de montfort the river grows shallower until it reaches a ford after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where dante and virgil first approached it immersed here are tyrants including attila king of the huns  flagello in terra scourge on earth line 134 pyrrhus either the bloodthirsty son of achilles or king pyrrhus of epirus  sextus rinier da corneto and rinier pazzo after bringing dante and virgil to the shallow ford nessus leaves them to return to his post this passage may have been influenced by the early medieval visio karoli grossi nb 3harpies in the wood of the suicides from inferno canto xiii by gustave doré 1861canto xiiiring 2 against self the second round of the seventh circle is the wood of the suicides in which the souls of the people who attempted or committed suicide are transformed into gnarled thorny trees and then fed upon by harpies hideous clawed birds with the faces of women the trees are only permitted to speak when broken and bleeding dante breaks a twig off one of the trees and from the bleeding trunk hears the tale of pietro della vigna a powerful minister of emperor frederick ii until he fell out of favor and was imprisoned and blinded he subsequently committed suicide his presence here rather than in the ninth circle indicates that dante believes that the accusations made against him were false 63 the harpies and the characteristics of the bleeding bushes are based on book 3 of the aeneid according to dorothy l sayers the sin of suicide is an insult to the body so here the shades are deprived of even the semblance of the human form as they refused life they remain fixed in a dead and withered sterility they are the image of the selfhatred which dries up the very sap of energy and makes all life infertile 63 the trees can also be interpreted as a metaphor for the state of mind in which suicide is committed 64 dante learns that these suicides unique among the dead will not be corporally resurrected after the final judgement since they threw their bodies away instead they will maintain their bushy form with their own corpses hanging from the thorny limbs after pietro della vigna finishes his story dante notices two shades lano da siena and jacopo sant andrea race through the wood chased and savagely mauled by ferocious bitches – this is the punishment of the violently profligate who possessed by a depraved passion  dissipated their goods for the sheer wanton lust of wreckage and disorder 63 the destruction wrought upon the wood by the profligates flight and punishment as they crash through the undergrowth causes further suffering to the suicides who cannot move out of the way brunetto latini speaks with dante in canto xv an engraving by gustave doré canto xivring 3 against god art and nature the third round of the seventh circle is a great plain of burning sand scorched by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky an image derived from the fate of sodom and gomorrah  gen 1924 the blasphemers the violent against god are stretched supine upon the burning sand the sodomites the violent against nature run in circles while the usurers the violent against art which is the grandchild of god as explained in canto xi crouch huddled and weeping ciardi writes blasphemy sodomy and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners and thus the rain which in nature should be fertile and cool descends as fire 65 dante finds capaneus stretched out on the sands for blasphemy against jove he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the siege of thebes he is still scorning jove in the afterlife the overflow of phlegethon the river of blood from the first round flows boiling through the wood of the suicides the second round and crosses the burning plain virgil explains the origin of the rivers of hell which includes references to the old man of crete canto xv protected by the powers of the boiling rivulet dante and virgil progress across the burning plain they pass a roving group of sodomites and dante to his surprise recognizes brunetto latini dante addresses brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the inferno  66 thus refuting suggestions that dante only placed his enemies in hell 67 dante has great respect for brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works you taught me how man makes himself eternal  and while i live my gratitude for that  must always be apparent in my words 68 brunetto prophesies dantes bad treatment by the florentines he also identifies other sodomites including priscian francesco daccorso and bishop andrea de mozzi a gustave doré wood engraving of geryon canto xvii canto xvi the poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the great cliff into the eighth circle when three shades break from their company and greet them they are iacopo rusticucci guido guerra and tegghiaio aldobrandi – all florentines much admired by dante rusticucci blames his savage wife for his torments the sinners ask for news of florence and dante laments the current state of the city at the top of the falls at virgils order dante removes a cord from about his waist and virgil drops it over the edge as if in answer a large distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss canto xvii the creature is geryon the monster of fraud virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monsters back dante goes alone to examine the usurers he does not recognize them but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck on these their streaming eyes appeared to feast 69  the coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent florentine families they indicate the presence of catello di rosso gianfigliazzi ciappo ubriachi the paduan reginaldo degli scrovegni who predicts that his fellow paduan vitaliano di iacopo vitaliani will join him here and giovanni di buiamonte dante then rejoins virgil and both mounted atop geryons back the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the eighth circle the hell of the fraudulent and malicious geryon the winged monster who allows dante and virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the eighth circle was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies 70 dantes geryon meanwhile is an image of fraud 71 combining human bestial and reptilian elements geryon is a monster with the general shape of a wyvern but with the tail of a scorpion hairy arms a gaudilymarked reptilian body and the face of a just and honest man 72 the pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions behind the face are all monstrous coldblooded and stinging with poison eighth circle fraud  editsee also malebolge canto xviii dante now finds himself in the eighth circle called malebolge evil ditches the upper half of the hell of the fraudulent and malicious the eighth circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep narrow concentric ditches or trenches called bolge singular bolgia  within these ditches are punished those guilty of simple fraud from the foot of the great cliff to the well which forms the neck of the funnel are large spurs of rock like umbrella ribs or spokes which serve as bridges over the ten ditches dorothy l sayers writes that the malebolge is the image of the city in corruption the progressive disintegration of every social relationship personal and public sexuality ecclesiastical and civil office language ownership counsel authority psychic influence and material interdependence – all the media of the communitys interchange are perverted and falsified 73illustration by sandro botticelli dante and virgil visit the first two bolge of the eighth circle bolgia 1 – panderers and seducers these sinners make two files one along either bank of the ditch and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned demons for eternity they deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests are themselves driven and scourged 73 dante makes reference to a recent traffic rule developed for the jubilee year of 1300 in rome 73 in the group of panderers the poets notice venedico caccianemico a bolognese guelph who sold his own sister ghisola to the marchese deste in the group of seducers virgil points out jason the greek hero who led the argonauts to fetch the golden fleece from aeëtes king of colchis he gained the help of the kings daughter medea by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for creusa 73 jason had previously seduced hypsipyle when the argonauts landed at lemnos on their way to colchis but abandoned her alone and pregnant 74bolgia 2 – flatterers these also exploited other people this time abusing and corrupting language to play upon others desires and fears they are steeped in excrement representative of the false flatteries they told on earth as they howl and fight amongst themselves alessio interminei of lucca and thaïs are seen here 73canto xixbolgia 3 – simoniacs dante now forcefully expresses his condemnation of those who committed simony or the sale of ecclesiastic favors and offices and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to god rapacious ones who take the things of god  that ought to be the brides of righteousness  and make them fornicate for gold and silver  the time has come to let the trumpet sound  for you  75 the sinners are placed headdownwards in round tubelike holes within the rock debased mockeries of baptismal fonts  with flames burning the soles of their feet the heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt the simile of baptismal fonts gives dante an incidental opportunity to clear his name of an accusation of malicious damage to the font at the baptistery of san giovanni 76 simon magus who offered gold in exchange for holy power to saint peter and after whom the sin is named is mentioned here although dante does not encounter him one of the sinners pope nicholas iii must serve in the hellish baptism by fire from his death in 1280 until 1303 – the arrival in hell of pope boniface viii – who will take his predecessors place in the stone tube until 1314 when he will in turn be replaced by pope clement v a puppet of king philip iv of france who moved the papal see to avignon ushering in the avignon papacy 1309–77 dante delivers a denunciation of simoniacal corruption of the church punishment of sorcerers and diviners in the fourth bolgia canto xx illustrated by stradanus canto xxbolgia 4 – sorcerers in the middle of the bridge of the fourth bolgia dante looks down at the souls of fortune tellers diviners astrologers and other false prophets the punishment of those who attempted to usurp gods prerogative by prying into the future 77 is to have their heads twisted around on their bodies in this horrible contortion of the human form these sinners are compelled to walk backwards for eternity blinded by their own tears john ciardi writes thus those who sought to penetrate the future cannot even see in front of themselves they attempted to move themselves forward in time so must they go backwards through all eternity and as the arts of sorcery are a distortion of gods law so are their bodies distorted in hell 78 while referring primarily to attempts to see into the future by forbidden means this also symbolises the twisted nature of magic in general 77 dante weeps in pity and virgil rebukes him saying here pity only lives when it is dead  for who can be more impious than he  who links god’s judgment to passivity 79 virgil gives a lengthy explanation of the founding of his native city of mantua among the sinners in this circle are king amphiaraus one of the seven against thebes foreseeing his death in the war he sought to avert it by hiding from battle but died in an earthquake trying to flee and two theban soothsayers tiresias in ovids metamorphoses iii 324331 tiresias was transformed into a woman upon striking two coupling serpents with his rod seven years later he was changed back to a man in an identical encounter and his daughter manto also in this bolgia are aruns an etruscan soothsayer who predicted the caesars victory in the roman civil war in lucans pharsalia i 585638 the greek augur eurypylus astrologers michael scot served at frederick iis court at palermo and guido bonatti served the court of guido da montefeltro  and asdente a shoemaker and soothsayer from parma virgil implies that the moon is now setting over the pillars of hercules in the west the time is just after 600 a m the dawn of holy saturday dantes guide rebuffs malacoda and his fiends between bolge v and vi canto xxicanto xxibolgia 5 – barrators corrupt politicians who made money by trafficking in public offices the political analogue of the simoniacs are immersed in a lake of boiling pitch which represents the sticky fingers and dark secrets of their corrupt deals 80 they are guarded by demons called the malebranche evil claws who tear them to pieces with claws and grappling hooks if they catch them above the surface of the pitch the poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting senator of lucca and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him virgil secures safeconduct from the leader of the malebranche named malacoda evil tail he informs them that the bridge across the sixth bolgia is shattered as a result of the earthquake that shook hell at the death of christ in 34 ad but that there is another bridge further on he sends a squad of demons led by barbariccia to escort them safely based on details in this canto and if christs death is taken to have occurred at exactly noon the time is now 700 a m of holy saturday 81 nb 4 the demons provide some savage and satirical black comedy – in the last line of canto xxi the sign for their march is provided by a fart and he had made a trumpet of his ass 83canto xxii one of the grafters an unidentified navarrese identified by early commentators as ciampolo is seized by the demons and virgil questions him the sinner speaks of his fellow grafters friar gomita a corrupt friar in gallura eventually hanged by nino visconti see purg viii for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape and michel zanche a corrupt vicar of logodoro under king enzo of sardinia  he offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch alichino and calcabrina start a brawl in midair and fall into the pitch themselves and barbariccia organizes a rescue party dante and virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away canto xxiiibolgia 6 – hypocrites the poets escape the pursuing malebranche by sliding down the sloping bank of the next pit here they find the hypocrites listlessly walking around a narrow track for eternity weighted down by leaden robes the robes are brilliantly gilded on the outside and are shaped like a monks habit – the hypocrites outward appearance shines brightly and passes for holiness but under that show lies the terrible weight of his deceit 84 a falsity that weighs them down and makes spiritual progress impossible for them 85 dante speaks with catalano dei malavolti and loderingo degli andalò two bolognese brothers of the jovial friars an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by papal decree 85 friar catalano points out caiaphas the high priest under pontius pilate who counseled the pharisees to crucify jesus for the public good  john 114950 he himself is crucified to the floor of hell by three large stakes and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him he must suffer upon his body the weight of all the worlds hypocrisy 84 the jovial friars explain to virgil how he may climb from the pit virgil discovers that malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the sixth bolgia the thieves tortured by serpents engraving by gustave doré illustrating canto xxiv of the inferno canto xxivbolgia 7 – thieves dante and virgil leave the bolgia of the hypocrites by climbing the ruined rocks of a bridge destroyed by the great earthquake after which they cross the bridge of the seventh bolgia to the far side to observe the next chasm the pit is filled with monstrous reptiles the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by snakes and lizards who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their hands behind their backs the full horror of the thieves punishment is revealed gradually just as they stole other peoples substance in life their very identity becomes subject to theft here 86 one sinner who reluctantly identifies himself as vanni fucci is bitten by a serpent at the jugular vein bursts into flames and is reformed from the ashes like a phoenix vanni tells a dark prophecy against dante canto xxv vanni hurls an obscenity at god and the serpents swarm over him the centaur cacus arrives to punish the wretch he has a firebreathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back in roman mythology cacus the monstrous firebreathing son of vulcan was killed by hercules for raiding the heros cattle in aeneid viii 193267 virgil did not describe him as a centaur dante then meets five noble thieves of florence and observes their various transformations agnello brunelleschi in human form is merged with the sixlegged serpent that is cianfa donati a figure named buoso perhaps either buoso degli abati or buoso donati the latter of whom is mentioned in inf xxx44 first appears as a man but exchanges forms with francesco de cavalcanti who bites buoso in the form of a fourfooted serpent puccio sciancato remains unchanged for the time being dante and virgil observe the false counsellors canto xxvicanto xxvibolgia 8 – counsellors of fraud dante addresses a passionate lament to florence before turning to the next bolgia here fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about hidden from view inside individual flames these are not people who gave false advice but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud 87ulysses and diomedes are punished together within a great doubleheaded flame they are condemned for the stratagem of the trojan horse resulting in the fall of troy  persuading achilles to sail for troy causing deidamia to die of grief and for the theft of the sacred statue of pallas the palladium upon which it was believed the fate of troy depended ulysses the figure in the larger horn of the flame narrates the tale of his last voyage and death dantes invention he tells how after his detainment by circe his love for neither his son his father nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to gain experience of the world  and of the vices and the worth of men 88 as they approach the pillars of hercules ulysses urges his crewbrothers i said o you who having crossed a hundred thousand dangers reach the west to this brief wakingtime that still is left unto your senses you must not deny experience of that which lies beyond the sun and of the world that is unpeopled consider well the seed that gave you birth you were not made to live your lives as brutes but to be followers of worth and knowledge 89ulysses tells how he and his men traveled south across the equator observed the southern stars and found that the north star had sunk below the horizon they sight mount purgatory in the southern hemisphere after five months of passage canto xxvii dante is approached by guido da montefeltro head of the ghibellines of romagna asking for news of his country dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of romagna guido then recounts his life he advised pope boniface viii to offer a false amnesty to the colonna family who in 1297 had walled themselves inside the castle of palestrina in the lateran when the colonna accepted the terms and left the castle the pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge guido describes how st francis founder of the franciscan order came to take his soul to heaven only to have a devil assert prior claim although boniface had absolved guido in advance for his evil advice the devil points out the invalidity absolution requires contrition and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it 90canto xxviiibolgia 9 – sowers of discord in the ninth bolgia the sowers of discord are hacked and mutilated for all eternity by a large demon wielding a bloody sword their bodies are divided as in life their sin was to tear apart what god had intended to be united 91 these are the sinners who are ready to rip up the whole fabric of society to gratify a sectional egotism 92 the souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch their wounds healing in the course of the circuit only to have the demon tear them apart anew there are divided into three categories i religious schism and discord ii civil strife and political discord and iii family disunion or discord between kinsmen chief among the first category is muhammad the founder of islam his body is ripped from groin to chin with his entrails hanging out dante apparently saw muhammad as causing a schism within christianity when he and his followers splintered off 92 93 dante also condemns muhammads soninlaw ali for schism between sunni and shiite his face is cleft from top to bottom muhammad ironically tells dante to warn the schismatic and heretic fra dolcino in the second category are pier da medicina his throat slit nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows a wound where one of his ears had been the roman tribune gaius scribonius curio who advised caesar to cross the rubicon and thus begin the civil war his tongue is cut off and mosca dei lamberti who incited the amidei family to kill buondelmonte dei buondelmonti resulting in conflict between guelphs and ghibellines his arms are hacked off finally in the third category of sinner dante sees bertrand de born 11401215 the knight carries around his severed head by its own hair swinging it like a lantern bertrand is said to have caused a quarrel between henry ii of england and his son prince henry the young king his punishment in hell is decapitation since dividing father and son is like severing the head from the body 92canto xxixbolgia 10 – falsifiers the final bolgia of the eighth circle is home to various sorts of falsifiers a disease on society they are themselves afflicted with different types of afflictions 94 horrible diseases stench thirst filth darkness and screaming some lie prostrate while others run hungering through the pit tearing others to pieces shortly before their arrival in this pit virgil indicates that it is approximately noon of holy saturday and he and dante discuss one of dantes kinsmen geri de bello among the sowers of discord in the previous ditch the first category of falsifiers dante encounters are the alchemists falsifiers of things he speaks with two spirits viciously scrubbing and clawing at their leprous scabs griffolino darezzo an alchemist who extracted money from the foolish alberto da siena on the promise of teaching him to fly albertos reputed father the bishop of siena had griffolino burned at the stake and capocchio burned at the stake at siena in 1293 for practicing alchemy dante et virgile by williamadolphe bouguereau capocchio an alchemist is attacked by gianni schicchi who impersonated the dead buoso donati to claim his inheritance canto xxx canto xxx suddenly two spirits – gianni schicchi de cavalcanti and myrrha both punished as imposters falsifiers of persons – run rabid through the pit schicchi sinks his tusks into capocchios neck and drags him away like prey griffolino explains how myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father king cinyras while schicchi impersonated the dead buoso donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests dante then encounters master adam of brescia one of the counterfeiters falsifiers of money for manufacturing florentine florins of twentyone rather than twentyfour carat gold he was burned at the stake in 1281 he is punished by a loathsome dropsy like disease which gives him a bloated stomach prevents him from moving and an eternal unbearable thirst master adam points out two sinners of the fourth class the perjurers falsifiers of words these are potiphars wife punished for her false accusation of joseph gen 39719 and sinon the achaean spy who lied to the trojans to convince them to take the trojan horse into their city  aeneid ii 57194 sinon is here rather than in bolgia 8 because his advice was false as well as evil both suffer from a burning fever master adam and sinon exchange abuse which dante watches until he is rebuked by virgil as a result of his shame and repentance dante is forgiven by his guide sayers remarks that the descent through malebolge began with the sale of the sexual relationship and went on to the sale of church and state now the very money is itself corrupted every affirmation has become perjury and every identity a lie 94 so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed central well of malebolge  edittitans and giants including ephialtes on the left in dorés illustrations canto xxxi dante and virgil approach the central well at the bottom of which lies the ninth and final circle of hell the classical and biblical giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery 95 – stand perpetual guard inside the wellpit their legs embedded in the banks of the ninth circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the malebolge 96 dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city among the giants virgil identifies nimrod who tried to build the tower of babel he shouts out the unintelligible raphèl mai amècche zabì almi  ephialtes who with his brother otus tried to storm olympus during the gigantomachy he has his arms chained up and briareus who dante claimed to have challenged the gods and tityos and typhon who insulted jupiter also here is the giant antaeus who did not join in the rebellion against the olympian gods and therefore is not chained at virgils persuasion antaeus takes the poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of hell ninth circle treachery  editdante speaks to the traitors in the ice canto xxxii canto xxxii at the base of the well dante finds himself within a large frozen lake cocytus the ninth circle of hell trapped in the ice each according to his guilt are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships the lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings or rounds of traitors corresponding in order of seriousness to betrayal of family ties betrayal of community ties betrayal of guests and betrayal of lords this is in contrast to the popular image of hell as fiery as ciardi writes the treacheries of these souls were denials of love which is god and of all human warmth only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures as they denied gods love so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of his sun as they denied all human ties so are they bound only by the unyielding ice 97 this final deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors betrayers and oathbreakers its most famous inmate is judas iscariot  round 1 – caïna this round is named after cain who killed his own brother in the first act of murder  gen 48 this round houses the traitors to their kindred they have their necks and heads out of the ice and are allowed to bow their heads allowing some protection from the freezing wind here dante sees the brothers alessandro and napoleone degli alberti who killed each other over their inheritance and their politics some time between 1282 and 1286 camiscion de pazzi a ghibelline who murdered his kinsman ubertino identifies several other sinners mordred traitorous nephew of king arthur  vanni de cancellieri nicknamed focaccia a white guelph of pistoia who killed his cousin detto de cancellieri and sassol mascheroni of the noble toschi family of florence murdered a relative camicion is aware that in july 1302 his relative carlino de pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the castle of piantravigne to the blacks betraying the whites as a traitor to his party carlino belongs in antenora the next circle down – his greater sin will make camiscion look virtuous by comparison 98ugolino and his sons by jeanbaptiste carpeaux  metropolitan museum of art depicts ugolino della gherardesca s story from canto xxxiii imprisoned for treachery ugolino starves to death with his children who before dying beg him to eat their bodies round 2 – antenora the second round is named after antenor a trojan soldier who betrayed his city to the greeks here lie the traitors to their country those who committed treason against political entities parties cities or countries have their heads above the ice but they cannot bend their necks dante accidentally kicks the head of bocca degli abati a traitorous guelph of florence and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met also punished in this level are buoso da duera ghibelline leader bribed by the french to betray manfred king of naples tesauro dei beccheria a ghibelline of pavia beheaded by the florentine guelphs for treason in 1258 gianni de soldanieri noble florentine ghibelline who joined with the guelphs after manfreds death in 1266 ganelon betrayed the rear guard of charlemagne to the muslims at roncesvalles  and tebaldello de zambrasi of faenza a ghibelline who turned his city over to the bolognese guelphs on nov 13 1280 the poets then see two heads frozen in one hole one gnawing the nape of the others neck canto xxxiii the gnawing sinner tells his story he is count ugolino and the head he gnaws belongs to archbishop ruggieri in the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the inferno  99 ugolino describes how he conspired with ruggieri in 1288 to oust his nephew and take control over the guelphs of pisa however as soon as nino was gone the archbishop sensing the guelphs weakened position turned on ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the torre dei gualandi in march 1289 the archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower round 3 – ptolomaea the third region of cocytus is named after ptolemy who invited his fatherinlaw simon maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them  1 maccabees 16 100 traitors to their guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied them dante encounters fra alberigo one of the jovial friars and a native of faenza who asks dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes in 1285 alberigo invited his opponents manfred his brother and alberghetto manfreds son to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests he explains that often a living persons soul falls to ptolomea before he dies before dark atropos has cut their thread  101  then on earth a demon inhabits the body until the bodys natural death fra alberigos sin is identical in kind to that of branca doria a genoese ghibelline who in 1275 invited his fatherinlaw michel zanche seen in the eighth circle bolgia 5 and had him cut to pieces branca that is his earthly body did not die until 1325 but his soul together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery fell to ptolomaea before michel zanches soul arrived at the bolgia of the barrators dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear fra alberigos eyes of ice and yet i did not open them for him  and it was courtesy to show him rudeness 102  canto xxxivround 4 – judecca the fourth division of cocytus named for judas iscariot contains the traitors to their lords and benefactors upon entry into this round virgil says  vexilla regis prodeunt inferni  the banners of the king of hell draw closer 103 judecca is completely silent all of the sinners are fully encapsulated in ice distorted and twisted in every conceivable position the sinners present an image of utter immobility it is impossible to talk with any of them so dante and virgil quickly move on to the centre of hell centre of hell  editsatan in the inferno is trapped in the frozen central zone in the ninth circle of hell canto xxxiv  gustave dorésee also dantes satan in the very centre of hell condemned for committing the ultimate sin personal treachery against god is the devil referred to by virgil as dis the roman god of the underworld the name dis was often used for pluto in antiquity such as in virgils aeneid  the archtraitor lucifer was once held by god to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against god resulting in his expulsion from heaven lucifer is a giant terrifying beast trapped waistdeep in the ice fixed and suffering he has three faces each a different color one red the middle one a pale yellow the right and one black the left he had three faces one in front bloodred and then another two that just above the midpoint of each shoulder joined the first and at the crown all three were reattached the right looked somewhat yellow somewhat white the left in its appearance was like those who come from where the nile descending flows 104dorothy l sayers notes that satans three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three human races red for the europeans from japheth  yellow for the asiatic from shem  and black for the african the race of ham  105 all interpretations recognize that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the trinity satan is impotent ignorant and full of hate in contrast to the allpowerful allknowing and allloving nature of god 105 lucifer retains his six wings he originally belonged to the angelic order of seraphim described in isaiah 62 but these are now dark bat like and futile the icy wind that emanates from the beating of lucifers wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake he weeps from his six eyes and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor marcus junius brutus and gaius cassius longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths respectively for their involvement in the assassination of julius caesar march 15 44 bc – an act which to dante represented the destruction of a unified italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world 105 in the central most vicious mouth is judas iscariot the apostle who betrayed christ judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors his head is gnawed inside lucifers mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by lucifers claws according to dorothy l sayers just as judas figures treason against god so brutus and cassius figure treason against maninsociety or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the divine and the secular government of the world 105at about 600 pm on saturday evening virgil and dante begin their escape from hell by clambering down satans ragged fur feetfirst when they reach satans genitalia the poets pass through the center of the universe and of gravity from the northern hemisphere of land to the southern hemisphere of water when virgil changes direction and begins to climb upward towards the surface of the earth at the antipodes dante in his confusion initially believes they are returning to hell virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the canonical hours of prime 6 am and terce 9 am – that is 730 am of the same holy saturday which was just about to end dante is confused as to how after about an hour and a half of climbing it is now apparently morning virgil explains that as a result of passing through the earths center into the southern hemisphere which is twelve hours ahead of jerusalem the central city of the northern hemisphere where therefore it is currently 730 pm virgil goes on to explain how the southern hemisphere was once covered with dry land but the land recoiled in horror to the north when lucifer fell from heaven and was replaced by the ocean meanwhile the inner rock lucifer displaced as he plunged into the center of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the southern hemisphere to avoid contact with him forming the mountain of purgatory this mountain – the only land mass in the waters of the southern hemisphere – rises above the surface at a point directly opposite jerusalem the poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of cocytus and the underside of the earth above 106 moving in opposition to lethe the river of oblivion which flows down from the summit of mount purgatory the poets finally emerge a little before dawn on the morning of easter sunday april 10 1300 a d beneath a sky studded with stars illustrations  editseries of woodcuts
