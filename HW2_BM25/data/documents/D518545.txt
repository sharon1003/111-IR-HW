maya textiles from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search maya textiles are the clothing and other textile arts of the maya peoples indigenous peoples of the yucatán peninsula in mexico guatemala honduras el salvador and belize women have traditionally created textiles in maya society and textiles were a significant form of ancient maya art and religious beliefs they were considered a prestige good that would distinguish the commoners from the elite 1 according to brumfiel some of the earliest weaving found in mesoamerica can date back to around 1000800 b c e 2contents  hide 1

editancient maya women had two natural types of cotton to work with one white and the other light brown called cuyuscate both of which were commonly dyed the preparation of cotton for spinning was very burdensome as it had to be washed and picked clean of seeds the cotton was usually associated with the elites 3elite women were also given the opportunity to work with the most expensive feathers and pearl beads however women of the elite not only had to prepare the best clothing for their families but they also had to be talented in weaving tapestry brocade embroidery and tiedyeing for tribute to other families and rulers weavers had three different natural dyes to work with women also worked with maguey this fiber was “another commonly spun material and depending on the species used and the number of production steps it could produce either cluded human and animal hair rabbit and dog feathers and vegetable fibers such as milkweed and chichicastle a fibrous nettle native to southern méxico also known as mala mujer ” 4 maguey was of major value as a cordage material used for horse gear nets hammocks and bags until the nineteenth century most dyed threads were naturally dyed but now in current times guatemalan weavers prefer and heavily rely on “commercial and handspun yarns dyed with mollusk dye ” 5 as stated by brumfiel the use of these easier to acquire materials “reduces the time needed for cloth production by twothirds to threequarters… making it possible for weavers to devote more time to the actual weaving process” when using a backstrap loom 6 instead focusing most of their time on creating the dyes and dyeing the cotton or maguey now mollusk dye or acrylic thread threads speedup the overall process another reason for using chemically dyed threads is because the “colors are brighter and do not fade with wear washing and exposure to the sun as readily as do naturally dyed threads” 7process  editin woven textiles the first step is preparing fiber which can come from plants such as cotton or maguey or animals such as wool from sheep in mesoamerica only plant fibers were available before european contact the loose fibers are spun into threads by hand with spindles a long sticklike device for holding the thread and whorls a weight held on the spindle to increase its motion 8 there were two kinds of looms used for weaving “the foot loom and the backstrap loom the latter is almost invariably used by women who attach one end of the loom to a tree or post and fix the other end behind their lower back for this reason the width of the textile is constrained by what the particular woman can manage until the fairly recent past foot looms were operated mostly by men but this practice is changing the threads are made of cotton although silk is frequently interwoven with cotton in textiles destined for ceremonial use” 9in the precolumbian era mayan women exclusively wove with backstrap looms that use sticks and straps worn around ones waist to create tension as written by mahler the backstrap loom in use before european contact and still used by some weavers today cannot even exist on its own without the support of a convenient upright at one end and the weaver’s body at the other the weaver controls the tension by the direction in which she moves her body and opens and closes the sheds in which weft threads are inserted by lifting heddles placing and rotating the wooden batten and using other handheld implements as needed… ‘the loom itself appears to be a simple device when the cloth is completed nothing remains of the loom except a pile of sticks’ yet studies of this technology have argued that it is really ‘a complex device more responsive to the weaver’s creative impulses than the modern treadle loom’… introduced into the region by the spanish 10after european contact treadle looms were introduced although backstrap looms continue to be popular 11 there had to be specific bodily discipline like stillness balance and kneeling for a long time in order to use the backstrap looms correctly which would end up defining “the proper physical comportment for women” 12 bone picks were used before contact and were unique in that they had different designs for most families and were usually passed on from generation to generation with the elite having the most expensive and beautiful traditional precontact

history preclassic maya classic maya collapse spanish conquest of the maya yucatán chiapas guatemala peténv t e in the maya civilization a man’s typical dress was a cotton breechcloth wrapped around his waist and sometimes a sleeveless shirt either white or dyed in colours in the twentieth century traditional male attire was characterized by some articles that were specific to a couple of towns this included a saco wool jacket or capixaij tunic pantalones trousers camisa shirt belt or banda sash and rodillera wool hip cloth 13a woman typically wore a traje which combined a huipil and a corte a woven wraparound skirt that reached her ankles 14 the traje was held together with a faja or sash worn at the waist 15 both women and men wore sandals when the weather was temperate mayan clothing was needed less as protection from the elements and more for personal adornment maya clerics and other dignitaries wore elaborate outfits with jewellery maya farmers wore minimal clothing men wore plain loincloths or a band of cloth winded around their waists some wore moccasins made of deerhide women possessed two items of clothing a length of ornamented material with holes made for the arms and head known as a kub both genders wore a heavier rectangle of cloth as a manta that functioned as an overwrap on cool days and as blanket at night the manta also served as a blind across the door huipil  editthe most prevalent and influential aspect of women’s clothing in ancient times is the huipil which is still prominent in guatemalan and mexican culture today the huipil is a loose rectangular garment with a hole in the middle for the head made from lightweight sheer cotton the huipil is usually white with colorful crossstripping and zigzag designs woven into the cloth using the brocade technique still commonly used today the huipil could be worn loose or tucked into a skirt this depends on the varying lengths of the huipil 16 huipils often are used to display one’s religion andor community affiliation different communities tend to have different designs colors and lengths as well as particular huipils for ceremonial purposes it was uncommon and often disgraceful to wear a huipil design from another community within one’s village although it was a sign of respect to wear a community’s huipil when visiting another village textiles produced by weavers within mayan communities tend to have similar recognizable traits unique to that community however weavers are not restricted in their creativity instead the community design serves as an outline for what women should have and then within the community design weavers can implement a variety of personal details to create an individual finished product one common theme is to express praise to different kiuggkes animals around the collar 17hair sash  editdetail of hair sash being brocaded on a jakaltek maya backstrap loom the hair sash is often the only part of the traditional outfit that is still locally woven by women on a backstrap loom each ethnic group not only has their own way of wearing the hair sash interlaced or wrapped around their long hair but colours motifs widths and the manner of setting up the loom and incorporating the geometric and figurative designs into the cloth are distinct elaborate hair sashes woven of finer thread with more complex imagery are worn on special occasions 18ideological aspects  editclassic maya clothing displays its full variety in the context of religious performance the deities themselves and their human impersonators were recognizable by their dress a good example of this is the tonsured maize god who wore a netted overskirt consisting of green jade beads and a belt consisting of a large spondylus shell covering the loins and who was repeatedly impersonated by the king as well as the queen legislative protection  editin 2011 efrain asij president of guatemalas commission for culture proposed legislative changes in favor of protecting textiles produced by indigenous communities 19 he touted the textiles economic value to the women of these mayan communities as well as the cultural heritage represented in these designs asij stated that traditional woven mayan designs are in danger of losing their cultural significance and economic value because of piracy and counterfeit production of mayan garments 20 he calls for the creation of schools designed to create the next generation of guatemalan weavers in order to ensure that this ancient and sacred art continues to be valued 19  he also proposes that a study be conducted that would track sales of mayan garments specifically to locate problems of exploitation of their designs and how these designs are sold 19 asij also proposed that mayan communities be allowed to import their manufacturing equipment taxfree 19 mayan communities could also purchase advertising and export their textiles from guatemala taxfree as well 19 all departments of guatemalas government are expected to promote and participate in the protection of traditional mayan textile production 19in 2016 legislative changes were presented to guatemalas national government by the national movement of maya weavers a coalition of weavers from all over guatemala 21 30 weaving cooperatives from 18 linguistic communities in guatemala are supporting the movement which is led by the women’s association for development of sacatepequez known in its spanish acronym as afedes 21 they argue that corporations have been exploiting their culture by mass producing their designs which ultimately devalues and degrades their sacredness and they are calling for revamped legislative protection that grants each mayan community collective intellectual ownership of their traditional designs 21current day textiles  editin current day mayan textiles much has changed in the fields of design technique and materials the kaqchikel and kiche are two specific ethniclinguistic groups that still have strong weaving traditions 22 according to schevill “field studies reveal that many of the design decisions which a weaver must make in producing a garment are spontaneous often the only conscious decision made prior to beginning the weaving process is the selection of the colors for the background fabric” 23 patterns would signify specific ethnic groups and social status but now a days the patterns are less strict and more creativity filled for other groups “local tradition dictates at least the overall composition of garments although deviation from these aesthetic norms is not strictly forbidden it does leave the weaver open to ridicule or gossip 24apart from more freehand designs new materials are being introduced into the textiles for example textiles now “include the use of imported rickrack ribbons metallic threads variegated embroidery floss and velvet edgings on handloomed garments all of these can be seen as inventive freeplay on the part of the indigenous artist” 25the mayan women weavers of textiles are the ones who for the most part stick to tradition and wear the trajes the mayan men have declined in their usage of traditional mayan clothing mainly because they want to avoid ladino harassment while “women… continue to wear indigenous styles of clothing to symbolize their work of bearing and enculturating the next generation and thus perpetuating mayan culture 26see also  edittextiles of oaxaca notes  edit brumfiel elizabeth m cloth gender continuity and change fabricating unity in anthropology american anthropologist new series 108 no 4 2006
