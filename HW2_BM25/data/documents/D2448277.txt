say end to end is spanning your vlan over a wan but what is distributed vlan also what are characteristics of these i was taking a practice exam and one answer for local vlan was 2080 i was very confused on this because doesnt this say that only 20 percent of traffic should be local732 views tags join this discussion now log in  register1 re types of vlans steven davidson feb 19 2014 238 pm  in response to steven williams steveni wouldnt necessarily characterize endtoend to mean spanning a vlan across the wan ive always looked at endtoend to mean spanning your vlan across your core for example suppose you created the coredistributionaccess design lets say you had 3 distribution blocks all connecting to the core block endtoend means that the vlan the same l2 broadcast domain can be in any or all of the three distribution blocks this is bad because a bridging issue can crash the core by maintaining a local vlan design you limit your bridging issues to a single distribution block if you take the approach further and separate the access blocks from the distribution blocks using l3 then you isolate your spanning tree to just the access closet like  0 actions join this discussion

only significant to a specific switch block it follows the idea that only 20 of the traffic stays in the switch block while 80 traverses the core with this you keep spanning tree out of the core which is always an optimal designendtoend means one vlan spans multiple switch blocks this is basically the opposite of local 80 stays local while 20 goes to the corenot sure about distributed like  0

traffic can stay locally 80 in like a campus environment and only 20 transverses the core but how much of this is still true these days with sometimes the dc and resources being on the other side of the core to the dc distro layer like  0 actions join this discussion now log in  register4 re types of vlans dmcneil feb 20 2014 1103 am  in response to steven williams thats kind of the point of the modular network design concepts it used to be when the internet was young servers resided on the local segment with users example a file server would be connected to the same access switch as the clients who needed to access it thus roughly 80 of the traffic would stay local because the clients didnt need to go off their local segment to access the server resources they required the trend with the internet and centrally located server farms and data centers mucks that all up now the client must leave its local segment in order to access the same server resources and more importantly the internet the modular network design concept helps deal with aggregating all that traffic into logical parts so you end up with the access distribution and core layers a switch block isnt a group of access layer switches its a group of access switches and the distribution switch es to which they connect so multiple switch blocks dont really connect at the distribution layer in a perfect world they connect at the core layer for various reasons the dc distribution layer and the campus distribution layer are linked by the core layer switches think of it as there being a core layer and all other distribution switch blocks connect to it so buildindg a and b both have two access layer switches that connect to a pair of distribution layer switches then you have a dc that has some access layer switches that connect to a pair of distribution layer switches all of these distribtion layer switches only would need dual connections to your core switches thats 6 switches and 12 links when planning your vlan design you have to think about where on your network is traffic going to go if you have vlan 200 where is it going can it stay only in building a and never have to go to the core if so then thats a local vlan this means that outside of building a vlan 200 has absolutely no meaning or use no device in building b needs to access resources from vlan 200 on the same subnet meaning all of the protocols and services can be routed however what if vlan 300 has a ton of a certain kind of fruit based devices that rely on a nonroutable protocol based on a french greeting namely apple devices and the bonjour protocol if you want airprint services or even airplay and apple tv devices to work optimally you have to have them on the same subnet or implement some complex mdns responder service this means that vlan 300 in buildin a needs to be the same as vlan 300 in building b what is the only way for building a and b to communicate with each other their traffic must traverse the core layer how do you span vlans across multiple switches trunk ports now your layer 2 vlan spreads from endtoend meaning vlan 300 reaches across the core into multiple switch blocks this is not the recommended design because you run the risk of causing stp issues in the core layer also routing protocols converge much faster than stp hthlike  0 actions join this discussion now log in  register5

necessarily classify these as different types of vlans but different designs i will say that there are some specific cost challenges around confining vlans to single access layer switches like  0

require more costs that end to end vlans like  0 actions join this discussion now log in  register go to original post
