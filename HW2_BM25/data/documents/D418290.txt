by burak guzel 26 jan 2010 difficulty intermediate length medium languages web development cronjobs cron jobs are used for scheduling tasks to run on the server theyre most commonly used for automating system maintenance or administration however they are also relevant to web application development there are many situations when a web application may need certain tasks to run periodically today we are going to explore the fundamentals of cron jobs definitions first lets familiarize ourselves with the terms related to this subject cron is a timebased job scheduler in unixlike operating systems linux free bsd mac os etc and these jobs or tasks are referred to as cron jobs there is a cron daemon that runs on these systems a daemon is a program that runs in the background all the time usually initiated by the system this cron daemon is responsible for launching these cron jobs on schedule the schedule resides in a configuration file named crontab thats where all the tasks and their timers are listed why use cron jobs server admins have been using cron jobs for a long time but since the target audience of this article is web developers lets look at a few use cases of cron jobs that are relevant in this area if you have a membership site where accounts have expiration dates you can schedule cron jobs to regularly deactivate or delete accounts that are past their expiration dates you can send out daily newsletter emails if you have summary tables or materialized views in your database they can be regularly updated with a cron job for example you may store every web page hit in a table but another summary table may contain daily traffic summaries you can expire and erase cached data files in a certain interval you can autocheck your website content for broken links and have a report emailed to yourself regularly you can schedule longrunning tasks to run from a command line script rather than running it from a web script like encoding videos or sending out mass emails you can even perform something as simple as fetching your most recent tweets to be cached in a text file syntax here is a simple cron job1 10     usrbinphp wwwvirtualusernamecronphp  devnull 21there are two main parts the first part is 10     this is where we schedule the timer the rest of the line is the command as it would run from the command line the command itself in this example has three partsusrbinphp php scripts usually are not executable by themselves therefore we need to run it through the php parserwwwvirtualusernamecronphp this is just the path to the script  devnull 21 this part is handling the output of the script more on this later timing syntax this is the first part of the cron job string as mentioned above it determines how often and when the cron job is going to run it consists of five partsminutehourday of monthmonthday of week here is an illustration asterisk quite often you will see an asterisk  instead of a number this represents all possible numbers for that position for example asterisk in the minute position would make it run every minute we need to look at a few examples to fully understand this syntax examples this cron job will run every minute all the time1      commandthis cron job will run at minute zero every hour ie an hourly cron job1 0     commandthis is also an hourly cron job but run at minute 15 instead ie 0015 0115 0215 etc 1 15     commandthis will run once a day at 230am1 30 2    commandthis will run once a month on the second day of the month at midnight ie january 2nd 1200am february 2nd 1200am etc 1 0 0 2   commandthis will run on mondays every hour ie 24 times in one day but only on mondays1 0    1 commandyou can use multiple numbers separated by commas this will run three times every hour at minutes 0 10 and 201 01020     commanddivision operator is also used this will run 12 times per hour ie every 5 minutes1 5     commanddash can be used to specify a range this will run once every hour between 500am and 1000am1 0 510    commandalso there is a special keyword that will let you run a cron job every time the server is rebooted1 reboot commandsetting up and managing cron jobs there are a few different ways to create and manage your cron jobs control panels many web hosting companies provide control panels for their customers if you are one of them you might be able to find a section in your control panel to manage your cron jobs editing the crontab running this command will launch vi text editor and will let you edit the contents of the crontab1 crontab e so it would help to be familiar with the basic vi commands as it is quite different than any other text editor you might have worked with if you would just like to see the existing crontab without editing it you can run this command1 crontab l to delete the contents of the crontab1 crontab r loading a file you can write all of your cron jobs into a file and then push it into the crontab1 crontab crontxt be careful because this will overwrite all existing cron jobs with this files contents without warning comments you can add comments followed by the  character12 this cron job does something very important10     usrbinphp wwwvirtualusernamecronphp  devnull 21setting the email as i mentioned earlier by default the output from the crons get sent via email unless you discard them or redirect them to a file the mailto setting lets you set or change which email address to send them to123mailtousernameexamplecom this cron job does something very important10     usrbinphp wwwvirtualusernamecronphp  devnull 21using the php parser cgi scripts are executable by default but php scripts are not they need to run through the php parser thats why we need to put the path to the parser before the path of the script1      usrbinphp path to php scriptsometimes it might be under another location like usrlocalbinphp to find out you can try running this in the command line1 which php handling the output if you do not handle the output of the cron script it will send them as emails to your user account on the server discarding output if you put  devnull 21 at the end of the cron job command or any command the output will be discarded the closing bracket  is used for redirecting output devnull is like a black hole for output anything that goes there is ignored by the system this part 21 causes the stderr error output to be redirected to the stdout normal output so that also ends up in the devnull outputting to a file to store the cron output in a file use the closing bracket  again1 10     usrbinphp wwwvirtualusernamecronphp  varlogcronlog that will rewrite the output file every time if you would like to append the output at the end of the file instead of a complete rewrite use double closing bracket  instead1 10     usrbinphp wwwvirtualusernamecronphp  varlogcronlog executable scripts normally you need to specify the parser at the beginning of the command as we have been doing but there is actually a way to make your php scripts executable from the command line like a cgi script you need is to add the path to the parser as the first line of the script12345678usrlocalbinphpphpecho hello worldn also make sure to set proper chmod like 755 to make the file executable when you have an executable script the cron job can be shorter like this1 10     wwwvirtualusernamehellophp preventing cron job collision in some cases you may have frequent running cron jobs and you may not want them to collide if they take longer to run than the frequency itself for example you may have a cron job running every minute yet every once in a while it may take longer than one minute to run this can cause another instance of the same cron script to start running before the previous one finishes you can create too many busy processes this way and possibly crash the server if they keep slowing down each other and cause even more processes to be created over time this problem can be addressed via file locking and more specifically the nonblocking locknb type of file locks if you are not familiar with file locking i suggest you read about it first you can add this code to the cron job script01020304050607080910fp  fopen  tmplocktxt r if  flock  fp lockex  locknb echo unable to obtain lockexit 1  fclose  fp with regular file locks the flock  function call would block the script if there is an existing lock and it would release once that lock is gone however with a nonblocking lock such as in the code above the function call does not stop the script but it immediately returns false if there is an existing lock so in this case we can immediately exit the script when we see there is an existing lock which indicates that another cron job is currently running blocking web access to cron jobs when you write a cron job in a web scripting language like php you may want to make sure that nobody can execute it by just loading it from their browser one easy option would be to store these script outside of your web folder however this may not be practical or preferable for some developers if they want to keep their cron job scripts right within their web application folders if you put all of the cron job scripts in a folder you block access by putting this line in an htaccess file1 deny from all or you can also deny access to scripts on an individual basis by putting this line at the beginning1 if isset  server  remoteaddr  die  permission denied this will ensure that when the script is accessed from the web it will abort
