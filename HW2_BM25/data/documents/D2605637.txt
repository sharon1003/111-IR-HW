chemicals to use it youll need to take out the small force guarding the nearby platform drop in on them and take out the six soldiers as four combat experts join the fray if youve played previous arkham games they behave much like ninjas and will alternate regular attacks with slicing attacks that must be dodged for all three swipes they will also seek to confuse you by hopping off railing walls and each other to leap at you  though they can still be countered when the guards are dealt with use the crane controls to move the ramp up to the higher platform and place it on the edge where your batmobile can drive off the ramp and up to the road on the other side drive into the next open section of the plant to find eight more drones including rattler tanks that shoot three cannon shots at different angles try to hide in between their shots while you take them out and build up your combo meter to take them out instantly when the drones are gone youll need to find a new way in to find the workers in the building start by checking out the enemies watching you from the loading dock window and eject from the batmobile to crash in through the windows among the 6 enemies here is a combat medic who will try to revive fallen militia after youve knocked them out make him your number one priority and try leading him towards an environmental takedown to take him out of the fight early search the back wall for a sealed up portion and blow it open with some explosive gel youll be blocked by several gas vents however so to find a way around use the remote batmobile controls notice the large pipe with the winch on it below batmans position pull it out to get rid of the gad and batman will find the next worker another one is close by but youll have to head down first blow up the floor on the far side of the room with more explosive gel to drop down into a room with more gas vents luckily this room also has a control panel to open shutters next to batman conveniently giving the batmobile room to fire on a sealed up wall blast it open and pull the pipe from the wall to give batman a way through to the next worker at the end of the hall youll find an elevator shaft with a wall panel batman can rewire to open the door to the shaft however the elevator isnt coming  so make the batmobile bring it up instead using the remote controls grab onto the elevators counterweight and put the car in reverse to pull the elevator up to the top where batman can climb in then slowly lower the elevator all way down by driving forward once out of the elevator youll find the last remaining worker alive being held by an assortment of thugs grapple up into the ceiling crawlspace and give them a nice surprise as you drop down into the next room your foes will include both a combat medic and sword wielding experts  so again try and make the medic your primary target as you take out the 10 bad guys talk to the surviving worker and follow him back to the elevator then pull it back up again with the batmobiles help boss fight  arkham knight s attack chopper as you leave the elevator the arkham knight will return in his vehicle flanked by several drones rattlers included focus your fire on the land drones first before turning your attention to the chopper since the arkham knight isnt actually in the cockpit your free to engage with your 60mm cannon the chopper will alternate launching missiles to the ground  so look for their trajectory on the ground to avoid them and watch for the choppers fly bys as it spits missiles out left and right the chopper will also seek to lock on to you with armor piercing missiles so when you here the alert switch to your rapid fire vulcan gun to take the missiles out before they launch in to you hit him with your best shots when hes stationary on either side and switch to your vulcan gun to attack when hes moving rapidly across the arena with enough firepower and smart dodging use your dodge thrusters constantly the chopper will explode and youll be free to bring the remaining worker back across to gordon ace chemicals part six sharei error 4 media source is incompatible with player or browser2058arkham knight chopper fight video guide once you get back inside ace chemicals its time for find scarecrow and stop him since the entrances to the main building are sealed  youll have to make your own blast the brick wall with the ace sign on it to make a new path and use the crane controls once more to lower the ramp onto the main road put it just above the keep clear letters and drive the batmobile into the new path drive down the road and take out the two drones waiting for you then continue on until you reach a sealed door eject out of the batmobile and fly above the door to find two enemies flanked by a rotating sentry turret these things are impossible to deal with head on so instead grapple into a wall grate and slide down below to get under the militia guards then preform a fear takedown while the sentry gun isnt looking quickly walk over and disable the sentry turret then find a nearby panel to break to open the doors drive down deeper into the plant until you find yet another sealed door and grapple above to find a large number of militia waiting for you theres a whopping twenty of them to contend with including two medics  but theres also an abundance of objects you can use for environmental takedowns which are especially useful when used on the medics when the thugs have been beaten use the nearby panel to let the batmobile in about 5 feet to another locked door use the batmobile to eject over the spikes and into the mixing chamber where the scarecrow waits this segment has 8 armed militia types patrolling the chamber with several of them tasked with moving tanks of fear toxin to and fro this is both a blessing and a curse as you can watch their movements to plan an ambush as long as you arent ambushed by an illtimed thug running by with a tank youll also find one sentry gun in a corner of the room so make sure to either give it a wide berth or silently disable it when nobody is around to catch you in the act when all foes have been dealt with enter the chamber to confront scarecrow following the events that transpire youll have to start trying to contain the impending reaction by moving large tanks of neutralizing agents into their designated receptacles on the far side of the room you need to pull them out move them across the room and put them in very slowly use the lights on the top to gauge how fast you are going and if you see red flashing lay off the movements and let it reset when you get to the final tank pull it out to find that scarecrows fear toxin is manifesting itself in very interesting ways flashback
