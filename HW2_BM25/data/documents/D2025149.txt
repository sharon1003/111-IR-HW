never too late to reinvent yourself – just look at jane fonda for proof in her 20s she became a hollywood sex symbol with barbarella in her 30s she was hanoi jane a woman known for her fierce opposition to the vietnam war and marriage to prominent antiwar activist tom hayden and in her 50s she quit acting to live with billionaire media mogul and cnn founder ted turner a long and rewarding career jane fonda but it took her another decade following divorce from turner in 2001 to find the peace of mind that eluded her for most of her tumultuous life for many years i was always trying to please others especially men now i have more passion and curiosity than ever my 70s have been pretty good for me plagued by chronic selfdoubts eating disorders and the lingering psychological fallout from childhood sexual abuse which she has only just revealed fonda has weathered enough crises to give her the kind of confidence that comes with knowing that you can survive jane fonda and lily tomlin in grace and frankie on the heels of her performance in paolo sorrentinos acclaimed 2015 film youth and her threeseason arc in aaron sorkins tv series the newsroom fonda has been rediscovering the joy of acting in grace and frankie the netflix comedy series now in its third season the show reunites the 79yearold actress with lily tomlin two years her junior who costarred opposite her and dolly parton in the hit 1980 comedy 9 to 5 and gives fonda a chance to explore some of the existential issues faced by women her age this is about women getting older and having the rug pulled out from under them she says suddenly they have to ask themselves who am i what kind of future is there for them fondas grace and tomlins frankie make a memorable acting partnership and the relationship between their characters parallels an offscreen friendship that has ebbed and flowed over the course of nearly four decades fonda is grateful that the series has brought them closer together were friends so i see her socially but its a joy to work with lily and its very easy our characters are two women who dont like each other at all in the beginning at least were thrown together and its fun to explore how they handle that were very different as characters and as friends but we get along great i come from a long line of depressed people and lily has a true funnybone so i get to spend time with someone whose take on everything comes from a place of funny which for me is total catharsis i mean its just fabulous the series has also extended fondas unexpected professional rebirth there arent very many movie roles available and i dont want to do crap projects just to keep busy the film industry has changed so much since i was making movies like coming home and klute as ive gotten older ive realised the importance of friendships and especially female friendships you could never make those films today television has given older women a chance to extend their careers and do interesting work im very happy to be working as often as i have been in my 70s and its been a pleasant surprise the series has reinforced many of the life lessons fonda has learnt over time not only has it meant coming to terms with issues of emotional abandonment but she is also proud of how grace and frankie has made the topic of friendships between women one of its key themes i wouldnt know what i would do without my women friends says fonda as ive gotten older ive realised the importance of friendships and especially female friendships people also arent used to seeing women as friends although its changing even though we fight a lot in the series we support each other and know that we need each other and have each others backs women also have an advantage over men in that we do tend to form these kinds of friendships that often men dont have women have spiritual friendships that go very deep one of the developments in series three is how grace and frankie become partners in a new business venture involving the sale of sex toys at the end of season two someone gives us presents and my present is a vibrator grace has never used a vibrator before and she ends up with carpal tunnel syndrome and our families make fun of us and we say were going to go into business and the business we go into is making vibrators for older women but the problem is you see grace is a real businesswoman frankie cant even add up her chequebook and shes into vaginal lubrication which she makes out of yams which i had thought was jam and put on my toast but anyway she keeps raising the wrong subject because i want to push with the vibrators this kind of casual openness about somewhat risqué topics is characteristic of fonda the former fitness guru who became a symbol of the 80s workout craze when her jane fondas original workout video sold 17 million copies has always been brutally – some might say ruthlessly – frank about herself and any number of political issues shes an ardent feminist and ecowarrior who recently attended a protest rally in alberta canada to protest that regionss massive oil sands development project but perhaps the most consistent target of her critical gaze is herself she was only 12 when her mother frances ford seymour – the second of her actor father henrys five wives – died while a patient at a mental hospital jane was told by her father that a heart attack was the cause of death but several months later she was further traumatised when she read in a magazine that her mother had committed suicide though she grew closer to her father while making on golden pond with him and in the months prior to his death fonda admits that her ability to show and appreciate affection has always been problematic love has always been complicated for me you dont realise it when youre young it was never simple it is simple for some – if a child grows up in a family where the parents look them in the eye and reflect the child back to itself with love then love will be easy for that child if that isnt there when youre little love will be very hard that doesnt mean that your parents are bad its just they never got it themselves its generational so what you learn as you get older is to try to break the cycle fortunately fonda has made great strides towards celebrating her life and being able to enjoy a brilliant third act both professionally and personally whats great about a tv series is that you go to work every day – its a steady job so when the hours are long and its hard on my feet i remind myself you wanted this youve got it be grateful love every moment in the meantime fonda has a new film in the pipeline our souls at night a drama that sees her renew her screen collaboration with robert redford who last worked with her on the electric horseman back in 1979 she has confessed to having been smitten with redford during the making of 1967s barefoot in the park i was so in love with bob nothing ever happened between us but he certainly was fabulous to kiss this time out the netflix feature has fonda pay an unexpected visit to her widower neighbour redford and they decide to make the most of the time they have left there is plenty of kissing in the film and one wonders if she has any regrets about a missed opportunity in her love life no but a few years ago i mentioned to redford that i would like to do a followup to barefoot in the park i told him we could go in slippers comments are not open on this article morning  afternoon newsletter delivered mon–fri by signing up you accept our privacy policy and conditions
