might be wondering why i am only now reviewing the camera especially given the fact that it has already been replaced by the nikon d4s while working on the d4s review i thought that it would be a good idea to revisit the older d4 – better late than never since the camera came out i have used it on several occasions for both personal and business needs and a number of our team members have owned or still own the d4 hence the information and images that i gathered for this review represent a collective effort between our team at photography life being a topoftheline dslr from nikon the d4 is a specialized tool that is primarily targeted at news sports and wildlife photographers with a 16 mp sensor that is capable of capturing images all the way to iso 204800 up to 11 frames per second continuous shooting speed a huge buffer for photographing fast action a solid allmetal construction and a highend ergonomic design the nikon d4 is a serious camera for serious needs after owning the nikon d3s for 4 years i really struggled with the decision to upgrade to the d4 the thing is back when the d3s came out nikon only had the d700 as the lowerend fx option which was noticeably worse in image quality so if one wanted to get the best image quality the only option was to move up to the d3s at 5200 there was a bit more than 2k price difference between the d700 and the d3s when the d4 came out nikon pushed its price up higher to 6k which was double the price of then newlyannounced d800 and if you remember that timeframe the d800 generated so much buzz in the industry that it practically depopularized the highend line and put it in the shadows personally i went for the d800 at the time and spent a considerable amount of time working with the camera it was a great buy at 3k and i did not see much reason to move up to the twice more expensive d4 especially after seeing high resolution sensor advantages and realizing that the d4 did not offer significant image quality improvements over the d3s putting 6k towards a camera that was only marginally better in image quality than my d3s and came with a few unwelcome changes such as the xqd card slot and small canonlike joysticks more on this further down below was a hard pill to swallow so i decided to skip a generation and see if a future model would offer better value and with lola’s wedding business growth i found myself shooting wildlife a lot less shifting more towards lifestyle and landscape photography the nikon d800 was superb for those needs and lola kept on using the d3s for her work and projects it worked out great as we had both a high iso king and a highresolution king in our arsenal eventually nikon released the df which was lola’s dream come true because it had similar image quality and pixellevel performance as the d4 minus the bulk and weight that’s when we decided to get rid of the d3s…while our story above reflects our decisions and reasoning why we chose not to get the d4 my wildlife friends were happy to move up to the d4 and they never regretted that decision the thing is for sports and wildlife needs the d4 was still the best nikon camera to get at the time with its super fast shooting speed and a huge buffer the d4 was the right tool for freezing those fast action moments had i kept my focus on wildlife photography i would have probably either upgraded to the d4 or the latest generation d4s since the d300s and d700 nikon kept its highend line protected by intentionally crippling lowerend cameras with slower fps and smaller buffers nikon d4  800mm f56  iso

camera specifications can be found at nikon usa2 camera construction and handling with a full magnesium alloy and weather sealed construction the nikon d4 surely does not disappoint just like all topoftheline nikon dslrs i have seen photographers accidentally drop their highend d3d3sd4 cameras i once dropped a d3s from 3 feet high bump them against hard surfaces or get every hole filled up with dust when photographing burning man and those cameras continued to work without any problems cameras like d4 are designed to be used heavily by professionals so they can withstand all kinds of physical abuse that’s why working pros prefer d4like cameras as they know they can rely on them in the most challenging conditions ergonomics and handlingwise the d4 went through significant changes when compared to the d3s some of these changes i really liked but others not so much the overall shape of the camera was completely changed making the d4 appear more curvy than the d3d3sd3x models the front of the camera went through the least number of changes the biggest change in the front was the grip – nikon redesigned the d4 grip so it feels better and deeper when handholding the camera another subtle change was the camera on  off switch  shutter release button which was angled lower to make shooting more comfortable the csm focus lever bottom left side of the camera was modified to adapt to a more modern switch like on other nikon dslrs there were some noticeable modifications to the camera connector panels – the nikon d4 has everything separated out by groups while the nikon d3s had a more consolidated look aside from standard ports the nikon d4 also came with a builtin ethernet port a real plus for shooting tethered in a studio which the d3s did not have the top of the camera went through a few design changes first the left dial was modified – the front of the dial on the d4 comes fully closed and only the rear of the dial is exposed the dial modes remained the same but there was a change on the top buttons – the “lock” button on the d3d3sd3x was replaced with a metering mode button i welcomed this change because the metering mode switch on the right side was eliminated as well after using the d4 for a few months i started to realize how much i hated the old metering mode switch on my d3s camera pressing the button and then rotating the metering mode dial was never comfortable so i was glad that this annoyance was finally taken care of the right side of the camera was also redesigned the shutter release button was located at a lower angle for comfort and the camera mode and exposure compensation buttons were moved up a little to make room for the new and small video recording button now let’s talk about the back of the camera which went through the most number of changes there are things i really like about what nikon did with the d4 back layoutdesign and things i don’t let’s start from what i believe are good changes nikon adapted a similar button layout as the d700 to the left of the lcd which is the ability to zoom in and out by pressing a button i remember when i first held the d3s in my hands i could not figure out how to zoom in i then realized that i had to press the zoom button and then use the dial on the back of the camera to zoom in and out what a pain it was the nikon d4 does not have this problem anymore – you just press the zoom in and zoom out buttons without having to rotate any dials and you want to zoom in to 100 magnification instantly you can program the middle button on the multiselector control just like on many other highend nikon dslrs the lockhelp button was moved up right under the menu button which i would rather have on the bottom because i never use it in addition all the new buttons are backlit which is great news for those of us that shoot in lowlight or at night nikon d4  850 mm f14  iso 200 11600 f28nikon d4  850 mm f14  iso 200 11250 f28the new lcd on the back of the camera has the same 921000 dot resolution as the one on the d3s but is now a little bigger in size by 02 inches diagonal the button placement under the lcd also went through some changes while the iso  qual  wb buttons are still in their respective places the audio record button has been moved to sit together in the same group the live view button was moved a little to the left now and has a lever for selecting between photo and video live view modes the vertical grip is now a lot more comfortable because the afon button has been moved deeper into the camera body this is great news because the old afon placement was never good to start with – i kept on accidentally pressing it while shooting horizontally and had to constantly turn it off when i was not using it nikon d4  240850 mm f3545  iso 200 1800 f80finally let’s talk about the rest of the buttons to the right side of the body and lcd the d4 introduced two new joysticks which nikon calls “subselector” just like canon has had on their highend cameras the joystick is borrowed from the mbd10 grip – one to use in horizontal position and one to use in vertical position the top joystick replaced the customizable aelafl button that was there on the d3s but you can still program the joystick to act as the aelafl button custom settings menucontrolsassign sub‐selector center i don’t know about others but i hate joysticks they are too darn small and uncomfortable to use nikon probably added the joysticks for the canon converts that wanted to have the same feel on nikon cameras the worst part about these joysticks is that they are not built well for regular use they are known to fall off and get lost which is quite poor craftsmanship for a 6k camera if you ask me…handling of the d4 is superb with the exception of its heavy weight and bulk for those that handhold the camera a lot although the d4 is a little lighter than the d3s it still weighs close to 12 kg compare that to the new nikon d750 which at 750 grams is almost 40 lighter – and those figures are without the large enel18 battery that weighs way more than the twice smaller enel15 while i loved the image quality of my previous nikon d3s neither lola nor i were happy with its weight when shooting those all day weddings especially when coupling the camera with something like the 70200mm f28g vr ii and a speedlight my neck and my back would get sore by the end of the day with all that weight yes i am comparing two different cameras with and without battery grips but that’s the part that you have to figure out for yourself – if using a standard profile dslr with a battery grip does not bother you you will love the d4 i personally quit using battery grips a while ago because i prefer the smaller and lighter cameras for my style of shooting at the same time the weight and bulk of professional camera bodies balance very well with long super telephoto lenses this goes for both handheld and tripod shooting when mounting the d4 on a gimbal head it balances easier than something like the d750 and you do not have to move the tripod leg to its tip just to get the balance right handholding something like the 200400mm f4g with the d4 is also easier on your hands because the setup is not very frontheavy although nikon has been redesigning their super telephoto line with lightweight fluorite elements making them comfortable to use with lighter camera bodies the older super telephoto lenses were all frontheavy just like all other topoftheline nikon dslrs the nikon d4 does not have a builtin camera flash while this is done primarily for better weathersealing it is a definite disadvantage if you have been using a builtin flash in emergency situations or perhaps as a master to trigger an offcamera speedlight it does not come with an af assist lamp either so you will have to use the ir beam of your speedlight when focusing in extremely dark environments as explained in this article nikon d4  850 mm f18  iso 110 1125 f323 xqd memory slot one big change that nikon introduced on the d4 was the xqd memory card slot although xqd is much better memory compared to cf due to its ability to push insane read and write speeds and it is also easier to use no more bent pins in my opinion nikon made a mistake by incorporating one xqd slot in the d4 why three reasons first nikon was the only vendor to try out the xqd format in a digital camera which made the d4 the only camera in the industry to use a different memory card format other than cf or sd it felt like it was an experiment rather than anything else because of this the availability of xqd memory cards and their readers was very limited at launch nikon ended up supplying people with xqd memory cards and readers with the d4 which i am sure only caused nikon more headaches second having two different slots significantly weakens the overall workflow process one has to find proper ways to store these xqd cards use them and access them together with cf cards nikon should have either picked two cf card slots or two xqd card slots to make the process consistent why should one have to carry separate memory card readers for cf and xqd lastly it has been almost three years since the xqd experiment started and the d4 and the d4s are still the only digital cameras in the world that use this format as far as i know aside from sony and lexar there are no other manufacturers that offer xqd memory cards and readers nikon should have either abandoned xqd after the d4 or made both slots xqd on the d4s« »related articles nikon d4s review a comprehensive
