microorganisms do not confuse antibodies with antibiotics what is the difference between antibodies and antibiotics antibodies are produced by the humanwhatever body naturally in response to specific foreign cells  bacteria or viruses antibiotics are produced by microorganisms cultured by man then processed and administered in a general hopeful way by a doctor as a drug in order to kill or prevent the reproduction of bacteria  but they are ineffective against viruses more specifically each antibody is produced by lymphocytes specialised white cells as a result of exposure to specific chemical substances mainly proteins and carbohydrates called antigens usually on the outside of an invading organism this is called the antigenantibody reaction socalled bcell lymphocytes produce the antibodies in response to tcells there are several sorts which participate more directly in recognising the foreign cells and chemically damaging them the antibodies are proteins immunoglobulins which are transported around the body in the bloodstream as part of the plasma protein what body system do lymphocytes originate from and what other functions does that system performlymphatic system  lymph vessels and lymph nodes spleen  thymus  closely related to the blood circulatory system also functions in processing of products of digestion of fats  oils lipids  connected to the lacteals inside villi in the small intestine ileumwhat name is given to the outside layer of viruses and what is it composed of chemicallycapsid  protein or envelope  protein lipid carbohydrate what name is given to the outside layer of bacteria and what is it composed of chemicallycell wall  protein and carbohydrate at the molecular level antibodies are known to be shaped like the letter y with a reactive site at the tip of each branch so that antibodies can become attached to antigens on the basis of their molecular shape rather like an enzyme and substrate this can cause the infecting microorganisms to stick together and neutralises them until they are taken away and dealt with by other white cells what name is given to the other white cells and how do they deal with the infecting microorganismsphagocytes  engulf ingest and digest them the production of antibodies can be used to explain  normal recovery from infection by bacteria or viruses  the primary immune response  immunity to a subsequent infection by the same organism  the secondary immune response  susceptibility to other microorganisms or different varieties or strains of the same microorganism why is there a gap in time between first infection and recovery it takes some time for the chain of events recognition of invaderscell division to make adequate numbers of the lymphocytes which produce the correct antibodies how can antibodies explain immunity to subsequent infection some white cells memory cells remain after beating an infection and are able to divide rapidly to produce more lymphocytes which will produce the correct antibodies so that the infection is quickly dealt with or not even noticed why are we susceptible to other ie different infecting microorganisms after our body has fought off an infection because other microorganisms have different antigens and the immune system must start again from scratch why do common diseases like the cold and flu sometimes come back again year after year often as epidemics different strains have different antigens on the outside so the bodys immune system may not be prepared for that specific strain so that it can get into cells and reproduce why is there great concern about the emergence of antibioticresistant strains of more virulent disease such as tuberculosis the bodys immune system alone was not enough to prevent epidemics of these diseases and treatment with antibiotics tipped the balance in our favour if strains of these pathogens are selected due to improper use of antibiotics there will be fewer medical alternatives what is the difference in biological terms between immunity and resistance immunity applies to a person or other organism who has an antibodybased protection against an infecting organism  bacterium or virus never say that a bacterium is immune to or has immunity to an antibiotic for instance resistance applies to the ability of a microorganism to survive the effects of an antibiotic it is a property of the pathogenic microorganism not a weakness or chemical property of the antibiotic and unrelated to the organism which is being infected  usually human or mans stock animals since resistance to antibiotics is likely to be genetically based there is fear that populations of resistant strains may become established never say that bacteria are spread or grow  examiners prefer to be told that bacteria reproduce asexually the antigenantibody reaction is also the basis for immunisation programs  vaccination  in which exposure to a related weakened or dead form of a pathogenic organism or even parts of its outer coat brings about an immune response which is similar to the bodys normal reaction to the more powerful or virulent form which would be difficult to fight off both of these  natural infection and exposure to vaccine  result in active immunity passive immunity is based on readymade antibodies for example babies obtain these from their mothers bloodstream and first milk colostrum  passive immunity may also be obtained via serum  derived from blood of organisms exposed to a pathogen the specificity of this antigenantibody reaction can be of even more use to man when it is further refined and developed the development of monoclonal antibodies the normal antigenantibody reaction described above is often the result of several antibodies produced in response to several different antigens on the surface of an invading microorganism since several different lymphocytes are involved in the production of a cocktail of antibodies these are known as polyclonal antibodies a method of using the specificity of action of single antibodies in the lab was recently discovered by cesar milstein and coworkers who made it possible to produce pure antibodies to almost any substance to order however they had to overcome a problem that lymphocytes only survive inside a living body  they cannot be grown in the laboratory in the same way that some other cells can in the laboratory an animal eg a mouse is exposed to the foreign substance which after a few days results in the production of a mixture of antibodies in response to the antigens responsible white cells are then extracted from the animal actually from its spleen  an organ which regulates many of the functions of blood and fused with cells taken from a cancerous tumour a detergent which lowers the surface tension is used together with gentle agitation how will this assist in the fusion process by chemically disrupting the cell membrane which contains lipids  and physically bringing cells close together allowing cytoplasm of tumour cells and lymphocytes to join together why is this fusion necessary this has to be done because antibodyproducing cells do not live long or divide in laboratory culture whereas cancer cells grow rapidly the reason they cause the tumour in the first place the result is a collection of cells including hybrid hybridoma cells which must be separated into single cells and then given the opportunity to grow into groups why is it a collection of cells and why must they be separated out there will be some unfused lymphocytes unfused tumour cells and even some double fusions of the same type there are also likely to be several different antibodyproducing lymphocytetumour hybrids each group of cells is called a clone because it is derived from a single cell these are then tested to see if they are producing antibodies for the particular target substance since they are genetically identical all the cells produce the same antibody which builds up in the nutrient medium surrounding the cells this is easily purified resulting in a product containing molecules of a single antibody  not a mixture since the final result is due to the action of many cells derived originally from a single lymphocyte cell these are called monoclonal antibodies what is the name of the nuclear process that takes place as the single cells divide to make a clonemitosis potential applications of monoclonal antibodies due the the specificity of their binding properties monoclonal antibodies may have a wide variety of possible uses possibilities include the following identification of odd substances produced by the body in special circumstances eg hormones produced in pregnancy or abnormal metabolites which enable screening for genetic abnormalities drugs etc and other health problems what is the name of the hormone produced in pregnancy on which pregnancy testing is basedhuman chorionic gonadotrophin h cg identification and quantification of circulating microorganisms possibly in small numbers or too small to see under the microscope eg infecting viruses industrial processing either by concentrating products which are needed or by removing unwanted substances for example blood products such as factor 8 which is needed by haemophiliacs could be processed using monoclonal antibodies in such a way as to avoid viruses which may be present in only a small number of cases but which pose a major problem when blood products are produced from a pooled source to target and identify neutralise or remove unwanted substances from the body especially the blood plasma examples might include drugs taken in overdose if a particular type of cancer with cells widespread in the body can be shown to have different antigens than ordinary cells then it may be possible to treat cancer by targeting only the unwanted cells in the body one way in which this could be done is by attaching poison to antibodies which will build up only in the cancer cells and killing them whilst having more or less no effect on ordinary cells which have different antigens the potent plant poison ricin has been investigated in this context reducing the possibility of rejection in transplants by more accurate tissue typing between recipient and possible donors home contents contact via form contact via email howlers books wwwlinks terms of use privacy
