lesson c1 factors that influence temperature printable copy overview students will draw on their previous knowledge and experience with weather to predict approximate temperatures around the world and in their home country and then compare their predictions with real world data then they will be provided with several factors that influence the annual temperature pattern of a region and develop hypotheses regarding how and why they think these factors influence temperature develop plans how they might investigate each factor objectives students will be able touse observations and prior knowledge to make predictionsinterpret realtime real world data from a mapunderstand that weather varies with location develop hypotheses for how and why several factors influence the annual temperature pattern of a region time one 45 minute class period materials weather learning log or student worksheet world map one per groupworlddwpdf 809kb  worlddwlgif 42kbcountry map one for each

limitedaccess if technology resources are limited you can either display the world temperature map on a projector  television or print color copies for each group backup prior to introducing this activity test the realtime data world temperature link if the map is not working use the backup site as described below review the following resources for information about the factors that influence the annual temperature patterns of a region globe seasons investigation the planetary forecaster  3 four factors that affect temperatureprocedure part 1 annual temperatures in your city  town begin by leading a brief class discussion with the students using the first one or two questions ie think of the hottest day you can remember etc this will get them thinking about the annual temperature patterns in their location after it is recommended to divide the students in pairs or small groups so they can share and discuss their predictions with each other however each student should be held responsible for answering each of the questions as an optional activity you can lead a whole class discussion after the pairssmall groups have answered the questions time permitting this can be an important role in assisting the students elaborate their thoughts about temperature part 2 temperatures around the world lead a brief class discussion with the students using the first one or two questions ie do you think the temperature is the same or different in other parts of the world etc this will get them thinking about the different temperatures around the world as above it is recommended to divide the students in pairs or small groups so they can share and discuss their predictions with each other however each student should be held responsible for answering each of the questions create a world and country temperature map distribute world and country maps to the studentsgroups see notes below for this activity tell them that they are going to illustrate the land masses continents on a world map according using the color key according to their predictions to further explain the instructions you should mention that they should illustrate the coldest regions blue the hottest region the pink etc after they complete the world map they should begin to work on the country maps using the same color key by completing this activity the students will begin to theorize about the various factors that influence annual temperature patterns of a region if you decide to arrange students in pairs or small groups you will need to have sufficient copies of the printable world map for each group for the country temperature map it is recommended that each student illustrate them individually so they can take them home and complete the homework assignment alternatively if they illustrate a country temperature map as a group they will need to work together as a group to complete the homework questions compare your world map to realworld temperatures students will now visit the world temperature map and compare it with the world maps they just illustrated you should mention that this is a composite image of the world that displays observed land temperatures the goal of comparing the two maps will be to provide the students with a taste of real world temperature data in a graphic format so that they will become further interested in learning about the factors that influence the annual temperature patterns of a region students should complete the questions to guide them in their comparison for the country temperature map students will complete them as a homework assignment part 3 factors that influence the annual temperature pattern of a region lead a brief class discussion with the students based on the venn diagram explain that every location has a combination of factors that influence its annual temperature patterns in this section students will be provided with three major factors and be asked to hypothesize how and why these factors influence temperature and to develop a plan how they might investigate each factor it is also important to note that most parts of the world also have many factors that pertain only to a local region however the three main factors listed latitude local geography and elevation influence any location explain to the students that they are about to begin a scientific investigation on how the given factors influence the annual temperature patterns of a region however prior to any investigation it is important to develop hypotheses about how and why each of the factors affect temperature to serve as a starting point after they complete the investigation they will have an opportunity to return to their hypotheses to revise and edit them since using charts and writing hypothesis may be new to the students it may be useful to review the example provided in the activity after you review the example you may need to initially explain each of the factors latitude you may need to identify latitude lines on the printed world map and remind the students that the map is a projection of the earths shape which is a sphere students should complete the charts individually or in pairssmall groups through consensus additionally the students may have a little difficulty developing hypotheses for these factors therefore you should focus your efforts and those of your students on fully thinking out each how and why and successfully writing hypotheses since they will be investigating each of these later it is not important at this time that their answers are scientifically correct responses may vary considerably depending on the prior knowledge of the students you should encourage students to base their hypotheses on what they learned from the world temperature maps above and on knowledge or prior experience they might have such as when they visited relatives in different locations if you are using the weather learning log you should ask students to open to a new page and draw the charts this will be important later on when they revisit them if they are using the worksheets collect them so you can return them later on homework compare your country map to current temperatures students will use local newspapers to access the average temperatures of cities within their countries and write them on their country temperature map that they previously illustrated in part 2 this can be assigned as a homework assignment as most if not all of the students should have access to a newspaper in their home assessment make each student or cooperative group responsible for their answers student activity note the following instructions also appear in student activities activity c1 factors that influence temperature part 1 annual temperatures in your city  town discuss and answer the following questions think of the hottest day you can remember what were the weather conditions like temperature sky conditions wind etc what time of year was it why do you think it was so hot that day now think of the coldest day you can remember what were the weather conditions like what time of year was it why do you think it was so cold that day now think about the annual trends and seasonal changes in temperature for the year how does temperature change during the year list three factors you think might affect these changes in temperature part 2 temperatures around the world discuss and answer the following questions do you think the temperature is the same or different in other parts of the world why or why not where do you think the hottest temperature will be why where do you think the coldest temperatures will be why list three factors that you think might be responsible for these differences in temperatures create a world and country temperature map take out a copy of a world map temperature colorless than 10 �c10  0 �c0  10 �c10  20 �c20  30 �c30  40 �cgreater than 40 �cillustrate the land masses continents in your world map according the to temperature using the color key to the right and your color pencils  crayons for example you should illustrate the coldest regions purple and the hottest region the dark red take out your country map and similarly illustrate the land area according to temperature you will analyze this map for homework compare your world map to realworld temperatures look at this world temperature map compare the world map you just created with the world temperature map and identify at least two places where the maps are the same and two places where they are different write three reasons why you think they were similar or different part 3 factors that influence the annual temperature pattern of a region every geographic location has a combination of factors that influence the annual patterns of its temperature ie its climatological temperature below is a venn diagram that illustrates how the three main factors latitude local geography and elevation contribute to influence the annual temperature pattern of a region on a separate page of your weather learning log make the following table and follow the directions below given each of the three factors write how you think the temperature changes and why you think it changes based on each of individual factors and your ideas or plans on how you might investigate each factor one example for the effect of day and night has on daily changes in temperature has been completed to serve as an example note this is not a factor that contributes to the annual temperature pattern of a region but rather has been provided to only serve as an example of how to complete the others factor how why investigative plan day and night example i think that during the day it will be hotter while during the night it will be cooler example thats because the sun is out during the day and heats up the earth example i plan to record the temperature at night and day over a series of weeks to determine if there is any relationship latitude elevation local geography distance from large bodies of water ocean currents etc in the venn diagram each of the factors overlap with each other explain how you think the combination of these factors influences the annual temperature pattern of a region and the annual temperature of your city  town homework compare your country map to current temperatures get a copy of todays newspaper and open it to the current weather section look at the major cities and locate them on your map write the high temperatures near the major cities on the country map illustrate the map according the to temperature using the color key above and your color pencils  crayons identify at least two places where the map and the temperatures of the cities are the same and two places where they are different in your weather learning log write three reasons why you think they were similar or different
