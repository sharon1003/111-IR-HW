diagnosis cluster headache has a characteristic type of pain and pattern of attacks a diagnosis depends on your description of the attacks including your pain the location and severity of your headaches and associated symptoms how often your headaches occur and how long they last also are important factors your doctor will likely try to pinpoint the type and cause of your headache using certain approaches neurological examination a neurological examination may help your doctor detect physical signs of a cluster headache your doctor will use a series of procedures to assess your brain function including testing your senses reflexes and nerves imaging tests if you have unusual or complicated headaches or an abnormal neurological examination your doctor might recommend other tests to rule out other serious causes of head pain such as a tumor or aneurysm common brain imaging tests include ct scan this uses a series of xrays to create detailed crosssectional images of your brain mri this uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of your brain and blood vessels treatment theres no cure for cluster headaches the goal of treatment is to decrease the severity of pain shorten the headache period and prevent the attacks because the pain of a cluster headache comes on suddenly and might subside within a short time cluster headache can be difficult to evaluate and treat as it requires fastacting medications some types of acute medication can provide some pain relief quickly the therapies listed below have proved to be most effective for acute and preventive treatment of cluster headache acute treatments fastacting treatments available from your doctor include oxygen briefly inhaling 100 percent oxygen through a mask at a minimum rate of at least 12 liters a minute provides dramatic relief for most who use it the effects of this safe inexpensive procedure can be felt within 15 minutes oxygen is generally safe and without side effects the major drawback of oxygen is the need to carry an oxygen cylinder and regulator with you which can make the treatment inconvenient and inaccessible at times small portable units are available but some people still find them impractical triptans the injectable form of sumatriptan imitrex which is commonly used to treat migraine is also an effective treatment for acute cluster headache the first injection may be given while under medical observation some people may benefit from using sumatriptan in nasal spray form but for most people this isnt as effective as an injection and it may take longer to work sumatriptan isnt recommended if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure or heart disease another triptan medication zolmitriptan zomig can be taken in nasal spray or tablet form for relief of cluster headache this medication may be an option if you cant tolerate other forms of fastacting treatments octreotide octreotide sandostatin an injectable synthetic version of the brain hormone somatostatin is an effective treatment for cluster headache for some people local anesthetics the numbing effect of local anesthetics such as lidocaine xylocaine may be effective against cluster headache pain in some people when given through the nose intranasal dihydroergotamine the injectable form of dihydroergotamine d h e 45 may be an effective pain reliever for some people with cluster headache this medication is also available in an inhaled intranasal form called migranal but this form hasnt been proved to be effective for cluster headache preventive treatments preventive therapy starts at the onset of the cluster episode with the goal of suppressing attacks determining which medicine to use often depends on the length and regularity of your episodes under the guidance of your doctor the drugs can be tapered off once the expected length of the cluster episode ends calcium channel blockers the calcium channel blocking agent verapamil calan verelan others is often the first choice for preventing cluster headache verapamil may be used with other medications occasionally longer term use is needed to manage chronic cluster headache side effects may include constipation nausea fatigue swelling of the ankles and low blood pressure corticosteroids inflammationsuppressing drugs called corticosteroids such as prednisone are fastacting preventive medications that may be effective for many people with cluster headaches your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids if your cluster headache condition has started recently or if you have a pattern of brief cluster periods and long remissions although corticosteroids might be a good option to use for several days serious side effects such as diabetes hypertension and cataracts make them inappropriate for longterm use lithium carbonate lithium carbonate which is used to treat bipolar disorder may be effective in preventing chronic cluster headache if other medications havent prevented cluster headaches side effects include tremor increased thirst and diarrhea your doctor can adjust the dosage to minimize side effects while youre taking this medication your blood will be checked regularly for the development of moreserious side effects such as kidney damage nerve block injecting a numbing agent anesthetic and corticosteroid into the area around the occipital nerve situated at the back of your head might improve chronic cluster headaches an occipital nerve block may be useful for temporary relief until longterm preventive medications take effect melatonin studies in small numbers of people suggest that 10 milligrams of melatonin taken in the evening might reduce the frequency of cluster headache other preventive medications used for cluster headache include antiseizure medications such as topiramate topamax qudexy xr surgery rarely doctors may recommend surgery for people with chronic cluster headaches who dont find relief with aggressive treatment or who cant tolerate the medications or their side effects several small studies found that occipital nerve stimulation on one or both sides may be beneficial this involves implanting an electrode next to one or both occipital nerves deep brain stimulation is a promising but as yet unproven treatment for cluster headaches that dont respond to other treatments because this involves placing an electrode deep in the brain there are significant risks such as an infection or hemorrhage some surgical procedures for cluster headache attempt to damage the nerve pathways thought to be responsible for pain most commonly the trigeminal nerve that serves the area behind and around your eye however the longterm benefits of destructive procedures are disputed also because of the possible complications — including muscle weakness in your jaw or sensory loss in certain areas of your face and head — its rarely considered potential future treatments researchers are studying a potential treatment called occipital nerve stimulation in this procedure your surgeon implants electrodes in the back of your head and connects them to a small pacemakerlike device generator the electrodes send impulses to stimulate the area of the occipital nerve which may block or relieve your pain signals several small studies of occipital nerve stimulation found that the procedure reduced pain in some people with chronic cluster headaches similar research is underway with deep brain stimulation in this procedure doctors implant an electrode in the hypothalamus the area of your brain associated with the timing of cluster periods your surgeon connects the electrode to a generator that changes your brains electrical impulses and may help relieve your pain deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus may provide relief for people with severe chronic cluster headaches that havent been successfully treated with medications request an appointment at mayo clinic clinical trials explore mayo clinic studies testing new treatments interventions and tests as a means to prevent detect treat or manage this disease lifestyle and home remedies the following measures may help you avoid a cluster attack during a cluster

complementary therapies to relieve your pain melatonin has shown modest effectiveness in treating nighttime attacks theres also some evidence that capsaicin used inside your nose intranasally might
