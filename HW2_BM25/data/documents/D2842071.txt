enzymes in the home and industry enzyme names the names of the different types of enzymes usually end in the letters ase three of the most common enzymes with their chemical actions arelipase  breaks down fatsprotease  breaks down proteinscarbohydrase  breaks down carbohydrates enzyme uses enzymes allow certain industrial processes to be carried out at normal temperatures and pressures thereby reducing the amount of energy and expensive equipment needed enzymes are also used in the home for example in biological detergents the table shows some common enzyme uses you should be familiar with uses of enzymes enzyme use protease used to predigest proteins during the manufacture of baby foods lipase used  together with protease  in biological detergents to break down digest the substances in stains into smaller water soluble substances carbohydrase used to convert starch syrup which is relatively cheap into sugar syrup which is more valuable  for example as an ingredient in sports drinks isomerase used to convert glucose syrup into fructose syrup  fructose is sweeter than glucose so it can be used in smaller amounts in slimming foods in industry enzymes allow reactions that normally need expensive energydemanding equipment to happen at normal temperatures and pressures on the other hand most enzymes are denatured at high temperatures many enzymes are expensive to produce now try a test bite
