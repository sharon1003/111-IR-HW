deep fried potatoes ok heres real county fair food and man is it good ranks right up there with the deep fried spam and twinkies these potatoes are a little bit of trouble to get set up for but its worth it serve em with burgers steak or just by themselves if you want you can dip them in catsup ranch dressing or other sauce but ill bet youll like them best just as they are they keep great as leftovers either warm or cold the flavor and crunch is absolutely wonderful at the fair there was this vendor from australia selling these as fast as they could cook them the potatoes were sliced into slabs and they were very large potatoes for cooking dude i used normalsized spuds and also sliced some into wedges like steak fries the photo shows some of each just as i prefer to preboil the potatoes for french fries and homemade potato chips before frying i do the same here heres how you make deep fried crunchy potatoes first the spice mix mix the following ingredients in a small bowl2 tablespoons salt 14 teaspoon black pepper 12 teaspoon white pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon dried oregano second the flour mix1 12 cups flour 12 cup cornstarch third the wet mix1 cup buttermilk 1 teaspoon baking soda fourth prepare the potatoes3 large or 45 medium russet potatoes put a pot of water on the stove with enough lightly salted water to cover the potatoes youre going to use if you are making a double or triple recipe you can do all of these steps in batches so all the spuds dont have to fit in the pot at the same time also start heating peanut or corn oil in a pot or deep fryer large enough to hold six or eight pieces of the potato if youre new to deepfrying please review that section on my kitchen safety page you want the oil to get up to about 350 degrees scrub the potatoes rinse them and pat them dry then slice them either into slabs or wedges or some of each when the water is boiling slide the potatoes into the water gently so you dont splash hot water and stir them a bit about two or three minutes after the water returns to a boil you will probably start smelling the potatoes which means its about time to get them out of the water you want them slightly cooked but still firm enough to handle without them breaking up underdone is better than overdone pour them into a colander to drain and cool off sprinkle a little of the spice mix over them when theyre cool enough to handle dredge them in the dry mix then in the wet mix and then in the spice mix again now you can place them on a wire rack to cool and dry out while you finish the batch and prepare to fry when the oil is hot gently put the potatoes in a few at a time depending on the size of your fryer or pot youll only need to fry them four or five minutes until they get a gorgeous golden brown take them out of the oil with a slotted spoon or fry basket and dump them onto paper towels on a plate or pan sprinkle a little more spice mix on them naturally youll eat some as soon as they are cool enough but keep yourself under control  you might have guests that want some you know if its not time to eat yet you can keep them warm in a warm oven 200 degrees or so but later youll want to refrigerate any leftovers then you can look forward to having a piece with eggs in the morning or with a sandwich for lunchyoull think youre back at the fair
