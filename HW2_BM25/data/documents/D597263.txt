  c repost from gianabeverly using repost regram app  once upon a time over five years ago i was obsessed with season 10 of american idol so i made a twitter dedicated to my favorite contestant when i did that i proceeded to meet randi who was also an idol fangirl we were only 14 at the time such fetuses id made lots of friends from that twitter but all of them faded away over timeexcept this girl of course wed never met because she lived in canada and i was stuck in florida and our parents wouldnt let us meet because we had met online so clearly the other person was a deranged serial killer so after i turned 18 last year to be precise i flew to canada for a couple weeks to meet her for the first time today she flew back home after a couple weeks visiting me and my friends and my disney life before she visited she really disliked disney i would talk about it all the time over the years and shed just roll her eyes and wait for me to shut up so naturally i was afraid she would hate the parks and my life here but last nightshe sobbed in my arms after watching wishes for the last time she is total disney trash now and im so proud proud to have made it happen proud that shes in my life proud weve stuck together through major shitstorms that have been our lives the past five years while i am a strong believer in being careful who your kids are talking to online and such making internet friends isnt the worst thing in the world i wouldnt know his beautiful human if it wasnt for social media shoutout to twitter american idol and airplanes for bringing us together thepurplewall purplewall magickingdom tomorrowland disneyworld disney wdw waltdisneyworld photography unforgetablehappenshere a photo posted by the purple wall purplewallphotos on may 3 2016 at 422pm pdt
