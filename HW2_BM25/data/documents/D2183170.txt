business prestige for market presence you may want to set up an llc eg the fictitious business name dba is  deas xyztch cloud 9co this company name as well as any other business name must be filed with the clerk as a trade name registration and that requires a filing fee to be registered just recording an assumed business name does nothing to keep the name exclusive nor does it avoid personal liability for the business owners only setting up a limited liability company llc will protect the name at the state level and also protect the owners of personal liability our recommendation that since you need to pay a fee to register the business name simply form a limited liability company llc for a similar fee and get both corporate status and protection for the name as well as personal liabilities so for instance if someone slips and falls in your business premises they can sue you personally if you are not a limited liability company llc note that once you incorporate no one can register the limited liability company llc name at the state level q what if i am a very small company do i need a limited liability company llc a you do not need an llc however q does an llc without employees need a tax id number a an llc without employees may not need a tax id number but an llc with more than one owner does need one in addition if the llc is engaged in selling taxable items such as clothing it will need a sales state tax id number in addition to any other tax id q do i need to file a dba if i form an llc a if you form an llc and you do business as the llc name you dont need a dba for example your llc name is ultra super llc and your business name is ultra super llc you dont need to file a dba q if i order a limited liability company llc online how long will it take before
