ministry herb magic yronwode institution the rabbit footthe belief that a rabbits foot is lucky seems to have become a commonplace of american popular culture but at one time in the past this belief was considered a southern superstition specifically one of strictly africanamerican origin and from what i have read in older books on folklore in earlier decades it was only the left hind foot of the rabbit that was considered lucky and the bearer had to rub it to activate the luck in addition some people back then believed that the rabbits foot was a source of protective magic in addition to bringing good fortune when i was a kid i was given a rabbits foot that was dyed bright pink and affixed to a little brasscoloured endcap and strung on beadchain i took it to school this was will rogers elementary school in santa monica caifornia circa 195556 and i showed it around and a pinchfaced little white southern boy said and i quote thats a nigger hoodoo foot i did not know what nigger or hoodoo meant so i went home and asked my mother a leftwing german jewish refugee she explained that nigger means schwartze but its not a nice word so you should say negro instead and  hoodoo is a kind of magic probably like voodoo she also told me that dyeing the rabbits foot pink was a cheap and modern idea typical americantypical heres another rabbit foot memory from my childhood  a 1950 roadside advertisement on curves ahead remember sonny that rabbits foot didnt save the bunny burmashave images of the lucky rabbit foot were most common in the era before world war two i have seen the foot charm depicted on a good luck postcard of the 1910s tied with a red ribbon much as raccoon penis bone charms are tied and on several north american good luck coins of the 1930s it also appears on the label of lucky mongol curio number xi  a 1930s era hoodoo incense powder as for the foot itself a circa1940 mail order catalogue from the standard o and b supply company a chicagobased distributor of africanamerican hoodoo material offered undyed rabbit foot charms made with a metal band and a link to attach on chain the johnsonsmith novelty company offered identical charms in its 1941 catalogue the advertisement shown here goes these one better and promises a free vial of van van oil with each rabbits foot the formula is a louisiana hoodoo favourite that clears away that evil mess and increases the strength of any good luck charm to which it is applied since none of the older catalogues or ads mention any colour when describing rabbits foot charms it can be assumed that the items were undyed and came only in natural tan or white symbolic representations of the rabbit foot have become rare now possibly due to the contemporary interest in animal rights but while johnsonsmith no longer offers rabbit foot key chain charms for sale traditional rabbit foot charms both dyed and undyed are still manufactured and remain part of the hoodoo stock in trade contemporary conjure bags in my collection that contain rabbit foot charms include a fast luck bag and a wishing bag the rabbit feet in these bags are natural in colour and not dyed why is the rabbit foot lucky i am not sure rabbits are swift and they reproduce prolifically but the luck of the rabbit foot is monetary and sexual as far as i know it is not related to swiftness or fertility there is considerable evidence that the lucky rabbit foot is a remnant of an african clan totem an importation related somehow to brer rabbit the famous protagonist of an african trickstergod mythcycle and what about the left hind foot of a jackalope is that lucky luckier than a rabbits foot here is a quick linklist to the illustrated lucky w pages containing key chain and key ring amuletskeychains and key rings as
