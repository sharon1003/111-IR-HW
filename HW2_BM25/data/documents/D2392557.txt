website shadowsocks org shadowsocks is an opensource encrypted proxy project widely used in mainland china to circumvent internet censorship it was created in 2012 by a chinese programmer named clowwindy and multiple implementations of the protocol have been made available since 4 5 typically the client software will open a socks5 proxy on the machine it is run which internet traffic can then be directed towards similarly to an ssh tunnel 6 unlike an ssh tunnel shadowsocks can also proxy udp traffic contents  hide 1 takedown2 server implementations3 client implementations4 net

maintain the project 7 the code of the project was subsequently branched with a removal notice 8 9 10 11 three days later on 25 august another proxy application go agent also had its git hub repository removed 9 10 the removal of the projects was met with media attention with news outlets speculating about the possible connection between the takedowns and a ddo s targeting git hub which happened several days later 12 danny obrien from electronic frontier foundation published a statement on the matter 13despite the takedown collaborators of the project have continued with the development of the project server implementations  editthe original python implementation can still be installed with pip package manager but the contents of its git hub repository have been removed 14 15 other server implementations include one in go c using the libev event loop library c with a qt gui and perl the go and perl implementations are not updated regularly and may be abandoned 15 16 17client implementations  editall of the server implementations listed above also support operating in client mode there are also clientonly implementations available for windows shadowsockswin mac os shadowsocks xng android shadowsocksandroid and i os wingy 18 many clients including shadowsockswin and shadowsocksandroid support redirecting all system traffic over shadowsocks not just applications that have been explicitly configured to do so allowing shadowsocks to be used similarly to a vpn net shadowsocks  editnet shadowsocks is name of the perl implementation of shadowsocks protocol client and server available on cpan 19shadowsocks r  editshadowsocks r is a fork of the original project claimed to be superior in terms of security and stability upon release it was found to violate the general public license by not having the source code of the c client available 20 it was also criticized for its solution to the alleged security issues in the source project both projects are
