answer by d4est confidence votes 479kthis information is from health care professionals and groups such as mayo clinic and should be used as a point of reference or as a generality because each pregnancy is unique morning sickness is a symptom some women feel during early pregnancy it starts after conception which may or may not occur after unprotected intercourse so first confirm that you are pregnant by using a home pregnancy test and if positive make an appointment for a health care professional to confirm those results and to start prenatal care once you have a confirmed pregnancy the morning sickness usually starts around the first 4 to 6 weeks of pregnancy and it tends to get worse over the next month or so after it begins however for some women the queasiness begins as early as two weeks after conception morning sickness for the majority of women stops around the 12 th week but for many women it continues until the 14th to 16th week about half of the women feel complete relief by 14 weeks for the rest it may take one more month or so for it to stop it can return later and for some unlucky women it can come and go throughout the entire pregnancy there isnt a set time for it to stop because each woman is different and each pregnancy is different if nausea and vomiting persists well into the second trimester after the 13th week you should contact your doctor just to be on the safe side it isnt harmful to you or your baby unless you have excessive vomiting and cant keep anything down if you are unable to eat or drink fluids and keep it down for 24 hours straight you may have something called hyperemesis gravidarum this condition can be harmful to both you and your baby so you should contact your doctor right away to see if you need any special treatment as stated above each pregnancy is unique so here is some information from various contributors about their experiences  it starts at about the 4th6th week of pregnancy and lasts until the 14th or 16th week morning sickness can occur at any stage of pregnancy but is more common in early pregnancy it can start as soon as you become pregnant or before you even know you may be pregnant this is usually due to all the hormones whizzing around inside you and your body trying to keep up with all the changes and surges of hormones some women never have morning sickness some have it in the morning some in the evening and others all day with my first i had nausea in the evenings and would fall asleep about 7pm this lasted until about 13 weeks with my second i had no nausea or tiredness and it turned out to be twins it varies from woman to woman when i was pregnant with my girls i have 2 i had morning sickness from 4 weeks up to month 5 straight with my boys no morning sickness at all i started feeling sick one week after my missed period which is how i found out that i was pregnant you can have morning sickness early when i was pregnant with my son i found out i was pregnant 2 weeks after unprotected sex due to morning sickness i had been getting it for almost a week before it got so bad i knew it wasnt a bugwell one week after conceiving the embryo is no larger than a bundle of cells in your uterus morning sickness due to pregnancy does not occur until the embryo is implanted and producing sufficient hormones to affect you usually from about 3 weeks after conception everyone is different you may get it within a week of being pregnant or at any time some people only have it for the first trimester and for others it may be with them all through the nine months but usually not every day morning sickness can happen any time during the day not just in the morning i had it only if i ate certain foods but in the first couple of weeks i felt like i wanted to throw up but i never would right now i am 10 weeks into pregnancy and feel great i just sleep alot but that is normal weeks six through twelve for me i got it at 5 weeks most women get it at 6 weeks but some can get it as soon as 3 weeks it is just more common not to get it until 56 weeks ive been pregnant twice and i began symptoms around a month into it both times some women have it in the first week or so and some women never have it some people dont get it some people do usually it hits at about 34 wks it can vary with every pregnancy i have had three kids and all have been different my first pregnancy i had a feeling of light headedness within 2 weeks of my missed period in my last trimester it probably settled down at about the 8 month mark my second pregnancy was totally different i may have had a few days that i felt lightheaded or my blood sugar was low but it was a breeze the last all i wanted to do was eat and i was queasy just for 3 months or so so you never know what it is going to be like i know someone said the more sick you are the healthier the baby you can feel morning sickness as early as a week after conception or sooner i think its different for each woman and each womans pregnancy i think the general rule is the first trimester morning sickness usually starts if at all between the 4th and 8th week after conception on average morning sickness lasts until sometime between the 14th and the 22nd week as soon as conception occurs hormones are released to prepare your body for the upcoming months of pregnancy and the eventual birth of your baby these hormones signal to your body to increase blood volume and to prepare the uterus for upcoming growth even your joints and muscles have to relax to enable them to move out of the way of your growing baby these hormones are also causing your morning sickness until your body adjusts to the new hormone levels you may be feeling nauseous every pregnant woman reacts differently to these hormonal changes making it hard to pinpoint exactly how soon after conception morning sickness starts the majority of pregnant women start to experience morning sickness somewhere between the 4th and 8th week of pregnancy it can however start as early as the day after conception for some women it doesnt start until about the 19th week of pregnancy and some never experience it morning sickness can also occur at any time of day  not just the morningusually it ends at the end of the first three months first trimester  it was like clockwork for me i felt great at the beginning of the 2nd trimesterit often starts in american movies the day after fertilization or conception along with fainting however in reality it begins after about six to eight weeks morning sickness caused by pregnancy begins between the 4th and 7th week after last menstrual period and it resolves by 20th week of gestation morning sickness affects 5070 of pregnant women which means there is a chance that you will not get morning sickness at all however morning sickness is also a good sign for a successful pregnancy because women who experience morning sickness especially vomiting are less likely to have miscarriages stillbirths low birth weight babies and preterm deliveries in addition one should avoid antiemetics to treat morning sickness because the mechanism of how pregnancy causes morning sickness is not known your symptoms of pregnancy will usually appear anywhere from the first week of your expected period to 12 weeks after your first week of expected period your first signs of pregnancy most commonly include missed period tenderswollen breasts change in color of the breasts fatigue nauseavomiting increased sense of smell and weight gain for some women it can happen as soon as the egg implants itself the time of conception which can take up to 5 days after fertilization usually during second pregnancies the woman will feel the sickness early and shows signs of pregnancy earlier than her first morning sickness can affect a woman at any time in her pregnancy and at any time of the day too it is more common in the mornings and nearer the beginning of the pregnancy hence the term i have heard of some women who had it very bad and almost right to the very end of their pregnancy its not common but morning sickness affects different women in different ways and at different times  there truly is no normal with morning sicknessit will show up only after two to three weeks into your pregnancy usually it starts the first few weeks it depends on your body because you may be one of a few women who do not experience morning sickness during pregnancy you may not have any nausea at all if so count yourself lucky some women get morning sickness all day some only get a few bouts of nausea some not at all at six weeks you may be just about to start the nausea if you do get nausea eating something bland normally helps saltine crackers are a good thing to always have on hand for morning sickness morning sickness hit me at seven weeks until about three months275 people found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no
