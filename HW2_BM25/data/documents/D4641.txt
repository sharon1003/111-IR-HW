being able to accelerate quickly and powerfully is probably the most important skill that needs to be improved in all athletes athletes in every sport need to be able to run as fast as possible as quickly as possible from getting off the line fast in football to beating your opponent to the ball in soccer to exploding out of the blocks in track each of these athletes need to be as efficient as possible to be able to generate speed in a short period of time acceleration development is a major focal point in our training program and we spend a lot of time working on proper acceleration mechanics the reason being that most sports never really need their athletes to sprint over 30 meters how often do you see a football player break away for a 50 yard gain or a field hockey player need to sprint at top speed from mid field without breaking stride not often at all most plays happen at short bursts of 10 yards or less even for a 100 meter sprinter the acceleration phase consists of 64 of the race from a time standpoint first what is acceleration acceleration is the rate at which the speed of an object is changing acceleration takes place the first 030 meters or to about 34 seconds from the start of a sprint after approximately 30 meters acceleration turns into maximum velocity and top speed is hit workouts to improve the acceleration of an athlete will follow in the same distance parameters running repeat sprints of 20 meters for example with full recovery is an option for an acceleration workout instead of giving you some basic running workouts i want to give you some of my favorite acceleration training drills that will not only create faster athletes but also help develop proper acceleration mechanics at the same time before giving you the acceleration speed drills let’s go into what constitutes proper acceleration mechanics so you know what to look for with your athlete being able to cue and make corrections to your athletes form is what is really going to make these drills successful speed training for track sprinters discover the agility  speed training secrets that will make you faster www complete speed training2com speed training secrets

www complete olympic liftingcom a breakdown of acceleration mechanics and other considerations1 stride length  short to long starts off short and increases until maximum velocity is reached when the stride length is optimal2 ground contact time  long to short ground contact time is the amount of time each foot spends on the ground it is longest at the beginning as the body is trying to overcome inertia the weight of your body fighting gravity to try and create velocity through force application this takes a great deal of strength3 shin angle with ground  small to large the shin angle is going to determine the force application to the ground and the projection angle that the athlete is going to drive out at roughly 45 degree projection angle is ideal the shin angle opens up and increases throughout acceleration and into maximum velocity4 velocity  slow to fast velocity is both the speed and direction that the body is moving as the athlete accelerates the rate and distance will increase with time5 stride frequency  slow to fast like ground contact time it starts off slower though still quite high and increases until stride frequency reaches optimal level at maximum velocity6 heel recovery  low to high heels should recover quickly with limited backside mechanics and shouldn’t involve large amplitudes of motion behind the hips during acceleration especially the first 68 steps you want to minimize your backside mechanics backside mechanics in sprinting are movements occurring behind the center of mass to put this more simply think of the drill ‘buttkicks’ as having a lot of backside mechanics and a drill like ‘highknees’ will have little amount of backside mechanics but a lot of frontside mechanics the running on hot coals example to give people an image about how to quickly recover their heels to their butt body position foot strikes on forefoot foot should strike directly below or slightly behind the hips looking for triple extension of the driving leg– ankle knee hip the body is driving out at a 45 degree angle to the ground a straight line from your head to your back leg keep the heel recovery low drive the lead arm same as front leg up as you begin to sprint step over the opposite knee and drive the foot down into the ground to create maximal force ankle steps over the knee face and neck relaxed tight stomach flat back hips forward arms – elbow is approximately at 90 degrees quick acceleration tip  often in the acceleration phase athletes are concerning themselves too much with trying to be quick with their legs instead of trying to drive out and be powerful athletes are spinning their wheels and not getting triple extension ankle knee hip we want the athletes to feel their feet behind them if you are getting the sensation of your feet driving well behind your center of mass then you know you are finishing off your leg drive as i said previously speed drills also give us an opportunity to teach cues we use speed drills to break down certain aspects or parts of the whole body of sprinting for example i use cue like ‘drive down’ during a speed drill in practice this gives the athlete a frame of reference to use when i need them to make adjustments to their form while sprinting this will help the athletes carry over the theory of what needs to be done so they can apply it when performing high speed sprinting every time you sprint you should be working on technique you want your athletes to have proper running technique ingrained in their heads so when it is time to sprint they can feel when everything is happening smoothly therefore we need to use speed drills to help reinforce sound running mechanics while also making our athletes stronger faster and more powerful acceleration training speed drills short hill work this is a great speed drill when you have large groups and you do not need any expensive equipment hills can naturally help athletes with their stride frequency and also help promote quick arm action also athletes that tend to rotate a lot at the hips and cross over with a sidetoside running action will have to quickly reevaluate their flawed running mechanics when doing hill work if they are running sidetoside they will not be going anywhere and will have trouble getting up the hill therefore this short hill work will help improve their straight ahead running hill work is perfect for acceleration development as it puts the athlete in proper acceleration mechanics naturally without any tools or cues you are bringing the ground up to them as they will be driving out and running in the 45 degree angle to the ground sample hill workout8 x 20 meter hills at 15 degree gradient walk back down with a 2 minute rest between each repetition stadiums if you have a nice set of bleachers or stadium stairs in your area i suggest you take advantage of them when performing stadiums for acceleration work make sure that your athletes are skipping a step so they are running every other step running every other step on the bleachers mimics acceleration mechanics similar to short hill work it is putting the athletes at that 45 degree body angle while they are running the stairs if you run up every step and do not skip one in between your body will be up taller in more of an upright maximum velocity position skipping steps is important because maximum velocity work is not the goal of this drill wall drill the wall drill was covered in detail in last month’s speed training report but here is an overview have athletes stand with their hands against a wall with the arms parallel to the ground the feet should be behind the hips and the athlete should be at approximately a 45 degree angle to the ground the torso should be erect hips forward stomach and lower back tight so that one could draw a straight 45 degree line from the head through the hips to the ankles from this position we implement a marching action have the athlete raise the right leg so that the ankle is beneath the hips toe dorsiflexed on your command the athlete will march alternating legs for a given number of repetitions they will finish with their leg in the original starting position partner assisted – march exactly like the wall drill except a partner is in the place of the wall have the two partners face each other the first person leans in the proper acceleration position 45 degree angle while their partner is holding them in this position at the shoulders have your first athlete bring their right knee up keeping the ankle behind the knee and the toe up towards the shin this is triple flexion on the front side the position your athlete would be in during acceleration on the support leg left leg have your athlete in triple extension the left leg will be in a straight line with the hips spine and head the athletes partner will be resisting slightly keeping the working athlete at the desired 45 degree angle the athlete is going to be marching for 10 steps forcefully driving the frontside leg down and back the forward movement will be short in distance with the focus on the driving motion you want your athlete to be able to feel their feet behind them during these drills so it seems natural when it comes time to accelerate during games speed training for track sprinters discover the agility  speed training secrets that will make you faster www complete speed

to become immediately more powerful www complete olympic liftingcom face and chase this drill is pretty much an extension of the partner assisted march drill this time the ‘marcher’ is running instead of marching and the partner is providing more resistance the focus is still on providing force application into the ground the partner is now resisting moving backwards for 5 meters at this point the partner lets go and releases the partner that was resisting and now released will turn and run and try to beat the person they were resisting to a cone at 15 meters we have extended these distances out and also turned them into a tag game face chase and race various starting positions instead of bringing the ground up to the athlete to create the 45 degree angle as we did with the hill work we are now going to bring the athlete down to the ground in bringing the athlete to the ground we have them start in different positions on the ground the body wants to get up as fast as possible the best way to do that is to drive out in proper acceleration mechanics without having the athlete think too much about it weaker athletes have an extremely tough time accelerating from a standing or 2 point position but are successful creating the acceleration form from a ground based position essentially we work from the ground up as our athletes get stronger and better mechanically we use the more vertical stances for our acceleration work you would still use the distance parameters of 1030 meters per run for your sprint workouts when you perform this drill here are some examples of the various starting positions you can use laying on back  pushup ‘up’ position  pushup ‘down’ position  on 1 knee always switch  seated facing forward  seated facing backwards  3 point position  4 point position  falling start  position specific med ball starts the athlete starts with both feet shoulder width apart holding a medicine ball at their chest have your athlete provide an explosive chest pass trying to propel the medicine ball as far as possible this will cause the athlete to use their legs and drive out the instant the ball is released have your athlete keep that momentum going by sprinting out to 15 yards this is a good exercise for athletes that don’t seem to be going any where their first couple of steps of acceleration and need to become more explosive ball drop you can start this drill having the athletes use the various starting positions as described above the coach stands 10 feet away this distance can be moved up or back depending on the level of athlete with a tennis ball in his or her hand the coach’s arm is at shoulder level held out to the side the coach then drops the ball and once the athlete sees the ball released heshe must catch the ball before it bounces twice this is a great drill to work on not only acceleration mechanics but also reaction time an extremely important characteristic in all sports use the speed drills provided for acceleration and make sure that your athletes are getting the most out of them by not sacrificing form in any of the drills about the author patrick beith is the coowner for athletes acceleration inc patrick holds
