1 cultural diversity and minority status prologue puerto rican american familieson the west sideon any street corner on the west side within about a 10block radius of spruce street a greeting of buenos dias is likely to receive a response of bueno dia with a noticeable omission of the final s in both words tá bién its okay to speak spanish here since the area is dominated by an estimated 5000 spanishspeaking people most of whom are from puerto rico it would not do however to assume that color of skin or other racial features will give a clue as to whether to use english or spanish since puerto ricans come in all colors the hub of this community is a small 2story brown building with the sign la asociación latina americana the latin american association laa is predominant among several voluntary agencies serving this area and their presence indicates the widespread dependence of many residents on various kinds of public assistance mucho daño a los niños a lot of harm to the childrenon a mild spring morning an old woman about 4 feet 10 inches tall with dark brown skin and a heavily wrinkled forehead barely visible beneath a mop of graying hair stands at the doorway of the laa she could be anybodys grandmother actually she is ginas one of the children in this study ginas grandmother and a few of the other older people in the community such as the fairskinned cuban man from across the street can find any number of excuses for going to the laa for assistance but most often they go just to feel at home and to find out what is happening in the neighborhood the younger people in the tiny foyer sit or stand with agreater urgency they have come to seek an interpreter to accompany them to an unexpected appointment or to translate a document or perhaps they are waiting for the daily english class to begin but today everyone may have a long wait because a tall dark young man needs someone to take his wife to the hospitalshe has gone into labor prematurely ginas grandmother and the cuban will not leave until they see a solution to this emergency back at ginas home i wander between the dining room and kitchen admiring the island mementos family photographs and handmade centerpieces that decorate the shelves and walls of the room her mother ana cooks piononoscrisp round balls of fried plantain stuffed with spicy ground beefwhile my tape recorder captures the sizzling of her kitchen her highpitched rapid spanglish soars above it all and i listen savouring traditional island hospitalitypiping hot delicacies and heavily sweetened puerto rican coffee mira look hay muchas personas that try to help puerto ricans pero in a way nos ayudan and in another way nos desayudan there are many people that try to help puerto ricans but in a way they help us and in another way they hinder us at first you think you can trust somebody and then behind your back they are talking about you thats why i tell you i dont trust nobodyhay mucho daño down here a los niños he visto tantas cosas there is a lot of harm down here to the children i have seen many things my son say i want to go outside pero but i dont let him in puerto rico its differenteverybody know you pero here it got trouble everywhere when i moved down here in esto apartamiento this apartment i got a lot of trouble with the kids in the summertime josé me dice said to me mammy i want to go in the porch so i say okay pero stay where i can see you but his friend got matches and cigarettes he got only 9 years and he smoking cigarettes i say what kind of friend is that you need to have good friends or when you grow up you are no good you are nothing so i put josé in the room i dont want to hit him because when he grow up he is mad with me i dont like hitting i see a lot of kids their father hit them and he dont know whats going on with the kids they dont tell him nada nothing so 1 tell them i am no just your mother i am your friend too trust me i tell him no take off your clothes outside your home no let anybody see you i tell him try no go in the bathroom at school i tell gina too you see i love my children more than my life when they go in the school my heart is broken what i mean is i try to keep my kids more at home than outside ana speaks for all the mothers in the study of puerto rican parents reported in this book her words echo familiar themes of cultural alienation mistrust and a continuing struggle to draw a protective boundary between home and outside ana and her family ana diazquintero pseudonym was born in puerto rico and came to live on the u s mainland in 1976 at the age of 16 having left high school in the eleventh grade her eldest child was born in puerto rico while his younger brother and sister were born on the mainland at the time of the study josé age 12 was in the fifth grade gina age 9 was in a special education class for students classified mildly mentally retarded and elizabeth age 4 was attending a neighborhood preschool program about five feet tall plump with light brown skin piercing gray eyes and brown hair pulled back tightly in a bun ana has just a trace of africa in her features always dramatic in manner she is quick to smile frown or laugh and when speaking of something that makes her angry there is no concealing the sudden flush of her face or the sharp edge to her voice she talks a mile a minute as she moves in and out of the kitchen or sits for a moment to sew a flowing mantilla onto the dark hair of a doll dressed in flounces of red lace and ribbon ana dresses as many as ten of these dolls per week and sells them for 10 or 12 each this helps since her family was cut off from welfare when her husband quit the required english class he became angry because he says they expected him to learn english from a blackboard when he told them he cannot read or write in spanish certain aspects of anas family defy easy categorization on a racial dimension her husband pedro is the only immediate family member who would readily be classified as black according to the u s system but ana would not use this term she would use instead the more descriptive term piel oscura which simply means darkskinned their son josé fairskinned with straight black hair would probably be seen as white in the united states while the girls just a bit darker than their mother with curly black hair would be hard to categorize in terms of nationality both ana and pedro were born u s citizens yet they spent their formative years in a culture very different from that of the u s mainland anas words quoted above leave no doubt that she considers herself a stranger in a foreign land the minute fraction of the u s department of educations statistics represented by ana and pedros children however reflects none of this ambiguity according to the classification system used by the department of educations office of civil rights ocr these students would first be classified as hispanic regardless of race which category is then collapsed into an amalgam of all nonwhite groups designated minority thus for the record josé gina and elizabeth diazquintero are minority students cultural diversity and minority status the family described in the foregoing section belongs to one of four groups classified as minority in the united states while the diaz quintero family falls within one national subgroup of the larger category hispanic the attitudes expressed by this mother cannot be assumed to be representative of puerto ricans in general they do however seem to be fairly typical of many puerto ricans of a similar educational and socioeconomic background who are only minimally acculturated to life on the u s mainland they also bear a strong resemblance to the attitudes of some other hispanic families of similar background these distinctions among many others that will be discussed in this book are important influences on the way we think about groups of people because without attention to such detail we too readily fall into the trap of developing stereotypical images and expectations this book is concerned with the way families from culturally different backgrounds view the special education system and with the quality of their interaction with professionals in that system this topic is of great concern to educators today for two reasons first the children of such families are disproportionately classified as handicapped and placed in special education programs second the input of parents is not only mandated by law p l 94142 and more recently p l 99457 but is increasingly being seen as a crucial element in the adaptation and success of students from culturally different backgrounds this chapter will present an overview of the surface characteristics of the four groups referred to as minority in the united states and will discuss their status in the society i will begin with a discussion of the u s perspective on race and then attend to factual information on the social economic and educational status of the different groups in a nation as heterogeneous as the united states it is inevitable that attempts at classification by race will be fraught with ambiguity the goal of the following discussion is to sharpen readers awareness of the complexities of such classification and of the impossibility of stereotyping large groups of people along discrete and static racial or cultural dimensions2culturally diverse students and their families it is essential that professionals in the united states understand the tension that exists between an outsiders and an insiders view of minority peoples experience the dimensions of powerpowerlessness traditionalatraditional cultural pridecultural shame are intertwined in a dynamic process through which the cultural consciousness of minority peoples evolves the pride that most minority peoples feel in their traditional culture has continued to thrive despite the widespread promotion of images of cultural deficiency pathology and hopelessness wright and colleagues 1983 have offered a sampler of myths about child rearing and family life in minority cultures showing that the stereotypes held by outsiders may be only one side of the coin for example stereotypes of machismo among hispanics and matriarchy among blacks fail to acknowledge the deep sense of responsibility and authority reflected by these patterns the ingrained responsibility of the hispanic young man for his sister and the enduring respect for the mother as the center of the black family eagar 1986 wright and colleagues further show how terms such as the tangle of pathology used by the moynihan report u s department of labor 1965 and cultural deprivation are built on a misguided notion of superior versus inferior cultures all cultures like all languages are adequate to the needs of the peoples who have developed them and to suppose that some cultures are inferior say wright and colleagues is to confuse culture with    social tools and resources p 134 in this chapter i will offer a brief outline of what is known about the general cultural ethos of each of the ethnic groups introduced in chapter 1 with the primary purpose of demonstrating that values and beliefs related to disability are cultural not universal in nature perhaps more important than knowing particular features of any one cultural group will be the recognition by american special educators of the cultural base of their own belief system the education for all handicapped children act couches its mandate in concepts that are uniquely western both in terms of a medical model of disability and of a framework of services derived from a technological culture the power of this legal mandate and the demand for accountability to it reinforce professionals tendency to forget the relativity of the concepts thus delegitimizing all others three provisos are essential to the following outline first because the minority group classifications being used are essentially classifications that have been imposed by western culture we cannot assume that they are meaningful to these peoples themselves second there is national cultural and often racial heterogeneity within each group third further heterogeneity is created in each group by varying extents of acculturation with regard to the latter i will use the term traditional to indicate what might be expected among peoples least acculturated to western ways the outline will highlight underlying commonalities that stand in contrast to the dominant culture of american schools in outlining central cultural features of each group i will first describe the extent to which the group appears to have a cohesive group identity then outline expressions of traditional culture as they appear in different worldviews conceptions of family and codes of social interaction and finally relate these views to conceptions of disability so far found in each culture3minority students in special education the disproportionately high placement of racial minority students in special education programs for the mildly handicapped has continued to be the topic of controversy in education since dunn 1968 first called attention to it over 2 decades ago the attention of researchers to this problem was further fueled by the initiation of litigation in the state of california and by the publication of jensens 1969 claim that the poor academic performance of black students reflected inferior intelligence in 1973 mercers landmark study of anglo black and mexican american children in a california community found that socioeconomic and minority status were highly correlated with such placement the climate of that period as prasse and reschly 1986 have observed was one of growing tension between the promise of equal opportunity in the 1960s and the slow fulfillment of that promise in summarizing the key events of the period these authors point out that the unwillingness of public school systems to comply with the courtordered racial desegregation established by brown v board of education 1954 had led to allegations of school segregation in san francisco as early as 1965 among these the suit johnson v san francisco unified school district 1971 included the allegation that the school district was dumping black children in classes for the mildly retarded a few months later the landmark case larry p v riles was filed and ultimately led to the state of california decision 13 years later to prohibit the use of standardized intelligence tests which were judged to be racially and culturally biased the situation on which the case was based was that while black students comprised only 285 percent of the total student body in the school district 66 percent of all students in educationally mentally retarded emr classes were black prasse  reschly 1986 the charge of biased assessment also focused on the assessment of children from nonenglishspeaking backgrounds the diana case in california 1970 represented hispanic children and the guadalupe case in arizona 1972 represented both hispanic and native american children these cases charged that placement decisions were made on the basis of englishlanguage testing of bilingual and in some instances monolingual spanishspeaking children with no effort to assess adaptive behavior the defendant school districts and state departments of education did not defend their programs in court but agreed to the reforms required by the consent decrees these included less emphasis on iq tests the use of nonverbal tests with bilingual minority students and the inclusion of assessment of adaptive behavior reschly 1988 while the focus of litigation has continued to be on the issue of linguistic and cultural bias in standardized intelligence testing several writers have pointed to an equally crucial issue that of the effectiveness of placement in special education programs reschly 1988 for example observed that there is no objection to the overrepresentation of black students in head start or chapter i programs since these do not carry the stigma attached to being mentally retarded and are presumed to be effective programs additional reasons for the acceptability of overrepresentation here must also be that these programs are based entirely on the choice of parents while special education is not and since they are targeted to populations in poverty it is inevitable that minority students will be highly represented all of these reasons make compensatory preschool programs less vulnerable to criticism than are special education programs the point about the effectiveness of programs is salient since students are referred from regular to special education because they are not achieving well in the regular program and special placement is recommended as a solution the report of the national academy of sciences panel on selection and placement of students in programs for the mentally retarded heller et al 1982 emphasized this point and my discussion of the problems of disproportionate placement will refer in more detail to the recommendations of this report the present section will highlight trends in the most recently available data on the racial distribution of students in special education programs the fact that the department of educations office for civil rights ocr monitors enrollment in what are known as the judgment categories the more ambiguous mild handicapping conditions reflects awareness that the civil rights of students may be violated by inappropriate classification and placement chan  kitano 1986 thus the ocr does not include information on more objectively based conditions such as sensoryand healthrelated disabilities or multiplyhandicapping conditions the following discussion is not intended to relate to these students since the issue of equity in special education placement refers in the main to students whose learning difficulties are first identified in school in the words of several of the puerto rican mothers whose views comprise chapters 5 through 9 of this book these are the children who were doing fine until they went to school 4culturally diverse families and the special education system the challenge of building trust the notion of parent participation in school affairs reflects the logical progression of a centuryold social reform movement whose roots in the 1887 formation of the national congress of mothers subsequently the national parentteachers association came into full bloom as one of the progressive educational experiments of the 1920s schlossman 1983 the dual thrust of this movement was toward the education of parents in effective parenting strategies as well as the cultivation of parental influence in childrens educational careers the underlying assumption of the parent education and participation movement has been the belief that parent involvement affects the cognitive affective and social development of children bronfenbrenner 1979 indeed many wellknown studies have concluded that family environments are more influential in childrens school achievement than the input of schooling itself coleman et al 1966 gordon 1979 marjoribanks 1979 gordon 1977 has identified three basic models of parent involvement the parent impact model which emphasizes the schools having a beneficial impact on the home the school impact model in which parents exert influence on the school to be more responsive to their needs and the community impact model which recognizes the interrelatedness of home school and community and allows for mutual responsiveness and flexibility in a comprehensive review of studies of the effects of parental participation on childrens academic performance leler 1983 concluded that positive outcomes were reported for 70 percent of the studies of parent impact models and for all of the community impact model studies with regard to the specific functions that parents may serve keesling and melaragno 1983 have identified the following governance primarily defined as decisionmakingeducation as instructional paraprofessionals or volunteers or as tutors of their own childrenschool support both tangible and intangiblecommunityschool relations referring to communication and interpersonal relationsparent education personal learning experiences p 223while the initial target group of the parent education and participation thrust was essentially middleclass families and the practice of participation was entirely voluntary in nature the advent of antipoverty and compensatory education programs in the 1960s introduced the concept not only of educating lowincome parents in effective parenting techniques but also of including them in governance and policymaking functions of federally funded programs keesling and melaragno 1983 point out that federally funded programs have concentrated mainly on governance and educational functions the impetus for this came from the community action program of the economic opportunity act eoa of 1964 which called for the maximum feasible participation of persons served keesling  melaragno 1983 p 234 and resulted in the inclusion of parents on policymaking bodies of head start programs similar requirements were subsequently initiated to varying extents in programs under title 1 of the elementary and secondary education act esea of 1965 title vi of the esea also referred to as the emergency school aid act and title vii of the esea more commonly known as the bilingual education act keesling and melaragno studied the extent of parental participation in these programs and concluded that programs with a stronger legal mandate and incentives for parental participation such as follow through succeeded in attaining higher levels of participation the developments outlined above present two concerns that are central to the discussion of this book first the difficulty of imposing value judgments regarding effective parenting in a culturally diverse society and second the fact that because of the central role of the federal government in certain educational programs parent participation in the affairs of schooling has come to exist within a distinctly legalistic framework the following sections will address the implications of these concerns5a study of puerto rican american parents views of special education background and method the first four chapters of this book presented the issues and challenges that provided the impetus for this study a great deal of research has placed the burden of responsibility for minority students failure and disproportionately high placement in special education programs at the feet of an overly ethnocentric school system that provides students and their families with culturally incongruous communication assessment procedures and instructional methodologies inherent in the system is the message that cultural difference is equivalent to educational deficit previous studies of hispanic families interaction with the special education system have focused either on mexican american lynch  stein 1987 or puerto rican families condon et al 1979 diaz 1981 figler 1981 a recent study by bennett 1988 has targeted a more heterogeneous group of parents from caribbean hispanic backgrounds the discussion in the previous chapter pointed to the common observation among these studies that a tradition of trust in the school combines with cultural differences and communication difficulties to create a pattern of relative passivity and noninvolvement among hispanic parents this study seeks one group of parents interpretations of childrens school failure and special education placement as well as their views of the dynamics of communication between themselves and school personnel the findings of the study tell twelve families side of the story of low parental participation6twelve families on the west side the twelve families who participated in this study lived in an area of the city known as the west side with only one exception they lived on welfare benefits with the same one exception they were all firstgeneration spanishspeaking puerto ricans who had been living in the united states no longer than 12 years at the time of the study they all had at least one child in special education and five families had two or more children in special education all told these twelve families accounted for seventeen of the fortyeight puerto rican children placed in special education programs at the time of the study in addition one family had an older child who had exited the special education class and returned to regular education in this chapter i will offer a brief description of these participants and an outline of the main issues that dominate their lives as part of this innercity latino community as described in the previous chapter twelve professionals who work with this community or with the school district were also informants for the study while the bulk of the data come from interviews and observations with families i will also be referring to information and opinions offered by these professionals before turning to an exploration of the data of the study i will offer a brief profile of each family for the most part i will describe the mothers referring specifically only to those fathers whom i interviewed i will then give a more indepth illustration through a closeup profile of one mother all names have been changed and the ages of children refer to their ages at the time of the study the first mother ana is the one who was introduced in chapter 17making sense of disability parents theories of the problem the needs and expectations of a society will determine the measure by which its members behavior will be labeled deviant and the extent to which that deviance will be stigmatized becker 1969 our discussion of labeling in chapter 3 showed how the meanings attached to labels of disability such as retarded or handicapped vary among societies and among groups within a society as well as being subject to change over time an earlier discussion of differing cultural views in chapter 2 emphasized that interpretations of the meaning of disability may be affected by the causes attributed to disability by views of the family and by beliefs about the relationship between physical and spiritual phenomena the language of the education for all handicapped children act eha however reflects none of this ambiguity and the process of reification is nowhere so obvious as in the conception of disability inherent in special education theory and practicethe belief that a childs failure to master certain skills is indicative of an objectively identifiable intrinsic deficit the limitations of the assessment process are recognized by the law in its call for measures to ensure unbiased assessment yet the subjective nature of the process is inescapable and becomes most evident with students from culturally diverse backgrounds indeed the ongoing debate over assessment and instruction of minority students which was outlined in chapter 3 eg duran 1989 figueroa et al 1989b heller et al 1982 ortiz  polyzoi 1986 reflects the elusive nature of the search for a definitive dividing line between special and regular education and the arbitrariness of the designation  disability for many students with mild learning disorders for many minority students underachievement is the point at which regular and special education meet with many students from what has been called the mental withdrawalgrade retention dropout syndrome stein 1986 crossing the border from normalcy to disability the argument that disability is a socially constructed phenomenon is readily demonstrated in designations such as mild mental retardation learning disability and behavior disorder indeed the arbitrary nature of the term mental retardation was dramatically demonstrated by the american association on mental deficiency aamd in its radical revision of the definition from an iq cutoff point of 85 to a mere 70 overnight the population of mentally retarded persons was cut by 13 percent hardman drew egan  wolf 1990 at the other end of the spectrum the concept of excellence is equally relative to cultural values and goals in a provocative discussion of the current emphasis in the united states on excellence in education spener 1988 argues that the united states is experiencing not a crisis of literacy but a crisis of an overeducated workforce which allows employers to arbitrarily raise educational requirements for jobs this he says has the effect of further enforcing what ogbu 1978 has called a job ceiling which keeps minorities from moving up the social ladder this argument underscores the way that a society can constantly define and redefine its borders for success and failure chapter 6 outlined certain dimensions of culture that puerto rican families entering this society may bring with them and the ways in which they must redefine their identities to find a place within the mainstream culture of the united states this chapter will examine the impact of yet another redefinitionthe school systems classification of their children as having mild disabilities these puerto rican parents entering the united states at the bottom of the social ladder demonstrate that differing perspectives on disability can have farreaching effects8communication information and meaning chapter i of this book introduced a mother whom i have called ana a mother who like many others centers her life on her children and describes life in the united states as so dangerous that she tries to keep her children more at home than outside ana is the sort of mother whom many professionals in the united states would describe as overprotective of her children yet for all her efforts one of the most serious failures of communication reported in the study occurred with anas 9yearold daughter gina her gray eyes flashing ana recounted with renewed indignation a blunder made by the school district about two years before the study the social worker at her daughters school had called to say that gina was sick and needed to be taken home ana found a friend from the latin american association laa to drive her to the school only to find that cuando nosotros llegamos ellos nos dijeron this is the wrong school gina does not come here anymore me cambiaron la niña mia sin consentimiento mio y sin decirme nada y yo creía que era la misma escuela porque la guagua la recogía aquí y para mi era la misma guaguaentonces cuando los grandes del distrito escolar hicieron un programa sobre todas las personas puertorriqueñas que tenían complaints sobre los problemas de los niños en la escuela yo también fui a quejarme del problema que tuve con la niña mia ellos creían que era mentira mia pero otros padres puertorriqueños también tenían estos problemas y nosotros firmamos un papel sobre todas estas cosas entonces me hicieron una reunión conmigo bueno que fuimos a la reunión y cuando llegamos nos cogieron de sorpresa porque ya estaban todos allí esperando y ellos no me pudieron explicar todo exactamente ni yo pude hacer algunas preguntas porque no me dieron la oportunidad ellos dijeron entiende yo no entendí nada yo me vine de allí como si fuera como según llegué así salimos porque aunque mi amiga me explicó en español yo no entendí nadaabsolutamente nadapero they asked us to pardon them and now everything that happens with gina in the school they notify me right away pero si yo no llegué hablar de eso todo habría seguido pasando así porqué por años y años nadie pudiera entender to que estaba sucediendo en la escuela con los niños when we arrived they told us this is the wrong school gina does not come here anymore they had moved my child without my consent and without telling me anything and i thought she was still going to the same school because the school bus collects her right here and it looked like the same bus to methen when the big people at the school district called a meeting for all the puerto ricans who had complaints about problems with the children in school i went and complained about the problem i had with my daughter they thought i was telling a lie but other puerto rican parents were having these problems too and we all signed a paper complaining about these things then they had a meeting with me well we went to the meeting and they caught us by surprise because when we arrived they were all there waiting and they could not explain to me exactly what had happened and i could not really ask questions because they did not give me the opportunity they said you understand  but i did not understand anything i left there no better off than when i arrived because although my friend explained in spanish i understood nothingabsolutely nothingbut they asked us to pardon them and now everything that happens with gina at school they notify me right away but if i had not gone and complained about this it would have continued just the same because for years and years no one could understand what was happening to the children at school the only explanation i could get from school district personnel was that ana had not been present at the meeting where ginas change of placement was decided but that the decision was recorded on the individual education plan iep i was unable to ascertain whether ana had actually signed the iep without observing the change of school or whether it had never been signed this story of failure in communication is more dramatic than most but it exemplifies some of the essential features of the communication system between parents and the school perhaps the most obvious in this case being the ineffectiveness of a reliance on formal written communication overall i have characterized the observed patterns of ineffective communication between professionals and parents according to the following themes trust versus deference written communication an absence of information and meaning and resignation and withdrawal9toward informed consent l egal compliance versus culturally responsive practice the legal mandate for parental participation has been met by the development of specific regulations in each state regarding both written and face toface communication with parents as the previous chapter showed there are documents to be signed rules and timelines to be observed and not the least intimidating for parents meetings whose sole topic of conversation is their childrens learning difficulties the data so far have shown some events that were not in compliance with the regulations but more often they show that even when there is compliance this does not necessarily ensure parental participation or even informed consent this chapter will focus on meetings that illustrate the difference between compliance with the letter of the law and professional efforts to infuse into that inert structure the breath of culturally responsive practice the individualized education plan iep phase 1 meeting is that annual occasion on which parents come face to face with all the representatives of the system it is a time for communication and decision making and constitutes one of the central procedures of special education administration in this state the meeting must be held no later than 40 school days after the students initial referral and its main purpose is to review reports of the students assessment and current performance so as to make recommendations for the next years placement and program phase 2 of the iep must be developed within 30 days of a students entry into a program with the input of the teacher a member of the team that evaluated the student and the parent this document will specify curriculum goals related services and mainstreamed activities these meetings constitute parents official opportunity to be influential in the decisionmaking process yet mehan and colleagues 1986 in their careful analysis of such meetings conclude that these events represent the ratification of actions that occurred at previous stages in the process these researchers do not interpret this as a conspiratorial process but simply as the way that decisions are arrived at every step of the referraltoplacement process further entrenching the path to the decision that will be stated in the official meeting further their observations of meetings showed that the underlying assumptions that determined the structure of participation were shared by all parties in the process for example assumptions of the superiority of technical knowledge over commonsense knowledge and of the greater authority of those who hold higher rank within the school organization by virtue of such assumptions the reports of the psychologist and the nurse took on the character of professional reports as compared to the lay reports of the parent and classroom teacher typical features differentiating these were that the professional reports were presented and received without challenge or question while the lay reports were elicited through question and answer and appeared more like an interrogation of the mother and classroom teacher who were constantly interrupted by questions from other committee members mehan et al 1986 p 128 these participation structures have important implications for the meanings that emerge from such encounters mehan and colleagues 1986 observe that given these assumptions the use of technical language by professionals removes the usual grounds by which people negotiate meaning and ensures that the professional version of a students profile will be credentialed they explain because the speaker and hearers do not share membership in a common languagecommunity hearers do not have the expertise to interrupt or to question to request a clarification of the psychologist then is to challenge the authority of the official position of the district and its representative    thus committee members including the parents remain silent thereby implicitly contributing to the guise that understanding has been achieved pp 130131these process features are mirrored in the actual content of the decisions made as is nicely illustrated both by mehan and colleagues study and a similar analysis of iep meetings by bennett 1988 in the former the researchers illustrate the way educators cultural theory structured and delimited the reasoning process by which a students classification was arrived at the process of elimination used in decision making revealed the belief that situations and individuals not structural and institutional arrangements are possible causes of the students success and failure mehan et al 1986 p 132 thus institutional effects were not considered as possible sources of the students learning difficulties similarly bennett 1988 focuses on the dialogue between an iep team and a hispanic mother who had challenged the ieps description of her sons behavior bennetts analysis demonstrates how professionals defined what was appropriate to be included in the iep by defining the iep as being solely concerned with behavior presumably belonging to the child professionals excluded from the discussion the mothers concern with classroom structure thus the mothers interpretation of the role of classroom structure in her childs behavior was delegitimated by the meeting in the light of these observations the central question derived from the data of this study is what is the potential for genuine parental influence within the limits of the decisionmaking process the structure of parentprofessional discourse and the cultural theory that informs the entire process of a meeting although parents are invited to be present and participate there is no escaping the fact that they are respondents in the situation indeed the data of this study show unequivocally that culturally different parents come to these meetings as strangers to a system that is legally required to include them but whose patterns of discourse are so structured as to exclude meaningful dialogue and indeed to delegitimate parents views this chapter will show that while parents own personal styles will have an impact on the proceedings it is essentially the structure and atmosphere provided that will either include or exclude parents chapter 8 showed the tremendous miscommunication that had resulted from parents lack of information as well as careless or inappropriate professional behavior nevertheless the school district was at the same time engaged in intensive efforts to remedy these problems the provision of family liaison workers and the appointment of a task force to examine issues related to speech and language assessment of limitedenglishproficient lep students were two efforts that were beginning to show a beneficial effect this impact was becoming evident in certain meetings in particular those of one schoolbased team whose annual review meetings achieved a standard of excellence not observed in other meetings these efforts will be reviewed in the following sections10the school district challenge and change this study reveals two crucial challenges for the school district establishing effective communication with hispanic families and meeting the educational and personal needs of students in linguistic and cultural transition the atmosphere of mistrust confusion and dissatisfaction evident in the study reflected parents perceptions of experiences both past and current for some parents there was increasing satisfaction and for others continuing dissatisfaction this was a study of a school district in the process of change pressure from parents andor community frequently provides the impetus for school districts to revise their policies this has been particularly true in the case of spanishspeaking communities cordasco 1976 it was also true for this district three years prior to the study a challenge from the latin american association laa had forced the school district to examine its policies and practice regarding hispanic students and their families a district spokesman admitted that it certainly was a challenge which he described in this way it began 3 years ago when the director of the laa met with the superintendent he laid out some concerns valid concerns regarding graduation rates dropout rates placement of students regular ed and special ed for example a kid who comes in who is limited english proficient what grade do you place him in is it based on what his grade was in puerto rico or do you put him back a year so he can catch up or do you hold him back the other concern was communicationhow do parents know what is going on in school the district responded by establishing an english as a second language eslbilingual committee which reviewed relevant research as well as current practice in the district and in new york city one of the results of this was a special board of education meeting with the hispanic community which led to the districts investigation of specific individual complaints some of the data of this study such as anas complaint that her child was moved without her knowledge came under scrutiny at that time but beyond attempts to resolve specific incidents the initial committee evolved into two study groups one on
