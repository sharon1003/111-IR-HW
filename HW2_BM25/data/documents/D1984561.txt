flooring reasonable upcharge for epoxy groutk9fan march 20 2012we are having four areas tiled an entry a mudroom and the floors and walls of a bathroom in addition were having a very small wall 30 square feet of glass blocks constructed in the bathroom because ease of cleaning is at the top of my list for tile i requested that the contractor get an estimate to use epoxy grout instead of standard grout the subcontractor really dragged his feet and only provided the estimate today after he had begun spreading the mortar his upcharge is 950 for 490 square feet of coverage tile sizes and grout seams width varies but the largest area will be 235 square feet with 12x24 tiles and a 116 grout seam most of the grout seams are 116 is 2square foot a reasonable additional charge for doing epoxy grout it seems ridiculously high to me even though we live in an expensive area san francisco bay area i feel like the guy waited until he figured we couldnt say no but i am considering telling the contractor that the subcontractor needs to reduce this number or we want a different installer on the other hand we could pay the upcharge but reduce the areas in which to use epoxy i think the bathroom floor and mudroom are the essentials while the entry bathroom walls and glass block wall could probably use regular grout what do you think email save comment 15 like comments 15thank you for reporting this comment undoglennsfc epoxy grout is expensive it costs more per unit and it costs the installer more time to install and cleanup make sure the subcontractor is deducting the regular grout material cost ease of maintenance will be the ticket with epoxy grout and you will never be regroutingever what do floor people think who do tile all the time like save march 20 2012 at 1117pmthank you for reporting this comment undo prosophie wheeler thats an entirely reasonable upcharge or even a bit low for the amount of square footage being done epoxy grout is much more expensive as a material and its more expensive for labor as well because its much harder to deal with however i have to caution you that an installer who is reluctant to work with it wouldnt be my first choice you dont want to be the job hes getting his on the job experience with like save march 20 2012 at 1122pmthank you for reporting this comment undok9fan thank you both in fact the original charges did not include the grout as far as i know so the upcharge is entirely for labor were buying the grout ourselves i am concerned too about the fact that this subcontractor has been so reluctant to use epoxy grout actually what were buying is spectralock which i understand has similar properties weve trusted to our contractor to provide good subs but im not very comfortable about this one if i had it to do over again i would push harder for a different one like save march 21 2012 at 100amthank you for reporting this comment undonerdyshopper when i used epoxy grout in our washroom i bought all the materials after i paid the tile store 100 each for gallon sized container of grout then i discovered it at lowes hardware locally in quart sized packages for 20 dollars each the installer did not add any more for using it but it did take him a lot longer to do i think and he must have kicked himself for not adding a reasonable charge for labor it took a lot of grout for an area of about 6x10 feet i believe took over a gallon1 like save march 21 2012 at 652amthank you for reporting this comment undoglennsfc be very careful hereyou do need someone with experience with the materialyou want to avoid a potential disaster i will say that 2 per square foot upcharge simply to work with the epoxy grout rather than cementious grout seems excessive on the face of it an installer has to stick with the grouting task until it is thoroughly done that meansthere is no returning the next day to remove haze or do a final cleanupit all has to be done continuous from start until finish what i am saying here is that the installer will be making an extra 950 labor over and above his normal charge for maybe 8 or 10 straight hours of work however if he has to split the areas and work two days instead of one grouting with the stuff then 950 seems reasonable when you factor in his normal charge to groutwell that figures not so good you have to decide whether to pay the freight here but whatever you decide to doyou need an installer who has experience working with laticretes spectralock grout and make sure you buy enough grout and make sure it is all from the same lot production run1 like save march 21 2012 at 634pmthank you for reporting this comment undo floortech a good installer has the spectralock figure as his standard of labor price i feel he is too high for an up chargebut who knows regarding frisco rates if he is reluctant to use spectra lock i wouldnt use himend of story like save march 22 2012 at 234amthank you for reporting this comment undo proavanti tile  stone  stonetech epoxy grout is a pain in the butt to install your tile guy will spend about 3 times as long to install properly his price is not out of line i might suggest you look into urethane grout available at dal tile a gallon is under 100 but is almost as good as epoxy and is far easier to use i recommend it in all my shower installs like save march 24 2012 at 516pmthank you for reporting this comment undo jondear i recommend epoxy to my customers it isnt bad to work with if you get it as clean as you need to when doing it as others have stated if you miss some its like cleaning up bubble gum or worse it doesnt stain and holds up very well my 2 cents like save march 24 2012 at 748pmthank you for reporting this comment undoweedyacres i wouldnt spend the extra for using epoxy grout on the walls just the floors cant speak to the costs as ive diyed all my floors but im glad we used it in our hightraffic areas like save march 28 2012 at 1003pmthank you for reporting this comment undok9fan well we did pay the extra money to have the spectalock grout installed by the contractors usual tiler and we are not thrilled with all the results on the laundry room floor im not sure how its working out the grout is gray and weve only lived in the house a week the room does get very dirty dogs and i mop it often but i cant tell whether the narrow seams are clean or not our front entry also has gray grout however in the bathroom its a different story the tile and grout are very light and the floor shows dirt very easily and needs frequent mopping the grout there is not rejecting dirt ive wetmopped a couple of times also tried with an ammonia solution and the grout in traffic areas is significantly discolored compares to the grout in areas where we dont walk needless to say after all the drama to get this done im really disappointed i havent yet had the remaining grout two wall areas in the bathroom get dirty enough to need cleaning by sheer coincidence an acquaintance who owns several rentals came by and actually pulled a jewelers loupe out of her purse to look at the dirty grout she said that 1 we shouldnt have used sanded epoxy grout i just bought what was in the store which was laticrete spectralock and 2 that the grout she looked at is too porous and was probably not mixed right she said its very hard to find a tile installer who actually knows how to use epoxy grout we have the local spectralock rep and our contractor coming out to look at the problem next week disappointing like save may 25 2012 at 124pmthank you for reporting this comment undo tile tech price is reasonable like save may 26 2012 at 122pmthank you for reporting this comment undoweedyacres its pretty hard to not mix epoxy grout right it comes in premeasured packages that you stir together my experience with epoxy grout is not that it doesnt get dirty but that the dirt can be scrubbed out and doesnt stain the grout permanently like save may 28 2012 at 936pmthank you for reporting this comment undok9fan weedyacres thanks for the reply you know after neither wet mopping with water nor ammonia solution worked i tried spraying one area of the darkened bathroom grout with 409 and rubbing it with a cloth and it still looks dirty if this is the normal performance of epoxy grout i just dont see the advantage over regular grout in this floor and in fact i am wondering if sealed regular grout would have cleaned up better its very puzzling since epoxy grout seems to have such a good reputation for being easy to keep looking good this grout was installed by a subcontractor that i believe is considered very professional i will be interested to see what the latricrete rep and the tile installation company owner say about the situation like save may 29 2012 at 240amthank you for reporting this comment undoweedyacres it sounds like most of the cleaning youve tried just involves wiping with different formulas try bathroom cleaner like scrubbing bubbles and a toothbrush wiping up the residual with a cloth like save may 29 2012 at 840pmthank you for reporting this comment undo matthew wilson i am a tile guy started at 16 and im now 36 it is a reasonable up charge he was hesitant because epoxy takes 3 times as long i hate hate hate the stuff it is suposed to be stain proof but it isnt i know from expierince it discolors all grout does all grout has dye to give it its color just like a shirt do they make any fade and stain proof shirts no and there is no such thing as stain proof grout if you want clean grout dont get dirt on it i have heard of instalkers charging as much as 3 a foot more for epoxy i usually add 1 so 2 is not bad any company selling epoxy will tell you the stuff is great but they are just trying to get you to buy their products like a car sales man it is more stain resistant than portland cement grout there are no grouts that bleach will not ruin like save february 16 2017 at 429amsign up to comment
