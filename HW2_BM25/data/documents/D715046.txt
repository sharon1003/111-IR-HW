selecting an anvil which is right for you jock dempsey  anvilfirecom to the uninitiated all anvils look alike just a big lump of iron with pointed ends in fact they are a deceivingly sophisticated tool that are made in many styles materials and sizes the best anvils are made of selectively hardened tool steel with a well balanced attractive shape and various useful working surfaces it has taken centuries to develop the shapes of anvils and similar to the violin some anvil styles were perfected long ago and will probably never change type by weight range  min  max pounds type kilos75  500

are different in both size and style as with most tools there is a lot of overlap in application a forging anvil or general shop anvil can also be used for making horse shoes and light forging can be done on a farriers anvil a heavy sheet metal stake can be used for light forging and bench work small bench work anvils can be used for jewelry but are clumsy for delicate work however it is impossible to forge anything larger than fine wire on a little 5 oz 150g jewelers anvil and difficult to use a large 200 pound 90kg forging anvil for jewelry work each task is best performed using the proper size tool the size of the anvil should be proportional to the work and the hammer used to perform that work for forging an average hand hammer to anvil ratio of about 501 is normal example a heavy 4 pound 1800g hammer and a 200 pound 90kg anvil are a good match forging anvils are also known as blacksmiths or general shop anvils these range in weight from about 75 pounds to 500 pounds or more they differ from farriers anvils in that there is more mass in the body directly under the face and less distributed in the horn and heel due to the prevalence of horse drawn transportation in the early part of the 20th century most popular anvils were a combination of farriers and forging anvil today the peddinghaus vaughans euro and nimba are typical forging anvils these are designed for heavy forging and have all the standard features of a blacksmiths anvil the first decision to make when selecting a forging anvil is the size or weight in general you want the heaviest anvil you can afford but there are other factors do you need portability do you need to move your anvil to the job or from storage to work space 100 to 150 pound 45 to 70 kg anvils are the most commonly found old anvil because they are the largest convenient portable size the scale of your work is also a factor if you know that most of your work is going to be light forging of 12 13mm stock or less or heavy sheet metal then a small anvil between 75 and 125 pounds is a good choice a few smiths like the narrow face of smaller anvils if you plan on doing lots of architectural work professionally or sculpture then a 200 pound 90 kg anvil is normally considered the minimum general shop anvil those that do heavy work need as heavy of an anvil over 200 pounds as they can afford up to 500 pounds smiths that work on heavy anvils will tell you they can feel the difference in ease of work between a 200 and 300 pound 90 and 135 kg anvil quality ranking by construction1 forged tool steel2 steel plate on wrought body3 cast tool steel4 steel plate on cast iron5 hardened ductile iron6 chilled cast iron7 cast iron aso historical manufacturing method no longer used  aso anvil shaped object aka door stop the next decision is largely economic and that is the quality or material of the anvil today you have two choices in anvils forged or cast forged anvils and tools have been regarded as the most durable for centuries and are still considered the best they are also more expensive than cast tools in north america the only forged anvil available is the ridgid tool co peddinghaus after that is the cast tool steel anvil the best heat treated cast steel anvils are almost indistinguishable from the best forged however there are some low quality cast steel anvils to avoid these it is best to purchase a recognized brand name or from a knowledgeable dealer that you can trust cast iron anvils are popularly called an aso for anvil shaped object these anvils are cheap junk largely being imported from china they are soft brittle and will chip or break under normal use they are not suitable for any extended use other than as a door stop style varies somewhat among different brands of forging anvil the difference between single horned with a wide rectangular heel and double horn with a tapering square is largely a matter of taste or what you are used to the short waistless italian style nimba and texas farrier supply anvils look odd to many but are good forging anvil designs the common features of most anvils are the same flat face round horn large square hardie hole small round punching or pritchell hole features that vary on forging anvils are square or rectangular heel a step between face and horn upsetting block side shelf multiple punching holes farriers anvils may look like any other anvil to the neophyte but they are a highly specialized type of anvil modern farriers anvils put a high proportion of the mass in the horn and often have just enough in the heel to balance the anvil the base has negligible mass because the majority of modern farriers travel to the horse most farriers anvils are made in the portability range of 100 to 150 pounds 45 to 70kg modern farriers anvils also have special features such as clip horns for forming toe clips and turning cams for ease of adjusting a shoe due to their very narrow waist most farriers anvils are too springy for general forging work and should be avoided by nonfarriers all the currently available farriers anvils are cast steel or hardened ductile iron stake anvils for heavy use are largely out of style and no longer available small stake anvils are available from peddinghaus and several manufacturers make the types designed for sheet metal and artistic iron work modern sheet metal stakes are designed to be supported in a stake plate or bench socket however they can be supported in a vice for light work or stump mounted like the old fashioned stake anvils stake anvils for sheet metal work are rarely very heavy the largest weighing 15 or 20 pounds there are dozens of shapes available the blowhorn stake is the most common having a large steep half cone on one side and a long tapered round on the other a beakhorn stake is similar except the long arm is rectangular there are many others named for their original purpose such as needle case and candle mold the blowhorn was made for making musical brass horns then there are others named for their shape such as mushroom ball hatchet or grooving stakes stake anvils are not suitable for forging but can be used for bench and heavier jewelry work bench anvils are small anvils that range in size from 5 to 50 pounds generally the only definition of a bench anvil is that it is used on a bench for supporting work to be hammered styles
