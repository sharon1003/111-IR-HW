ministries king david’s best friend was named jonathan  which means “ gift of yahweh ” or “ yahweh has given ” when jonathan came to an untimely death david wrote of him “i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women” 2 sam 126 he lamented of jonathan “how are the mighty fallen” 2 sam 119 we are going to learn that they shared a special “blood covenant” which turns out to be a picture of what jesus accomplished for humanitytonight we will look into the background of jonathan’s covenant with david in order to proceed it is important that we first capture the biblical connotation behind a covenant a covenant is much the same as a contract however it is even more binding a contract is an agreement between two parties on any given issue however a covenant is more like the merging of future fortunes a covenant is essentially an oath sealed not with pen and ink but with blood a covenant establishes a union marked by the peaceful shedding of blood for this reason we observe that all bible covenants are associated with the shedding of blood for example abraham’s covenant  the old covenant demanded circumcision of male children god even intended the shedding of blood into the marriage covenant by the breaking of the female hymen therefore it is obvious that god considers marriage to be more of a covenant than a contract marriage is more than an agreement between two parties it is the combining of their future into one flesh  a child a covenant is a solemn binding oath with blood it takes place between two parties or kingdoms of people the bible also illustrates that a covenant relationship exists between god and man indeedthe major subdivisions of god’s covenant are acknowledged as the old testament and the new testamentwe know that jonathan felt so strongly about his identification with david that he wanted to formalize their relationship by involking a covenant through that formal procedure jonathan honored david with gifts jonathan gave away his robe symbolic of his royal inheritance and his weapons symbolic of his strength power and might jonathan effectively proclaimed that david’s friendship was more valuable to him than were all of his accomplishments his political power and even his position as heir aparent through it all jonathan was out of place he did not act like the others who came from saul’s house those others who hated david on the contrary he loved david more than himself often he tried to work peace into the relationship linking david and saul however the more he tried the more saul’s anger grew toward david and toward jonathanaccording to all known practices among the people of his time jonathan was the heir apparent and was in place to become the next king in israel nevertheless we observe in scripture that much earlier samuel anointed david to become the next king david was poised to assume the status that would have been jonathan’s this means that under normal circumstances they would have been mortal enemies jonathan’s father  king saul knew that it was only a matter of time before david would take jonathans position upon the throne of israel even thought jonathan completely understood this situation he remained loyal to his friend david the bible first describes jonathan and david’s special relationship when david slew goliath “abner  saul’s general took him  david  and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand 58 and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite” 1 sam 175758 obviously this took place right after david killed goliath “it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul thatthe soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul 2 and saul took him that day and would let him  david go no more home to his fathers house 3then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul 4 and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle” 1 sam 1814 even though the bible first mentions the meeting of david and jonathan at this time it is probable that they had first become acquainted earlier when king saul employed david’s musical abilities regardless of when their relationship started their hearts were tightly knit in close friendship and as a result of that close friendship they became blood brothersthe hebrew root “to cut” is the basis of the hebrew word brit meaning covenant the hebrew phrase karât brit literally means to “cut a covenant” when we think about covenant we must realize that blood is connotatively implicated we christians must seek a deeper understanding of what a blood covenant entails if you have not yet read the rivkah ministries bible study entitled “ covenant ” you should obtain a copy of that bible study from httpwwwrivkahorg as a result of their covenant jonathan gave david gifts that evidently were established by ancient custom “ and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle”david had no gifts to exchange with jonathan nonetheless jonathan gave david his own possessions ancient peoples believed that an individual’s clothes were an outward expression of the man clothes didnt make the man instead an individual’s apparel was simply an expression of that man in essence jonathan gave of himself to david when he gave him those gifts it is ironic that david had previously rejected the king’s  sauls armor however in this instance david accepted all of jonathans gifts jonathan somehow recognized that he and david were men of like minds they were also both men of faith and perceived life in the same way what is more important they were both willing to entrust themselves to the lord no matter what it might cost notice what david told king saul just before he confronted goliath “thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them” 1 sam 1736 in the same fashion notice jonathan’s words prior to his own peril “between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side    6 and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised  it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few ” 1 sam 1446 clearly jonathan referred to the “ uncircumcised ” in the same way that david had previously referred to them during jonathan’s skirmish against the philistine garrison he made reference to his covenant by mentioning the “ uncircumcised ” both jonathan and david were covenant oriented and trusted in godupwards of twenty years after cutting their original covenant we find jonathan and david yet again strengthening thier firstcovenant “11 and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field 12 and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee 13 the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father 14 and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord that i die not 15 but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth 16 so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of davids enemies 17 and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul” 1 sam 201117 notice toward the end of this encounter “and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city” 1 sam 2042 here we find that jonathan repeated his pledge of love and friendship toward david indeed jonathan loved david more than his own soul in this covenant david and jonathan’s mercy toward one another was extended even to their future generations they made a covenant to bless through each other their yet unborn children they made a covenant of mutual kindness extending even to their descendants god watches very carefully over our human covenants not surprisingly we discover that saul  jonathan’s father was guilty of breaking covenant let’s take careful note of god’s own involvement in the covenants of his people we will observe 1 a covenant that was established by joshua 2 saul’s breaking of that covenant and 3 the resulting punishment upon israel for breaking their covenant 1 several years earlier the gibeonites beguiled israel into a covenant with joshua – “when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai 4 they did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up 5 and old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy 6 and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us 7 and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you 8 and they said unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye 9 and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt 10 and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth 11 wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us 12 this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldy 13 and these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey 14 and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord 15 and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them 16 and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them 17 and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day now their cities were gibeon  and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim 18 and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel  we should never say “i swear to god” unless we fully intend to live by those words forever and all the congregation murmured against the princes 19 but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them 20 this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them 21 and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised them 22 and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us 23 now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god” josh 9323 2 saul breaks joshua’s covenant – “then there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year  whenever a famine lasts three years it is obvious that god is involved and david inquired of the lord and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites 2 and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah 2 sam 2112 3 seven of saul’s heirs were killed they became a curse and hanged on tree “3 wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord  perhaps they had earlier placed a curse upon israel 4 and the gibeonites said unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you 5 and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel 6 let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them 7 but the king spared mephibosheth  the son of jonathan  we are going to discover that this is the second time that david intervened in the life of mephibosheth the son of saul because of the lords oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul 8 but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul  it is interesting that king saul had earlier given michal to david however king saul took her back and gave her to another whom she brought up for adriel  adriel was michal’s sister the son of barzillai the meholathite 9 and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest  the barley harvest takes place in marchapril 10 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven  the “water drops out of heaven” or the rainy season comes after the fall holy days therefore these seven men were hung and left unburied for six months and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night 11 and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done 12 and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa 13 and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged 14 and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was intreated for the land” 2 sam 21314 here we find that david fulfilled his covenant with jonathan by protecting mephibosheth while at the same time the gibeonites wanted to execute seven of saul’s descendants because he had broken covenant more importantly we see here that god himself brought a drought upon israel because saul had carelessly broken the covenant established by joshua with the gibeonites god is a god of covenants scripture calls him “the faithful god which keepeth covenant ” deut 79 god keeps covenant he is serious about them and observes that our covenants are kept also jonathan’s story is all about covenant let’s take note of some things concerning the covenant between jonathan and david their covenant was made in secret therefore no one knew about their mutual pledge except god we must also realize at that point in time jonathan was dead 1 that covenant had been made many years before perhaps 30–some years earlier 2 that covenant had been made during a time of great adversity for david 3 their covenant concerned their children and grandchildren the whole nation of israel was aware of the covenant made by joshua and the gibeonites nevertheless king saul openly broke that covenant on the other hand nobody knew about the covenant made between jonathan and david and that covenant was kept we should begin to understand why god said “i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will” acts 1322 it would have been so easy for david to simply ignore his covenant with jonathan nevertheless he rememberedwe should try to imagine the horror that saul’s family must have experienced when they first heard that saul and jonathan had been killed during battle they all understood that saul had considered david to be an enemy therefore all of saul’s clan sought after the life of david for twenty years it follows that once saul was dead david was free to take over the throne of israel however in the eyes of saul’s family this was not good news in those days it was common for the new king to kill all of the previous king’s male heirs to ensure that nobody from the previous dynasty would try to reestablish the old throneobviously david had no such notion in mind nonetheless saul’s family did not know that and they all fled in great fear notice what happened to jonathan’s little boy who “ was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth  meaning to dispel shame ” 2 sam 44 saul’s family greatly feared king david nonetheless we can see david’s real attitude toward saul’s family “and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathans sake 2 and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba and he said thy servant is he 3 and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet 4 and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar  lodebar means “pastureless” however the hebrew roots means “no or without” and “good word” lodebar is on the wrong side of the jordan 5 then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir  machir literally means to sell  as merchandise a daughter in marriage into slavery figuratively it means to surrender the son of ammiel  ammiel means “the people of god” from lodebar  that last verse literally says that to dispel shame david brought to himself the people of god who were in the house of surrender because of no good word  6 now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant 7 and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy fathers sake  and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually 8 and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am 9 then the king called to ziba sauls servant and said unto him i have given unto thy masters son all that pertained to saul and to all his house 10 thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants 11 then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the kings sons 12 and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth 13 so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table and was lame on both his feet” 2 sam 9 mephibosheth was completely stunned he went from utter despair to great joy in a matter of moments he had done nothing to merit this favor from the king david did not especially care for mephibosheth because he had compassion upon the lame david sought out to care for mephibosheth because he had much earlier entered into a blood covenant with his father jonathanobviously this story is appealing in the natural however this story is much more than a tender tale from israel’s illustrious past this story forms an analogy of the relationship between god and mankind david represents god the king who loves all of his creation indeed he wants to show mercy and kindness to humanity unfortunately humanity is represented by the family of saul we have all been rebellious against the will of god what we needed was someone to make a covenant between god and rebellious humanity even though jonathan was a member of saul’s family he did not hate david like a normal son of saul instead he was more like david and delighted to do the will of god jesus christ represents jonathan  which means jehovah’s gift  he became flesh and dwelt among us like jonathan he really did not fit in with the rest of saul’s sons of rebellion nevertheless he was one of us  the son of man  he was like god yet he was like man “in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily” col 29 since he was the creator he was worth more than all of his creation all of us human beings put together do not equal his magnificence he did not carry our blood disease which is our sin nature therefore he was worthy to take our place in a covenant relationship with god almightyhe was “the lamb slain from the foundation of the world” rev 138 therefore when he shed his blood we were in him like mephibosheth was blessed in jonathan we were in jesus when he made a blood covenant with god god made a covenant with jesus and since we are “in him” we are qualified  based upon our knowledge of and faith in the work of jesus to receive the benefits of his covenant all of our diseases all of our lameness was placed upon him when he went to the cross “he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not 4 surely he hath borne our griefs  hebrew word kholee which means sicknesses and carried our sorrows hebrew word makobe meaning pain and sorrow  yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all 7 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken 9 and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death” isa 5339 david used his covenant with jonathan to endow special benefits of the covenant upon mephibosheth likewise god the father will take all of the benefits of the covenant of jesus christ and place them upon us based upon 1 our knowledge of and 2 faith in the finished work of jesus christ upon the cross we are mephibosheth  which me ans to dispel shame  here are the terms of the new covenant that we receive through our lord jesus took all of our liabilities and all of our sins and placed them upon himself he became sin for us he forgave our iniquities and remembers them no more he took our selfrighteousness and gave us his own righteousness we must completely give him our clothing  self righteousness which is filthy rags and in turn he clothed us with his own garments of salvation and righteousness we became part of him and he lives in our hearts we feast at his table and he is a father to us he adopted us as his own sons here are the actual scriptures that reference those specific promises 1 “i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah 32 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord 33 but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people” jer 313133 2 “i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah 9 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant  and i regarded them not saith the lord 10 for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people” heb 8810 3 “and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh 20 that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god” ezek 111920 4 “then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you 26 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh 27 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them 28 and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god” ezek 362528the souls of jonathan and david were closely knit together jonathan was of one spirit with david they shared the kind of relationship that most people only long to have they were like the lone ranger and tonto or perhaps batman and robin however jonathan and david were equals without question david was just a man however he was also a flawed human jonathan obviously shared this common humanity with david on the other hand christ is perfect and “was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin ” heb 415 jesus is fully god and fully man because he is fully god we cannot relate to him as an equal however because he is fully man we can have a coequal relationship of friendship with him and we can live under the covenant he has with the fatherour relationship is real but it is not a relationship of equals think back to jonathan’s friendship with david since his heart was one with david’s our hearts should likewise be one with christ if jonathan formalized his relationship with david through a covenant how much more should we formalize our relationship with christ through the terms of the covenant as identified in the new testament jonathan was an extraordinary man the biblical record does not one time show where he lacked faith or made a poor decision he was certainly a different cut of cloth than was king saul jonathan was a man of commitment and he was filled with integrity jonathan provides for us the best human biblical picture of true friendship and loyalty jonathan  yahweh’s gift was the legitimate successor to his father’s throne however jonathan took his amour sword bow and belt and gave them to david this symbolically indicated that he was willing to give up that right in order for david to be crowned in his stead we should recognize jesus in this example jesus  yahweh’s gift –  who was glorified in god’s presence gave up all of that glory in order to become a human who would make a covenant with god for us “ this cup is the new testament  covenant in my blood which is shed for you ” luke 2220 john 1513 teaches us that “greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends” jonathan provides the best human biblical picture of true friendship and loyalty however jesus’ example is unsurpassedplease take just a few minutes to complete a
