garden web topics  home forums  cooking forgot fish on counter petragw july 10 2013i am so mad at myself i bought 20 worth of wild salmon and cod today and cut them up and sealed into plastic bags to freeze was interrupted in the middle of doing this washed my hands left the kitchen and totally forgot about them didnt return to the kitchen until an hour ago and put them in the freezer right away but they were on the countertop for approx 5 hours so they probably have to be thrown out email save comment 28 like comments 28lizh im not sure but i think the temperature in your kitchen would make a difference like save july 10 2013 at 1112pmpetragw air conditioner has been on so the kitchen stays around 69 or 70 like save july 10 2013 at 1129pmclblakey food safe course says meat fish and eggs should be thrown away if left out in the danger zone for more than 2 hours danger zone is above 4cit is amazing i am not dead yet for breaking the rules i regularly thaw meat on the counter this post was edited by clblakey on wed jul 10 13 at 2354like save july 10 2013 at 1152pmannie1992im also a rule breaker i spent my life taking a package of meat from the freezer and putting it in the sink to thaw going to work all day and cooking it when i came home i thawed turkey in the sink for years yes i know the rules and maybe im lucky or maybe i have a strong immune system from being exposed to all types of things on the farm but ive gotten away with it now that fish i sure wouldnt use it for sushi and i wouldnt probably feed it to someone ill or elderly frail very young etc would i eat it myself that depends if i caught it myself or knew who caught it and so i knew how old it was and how long it had been stored before i brought it home maybe if it has one of those product of china labels on it well im leaning way further in the no direction although id probably cook it and use it for dog food bottom line is if you arent comfortable i think you should probably toss it annie like save july 11 2013 at 1222amannt like annie ive broken the rules too but fish no im very picky about fish to begin with and only buy fish that i am going to cook the same day i dont freeze fish i know i wouldnt eat fish that had been left out on the counter for five hours so i definitely would not freeze fish that had been left out that longann like save july 11 2013 at 1233amdcarch7 d c f l a s h 7  y a h o o  c o m i am not recommending this to anyone i have been to many areas where warm meat is out all day in hot tropical weather in markets flies bugs  when the meat gets a little smelly they just wash it again just for myself not suggesting for anyone else i use the smell test if food has been out of the refrigerator too long fish and other seafood are different texture deteriorates rapidly if not cooked right away i think i have gotten minor stomach discomfort maybe only twice in my entire lifedcarch like save july 11 2013 at 654amsleevendog 5a ny 6a nyc nl caim also pretty picky about fish id be pissed too fish is expensive also depends where it was purchased i buy wild caught salmon frozen as most is flashfrozen anyway then thawed at the market all shrimp is frozen then thawed and spread out on ice i always buy it frozen a few exceptions in some areas if you meet the boat did you sniff it before freezing i just thawed my last cod fillet yesterday for dinner tonight just gave it a rinse this morning and it has zero smell the freezer bag it was in and under the sink in the small stink garbage can was pretty rank after about 6hrs and had to go out to the garbage can last night like save july 11 2013 at 704amwintercatgwdcarch  yes huge chunks of meat inside and outside butcher shops on hooks with a cloud of flies around them the more hygienic minded butchers would spray them with ddt im talking about certain parts of the middle east about 50 years ago like save july 11 2013 at 729ampetragw it was alaskan wild salmon and wild cod argh what a waste only reason i froze it upon discovery was just in case there was a chance i might be able to use it anyway but after reading all of the above and also checking some food safety sites i am not gonna use it 20 is not worth getting food poisoning darn i still cant believe i did that no more letting myself be distracted when putting groceries away like save july 11 2013 at 1030ammomj47goodness id eat it in a heartbeat you are going to cook it arent you at the very least use it in a chowder or stew or soup thats good stuff otherwise give it to the wildlife let it go back into the food chain

a bummer i would give it to the wildlife they may or may not eat it barring that id plant it in the garden  great fertilizertricia like save july 11 2013 at 1056ambumblebeez sc zone 7lets ask john l hahahalike save july 11 2013 at 1100amolychick well i would thaw it not on the counter  and smell it fish lets you know if its bad when its raw and gets stinky if its not stinky and you cook it thoroughly i cant imagine how it could make you sick id use it in a heartbeat and i am very fussy about fish i think whether it spoiled or not might also depend on your source ie how fresh it was if you got it from a fish market that gets it frequently and its very fresh vs something sitting in the supermarket for a few days like save july 11 2013 at 1113ampetragw it was previously frozen and thawed for sale at the fish counter by the time i bought it it was fully thawed i did have it put on ice to take home but had discarded the ice when i took it out to portion it re giving it to the critters i know dogs do eat rotten stuff but our lab has a sensitive stomach and i dont want to risk any gastric upset he weighs 120 pounds and its like cleaning up after a person very gross o we just had a fat kitty vet bill so not gonna risk giving it to the cats either i will put it out for whatever wild critters want it oh well next time we make a trip to trader joes gonna stock up on their frozen alaskan salmon and try to remember to put it in the freezer olike save july 11 2013 at 1237pmmomj47i wouldnt give it to my pets i put my leftovers etc out back in the woods lots of animals eat carrion we should have immune systems like vulturesthis post was edited by momj47 on thu jul 11 13 at 1927like save july 11 2013 at 449pmannt petra i didnt realize that this was previously frozen thawed fish i dont know what others here do but i would never refreeze meats or fish that had already been frozen once and thawed it is really too bad you had to throw it out but at least your neighbourhood critters will enjoyann like save july 11 2013 at 502pmfoodonastump lol around here 20 of wasted fish would be drop in the bucket as compared to cooling the house to 69 degreeslike save

lookout station other brothers and sisters are stationed on strategic poles along the beach creepyi thought it was bad that last year we had an osprey that sat on a light pole across the street and to eat breakfast and lunch on top of the light glad i didnt have to clean up the area under the light i forgot to ask where he ate dinner sorry this happened to you but something out there wont be affected like save july 11 2013 at 600pmsleevendog 5a ny 6a nyc nl ca69 degrees lucky you our limit is 79 i do refreeze but not that often it did take a while to accept it but something i read said it was fine i did buy shrimp recently and dinner plans got sidetracted so i tossed it in the freezer with its ice like save july 11 2013 at 642pmdedtired20 worth of fish on the counter for five hours in an air conditioned house id cook it and eat for sure however i dont freeze fish either i buy it the day i plan to cook it and only get as much as i will use for that meal just give it the old whiff test your nose knows like save july 11 2013 at 942pmannie1992i dont worry about the cost of air conditioning because i dont have air conditioning saves me a ton of money lol if that salmon were some of my own wild caught salmon i might give it a shot but definitely not something that was already frozen then thawed cooper loves fish and the vet says its good for him so id still use it for dog food darned expensive dog food given your dogs propensities though id probably use it for compost i dont suppose you have a garden the native americans have always dropped a chunk of fish in the corn rows its great fertilizer annie like save july 11 2013 at 952pmpetragw air conditioner is usually kept at 76 but sometimes hot flashes demand a quick cooling off especially after carrying groceries in from 95 degrees o there are no woods closeby but i threw the frozen fish out in the front and it was gone this morning we do have lots of wild creatures who hopefully wont get ill from it like save july 11 2013 at 957pmdcarch7 d c f l a s h 7  y a h o o  c o m i seem to remember those times when i was in paris there were many stores which sold meat without refrigeration wild pheasants boars other games just hung in front of the storesdcarch like save july 11 2013 at 1014pmsleevendog 5a ny 6a nyc nl cai did run some errands today and when home and hauling i did sneak it down to 76   my pups would get a meal of that fish for sure after a sniff test their gutsdigestion are a bit more forgiving no critter will get ill like save july 11 2013 at 1055pmpetragwdcarch in europe meat was sometimes hung right in the shop to age that could have been the case with the wild game havent seen fish left out though sleevendog when we had to replace the air conditioner we had a heat pump installed our area does get kinda cold in winter but it doesnt constantly stay below freezing so the pump works fine it saves quite a bit of money on electricity like save july 12 2013 at 1118ampetragw annie we do have a small garden area with tomatoes peppers and herbs guess thatll have to wait for my next forgetful episode o i once read that a famous rose authoritygardening book author maybe gertrude jekyll cant remember for sure had her gardener murder a rabbit each time she wanted to plant a new rose to put in the planting hole o like save july 12 2013 at 213pmartsyshell i agree with many others i used to break major rules regarding food safety now i only defrost in the fridge or a sink of very cold water which works very well but having had major food poisoning i wouldnt risk fish or seafood that had been left out for five hours fish doesnt take very long to defrost so wouldnt want to risk it unless you had air conditioning on in your house as bad as 20 is food poisoning is way worse and likely to turn you off of fish forever like save july 12 2013 at 1000pmannie1992petra the tomatoes and peppers probably would have loved it unless your dog got wind of it and dug it up then maybe neither you nor your garden would be happy grinannie like save july 13 2013 at 116amsign up to comment browse gardening and landscaping stories on houzz see all stories my houzz my houzz saltbox charm in a
