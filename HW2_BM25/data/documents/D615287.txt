constitutional law the rule prevents evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendant s constitutional rights from being used in a court of law this may be considered an example of a prophylactic rule formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right the exclusionary rule may also in some circumstances at least be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language such as the fifth amendment s command that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself and that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law 1the exclusionary rule is grounded in the fourth amendment and it is intended to protect citizens from illegal searches and seizures 2 the exclusionary rule is also designed to provide a remedy and disincentive which is short of criminal prosecution in response to prosecutors and police who illegally gather evidence in violation of the fifth amendment in the bill of rights compelled to selfincrimination the exclusionary rule also protects against violations of the sixth amendment which guarantees the right to counsel most states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained evidence under their state constitutions andor statutes some of which predate the federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and compelled selfincrimination 3this rule is occasionally referred to as a legal technicality because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed in this respect it is similar to the explicit rule in the fifth amendment protecting people from double jeopardy in strict cases when an illegal action is used by policeprosecution to gain any incriminating result all evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal action—this evidence is known as  fruit of the poisonous tree —can be thrown out from a jury or be grounds for a mistrial if too much information has been irrevocably revealed the exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the united states regardless of whether they are citizens immigrants legal or illegal or visitors contents  hide 1 history of the rule2 limitations of the rule21 parallel construction3 criticism and defense4 see also5 references6 further reading history of the rule  editup until the independence of the united states the courts of england excluded selfincriminating evidence that was provided as a result of official compulsion regardless of its reliability 4 in 1769 lord chief justice mansfield explained as follows“ in civil causes the court will force parties to produce evidence which may prove against themselves or leave the refusal to do it after proper notice as a strong presumption to the jury but in a criminal or penal cause the defendant is never forced to produce any evidence though he should hold it in his hands in court 5”chief justice mansfield also explained that if any evidence or confession has been extorted from her it will be of no prejudice to her on the trial 6 additionally a defendant could sue to suppress and regain possession of at least some types of illegally seized evidence in a common law action for replevin 7however in the 1783 case of ceglinski v orr the english courts declined to suppress evidence obtained by illegal coercion in the warickshall case evidence was gathered as a result of an involuntary confession and the court held that the evidence but not the confession itself could be admitted 8 it is questionable whether the warickshall rule became known in the united states before 1789 when the u s bill of rights was written and whether it applied to confessions obtained by both governmental and private parties 4 in any event no decision by the supreme court of the united states has ever endorsed the warickshall rule as a constitutional matter 4generally speaking english law before 1789 did not provide as strong an exclusionary rule as the one that later developed under the fourth amendment to the united states constitution regarding unlawful searches and seizures 7 the fourth amendment after all was partly a reaction against english law including the general warrant and the writs of assistance 7in the 1886 case of boyd v united states 9 the u s supreme court addressed compulsory production of business papers and the court excluded those papers based on a combination of the fourth and fifth amendments boyd was closely limited to its facts and several years later the court stated that the fourth amendment does not extend to excluding testimony about wrongful searches and seizures 10in 1897 the u s supreme court held in bram v united states 11 that involuntary confessions are inadmissible as evidence the court in bram did not announce a strong version of the exclusionary rule that would apply uniformly to exclude all evidence gathered in violation of the bill of rights but instead announced a weak version that excluded only selfincriminating testimony that was compelled in violation of the fifth amendment the distinction between testimonial versus other selfincriminating evidence is a matter of continuing debate 12before a strong version of the exclusionary rule was addressed and adopted by the federal courts it had already been adopted by at least one state court namely the iowa supreme court as that court would later describe“ the genesis of iowa’s exclusionary rule was a civil case reifsnyder v lee 44 iowa 101 1876 the first application of the exclusionary rule in a criminal context occurred in the height case decided in 1902 height involved a physical exam of the defendant against his will 117 iowa at 652 91 n w at 935 this court held that the examination of the defendant violated the due process clause of the iowa constitution as well as article 1 section 8’s prohibition of unreasonable searches 13”in 1914 the u s supreme court announced a strong version of the exclusionary rule in the case of weeks v united states under the fourth amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures 14 this decision however created the rule only on the federal level the  weeks rule which made an exception for cases at the state level was adopted by numerous states at a time during prohibition in adopting the rule actions by states often reflected attitudes towards prohibition which was enacted by adoption of the eighteenth amendment and was enforced through the volstead act concerns about privacy violations also extended to other instances where criminal sanctions were permitted for victimless crime such as illegal gambling or narcotics violations 15in 1920 the u s supreme court adopted the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine in the case of silverthorne lumber co v united states 16 the court stated that allowing evidence gathered as an indirect result of an unconstitutional search and seizure reduces the fourth amendment to a form of words wolf v colorado 338 u s 25 1949 ruled that states were not required to adopt the exclusionary rule despite the ruling some states adopted the exclusionary rule in 1955 the supreme court of california ruled in people v cahan 17 that the exclusionary rule applied for cases in the state of california by 1960 22 states had adopted the rule without substantial qualifications california delaware florida idaho illinois indiana kentucky mississippi missouri montana north carolina oklahoma oregon rhode island tennessee washington texas west virginia wisconsin wyoming michigan also had an exclusionary rule but with limitations for some narcotics and firearms evidence in alabama maryland and south dakota the exclusionary rule applied in some situations 15it was not until mapp v ohio 18 in 1961 that the exclusionary rule was also held to be binding on the states through the fourteenth amendment which guarantees due process up until mapp the exclusionary rule had been rejected by most states 19in 2016 utah v strieff dealt with the exclusionary rule and outstanding warrants and was viewed to be generally favorable towards police 20 21limitations of the rule  editthe exclusionary rule does not apply in a civil case in a grand jury proceeding or in a parole revocation hearing even in a criminal case the exclusionary rule does not simply bar the introduction of all evidence obtained in violation of the fourth fifth or sixth amendment in hudson v michigan 22 justice scalia wrote for the u s supreme court“ suppression of evidence however has always been our last resort not our first impulse the exclusionary rule generates substantial social costs united states v leon 468 u s 897 907 1984 which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large we have therefore been cautious against expanding it colorado v connelly 479 u s 157 166 1986 and have repeatedly emphasized that the rules costly toll upon truthseeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging its application pennsylvania bd of probation and parole v scott 524 u s 357 364–365 1998 citation omitted we have rejected indiscriminate application of the rule leon supra at 908 and have held it to be applicable only where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served united states v calandra 414 u s 338 348 1974 – that is where its deterrence benefits outweigh its substantial social costs scott supra at 363 quoting leon supra at 907 whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case is an issue separate from the question whether the fourth amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct ”limitations on the exclusionary rule have included the following evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendant by a private person is admissible the exclusionary rule is designed to protect privacy rights with the fourth amendment applying specifically to government officials 23evidence can only be suppressed if the illegal search violated the persons own the person making the court motion constitutional rights the exclusionary rule does not apply to privacy rights of a third party 24 however there is a narrow exception to this standing requirement the jus tertii standing exception 25the defendant cannot take advantage of the situation police breaching rules to turn the case to his advantage in face of other evidence against himself this falls under the exigent circumstances exception 26the silver platter doctrine which was ruled unconstitutional in the case of elkins v united states in 1960 state officials that obtained evidence illegally were allowed to turn over evidence to federal officials and have that evidence be admitted into trial 27nix v williams held that if the evidence obtained in the unlawful search would almost definitely have been found eventually even without said search  inevitable discovery  the evidence may be brought forth in court if police officers acting in good faith  bona fides rely upon a defective search warrant then the evidence acquired may still be used under the goodfaith exception the exclusionary rule is not applicable to nonu s nationals residing outside of u s borders in united states v alvarezmachain 28 the u s supreme court decided that property owned by aliens in a foreign country is admissible in court certain persons in the u s receive limited protections such as prisoners probationers parolees and persons crossing u s borders corporations by virtue of being also have limited rights under the fourth amendment see corporate personhood  in the case of florida v jimeno it was found that the evidence found to convict jimeno although at first was not admissible later was found to in fact be admissible since it passed the test of reasonable standards the defendant consented to a search of his car and when the officer searched a package and found drugs it was not said to be in violation because a reasonable person would expect illegal narcotics to be kept in a package or container 29parallel construction  editthe special operations division of the u s drug enforcement administration advises dea agents to follow a process of parallel construction when launching criminal investigations of americans based on sod tips that may be based on warrantless surveillance 30criticism and defense  editthe exclusionary rule as it has developed in the united states has been long criticized judge benjamin cardozo chief judge of the new york court of appeals between 1927 and 1932 stated that under the rule the criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered the judge noted that many states had rejected the rule but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states 31 32 33 34in the 1970s dallin h oaks 35 malcolm wilkey 36 and others called for the exclusionary rule to be replaced with a comprehensive judicial remedy against all illegal arrests and searches and seizures eg tort remedy by the 1980s the exclusionary rule remained controversial and was strongly opposed by president ronald reagan but some opponents began seeking to have the rule modified rather than abolished altogether the case illinois v gates before the supreme court brought the exclusionary rule for reconsideration the supreme court also considered allowing exceptions for errors made by police in good faith 37 the reagan administration also asked congress to ease the rule 38 it has been proposed that the exclusionary rule be replaced with restitution to victims of police misconduct 39a major criticism of the fourth amendment exclusionary rule is that it allegedly defies the original intent of the constitution yale law professor akhil amar for example has argued that nothing in the text history or structure of the fourth amendment supports the rule 40 critics like amar oaks and wilkey point to the fact that the text of the fourth amendment does not indicate that illegally seized evidence must be excluded some legal historians argue that the constitutions framers intended only that victims of unreasonable searches or seizures could file civil lawsuits in 2009 roger roots presented evidence that the idea of exclusion can be found in the earliest set of law books published in american history 41 in 2014 roots elaborated that certain eighteenthcentury british law books and pamphlets which discuss the exclusion of illegally seized evidence circulated widely in the american colonies and were owned by numerous prominent framingera lawyers and statesmen 42 also in 2014 professor richard re proposed that the due process clause provides an ample basis for the exclusionary rule 1see also  editbunning v cross an australian case for which the ruling may be formulated as an exclusionary rule
