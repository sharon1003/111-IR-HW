major differences between the us and uk legal systems april 07 2014 by piyali syam attorneys probably already know legal systems in both the u k and the u s share the same historical common law roots and are for that reason quite similar the purpose of this post though is to highlight a few of the key divergences in order to give attorneys a sense of how the u s and u k legal systems differ a note on states much like the main subdivisions of the u k ie england wales scotland and northern ireland the states of the u s have their own laws court systems and bar associations in the u s federal law and court decisions generally take precedence over these state laws and decisions powers not granted to the federal government are instead specifically reserved to the states in the u s constitution if you are a working professional looking to expand your legal education learn more about wash ulaws online master of legal studies degree court systems court systems in both countries are quite similar minor criminal offenses and small civil disputes are handled by special magistrate courts tasked with resolving such disputes in the u s these are cases for state courts almost exclusively more serious crimes and civil cases in both countries are then subject to a threecourt hierarchy in the u s at the federal level criminal cases and civil cases are not heard by separate courts at the state level however many states do have separate court systems for these two types of cases cases begin in lower courts crown court in the u k district court in the u s then move on to courts of appeals and are finally resolved in a single supreme court if necessary it is important to note that the u s does not have a “tribunal system” as the u k does for certain disputes there are however niche courts for certain types of cases eg bankruptcy court is a separate type of federal court in the u s parties may also agree to submit to binding arbitration or mediation as a means of alternative dispute resolution in certain cases this often provides a less costly more streamlined and less adversarial way to conclude conflicts sources of legal authority much like courts in the u k courts in the u s rely mainly on past judicial opinions as authoritative precedent when resolving litigation in the u s these are often referred to as “opinions” or simply “cases” while the phrase “law report” has become somewhat archaic as readers will also likely know for legislation the u s has two centralized federal bodies the house of representatives and the senate together known as the congress which are similar to the houses of parliament each of the 50 states in the u s is afforded two senators while representatives are allocated proportionally based on each state’s population in order to become a law in the u s a bill under discussion must be approved by a majority of both congressional bodies and then signed into law by the president if the president refuses to sign the bill into law his or her veto can be overridden by a twothirds majority vote in congress roles of lawyers aside from differences in nomenclature the roles of lawyers in both countries are quite similar the terms “barrister” and “solicitor” are not commonly used in the u s and litigators and nonlitigators are not separately licensed instead once an attorney is admitted to the bar in a particular state he or she may generally practice any kind of law for the sake of clarity courtgoing barristers are known as “litigators” in the u s and solicitors are called “corporate” or “transactional” attorneys or are referred to in accordance with their area of specialization eg a health care attorney a real estate attorney a family law practitioner etc legal education unlike in the u k there is not a requirement to pursue further courses and apprenticeships beyond law school in the u s instead all prospective lawyers take a threeyear course at an accredited law school and receive a juris doctor j d degree upon graduation then students must pass the bar exam in a state of their choosing after licensure they may generally practice law in any field of their choosing as you can see the systems are more alike than they are different hopefully this post can serve as a basic guide so that attorneys can get a sense of how the two systems compare if you are interested in learning more about u s law and how it differs from other countries’ legal systems consider an ll m in u s law what is the difference between common law and civil law major differences between the brazilian and u s legal systems major differences between the japanese and u s legal systems take the next step advance your career with an online law degree from washington university school of law learn more about the mls  learn more about the ll m  learn more about the dual ll m
