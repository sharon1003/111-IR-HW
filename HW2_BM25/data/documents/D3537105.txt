number of text messages being sent falls for the first time ever as more people turn to whatsapp and i message number of texts sent in the uk has fallen for the first time in two decades im apps like whatsapp are more appealing to younger users predictions say text messaging will decrease further in the uk in 2014cheapness of smartphones means more people might have to convert by luke garratt and sean poulter for the daily mail published 0452 edt 13 january 2014  updated 1122 edt 14 january 201426view comments2as smartphones become cheaper and more available instant messaging is on the rise while the number of texts sent falls dramatically omg the text message is on its way out a little over 20 years after it arrived to revolutionise how the world communicates new and cheaper ‘instant message’ alternatives available from smartphones connected to the web such as snapchat and whats app are taking over the first text was sent on december 3 1992 when british engineer neil papworth 22 used his computer to send the message ‘merry christmas’ to a mobile phone the number of texts sent in britain peaked at 397billion in 2011 having sparked the new language of text speak from omg oh my god to lol laugh out loud and xoxo meaning hugs and kisses however this year the number is predicted to fall to 21billion less than half the 50billion ‘instant messages’ that will be sent the pattern is being repeated around the world where the number of texts sent last year is thought to have fallen by seven billion to 145billion the beauty of the instant message is that it can be sent cheaply through a smartphone app over the internet rather than as a phone message via the mobile network which can cost 15p a time users so far mainly teenagers can also communicate with several people simultaneously and punctuate their messages with brightly coloured icons snapchat which is estimated to be used by up to half of all schoolchildren allows users to send images videos or text – known as snaps – that disappear from the recipient’s phone after a maximum of ten seconds related articlesprevious 1 next customers out of pocket as phone recycling firm cash4phones are we losing the war on spam complaints about nuisance share this article but the app has sparked concern over its use by teenagers for sending explicit pictures of themselves a practice known as sexting the figures highlighting the rise of the instant message are included in a study by accountants deloitte a spokesman said ‘we have reached a tipping point but the usage of mobile phones to send messages is stronger than ever this year trillions of instant messages will be sent in place of a text message’according to the telecom prediction survey the number of texts sent last year fell 7bn to 145bn while the number of instant messages sent through apps rose to 160bn head of telecoms research at deloitte paul lee said while text messaging has been growing in volume since it started it has to come to an end of its heyday2the number of sms messages sent is predicted to make a steady decline while the number of instant messages sent is set to increase dramatically factors are thought to be both financial and generationalthere has been a moderate decline in text volumes for a couple of years and whats driving it is growth in alternative services like whatsapp snapchat and mobile email this means that there have been declining revenues from text recently with more people being inclined to take out mobile broadband packages companies losing revenue from falling sms use will be able to make it up in an increase of broadband packages and were predicting that mobile broadband revenue will overtake text revenue for the first time experts say the reason for this is costs texts cost 10p to send with a bit less to deliver and im apps like whatsapp are free for the time being lee said quite a few im services have no profit  many are in a startup phase right now whatsapp has 400 million users a month and charges 60p a year to use it i message is free with an i phone snapchat is accumulating users rather than charging them whereas text messaging costs money some of the companies charge for things like emoticons and games theyre diversifying significantly but theyre still looking at ways to generate revenue sms still makes up around 98 per cent of revenue for mobile phone companies because everybody still uses it across the world i think itll continue to exist because for now its the common denominator in all mobile phones lee said unless something else comes up that takes over as the common denominator then its safe if you want to get a message to someone you have to use sms the report predicts that in 2014 the number of texts sent will fall even further to only 140bn while the number of instant messages will increase dramatically to around 300bn whatsapp left which was released in 2009 has since overtaken sms as the predominant form of messaging in the uk and i message right which was released on the apple i phone in 2007 was one of the first most readily available im services following on from blackberrys bbmit is thought that younger users are turning away from traditional texting in favour of instant messaging services that offer lower prices and more customisation in addition the cheapness and availability of smartphone technology is contributing towards the rise of im with cheaper handsets meaning more people who wouldnt usually buy smartphones like senior citizens are becoming regular users the price of the technology also means that soon mobile phone companies will stop making traditional handsets and people will have no choice but to convert to smartphones in the uk the percentage of people over 55 with a smartphone was 29 per cent in 2012 and is set to rise to around 47 per cent in 2014 however only 13 per cent of older smartphone owners used im preferring to use their smartphones to make calls and send texts suggestions show that it could be a generation gap that makes the difference paul lee said im is a tremendous utility for delivering messages for nothing for young people its phenomenal because its free and they have devices to utilise this for older its irrelevant sms is still worth around £60bn because of its functionality texts still work in any country on any network on any handset traditional sms still stands to make more money in 2014 than im and the report predicts that this trend will continue until 2018 black berry can claim to have started the im trend when its bbm service started in 2006 but the im trend took off when the i phone was released in 2007 this release brought with it services like i message facebook messenger and whatsapp released in 2009 with these services overtaking traditional texts in the uk last year a carphone warehouse spokesperson said with the massive increase in popularity of instant messaging apps it’s not surprising that the number of texts sent has fallen so dramatically consumers are no longer tied to text messages or phone calls as a means of communication and are using free messaging services like whatsapp i message facebook and skype instead we’ve seen significant change across our stores as customers are more interested in enquiring about a tariff’s data limits  and whether a phone comes with a free messaging app or function preinstalled  as opposed to the number of text messages and minutes available the networks are also clearly responding to this shift as the number of unlimited data plans available has increased considerably in recent months advertisement share or comment on this article most watched news videos embed this manchester teacher accused of sex with schoolboy leaves court new zealand pm
