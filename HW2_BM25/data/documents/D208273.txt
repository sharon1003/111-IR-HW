i have a friend who recently nearly lost all of his photos of his daughter he had his i phone for just about two years he took tons of pictures of her she wasn’t even two years old yet so basically her whole life was on his i phone one day his phone crashed and he couldn’t figure out what happened to it his pictures were lost he was eventually able to recover his photos but not without hours of work and days of anxiety when i asked him why he didn’t just back his photos up he had no good response always back up your photos seriously always back up your photos we’ve got a tutorial on a few different ways you can back up your photos so you’ll never have to face the dreaded lost memories again…apple stores your photos in i cloud this makes it possible for you to save a lot of photos but you should find another way to back them up or you will lose the ones that don’t fit into the 5gb of free i cloud storage that you get how to back up your photos to your desktop if you use a mac my best suggestion is to use the free photos app that come with os x for your desktop or laptop photos is a replacement to i photo which is not supported by apple anymore if you consider yourself a pretty good amateur photographer you will find lightroom to be a wellrounded featureheavy photo application for your mac however if you just like snapping pics at the beach photos is simple and effective for storing images plus all of the my photo stream pictures that you take on your i phone will automatically go directly into photos so you don’t have to upload them to anything that doesn’t mean you don’t have to back your photos up though when you connect your i phone to a computer running photos or lightroom go to the import tab to automatically upload your pictures into one of the programs not in my photo stream but in the application itself now your images are officially saved to your computer and you can delete them tip click the button that reads “delete items” in photos to delete photos from your i phone after importing them if you want to make room on your i phone for more photos learn more about this method how to transfer photos from i phone or i pad to mac how to backup your photos to i cloud photo library apple offers a paid service that lets you automatically backup your photos from your i phone i pad i pod touch and mac to i cloud this is probably the best option to back up your photos without any user interaction but of course it is not free plans start at 099month for 50gb of storage and go up to 1999month for 2tb of storage before activating i cloud photo library it would be wise to upgrade your i cloud storage by going to settings  i cloud  storage  buy more storage start with the 50gb plan and see if you need more most people should be fine with this 099month plan once this is done go to settings  i cloud  photos turn on i cloud photo library then select the optimize i phone storage option to make more room on your i phone repeat the process on all your i os devices such as your i pad and i pod touch from now any photo or video you take from any i os device on which you activated i cloud photo library will be automatically uploaded to i cloud without having you to do anything this is a great way to backup your photos without having to think about it how to back up your photos in the cloud automatically back up your photos to dropbox from your desktop if you own a dropbox account you can also automatically store your photos in their cloud if you connect your i phone to a computer with dropbox installed you can turn on camera upload and photos and videos will automatically download to dropbox to do so go to dropbox  settings  preferences  import and check the “enable camera uploads” you can then choose to import both photos and videos or photos only doing so will automatically import your photos to dropbox when your i phone is connected however keep in mind that dropbox has a limited amount of free storage available when you run out you have to pay for an upgrade you get 2 gb of storage with a free account if you don’t have an account yet click this link to create one you’ll get a free additional 500mb of storage space automatically back up your photos to dropbox from your i phone dropbox can also automatically upload images that you take with your i phone you’ll of course need to download the dropbox app first and create an account if you don’t already have one when you first launch the dropbox app it will offer to save your photos to dropbox as seen on the screenshot below if you didn’t enable this feature at launch but want to do it now follow the following steps step 1 in the dropbox app go to settings  camera upload  on step 2 select whether you want dropbox to only

another cloud storage service that lets you upload images right from your i phone is flickr flickr offers 1tb of free space so it is the best cloud storage service for the price around uploading photos from your i phone to flickr is pretty easy you’ll need to download the flickr app then launch the app which should ask you if you want to activate the autouploadr turn it on if you want flickr

autouploadr if you want to manually choose what photos and videos are backed up to flickr tap the camera icon at the bottom center of the screen then select the images you want to upload you can select multiple photos for simultaneous uploading it can take a while so you should do this often if flickr is going to be your method of backing up you can add filters right in the app before you send them to flickr after you’ve added a group name description and location then tap the upload button and they will be added to your flickr photo stream note all photos uploaded to flickr are
