from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search nearby anthropogenic sources such as coal burning and mining of iron can contaminate water sources with methylmercury which is efficiently absorbed in the bodies of fish through the process of biomagnification mercury levels in each successive predatory stage increase fish and shellfish concentrate mercury in their bodies often in the form of methylmercury a highly toxic organic compound of mercury fish products have been shown to contain varying amounts of heavy metals particularly mercury and fatsoluble pollutants from water pollution species of fish that are longlived and high on the food chain such as marlin tuna shark swordfish king mackerel and tilefish gulf of mexico contain higher concentrations of mercury than others 1mercury is known to bioaccumulate in humans so bioaccumulation in seafood carries over into human populations where it can result in mercury poisoning mercury is dangerous to both natural ecosystems and humans because it is a metal known to be highly toxic especially due to its ability to damage the central nervous system 2 in humancontrolled ecosystems of fish usually done for market production of wanted seafood species mercury clearly rises through the food chain via fish consuming small plankton as well as through nonfood sources such as underwater sediment 3the presence of

animals 4 mercury and methyl mercury are present in only very small concentrations in seawater however they are absorbed usually as methyl mercury by algae at the start of the food chain this algae is then eaten by fish and other organisms higher in the food chain fish efficiently absorb methyl mercury but excrete it very slowly 5 methyl mercury is not soluble and therefore not excreted instead it accumulates primarily in the viscera although also in the muscle tissue 6 this results in the bioaccumulation of mercury in a buildup in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels zooplankton small nekton larger fish and so on the older that such fish become the more mercury they may have absorbed anything that eats these fish within the food chain also consumes the higher level of mercury that the fish have accumulated this process explains why predatory fish such as swordfish and sharks or birds like osprey and eagles have higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone species on the food chain can amass body concentrations of mercury up to ten times higher than the species they consume this process is called biomagnification for example herring contains mercury levels at about 01 parts per million while shark contains mercury levels greater than 1 part per million 7legislation  editjapan  editsince the minamata disaster japan has improved on its mercury regulation during the 1970s japan made strides to reduce mercury demand and production chief among these efforts was the reduction of inorganic mercury produced by mines it was halted by 1974 and demand fell from 2500 tons per year in 1964 its peak to 10 tons per year in recent years 8 since these initial strides japan has introduced a list of regulations

enacting legislation controlling the mercury levels in potential pollutants japan has directly influenced the environment by issuing regulations setting acceptable levels of environmental mercury pollution it is japans goal to promote international mercury legislation in hopes of preventing any country from experiencing what it did 8 despite japans extensive regulation and experience with mercurybased disasters there is still little information provided to the public the japanese federal fish advisorys recommendations are less strict than those in america 9united states of america  editmain article mercury regulation in the united states the united states is a leader in mercury regulation a key piece of mercury legislation in the united states is the mercury and air toxics standards mats 10 this policy was finalized by the environmental protection agency epa on december 16 2011 this is a federal policy which directly influences mercury in fish and is the first of its kind in the united states the facilities targeted by this new policy are the chief sources of mercury in the air the airborne mercury is dissolved in the oceans where microorganisms convert waterborne mercury into methyl mercury mercury thus finds its way into the food chain and into fish mats is legislated towards the aim of preventing about 90 of the emissions from power plants from reaching the air in total the expected health benefits are estimated at 37 billion–90 billion by 2016  citation needed in comparison the expected economic cost is 96 billion annually  citation needed another integral piece of legislation controlling the emission of mercury to the air is the clean air act under this act mercury is classified as a hazardous air pollutant allowing the epa to regulate emissions by establishing performance standards 11international  editlegislation on a global scale is believed by some to be needed for this issue because mercury pollution is estimated to be so farreaching pollution from one country does not stay localized to that country despite the need by some international regulation has been slow to take off the first forms of international legislation appeared in the 1970s beginning as agreements about shared bodies of water 12 the next step was the stockholm declaration which urged countries to avoid polluting the oceans by dumping 13 the 1972 oslo convention and the 1974 paris convention were adopted by parts of europe both lessened polluting the ocean with mercury the former by banning the dumping of ships and aircraft into the ocean and the latter by obligating participants to reduce landbased pollution on coastlines 14 15 the first real global legislation regarding mercury pollution was the basel convention of 1989 this convention attempts to reduce the movement of mercury across borders and primarily regulates the import and export of toxic chemicals including mercury 12 in 1998 the convention on longrange transboundary air pollution was adopted by most of the european union the united states and canada its primary objective is to cut emissions of heavy metals the convention is the largest international agreement on mercury established to date 12 in the early 21st century the focus of mercury regulation has been on voluntary programs 12 the next phase in legislation is a global effort and this appears to be what the minamata convention hopes to accomplish the minamata convention named after the japanese city that suffered horribly from mercury pollution has taken four years of negotiation but was finally adopted by delegates from over 140 countries the convention will come into power after 50 countries have signed it the minamata convention will require all participants to eliminate where possible the release of mercury from smallscale gold mining it will also require a sharp reduction in emission from coal burning 16levels of contamination  editmostcontaminated fish species  editthe danger level from consuming fish depends on species and size size is the best predictor of increased levels of accumulated mercury sharks such as the mako shark have very high levels of mercury a study on new jersey coastal fish indicated that one third of the sampled fish had levels of mercury above 05 parts per million a level that could pose a human health concern for consumers who regularly eat this fish 17 another study of marketplace fish caught in waters surrounding southern italy showed that undoubtedly greater fish weight leads to additional mercury found in fish body tissues moreover the concentration measured in milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish steadily increases with the size of the fish anglerfish off the coast of italy were found with concentrations as high as 22 milligrams of mercury per kilogram higher than the recommended limit of 1 milligram of mercury per kilogram annually italy catches approximately a third of its fish from the adriatic sea where these anglerfish were found 18fish that consume their prey in a certain manner may contain much higher concentrations of mercury than other species grass carp off the coast of china hold far less internal mercury than do bighead carp the reason for this is that bighead carp are filter feeders while grass carp are not thus bighead carp gather more mercury by eating large amounts of small plankton as well as sucking up sediments that collect a sizable amount of methyl mercury 3  hide mercury levels in commercial fish and shellfishspecies mean ppm 1std dev ppm 1median ppm 1comment trophic level

found mercury in every fish tested according to the study by the u s department of the interior they found mercury even in fish of isolated rural waterways twentyfive percent of the fish tested had mercury levels above the safety levels determined by the u s environmental protection agency for people who eat the fish regularly 23origins of mercury pollution  editsee also mercury cycle and mercury pollution in the ocean there are three types of mercury emission anthropogenic reemission and natural including volcanoes and geothermal vents anthropogenic sources are responsible for 30 of all emissions while natural sources are responsible for 10 and reemission accounts for the other 60 while reemission accounts for the largest proportion of emissions it is likely that the mercury emitted from these sources originally came from anthropogenic sources 24anthropogenic sources include coal burning cement production oil refining artisan and smallscale gold mining wastes from consumer products dental amalgam the chloralkali industry production of vinyl chloride and the mining smelting and production of iron and other metals 24 the total amount of mercury released by mankind in 2010 was estimated to be 1960 metric tons the majority of this comes from coal burning and gold mining accounting for 24 and 37 of total anthropogenic output respectively 24reemission the largest emitter occurs in a variety of ways it is possible for mercury that has been deposited in soil to be reemitted into the mercury cycle via floods a second example of reemission is a forest fire mercury that has been absorbed into plant life is rereleased into the atmosphere while it is difficult to estimate the exact extent of mercury reemission it is an important field of study knowing how easily and how often previously emitted mercury can be released helps us learn how long it will take for a reduction in anthropogenic sources to be reflected in the environment mercury that has been released can find its way into the oceans a 2008 model estimated the total amount of deposition into the oceans that year to be 3700 metric tons it is estimated that rivers carry as much as 2420 metric tons 24 much of the mercury deposited in the oceans is reemitted however as much as 300 metric tons is converted into methyl mercury while only 13 of this finds its way into the food chain that is still 40 metric tons a year 24much an estimated 40 of the mercury that eventually finds its way into fish originates with coalburning power plants and chlorine production plants 25 the largest source of mercury contamination in the united states is coalfueled power plant emissions 23 chlorine chemical plants use mercury to extract chlorine from salt which in many parts of the world is discharged as mercury compounds in waste water though this process has been largely replaced by the more economically viable membrane cell process which does not use mercury coal contains mercury as a natural contaminant when it is fired for electricity generation the mercury is released as smoke into the atmosphere most of this mercury pollution can be eliminated if pollutioncontrol devices are installed 25mercury in the united states frequently comes from power plants which release about 50 of the nations mercury emissions 26 in other countries such as ghana gold mining requires mercury compounds leading to workers receiving significant quantities of mercury while performing their jobs such mercury from gold mines is specifically known to contribute to biomagnification in aquatic food chains 27the farming of aquatic organisms known as aquaculture often involves fish feed that contains mercury a study by jardine has found no reliable connection between mercury in fish food affecting aquaculture organisms or aquatic organisms in the wild 28 even so mercury from other sources may still affect organisms grown through aquaculture in china farmed fish species such as bighead carp mud carp and siniperca chuatsi carried 90 of total mercury content in all of the measured fish in a study by cheng this study also concluded that mercury bioaccumulates through food chains even in controlled aquaculture environments both total mercury and methyl mercury absorption was found to be derived from sediments containing mercury not mainly from fish feed 3the hawaii institute of marine biology has noted that fish feed used in aquaculture often contains heavy metals such as mercury lead and arsenic and has dispatched these concerns to organizations such as the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elemental mercury often comes from coal power plants and oxidized mercury often comes from incinerators oilfired power plants also contribute mercury to the environment 2 the energy industry therefore is a key player in the introduction of mercury into the environment when addressing the issue of reducing seafood mercury bioaccumulation on a global scale it is important to pinpoint major energy producers and consumers whose exchange of energy may be the root of the problem controlling output of mercury pollution sources  edita study that was led by scientists from harvard university and u s geological survey has determined that in the next several decades there will be a 50 percent increase in mercury levels  citation needed the study also shows that the increases are connected through industrial emissions and are not natural as previously thought  citation needed however by decreasing emissions from industrial plants the possibility of decreasing the high level of mercury remains plausible 29 several nations are currently implementing systems that will detect and therefore later be able to control the output of mercury into the atmosphere air pollution control devices apcds have been implemented in south korea as the government is starting to take inventory of mercury sources mercury pollution can also be removed by electrostatic precipitators esps bagbased filters are also used in factories that may contribute mercury to the environment fluegas desulfurization normally used to eliminate sulfur dioxide can also be used in conjunction with apcds to remove additional mercury before exhausts are released into the environment 2 even so countries such as south korea have only begun to use inventories of mercury sources calling into question how fast antimercury measures will be put into factories health effects and outcomes  editdisparate impacts  editmercury content in fish does not affect all populations equally certain ethnic groups as well as young children are more likely to suffer the effects of methyl mercury poisoning in the united states wallace gathered data that indicated 169 of women who selfidentify as native american asian pacific islander or multiracial exceed the recommended reference dose of mercury 30 a study done on children of the faroe islands near great britain showed neurological problems stemming from mothers consuming pilot whale meat during pregnancy 31regulation and health  editwhile various studies have shown high concentrations of mercury accumulated in fish medical cases often go unreported and pose a difficulty in correlating mercury in fish with human poisoning environmental issues cover a broad range of areas but medical cases that are associated with pollutants released into the environment by factories or construction areas cause public health issues that affect not only the environment but also human wellbeing substances poisonous to the human body in a particular amount or dose may not cause any symptoms over time while there are limits to how much of anything the body can have mercury is a particular poison that produces immediate physical symptoms when the body has been accumulating it over a period of time  clarification neededin the united states the environmental protection agency measures the amount of mercury concentrated in human blood that does not pose fatal health outcomes the agency is in charge of enforcing regulations and policies that cover a range of environmental topics 32 analysis of blood mercury concentrations in childbearing women has proved that exposure to methyl mercury me hg occurs primarily through the consumption of fish 33 the u s fda highly recommends against pregnant woman and young children consuming raw fish pregnant women and young children often lack strong immune systems and are more at risk for foodborne illnesses 34medical cases and exposure to mercury  editin the united states the epa serves as an advisory organ to set the levels of mercury that are nonfatal in humans symptoms of exposure to high levels of methyl mercury include disturbed vision hearing and speech lack of coordination and muscle weakness medical studies have examined the correlation of fish consumption and health issues american studies have presented evidence of fish consumption and its effects on child development longitudinal studies agree that human activities are what release and accumulate mercury in marine life 35 addressing the issues of fish consumption forces health officials to recognize the sources of mercury in the human body specific native american tribes are vulnerable to a high exposure of mercury studies have determined that these native peoples in the united states suffer more from mercury poisoning and illness than any other cohort group in the country this is due to the fact that fish is a main source of protein exposure risk was assessed through a medical study thus raising judicial issues of whether the public health of these groups is a priority in the united states 36work and exposure  editmost cases that arise are due to work exposure or medicinal poisoning environmental justice advocates can relate these mercury cases to the unregulated amount of mercury that enters the environment workers can be exposed to mercury through the manufacture of fluorescent tubes chloralkali or acetaldehyde among other products anthropogenic sources and places where mercury is released or used as a solid or vapor puts these has caused fatigue dizziness hyperhidrosis chest congestion and loss of motor skills when taken to the hospital the neurotoxicity levels had already exceeded the maximum amounts 37 overthecounter medicines have been shown to have traces of mercurous choloride medical research reported that the children who received doses of these medicines experienced physical symptoms such as  drooling irregular arm movements and impaired gait 38 exposures to this result in severe physical impairments unregulated chemicals that are put in products the intake of laxatives that contained about 120 mg of mercurous chloride has also been cases of mercurys toxicity 39even in countries such as sweden that have phased out mercury in the dental industry and manufacturing lingering quantities of mercury still exist in lakes and coastal areas moreover global contributions of mercury to the environment also affect that country a study in sweden selected 127 women who had a high level of fish consumption around 20 of the women selected after hair and blood samples were found to have exceeded the epa s recommended reference dose of 01 micrograms of methyl mercury per kilogram of body weight additionally the study concluded that there was no margin of safety for neuraldevelopmental effects in fetus es 40 without removing the offending species of fish from the diets of the women this indicates that families intending to raise children should be especially careful about exposing their unborn babies to toxic mercury via fish children exposed to mercury are particularly susceptible to poisoning since the ratio of food water and air intake versus individual body weight is much higher than that of adults 41 additionally children undergo fast growth which causes them to be more susceptible to damaging exposure to methylmercury as well as the long term consequences of such exposure during childhood development 41 young age plays an important role in terms of damage caused by mercury and much literature on mercury focuses on pregnant women and specific precautions designed to prevent youth mercury exposure prenatal methylmercury exposure does cause behavioral problems in infants and worsened cognitive test performance additionally hughner estimates that 250000 women may be exposing their unborn babies to levels of methyl mercury above recommended federal levels 17economically there does not seem to be a difference in mercury exposure based on socioeconomic bracket and the ability to buy fish from the market one study shows no significant differences in mercury levels in tuna bluefish and flounder as a function of type of store or economic neighborhood 42by nation  editcertain countries have cultural differences that lead to more fish consumption and therefore more possible exposure to seafood methylmercury in ghana the local population traditionally consumes large quantities of fish leading to potentially dangerous amounts of mercury in the bloodstream 27 in the amazonian basin during the rainy season herbivorous fish dominate the diet of 722 of the women selected from a particular amazonian village analysis also shows increase of mercury content in the hair of humans who eat fish on a daily basis in the amazon 43the most serious case of mercury poisoning in recent history was in the japanese city of minamata in the 1950s minamata poisoning proves that significant prenatal and postnatal exposure to high levels of methylmercury causes serious neurological problems minamata victims also show higher than normal signs of psychiatric diseases along with those diseases being caused by underlying neurological issues 44a 2014 usgs survey of mercury levels in the united states water system found that methylmercury concentrations in fish were typically highest in wetland areas including the coastal plain streams in the southeast fish methylmercury levels were also high in the western us but only in streams that had been mined for mercury or gold 45seafood consumption benefits  editthe american college of obstetricians and gynecologists note that considering all the dangers and benefits the overall result of eating fish in the united states is likely to improve personal health rather than damage it 31 the college argues that the omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish have a health benefit that outweighs the harm from mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls even so the college also suggests limiting fish consumption for pregnant women a riskbenefit study weighing the risks of mercury consumption against the benefits derived from fish in alaska showed that the benefits outweigh the risks when consuming salmon for both cardiovascular health and infant neurological development and that me hg data for nonoily fish needs to be of high quality before relative risk can be reliably identified 46 the seychelles child development study traced more than seven hundred motherchild pairs for nine years and found no neurological problems in the children resulting from both prenatal and postnatal methylmercury exposure a study done with marketed fish in oman concluded that except in a few rare cases the fish available for consumption had lower levels of mercury than limits defined by various health organizations 47 clearly these studies call into question whether or not normal everyday consumption of fish is dangerous in any way and at very least justify the creation of placebased and culturally relevant consumption advisories 48 they do not take into account cases of severe mercury poisoning such as that found in minamata disease selenium is an element that is known to counteract some of the dangers of ingesting mercury 17 multiple studies have been done such as those in new jersey and sweden that take into account selenium as well as mercury levels fish often do contain selenium in conjunction with bioaccumulated mercury which may offset some of the dangers associated with the mercury ingested current advice  editthe complexities associated with mercury transport and environmental fate are described by usepa in their 1997 mercury study report to congress 49 because methyl mercury and high levels of elemental mercury can be particularly toxic to a fetus or young children organizations such as the u s epa and fda recommend that women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next one or two years as well as young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces 170g one average meal of fish per week 50in the united states the fda has an action level for methylmercury in commercial marine and freshwater fish that is 10 parts per million ppm in canada the limit for the total of mercury content is 05 ppm the got mercury website includes a calculator for determining mercury levels in fish 51species with characteristically low levels of mercury include shrimp tilapia salmon pollock and catfish fda march 2004 the fda characterizes shrimp catfish pollock salmon sardines and canned light tuna as lowmercury seafood although recent tests have indicated that up to 6 percent of canned light tuna may contain high levels 52 a study published in 2008 found that mercury distribution in tuna meat is inversely related to the lipid content suggesting that the lipid concentration within edible tuna tissues has a diluting effect on mercury content 53 these findings suggest that choosing to consume a type of tuna that has a higher natural fat content may help reduce the amount of mercury intake compared to consuming tuna with a low fat content also many of the fish chosen for sushi contain high levels of mercury 54according to the us food and drug administration fda the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern for most people 55 however certain seafood might contain levels of mercury that may cause harm to an unborn baby and especially its brain development and nervous system in a young child high levels of mercury can interfere with the development of the nervous system the fda provides three recommendations for young children pregnant women and women of childbearing age do not eat shark swordfish king mackerel or tilefish gulf of mexico because they might contain high levels of mercury eat up to 12 ounces 2 average meals a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury five of the most commonly eaten fish and shellfish that are low in mercury are shrimp canned light tuna salmon pollock and catfish another commonly eaten fish albacore or white tuna depending on its origin might have more mercury than canned light tuna so when choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish it is recommended that you should not eat more than up to 6 ounces one average meal of albacore tuna per week check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes rivers and coastal areas if no advice is available eat up to 6 ounces one average meal per week of fish you catch from local waters but consume no other fish during that week research suggests that selenium content in fish is protective against the toxic effects of methylmercury content 56 fish with higher ratios of selenium to methylmercury se hg are better to eat since the selenium binds to the methylmercury allowing it to pass through the body unabsorbed in 2012 the european food safety authority efsa reported on chemical contaminants they found in the food of over 20 european countries they established that fish meat and fish products were primarily responsible for methylmercury in the diet of all age classes particularly implicated were swordfish tuna cod pike whiting and hake the efsa recommend a tolerable weekly intake for methylmercury of 13 μgkg body weight 57background  editin the 1950s inhabitants of the seaside town of minamata on kyushu island in japan noticed strange behavior in animals cats would exhibit nervous tremors and dance and scream within a few years this was observed in other animals birds would drop out of the sky symptoms were also observed in fish an important component of the diet especially for the poor when human symptoms started to be noticed around 1956 an investigation began fishing was officially banned in 1957 it was found that the chisso corporation a petrochemical company and maker of plastics such as vinyl chloride had been discharging heavy metal waste into the sea for decades they used mercury compounds as catalysts in their syntheses it is believed that about 5000 people were killed and perhaps 50000 have been to some
