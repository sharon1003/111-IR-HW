from the metroid universe that appears in super smash bros brawl her return was announced at e3 2006 alongside with the debut of her unarmored self zero suit samus samus is currently ranked 32nd on the tier list samus possesses a very powerful zoning game due to her potent projectiles and disjointed grab as well as very quick damage rackers in her tilts and screw attack however samuss finishers and projectiles were severely weakened from melee which makes her ko potential very ineffective against other fighters resulting in terrible matchups and tournaments results contents  showattributes samus has a wide array of both projectiles and physical attacks which can be used in promising combinations and zoning samus is heavyweight and ranks in the middle of the speedclass however she is tall which makes her easier to hit a common problem amongst most of the games heavyweights she has very low kill power and high floatiness for her weight class samus can be awkward to fight effectively with against the games faster more graceful characters but with a good combination of long and shortrange attacks she can be deadly samus has the third slowest falling speed in the game behind peach and jigglypuff this is both advantageous and disadvantageous on the upside her floatiness can be used to bolster her air game staying in the air longer allows samus to followup with other aerials given that many of her moves have low knockback she can create all sorts of continuous strings of lowtomid percent attacks and it makes her edgeguarding game easier and safer more importantly her floatiness allows her to have an aboveaverage recovery game on the downside her slow fall speed also makes her recovery predictable and fairly easily edgeguarded samus can also be easily juggled because her fastfall is still very slow and as a result of this her momentum canceling is poor and only makes her live slightly above average vertically despite being the seventh heaviest in terms of weight despite her ground moves being weak in terms of knockback they deal decent damage samus has much time to dodge attacks while throwing foes off with things like bombs and bomb jumping or she can speed things up by using her surprisingly long grapple beam to zip to the safety of the edge one of the most valuable uses of her slow falling speed is successfully spiking an opponent who has no ground on which to land and still being able to recover easily she also has the largest ledge sweetspot her neutral special charge shot does great knockback at higher percentages and is a deadly projectile for edgeguarding when fully charged thanks to its very large hitting area samus has two kinds of missiles the homing missile homes on opponents and deals 5 of damage but little knockback the super missile moves in a fast straight line and deals 10 of damage and noticeable knockback her up special screw attack gives her decent vertical height and can trap opponents for damage racking her down special bomb makes samus morph into ball mode and lay a bomb which will explode after a set time period her grab has great range but it is laggy if she fails to grab an opponent although performing a dash grab can remedy this in the air her grapple beam can damage opponents and can be used as a tether recovery  samus works best when transitioning well from the air to the ground all of her aerials have no landing lag with fair and uair having no knockback except at the final hit samus can capitalize on this by canceling into more powerful moves like forward smash and down tilt or by using a fully charged charge shot in the event the opponent is a bit too far away missiles also factor into the air to ground transition landing immediately after the missile has been fired negates the significant firing lag so one can immediately follow up with another missile of either kind this lag negation allows for a double missile effect where samus can fire one missile land and almost immediately fire another these missiles can also stop opponents recovery such as pikachu s skull bash luigi s green missile jigglypuff s rollout ike s quick draw wolf s wolf flash fox s fox illusion and falco s falco phantasm setting them up for an immediate meteor smash a missilecharge shot combination is an excellent combo but can sometimes be predictable so samus players must learn to launch them unexpectedly her aerial grapple beam zair actually acts as a move to complement this strategy stunning opponents from far away with high speed and also cancels immediately upon landing which can combo into a killing down tilt or smash coupled with the charge shots potency samus has no problem frustrating opponents from a safe distance chipping away at her opponents approach to best suit her although samus has three different projectiles she still lacks a reliable way to deal with opponents projectiles especially since her shield roll is the slowest in the game samus major problem lies in her extreme lack of finishing abilities her quickest kill move is her down tilt but with vertical knockback and a small hitbox has trouble koing opponents before around 130 and is recommended to not be used until the right time as to not devalue it with stalemove negation also her forward smash is quick but deals fairly low damage and doesnt ko properly before around 130 her down smash has rather low knockback and doesnt ko reliably before 150 her only way to ko at earlier percents is using either the dair for spikes or the bair unfortunately the bair telegraphs itself has a tiny sweetspot and requires good setup while the dair is rather slow and has a sweeping hitbox that also needs good placement despite its fairly large hitbox even a fullycharged charge shot doesnt tend to kill until at least over 100 making it one of the least kocapable charged specials in the game however it is still a good move for edgeguarding all in all samus can be a character of good and bad situations with her wide array of projectiles and a fairly powerful spike a huge problem in competitive play is that samus is easily chain grabbed due to her heavy weight and large size with the exception of chain grabs that are ineffective on very floaty characters and can be infinitely chaingrabbed by king dedede her slow falling speed being floaty can help protect her from some consecutive chain grabs though this should not be relied on changes from melee as mentioned before samuss killing power and projectile game have been severely nerfed her neutral aerial her charge shot and her forward smash all deal less knockback and super missiles can no longer ko however her down tilt is more powerful making it one of her very few kill moves her grapple beam extends very far and straight forward unlike melee throwing off opponents combos and canceling quickly upon landing her bomb jump technique is less effective in recovery and she can no longer attack out of morph ball form while she is overall slightly slower her aerials have absolutely no landing lag making her damageracking and setup abilities slightly better her homing missiles are now much better at homing in and her screw attack now traps opponents for damage racking the last real change to her playstyle is that her bombs no longer explode upon enemy contact but instead have a set time in terms of cosmetics samus was updated to resemble her appearance from zero mission and incorporates more detail such as circuitry bomb was updated to reflect samuss new design and super missile was updated to differentiate it from homing missile many of her moves also incorporate new sound effects and sounds moveset ground attacks normal dash attack  shoulder tackles 10 damage decent dash attack with decent knockback but rarely defeat before extremely high percents and is better for setting up a bair or other air games neutral attack  punches and attacks with arm cannon in an arc 3 then 7 with a total of 10 good on shorthopping opponents closeup otherwise the second hit can be easily shielded forward tilt  spin kicks forward 8 close range 7 far range 10 if angled up or down samuss best midrange defensespacing move angling this one makes a much bigger difference than with most tilts up tilt  axe kicks down similar to captain falcons uptilt though no disjoint a little weaker and doesnt move her forward 13 damage good knockback long duration good for use beneath platforms spiking opponents against the ground into the air otherwise useful as a kind of antiair move down tilt  creates a fire burst on the ground with arm cannon this is very similar to snake s forward smash 14 damage high knockback for a down tilt samuss quickest kill move but laggy if shielded has a small hitbox and doesnt defend against shorthops well smash forward smash  thrusts arm cannon forward belowaverage koing power for a fsmash having high knockback scaling but very low base knockback it has fast startup which can counterbalance its poor reach and belowaverage knockback surprising opponents up close after a cancelled fair or whenever the opportunity presents itself this attack is not likely to ko before 130 due to its high knockback scaling it is arguably samus most reliable finisher it can also be pointed upwards or downwards by holding the control stick either up or down respectively does 1219 up smash  releases 5 fire bursts in an arc above herself moderately fast startup lag but has punishable ending lag with poor horizontal reach the first four hitboxes have negligible knockback designed to link each hitbox however the up smash is easy to escape out of especially at high percentages one of the least effective smashes in the game this move can occasionally redeem itself by catching larger characters for significant damage it is otherwise very situational does 46 for each hit dealing 2332 if all hits connect down smash  spins around on the ground with her feet sending her victims upward back hit sends foes diagonally in front of samus good for spacing fast startup but the back hit does not happen quickly and the down smash has some ending lag it has fairly low knockback however and will not reliably ko under 150 does 1521 for the frontal hitbox does 1419 for the back hitbox aerial attacks neutral air  sex kick 9 initially 6 if hit afterwards belowaverage knockback samuss large character model makes this neutral longerranged than many of the others in the game but its still a primarily defensive maneuver forward air  creates 5 fire burst in front of her 34 per hit 18 total okay knockback on final hit cancels quickly enough on landing to follow up with a dtilt if someone was caught before the final fire burst great on ledgehops and an overall useful offensive move back air  spins once backward with kick 10 damage with low knockback normally 14 damage with good knockback if hit with the tip of her foot somewhat slow with a tiny sweetspot this kill move is hard to land and requires trickery and good spacing up air  spins in a drill upward 11 damage multiple hitboxes with low knockback makes this move one of samuss setup moves down air  swings arm cannon in an arc underneath herself can meteor smash with average power and has a fairly large hitbox 15 damage a great move to use while floating backwards over runins but has a sweeping hitbox that needs good placement and is fairly slow this is her only way to ko at lower percentages grapple beam  sends grapple forward with long range 4 damage 7 with tip a staple samus move that makes samus one of the best campers in the game combine with homing missilesuper missilecancels and charge shots for a tremendous longrange obstacle course for opponents grabs  throws grab  reaches forward with grapple beam incredibly laggy and dangerous sped up slightly while running pummel  hits with fist 1 she sometimes cannot pummel attack bowser the animation goes normally but theres no damage at all however as long as samus grapples bowser while he is off the edge she can cause damage to him likewise if she grabs bowser while on a fallthrough platform she can cause damage to him then as well the glitch only takes effect on solid platforms back throw  flings backward 8forward throw  flings forward 9up throw  spins above her head and blasts opponent upward gradually deals a total of 9 damage down throw

somersault makes a completely different noise in brawl samus captain falcon and yoshi are the only super smash bros veterans that remain the only character to represent their own series in brawl
