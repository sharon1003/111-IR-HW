shareuntil relatively recently photographers handholding telephoto lenses faced a dilemma as lenses increased in power and weight they became increasingly difficult to hold steady enough to avoid image blur the quandary was solved with the application of some ingenious technology – image stabilization cpn reveals the story of how this ingenious canon technology was developed any photographer who has used a camera fitted with a powerful telephoto lens will understand the term “image shake” the more powerful the lens the more any small vibrations are magnified the excitement at the prospect of filling the frame with distant objects quickly wears off as the frustration of an uncontrollably jumpy subject and the reality of blurred images sets in hands typically shake at between one and five tiny movements per second and the lens in a photographer’s grasp shakes with them this has the effect of moving the subject off the lens’ optical axis resulting in the appearance of a jumpy subject and movement of the subject across the film or image plane during exposure time the magnification of the lens works to exaggerate this effect unless working in very bright conditions most people will find lenses with a focal length of more than 300mm difficult to use successfully without the use of a tripod tripods however can be cumbersome heavy and bulky – hardly an ideal or practical solution in every situation the ef800mm f56l is usm is a prime example of a super telephoto that benefits from is technology it features a four stop image stabilizer capability tilt system iscanon addressed the problem with its image stabilisation technology that was first seen in the ef75300mm f456 is usm zoom lens in 1995 a special corrective lens group was developed to sit behind the objective lens group this is lens group is designed to refract or ‘bend’ light rays when it is moved perpendicular to the optical axis when a lens is moved off its optical axis by vibrations a detection system consisting of two tiny gyros leaps into action highly responsive coils move the is lens group by precisely the right distance in the direction of the vibration because vibration can occur in both horizontal and vertical directions design of the corrective optical system allows movement up and down and left to right hair trigger response all of this starts to happen within approximately 0002 of a second of a vibration being detected this essentially immediate response allows the is system to move the correction lens group with the vibration effectively cancelling image shake effect is the faster lens image stabilisation is so effective that it allows reduction of shutter speed by between two and five stops without any perceptible increase in image blur initially it was a two stop reduction but this was changed to three with the arrival of the ef70200mm f28l is usm in 2001 to four steps with the ef70200mm f4l is usm in 2006 and finally five steps with the ef200mm f2l is usm in 2008 this has obvious implications for low light photography or photography where using a tripod is impractical or undesirable the ef200mm f2l is usm lens features a fivestop image stabilizer system that ensures the lens can be hand held at very slow shutter speeds to make sure you get the shot when the light levels fall using is with a tripod when using certain early models of is lenses with a tripod it was necessary to turn off the is function this is because of a phenomenon known as ‘shake return’ shake return occurs when the is system tries to correct vibrations to which the system itself contributes when the is lens sits on a tripod the is detection gyros pick up any tiny vibrations or movement these might be caused by the tripod being knocked or the photographer adjusting a camera setting the is system then swings into action to correct that movement the movement of the is lens group causes its own minute vibration which is in turn detected by the movement sensor which triggers another correction this ‘feedback loop’ can continue endlessly resulting in the addition of unwanted blur to images that would be sharper if the is function was switched off
