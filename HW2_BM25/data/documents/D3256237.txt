19955910748 t he standardization of medical practice is gaining acceptance as a technique for reducing lengths of stay as well as hospital charges while maintaining qual ity medical care approaches have ranged from using general sets of principles called practice guidelines 13 to using specific and detailed outlines for care called clinical pathways cps 4 5 both approaches contain elements of continuous quality improvement 6 7 typically these standardized approaches have been applied to specific diagnoses or procedures in the area of cardiac surgery there is little published information about this approach 8 9 as in other disci plines cp methodology has been either applied to spe cific diagnoses or procedures 8 or individually tailored to each patient 9 we have previously reported on the use of a cp to manage a subset of lowrisk patients undergoing repair of congenital cardiac defects this resulted in decreased lengths of stay and hospital charges 10 11 recently we developed four stratified cps based on the level of care required from simple to complex and have managed all cardiac surgical patients using this new cp method this approach significantly differs from others described in the literature because the cp is based on acuity rather than on specific lesions or procedures the purpose of this study was to evaluate our initial experience with this approach lengths of stay results of variance analyses and hospital charge data were examined as indices of our ability to stratify and standardize care for this diagnostically and procedurally diverse patient

cardiac surgery columbus childrens hospital 700 childrens dr columbus oh 43205 material and methods four pathways were developed based on anticipated acuity the likelihood and duration of postoperative ven tilatory support and the expected length of stay these are summarized in table 1 pathway a was designed for patients undergoing shortstay nonopen heart procedures not requiring postoperative ventilation closure of patent ductus arte riosus and uncomplicated pacemaker procedures are examples of the conditions treated in this pathway pathway b is used for the care of open heart procedure patients not requiring overnight ventilation eg a simple tetralogy of fallot without an outflow tract patch or of patients having more complex closed heart procedures eg palliative procedures for complex lesions for whom a 3 or 4day hospitalization is anticipated pathway c guides the care of patients with moderately complex conditions patients with a more severe form of tetralogy of fallot or those with a simple lesion atrial septal defect in the setting of a more complex condition such as downs syndrome would have their care guided by this pathway the procedure could be either an open or closed heart one but overnight or i full day of ventilation and a 6 to 7day hospitalization are expected pathway d is used to guide the care of patients with the most complex conditions the number of days on the ventila tor for any given patient in this pathway can vary nonetheless the care given in the intensive care unit while the patient is artificially ventilated is standardized with the exception of the frequency of laboratory studies which is determined daily postextubation care is stan dardized as it is in the other pathways a patient with a given lesion may have his or her care guided by any of the pathways depending on the procedure chosen the overall status of the patient or the events that take place Â© 1995 by the society of thoracic

than anticipated each pathway consists of a detailed outline of all daily interventions to be rendered from the time of preadmis sion to discharge as an example the pathway for the operative day for patients in pathway b is given in appendix 1 the pathways were developed by a multi disciplinary physiciandriven group that consisted of representatives from cardiac surgery cardiology inten sive care medicine and anesthesia as well as cardiac care clinical nurses nurses from the intensive care unit and the ward house staff respiratory and occupational ther apists and members of social services and administra tion the details addressed for each day are as follows activity diet tests electrocardiography and echocardiography blood studies medications nursing monitoring and assessment pulmonary care wound or other treatments fluid or intravenous status patient or parent teaching discharge planning once collated by the development group the proposed pathway guidelines were distributed to all participating groups for further input resultant suggestions were incorporated whenever possible the cp guidelines were then incorporated into a userfriendly small booklet with each day for each cp printed on a separate page the booklets were distributed and multiple inservice meetings were arranged with house staff nursing and ancillary services before the initiation of the program a date was selected for the launch of the program variances were defined as any deviation from the cp a single extra intervention eg an extra chest xray study was considered a minor variance an event trig gering a number of minor variants eg reintubation that triggered extra blood gas determinations extra chest films and extra intensive care unit time was deemed a major variant a deviation from the cp resulting in less rather than more resource utilization was considered a positive variance an example of a positive variance would be early extubation or the elimination of a study because of a betterthananticipated postoperative course variances from the pathways were initially gathered by nursing staff at shift changes and were noted in the booklet or an accompanying sheet which became avail able for analysis after discharge shortly after the pro gram began a research assistant specifically reviewed the chart and order sheets on a concurrent basis to ensure the capture of all variances variances were col lated and reviewed the pathways are evaluated and revised biannually the chart was used to verify hospital and intensive care unit lengths of stay the hospital information services department provided information on the final hospital charges if a pathway was changed during the patients hospitalization the data were assigned to the last desig nated pathway standard statistical methods were used to determine the median mean and standard deviation of each variable by pathway results one hundred seven consecutive surgical patients oper ated on during a 4month period were included this program of the total number of patients 16 n  17 were cared for by pathway a 31 n  33 by pathway b 24 n  26 by pathway c and 29 n  31 by pathway d table 2 details the findings from the variance analyses and the relatively small number of variances per patient can be seen as expected the frequency of variations from the cp increases with increasing complexity of care the table also shows that the small number of major variances was approximately offset by a similar number of positive variances table 3 shows the lengths of stay per patient by pathway and table 4 shows the hospital charges in the same format as expected both variables were larger with increasing complexity of care and were largely unpredictable for the patients in pathway d table 3 median

hospital charges for patients by pathway the bimodal distribution in pathways a and b reflects the fact that these pathways were used for both open and closed heart procedures the difference between the peaks represents the re source utilization associated with cardiopulmonary by pass by far the most important determinant of hospital charges was the length of time on the ventilator this directly determined the length of time in the intensive care unit and heavily influenced laboratory charges particularly the need for blood gas determinations also accounting for some variability in the complex pathways was a variable length of time in the hospital before operation was performed this was particularly true for the neonatal and infant groups comment these data show that the surgical care given patients with congenital cardiac conditions can be standardized into four pathways based on acuity despite the highly variable diagnostic and therapeutic nature of the field the relatively tight clustering of hospital charges verifies the validity of pathways a through c which constitute 71 of the group the small percentages of pathway changes were inevitable as there will always be some patients who respond differently than expected and it is important to fit care to the patient not the other way around as expected the data for pathway d were highly variable the low charges and short lengths of stay in the patients in this pathway are due to early mortalities after complex procedures those at the upper end of the scale represent the inevitable outliers who require extraordi

1 the bimodal distribution relates to the use of the pathway for patients undergoing both open and closed heart procedures nary support measures such as prolonged ventilation renal dialysis or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation despite the variability of the data for pathway d as a group the standardization of care given on a daytoday basis is a valuable feature of this program for instance a patient on pathway d may require 2 days or 2 weeks on the ventilator the charges and lengths of stay will reflect this difference and these 2 patients might seem to have little in common yet the care rendered for any given day on the ventilator is nicely standardized by the use of pathways furthermore patients on pathway d represent only 29 of the group and these median charges and lengths of stay still have predictive value from the stand point of business and pricing decisions our choice of four pathways rather than three or five might be questioned we believed initially and the data have borne out the fact that the first three pathways would be followed relatively closely most of the time the complex conditions of the patients in pathway d pre clude a close prediction of costs and lengths of stay we believed that further subdividing this group would not decrease the variability or enhance its usefulness it is likely that the optimal number of acuitybased pathways might be different in a different specialty 9 8  3  2 1 0 i i i i     thousands of dollars fig 3 distribution of hospital charges for patients in pathway c the axes are the same as those in figure 1

lengths of time on the ventilator and to the intensive care unit length of stay the lowest charges were those incurred by patients who died in the operating room we believe the acuitybased pathways are more useful than the traditional diagnosis or procedurally based pathways for example the course in an otherwise nor mal 1yearold child with tetralogy of fallot who under goes complete repair probably pathway b may be quite different from that in a 2monthold infant with tetralogy of fallot who also has downs syndrome probably path way d our approach is somewhat different from that pro posed by turley and colleagues 9 although the goals are quite similar the methods differ their method in volved seven sequential decision points that pertained to further intervention in all patients our approach directs patient care into one of four pathways and allows devi ation within the pathways as necessary deviation is infrequent in the first three pathways although we believe our approach is quite simple and reproducible either approach when properly applied can direct crit ical attention to resource utilization and attain the nec essary goals of cost containment and reduced length of stay without sacrificing quality we believe this approach serves several useful func tions first it has been helpful in the medical manage ment of patients second it has been useful in the management of resource utilization in an organized and justifiable manner third we believe that the tracking of pathway distribution done in conjunction with cost anal ysis by pathway is a useful tool for pricing managed care contracts as we look toward the introduction of capitation or more standard global fees across large numbers of procedures this approach has improved the quality of our medical product it has been particularly useful in minimizing the overutilization of services in a teaching environment the fact that the expectations for the study and care of each patient are outlined in detail frees house officers from ordering batteries of studies to protect themselves par ents particularly appreciate the predictability of the path ways and their perception of the organization is en hanced when attending house officers nurses and other caregivers are all working from the same plan parents also expressed satisfaction at the earlier discharge of the patients variance analysis revealed no adverse effects from the use of this method and no patients were readmitted for the management of complications that could have been prevented by a longer inpatient stay the standardization of resource utilization offered by this approach in conjunction with new and improving methods in cost accounting considerably upgrades our ability to assess the actual costs for service the relatively predictable charges in 71 of the group give us hope that the costs will also be predictable to the degree that the distribution of pathways is stable and knowing the median charges for each group the charges that would be generated by a group of sufficient size can be deter mined by simple arithmetic although these data reflect our initial experience and represent a relatively small group dealt with over a short period we have been developing this approach for many years and find that the cp approach becomes easier and more accepted with time however longterm followup is important we conclude that basing cps on acuity rather than diagnosis enhances the ability to manage both patients and resources and is therefore useful in the managed care environment we

multiple pathways for each diagnosis has been seen as a significant drawback in this patient group davis and associates have attempted to decrease the complexity of the methodology by con structing four pathways based on the degree of acuity the first two of these are extremely simple and clearly meet this goal however these are the same simple patients in which straightforward pathways are in place in most institutions using the methodology it is with the more complex patients that the problems begin their third pathway is slightly more complex and does com bine more divergent diagnoses however it is also with this group that we start to see the problems associated with bunching different diagnoses with numerous co morbidities finally in the fourth pathway a menagerie of commonly seen complex abnormalities results in what appears to be no true pathway with great variability in the clinical course and costs of the patients in these subsets the article does however express a very impor tant problem in pathway methodology the need for simplification to make it functional in the complex world of congenital heart disease the problem with the davis model is that it attempts to use the standard quality assurance approach and produce a small number of standard plans to which very different patients are ex pected to adhere not surprisingly this approach is very successful in the simple groups where uniformity of patient hospitalizations is expected and negative varia tion can be reduced through its use the system fails when the more complex patients with significant co morbidities are approached imagine a system in which the power is in the process rather than the plan imagine a process that is proactive has seven critical moments can accelerate ones passage through that process and encourages the patients to outperform the system imagine more than 95 of the patients achieving their goals more than 80 exceeding their goal and more than 70 achieving the shortest hospital plan a 3day hospitalization this is the system called cardiovascular radical outcome method and a 3day hospitalization is cv rom 1 a separate 2day pathway cv rom 0 recently has been developed for the most simple cases as seen in davis and associates first two pathways and uses a q shift rather than q daily design to maximally accelerate such patients progress these techniques are 180 degrees separated from the world of standard quality assurance plans they assure nothing but demand close attention to history physical and comorbidities to create the pathway and then close observation of clinical progress to allow the patient to outperform the system it is not a simplified plan but rather with computer technology the individual plans can be formatted simply and as the patients progress their course is simplified and their pathways shortened in response to the process it is a system quite distinct from that of davis and associates a system in which the upfront work is rewarded by the process the process is a proactive approach to positive variation the result is a large percentage of the patients even in the complex group accelerating to a markedly shortened hospitaliza tion davis and associates efforts are to be applauded however their methodology is in fact the drawback to the application to more complex lesions it can provide decreased variation in the simple problems and a small number of pathways in such patients can easily be constructed however complex patients provide the greatest opportunity for positive variation and in many both a safe and
