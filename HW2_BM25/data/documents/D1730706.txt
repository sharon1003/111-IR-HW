john daltonlived from 17661844 put forward atomic model in 1803nickname for his model billiard ball model description of his model dalton was an english chemist and teacher who used experimental evidence to form the atomic theory of matter all elements are composed made up of atoms it is impossible to divide or destroy an atom all atoms of the same element are alike one atom of oxygen is like another atom of oxygen atoms of different elements are different an atom of oxygen is different than an atom of hydrogenatoms of different elements combine to form a compound these atoms have to be in definite whole number ratios for example water is a compound made up of 2 atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen a ratio of 21 three atoms of hydrogen and 2 atoms of oxygen cannot combine to make water chemical reactions occur when atoms are separated joined or rearranged atoms of one element are never changed into atoms of another element as a result of a chemical reaction play in daltons playhouse httpwebvisionlearningcomdaltonplayhouseadloaderhtml an interactive virtual set of experiments that allow you to recreate classic experiments from the 19th century solid sphere model or billiard ball model proposed by dalton daltons elements more information john dalton investigated into the great depths of chemistry he came up with a theory on the smallest particles in the universe of what makes up what we call matter all matter consists of indivisible particles dalton gave the name to these minute particles the atom there are different types of atoms these are called elements hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen are examples of elements each of these elements is different from one another only by its weight atoms of the same element all have the same mass atoms of different elements are different in mass dalton used symbols to represent the elements he imagined atoms to be tiny spheres thus to draw atoms would be to draw circles he used patterns within the circles to distinguish the different elements using this way to symbolize invisible atoms he could experiment with their combining properties he created a table of atomic weights and using the information from this table he placed them in a significant order determined by the weight of the elements comparing them to hydrogen the lightest element which is number one on the table and has the atomic number of 1 dalton discovered the  law of multiple proportions this states that the weights of elements always combine with one another in ratios of small whole numbers dalton experimented with a gas called nitric oxide no and oxygen o he reacted them together to produce a third type of gas the results were determined by the proportions or ratios of the two reacting gasses 2no  o  n2o3 no  o  no2 dalton carried out experiments like this using the law of multiple proportions and completed the table of atomic weights summary john dalton was an english chemist his ideas from the atomic theory of matter here are his ideas matter consists of indivisible atoms all of the atoms of a given chemical element are identical in mass and in all other properties different chemical elements have different kinds of atoms in particular their atoms have different masses atoms are indestructible and retain their identities in chemical reactions a compound forms from its elements through the combination of atoms of unlike elements in small whole number ratios such as 1 to 1 2 to 2 2 to 3 and so on ratio of water is 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen atom adapted fromhttpwwwheliumcomitems214326howjohndaltoncameupwiththeatomictheoryofmatter
