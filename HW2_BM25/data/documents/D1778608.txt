provided inadequate agricultural education which was in part due to the fact that it could not afford to hire a specific professor or faculty of agricultural sciences and also in part due to the fact that rhode islands method for allocating landgrant scholarships favored urbanites and effectively produced few to no farmers the curator of the universitys museum of natural history had been reluctantly recruited to give series of lectures on agricultural topics which included visits to local farms when the hatch act of 1887 was passed the grange had made sure it was stated therein that funds did not need to be applied to current colleges and could be used for agricultural experiment stations not connected with them so the rhode island general assembly having grown disenchanted with browns lackluster performance established an agricultural school at kingston and applied the hatch acts funds to it eventually in 1890 brown felt it drew no benefit from being the states landgrant university so it offered to return the morrill trust to the state and withdraw as the landgrant institution shortly thereafter congress passed the second morrill act to increase funding to landgrant universities and following a controversy as to which school should benefit decided in browns favor by the rhode island supreme court brown promptly withdrew its offer on may 19 1892 after growing increasingly displeased with browns agricultural program the general assembly decided to restructure the kingston school as the rhode island college for the agricultural and mechanical arts now called the university of rhode island and to designate it as the states only landgrant institution thereby removing brown from that status the university protested by suing the state and the case was transferred to the us district court for rhode island which decided against brown which then appealed to the united states supreme court when the us supreme court refused to hear the case brown conceded defeat such that in 1894 the state as related by encyclopedia brunoniana approved an agreement in which brown would repay the 50000 received from the sale of the land in kansas and assume the expense of educating the present holders of the state scholarships and in return brown would receive 40000 in compensation for the education of earlier state scholars and would be relieved of the responsibility for agricultural education assumed in connection with the morrill act of 1863 20south carolina  editclemson university south carolina state university founded in 1896 as the colored
