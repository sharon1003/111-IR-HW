key points an arrhenius acid is any species that increases the concentration of h  in aqueous solution an arrhenius base is any species that increases the concentration of oh − in aqueous solution in aqueous solution h  ions immediately react with water molecules to form hydronium ions h 3 o  in an acidbase or neutralization reaction an arrhenius acid and base usually react to form water and a salt introduction from the vinegar in your kitchen cabinet to the soap in your shower acids and bases are everywhere but what does it mean to say that something is acidic or basic in order to answer this question we need to examine some of the theories describing acids and bases in this article we will focus on the arrhenius theory arrhenius acids the arrhenius theory of acids and bases was originally proposed by the swedish chemist svante arrhenius in 1884 he suggested classifying certain compounds as acids or bases based on what kind of ions formed when the compound was added to water citrus fruits—such as grapefruit—contain high amounts of citric acid a common organic acid image credit wikimedia commons cc bysa 25an arrhenius acid is any species that increases the concentration of h  ions—or protons—in aqueous solution for example lets consider the dissociation reaction for hydrochloric acid hcl in water h cl  a q → h   a q  cl −  a qwhen we make an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid h cl dissociates into h  ions and cl − ions since this results in an increase in the concentration of h  ions in solution hydrochloric acid is an arrhenius acid hydrogen or hydronium ions lets say we made a 2 m aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid hbr which is an arrhenius acid does that mean we have 2 m of h  ions in our solution actually no in practice the positively charged protons react with the surrounding water molecules to form hydronium ions h 3 o  this reaction can be written as follows h   a q  h2o  l → h3o   a qeven though we often write acid dissociation reactions showing the formation of h   a q there are no free h  ions floating around in an aqueous solution instead there are primarily h 3 o  ions which form immediately when an acid dissociates in water the following picture illustrates the formation of hydronium from water and hydrogen ions using molecular models when an acid dissociates in water to form h  ions protons the h  ions immediately react with water to form h 3 o  thus chemists talk about the concentrations of hydrogen ions and hydronium ions interchangeably image credit uc davis chemwiki cc byncsa 30 usin practice most chemists talk about the concentration of h  and the concentration of h 3 o  interchangeably when we want to be more accurate—and less lazy—we can write the dissociation of hydrobromic acid to explicitly show the formation of hydronium instead of protons hbr  a q  h2o  lhbr  a q→ h3o   a q  br −  a q more accuratevs→ h   a q  br −  a q shorter and easier to writein general either description is acceptable for showing the dissociation of an arrhenius acid arrhenius bases an arrhenius base is defined as any species that increases the concentration of hydroxide ions oh − in aqueous solution an example of an arrhenius base is the highly soluble sodium hydroxide na oh sodium hydroxide dissociates in water as follows na oh  a q → na   a q  oh −  a qin water sodium hydroxide fully dissociates to form oh − and na  ions resulting in an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions therefore na oh is an arrhenius base common arrhenius bases include other group 1 and group 2 hydroxides such as li oh and ba oh2 an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide an arrhenius base contains dissociated sodium and hydroxide ions wait arent most metal hydroxide insoluble even insoluble compounds such as ca oh2 are often classified as arrhenius bases because they have some tiny fraction that can dissolve in water and the fraction that is in solution dissociates to form oh − ions another way to think about this is that complete solubility is not a requirement for something to be an arrhenius base as long as some of it gets into solution and increases the concentration of oh − ions we can classify it as an arrhenius base note that depending on your class—or textbook or teacher—nonhydroxidecontaining bases may or may not be classified as arrhenius bases some textbooks define an arrhenius base more narrowly a substance that increases the concentration of oh − in aqueous solution and also contains at least one unit of oh − in the chemical formula while that doesnt change the classification of the group 1 and 2 hydroxides it can get a little confusing with compounds such as methylamine ch 3 nh 2 when methylamine is added to water the following reaction occurs ch3nh2  a q  h2o  l ⇋ ch3nh3  a q  oh −  a qbased on our first definition methylamine would be an arrhenius base since the oh − ion concentration increases in the solution by the second definition however it would not count as an arrhenius base since the chemical formula does not include hydroxide acidbase reactions arrhenius acid  arrhenius base  water  salt when an arrhenius acid reacts with an arrhenius base the products are usually water plus a salt these reactions are also sometimes called neutralization reactions for example what happens when we combine aqueous solutions of hydrofluoric acid hf and lithium hydroxide li oh if we think about the acid solution and base solution separately we know the following an arrhenius acid increases the concentration of h   a q h f  a q ⇋ h   a q  f −  a qan arrhenius base increases the concentration of oh −  a q li oh  a q → li   a q  oh −  a qwhen the acid and base combine in solution h 2 o is produced from the reaction between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions while the other ions form the salt li f  a q h   a q  oh −  a q → h2o  l formation of water li   a q  f −  a q → li f  a q formation of salt if we add the reactions for the formation of water and the formation of salt we get our overall neutralization reaction between hydrofluoric acid and lithium hydroxide h f  a q  li oh  a q → h2o  l  li f  a qlimitations of the arrhenius definition the arrhenius theory is limited in that it can only describe acidbase chemistry in aqueous solutions similar reactions can also occur in nonaqueous solvents however as well as between molecules in the gas phase as a result modern chemists usually prefer the brønstedlowry theory which is useful in a broader range of chemical reactions the brønstedlowry theory of acids and bases will be discussed in a separate articlesummary an arrhenius acid is any species that increases the concentration of h  in aqueous solution an arrhenius base is any species that increases the concentration of oh − in aqueous solution in aqueous solution h  ions immediately react with water molecules to form hydronium ions h 3 o  in an acidbase or neutralization reaction an arrhenius acid and base usually react to form
