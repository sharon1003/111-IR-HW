flag function of cytosol answer by judithdelgado2000 confidence votes 8semifluid medium of a cells cytoplasm the cytosol has no single function and is instead the site of a wide variety of cell processes examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell such as the cell nucleus 51 or organelles 52 this compartment is also the site of many of the processes of cytokinesis after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis 53 another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used this is relatively simple for watersoluble molecules such as amino acids which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol 14 however hydrophobic molecules such as fatty acids or sterols can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes 54 55 molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles 56 which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins 57 the cytosol is the site of most metabolism in prokaryotes 6 and a large proportion of the metabolism of eukaryotes for instance in mammals about half of the proteins in the cell are localized to the cytosol 58 the most complete data are available in yeast where metabolic reconstructions indicate that the majority of both metabolic processes and metabolites occur in the cytosol 59 major metabolic pathways that occur in the cytosol in animals are protein biosynthesis the pentose phosphate pathway glycolysis and gluconeogenesis 60 the localization of pathways can be different in other organisms for instance fatty acid synthesis occurs in chloroplasts in plants 61 62 and in apicoplasts in apicomplexa 63 httpenwikipediaorgwikicytosol to suck the sperm and urine out of the dick the function is to save the cell from dirt and germs36 people found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no
