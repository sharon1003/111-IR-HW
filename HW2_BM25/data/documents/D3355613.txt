a parent’s guide to minecraft september 29 2013 by erika is your child crazy about minecraft but you’ve been wondering what the hype is about – and if you should let your child play it do you worry your child might play minecraft too much or worry that it’s too violent maybe you’ve heard some parents say that it’s an amazing tool for learning and will cure all the ills of the 21st century doubtful right well i was once clueless about minecraft and in fact i would not let my children ages 7 and 4 anywhere near it but they wore me down – and now i am fine with it in fact they’ve even converted me to it a little bit – and taught me more than i ever wanted to know about it which is why i decided to write this little review for you my dear readers just sharin’ the love…what is minecraft  minecraft is a video game designed to lull children into a zombielike state so they never leave their bedrooms which allows their parents to finally have a moment of peace haokay so that’s not really what it is minecraft is a videogame that consists of digital blocks that the player can use to create whole new worlds the game is available on a variety of platforms  i pad i phone mac pc and even xbox 360 the next step is to install a chip in the head to play minecraft…just you wait and seewe started off with the minecraft pocket edition for i pad the kids did great with that it has many of the same options as the pc game at a fraction of the price i am sure you are aware but if your child is using an i pad please please please do yourself a favor and get a good case for it we have an otter box defender  i cringed at the price when i bought our case but it has saved our i pad from ruin countless times getting off soapbox now…we “upgraded” to the pc minecraft version awhile back – and it has many more things you can do…which for our purposes was a little too much the kids prefer the i pad version because it’s simpler to navigate on the pc version you use the keyboard to command and it’s easier to connect to a server  ain’t gonna happen in this house…more on that later  also note that the game operates in one of four modes survival creative adventure and hardcore if you have a young child you need to change the setting to creative we did not know this and it was bad paprika age 7 had nightmares for a month about zombies coming to eat her alive in creative mode you have access to all the resources you want and you never die and you can’t kill anyone either oh and no zombies that’s the happy land where i’d like to liveis minecraft educational or just another mindless video game  minecraft is different than a lot of other games in that the user can actively create the setting and the world the user creates can respond dynamically i know people say minecraft is like “digital legos” – and that’s true to some extent the difference is that in minecraft the building blocks can be used in an infinte number of ways also the creations can stay forever and you can build on them potentially forever that being said minecraft is just about as educational as you make it if your child just walks around the world for the day perhaps that day would better be spent walking around an actual park maybe…if you want the best of both world – there are now minecraftthemed legos ha although i would opt for the digital minecraft because goodness knows i don’t need any more legos to step on or suck up in my vacuum cleaner geeshwhat aspects of minecraft should concern me even though minecraft is a great tool for all ages – there are some areas of caution1 the time spent my kids can be sucked into minecraft and never want to leave everyone has their own level of screentime allowance in their home but bottomline…it’s just not healthy for anyone to be so fixated on one game my kids get a limited amount of time to play minecraft and i use it as a reward as well that being said my kids do play it together and so while i was worried that playing it would be an isolating experience i find that they often sit together and build worlds2 connecting to the server a huge feature of minecraft is the community your child can connect to a server and play with other people of all ages who are also playing minecraft at the same time strangers evennuhuh not in my house not with my kids my husband figured out a way to network our two computers together so that we have an internal server where we can play against each other technology wayyyy over my head but for the most part i do not let my kids play on the server with other people i am sure i don’t have to tell you why that’s a bad idea especially for young kids3 minecraft videos there are a ton of minecraft videos on you tube especially where people can show off their minecraft creations there are minecraft building contests music videos and short movies all featuring minecraft paprika age 7 has begged me to watch the minecraft videos but here’s the thing many of those videos have some very foul language and inappropriate content i used to watch them before paprika and then bookmark the videos she was allowed to watch the few times i did not preview the videos…let’s just say i exited out really quickly hai don’t let her watch the you tube minecraft videos anymore because i don’t have the time to prescreen everything seriously ain’t nobody got time for thatplus even the “safe” videos always led to other videos she wanted to watch which had not been prescreened i suppose i could find a “safe” you tube alternative – but so far i haven’t had any luck4 warlike behavior scary themes in peaceful mode everything is…you guessed it…peaceful but when you venture into the other modes of minecraft your child’s player could kill or be killed and also could be attacked by something scary they could also kill animals like poor sweet little sheep that has not been something i’ve wanted to let my kids experience so like i said we choose peaceful mode when we play if you venture outside peaceful mode it’s not such a happy land anymoredo you recommend minecraft for young children overall i think minecraft is great in moderation i do limit the amount of time they can play otherwise they might never come up for air also because of the strict controls i have in place – always in peaceful mode and never on a server – i know that they are safe they have built beautiful castles elaborate mansions and explored the depths of the sea all in minecraft it’s a phenomenal creative tool with the right limits in place it can be a wonderful game to teach problemsolving while having a lot of fun the downsides are that it can take up a lot of time and if the right parental controls are not in place it can be inappropriate for young kids so take your precautions and then go have some funwhat has your experience been with minecraft are you a fan yes or no tell me in the comments i was not compensated for this review – i just love sharing my knowledge with other parentsp s are you
