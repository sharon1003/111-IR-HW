pm never have taken a cab from dulles to the bwibaltimore area but in 2004 we got a good deal to fly into dulles going to annapolis and baltimore for a relatives wedding  not realizing how far apart they were dulles is even way removed from dc we rented a car i swore i would never do it again its not easily accessible to baltimore renting a car that night and driving took at least 90 minutes or more we still call it the drive from he11 much further than we anticipated if your destination is baltimore for touring or your hotel location is there any way you could fly into bwi instead its much closer and handier to baltimore public transportation will save you a lot of transportation dollars with more information from you as to where you need to be hotelwise we could give you more exact transportation details i dont want to scare you but  just be aware that they are not close to each other so a taxi might cost quite a bit enough to be a large factor into your travel budget mentioned

reply2 re distrance from washingtondulles airport jul 6 2012 627 am dulles airport is just over 60 miles from downtown baltimore a taxi between dulles airport and bwi airport is quoted at about 120 before tip on the dulles website it would be more to downtown baltimore report inappropriate content gl726potomac maryland level contributor114 posts463 reviews save reply3 re distrance from washingtondulles airport jul 6 2012 759 am following on irish fans post the 120 figure should be considered a minimum it can be even higher depending on traffic agree with marly sf if you can fly into bwi versus iad dulles youll be much better positioned you should have cheaper flights from toronto into bwi versus iad anyway bwi is a less convenient airport and most of the airlines that serve bwi take that into consideration on their fares plus its a southwest airlines hub which drives prices down too mentioned in this post toronto ontario canada report inappropriate content irish fan maryland

definitely give me something to think about i was thinking of flying into dulles because porter airlines has started flying there from toronto not only would it be cheaper but the porter airport is easier and cheaper to get to in toronto than pearson airport where the other airlines fly out of but if it is more inconvenient to go to dulles it might be worth paying the extra  are there any trains or buses that go from dulles airport to downtown d c or baltimore thanks again for all of the help mentioned in this post toronto ontario canada report inappropriate content davefrom col mdcolumbia

downtown dc a very roundabout way would be transport from dulles to downtown dc then train amtrak or marc to baltimore report inappropriate contentsoliel1705toronto canada13 posts save reply7 re distrance from washingtondulles airport jul 6 2012 1031 am thats true my main reason for going to baltimore would be to check out an orioles game ideally in the postseason but no pressure and i want to take a tour of beautiful camden yards i guess i could fly into dulles stay in d c and take the train in to baltimore for a day definitely something to think about thanks again for all the

jul 6 2012 1224 pm glad you got back to us with your travel goal that helps a lot your last plan sounds quite workable if you just want to go to the ballpark for the day we take marc to and from baltimore and dc on our trips to baltimore and its a cinch also i agree with you 100  ill be at the ballpark on september 30 to see the last regular season game with the red sox so im hoping for an os

distrance from washingtondulles airport jul 6 2012 201 pmthanks for the info about the marc thats good to know is it safe to take the marc at night after a game wraps up there is no marc service late enough to get back from a night os game sorry marc is a commuter train service geared towards commuters and not baseball fans unfortunately the last train leaves penn station at 915 and penn station
