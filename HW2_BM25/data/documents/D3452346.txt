flat earthers and god some flat earthers believe in god but not the bible it’s strange but i have read some posts and saw some videos where some flat earthers do not believe in the bible and even ridicule it but they believe in a creator god this doesn’t make sense they think that they are so well schooled in conspiracy theories and the false flags that the us government has done but they don’t see that they are being lied to when it comes to the bible i don’t know where you are in your studies but say if you are one of them let me ask you some questions first since you are a “flat earther” and do believe in a creator god you agree that the whole of creation earth is beautiful with all the provisions that mankind needs such as water abundance of food animals including domestic animals that help us move heavy objects there are the basic materials we need to build homes out of wood trees hemp rocks mud and steel there is all the minerals and rareearths elements we need to make everything from bicycles to trains from shirts to computers we all agree with this the intelligence and the foresight of our creator to provided all of this is beyond what any mortal man could think of after all god could have just provided us with materials that would only keep us living in mud or wooden huts to have us with only the materials that would keep us in a primitive state but he didn’t he has materials here on earth for the most basic construction materials to the most advanced everything is in perfect balance too from plants to minerals to the ratio of land to fresh water this we are all in agreement with so with that in mind i ask these agnostic people why wouldn’t god have an instruction book for us for how to have a successful happy and healthy life think of this for a moment what would you think of a person who invented a board game those old fashion games before computers came along and he provided no instructions you take it home and look and all you saw was a small slip of paper that said “you can play this game as you see fit you can cheat you can change the rules as you play in short you can use ‘situation ethics’ ” would you like this game would you think it would be fun to play what would you think of the inventor who made the game you probably wouldn’t like the game you would lose most of the time and you would think that the inventor was an idiot so why would you think that god in his mighty wisdom would not provide us with an “instruction manual” for the game of life well he did and it’s called the bible and he inspired certain people to write it but this is the book that is ignored by most of the world and by christians these christians might as well be muslims as they are ignorant of it there are “flat earthers” too who ridicule the bible as much as the atheists and agnostics who believe in the globe earth i notice that most people who know the flat earth truth wants to see a better world they also want to expose lies that we are told whether it be in current events history or science they are well aware of the lies being told them by their governments and media yet they don’t consider the lies that are being told them about the bible haven’t they stopped and thought that most of the attacks are not on the muslim buddhist or jewish faith but on christians haven’t they given a second thought that the same sources who attack 911 truthers also attack the true christian faith if these flat earthers did more research into why the bible is attacked they will find the answer not only will they find that it’s done by the same tribe of people but the reasons behind they will find that the reason is that god tells us how to have a happy healthy and prosperous life and the jews don’t want us to know about as it would break their monetary grip over us so is it really that much trouble for you to give back to god the little that he asks all that god asks us to do includes a little of your time in reading his word each day tithing your income as his law requires no income tax or other taxesbelieving in christ following his laws statues and judgements that’s it is that too much trouble to ask look at all the things he gave you of course you’d have a heck of a lot more when you live by god’s laws instead of the pharisee’s laws yet there are those who call themselves “christians” who say they don’t want god to rule but it’s ok to have men to rule what sense does that make so they don’t want to do the little that god requires but they do the tons of paper work that is required by an oppressive government that we have today god said take my burden as it is light comparing it to man’s burdensome laws advertisements share this print pinterest twitter facebook google email linked in loading
