players fresh and out of foul trouble by ken sartini subbing players is a very important part of game time coaching strategy its important because not having the proper personnel on the floor in crunch time can result in lost games subbing properly can boost your players moral and confidence subbing keeps key players fresh and out of foul trouble when you really need them subbing can change the momentum and pace of the game keeping players fresh and out of foul trouble keeping players fresh usually keeps them out of foul trouble why tired players tend to foul more because they dont move their feet as well and rely on reaching subbing gets more players in the game and that keeps them happy and the morale of the team up you will also have your best players in the game on the floor when it counts in crunch time there are times when this can be a very difficult decision the big question is can i keep this game close with my best player s on the bench can my subs keep the intensity level up or do i have to play my best players and hope they dont foul out the bigger the game the tougher the decision is going to be but if you have formed a philosophy regarding when you sub and at what time you are willing to put them back in the game the decision becomes easier i will give you two different examples of using subs in one game i had only one player that could really score and he was in foul trouble from the first quarter to the fourth i subbed for him in each quarter to try and save him for the last part of the game he probably sat 70 of this game we went into the 4th quarter down four points they were in a zone and my best player was on the bench we held the ball for 4 minutes and i put him back in the game he ended up hitting four threes in the last 4 minutes to give us the w this time it worked out another game we had a transfer student from yugoslavia who was foul prone so i never started him until we got to the regional championship game i felt that if we were going to have our best chance of winning he would have to start and of course he got in foul trouble i subbed for him and the sub did a decent job no baskets but no turnovers which i was happy about when i got the player back into the game with 4 minutes on the clock we were ahead amazing considering the size of the other team and our lack of it we ended up down two with less than a minute to go we got the last shot but it didnt go in it would have been a great upset that team ended up going downstate and did pretty well the use of subs correctly comes with experience sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesnt we do what we think is the right thing at the time we do it according to our own philosophy the pros to subbing are keeping your players fresh  getting more players into the game thus making them happy great for team spirit  it makes everyone feel like they are an integral part of the team this allows you to pressure the other team and do more things if the subs are prepared to play that maybe you cant do if they are tired towards the end of the game it also ensures that your best players are on the floor at the end of the game when you need them pace of the game one of the best ways to change the pace of the game is to know your personnel and sub based on whats happening for example lets say your team is looking slow on both ends of the court they are hesitant on offense and the defense is slow to the ball this could be a great time to put in a couple high energy defensive guys to get the team moving sometimes you need a defensive leader or two on the floor the energy and hustle can be contagious a couple turnovers and fast break baskets can really change things let your best players watch for a few minutes let the energy pick up then put your good players back in to join the energy you may want to keep at least one of your hustle players in there to keep things going in any case this is an example of how you can change the pace of the game by knowing your players and subbing at the right time allowing players to get a rhythm theres a fine line between keeping your players fresh and allowing them to develop a rhythm sometimes it takes a few shots and a little time for players to get a rhythm and feel for the game nothing is more frustrating for a player when they get pulled from the game just when they started to feel it this bothers some players more than others i think players with limited confidence are affected most by this the really confident and mentally tough players dont care when and where they shoot they always think it will go in one of the best ways to overcome that issue is to develop a consistent rotation this allows players to get comfortable playing at certain times of the game and they know what to expect if you know youre coming out of the game and will get your 8 minutes every night then its not as frustrating when you get pulled knowing a head of time certainly helps on the other hand some coaches like to change things up constantly and make changes based on the opposition pace of them game and gut feel there are pros and cons to both methods for the super experienced coach going with your gut might work well for the less experienced coach i think having a consistent rotation is the way to go it allows you to focus on other aspects of them game and keeps you from getting overwhelmed subbing after players do good things one thing i picked up from coach danny miles 876 wins at oit college is to sub players after they make a shot or do something good this helps keep players shooting confidence high if they come out just after missing they might dwell on the miss when it comes to high percentage shooting nothing is more important than confidence its the little things that can make a difference what is your philosophy in regards to subbing do you sub players that are in foul trouble do use a preplanned rotation please leave your comments below coaching resources how to win at the

witzberger says6252009 at 85621 amwe also like for players to let us know right when they think they are starting to get tired if they take themselves out we will get them back in quicker we tell them if they get too fatigued and we have to get them out they will sit a lot longer giving them some control on this has worked for a lot of players if we sub for other reasons we let the players know when they come out also we may tell players going in why they are going in especially nonstarters it could be just to give somebody a quick breather a lot of times we may tell them something like youre goong in just for a couple minutes dont worry about scoring unless its a layup take care of the basketball and lets see how many rebounds you can get like carolyn chapple says6252009 at 104346 amthanks so much for this article i coach an 20 and under male basketball team and that is a question i get asked quite a bit coach why did you take me out for the most part my players are in foul trouble or it is becasue there is no flow amongst the players that are on the floor i have subbed also to help a player get his emotions under control like coach pantoja says6252009 at 110607 ami coach middle school girls basketball my district requires that everybody on the team play at least 4 minutes and if you play in the 1st quarter you cannot play in the second quarter i play my strongest group in the 2nd quarter in order that they do not sit too much on the bench to make a long story short this allows me to use the players that did well in the 1st quarter to give my best players a blow in the second half like coach davis says6252009 at 111307 pmi coach a 14uboys competitive basketball team and i still have not figured out just how to sub honestly i tend to remove them from the game after a couple mistakes or turnovers i am never too concerned over a missed shot unless it was an easy layup that was missed i have been told to leave the player in and when i do more mistakes i dont intend to blow their confidence but they leave me no choice they turn to you and say my bad then make another turnover i usually try to play all of my players except for discipline reasons and a lot of my most serious problems is parents we have played many teams this season and a lot of those teams dont play all of their players yet i have still have complaints one of the parents even verbally attacked me i hate to punish the kid but since then things just have not been the same please advise on how to deal with parents i will need this for next year like 1 reply coach jackson says352016 at 70731 amcoach davis i think your most effective strategy is going to be discussing this before the season even starts if you have a parentathlete informational meeting before the season starts this is a great time to address this for my team i have a concise list of nonnegotiables these are basic expectations that i have which i will not waver or be flexible with for example among my nonnegotiables are respect hustle ontime and not discussing playing time the last part is more for parents than my athletes i tell parents early on that i will not discuss playing time with them under any circumstances i will be more than happy to discuss things their athlete can work on at home or on their own time to improve their skills thus potentially leading to more playing time but that i will not discuss an athletes playing time with anyone besides my coaching staff hope this helps best of lucklike joe haefner says6262009 at 102032 amcoach davis please understand that in order for players to learn they will make mistakes they need to play out of their comfort zone and learn things they can and cant do at this age level if you take them out whenever they make a mistake you get a scared timid player i highly advise to listen to this interview by don kelbick former college coach and currently trains nba players where he talks about the importance of reducing the fear of failure httpwwwbreakthroughbasketballcomaudionews7kelbickhtml for kids under 14 you should try to keep fairly equal playing time if you dont you could be hurting the players and the teams future the reason i say this is that so much happens between ages 14 to 18 somebody who is riding the bench right now may have the most potential but is developing slower than others if this player doesnt get playing time how does he improve and never punish a kid for a disagreement that you have with a parent that is extremely unfair to the child you need to ask yourself are you coaching to win games or are you coaching to develop players at the youth level this does not always go hand and hand like joseph wilson says6292009 at 23746 pmi make out a substitution pattern for all my games i dont like for my players to have to go more than 3 or 4 minutes without coming out for at least 30 or a minute this rotation is not set in stone and is adaptable to foul troublescore of gamehow well or poorly a player is performing i like doing this because it helps me to get more players in the game and also allows me to control who is on the floor making sure to always have each position covered my backup pg is also my starting 2 guard so this helps me to make sure not to have both of them out at one time like mark mc kinley says11132009 at 72855 amcoaches im looking for a 9 man sub rotation plan i have one pg and have backups for the rest 2345 my 2g can play the point in order to rest the starting pg concerned about keeping starters out of foul trouble and at the same time getting 4 on the bench valuable varsity minutes please email me at mdmckinleyhotmailcom with anyall suggestions thanks and good luck to you and your team this season  likelevi says4242010 at 45626 pmthis is a good one i like to sub players by a number situations like tempo and fatigue ive even used a sub to be able to communicate a strong point to a player in crunch time so i beleive subs are a very important part of the coachs strategies like james says11122010 at 12224 pmi coach 3rd and 4th grade girls we have 14 kids how can i get a pattern of substitution that will allow for equal playing time it is required in our league and i firmly believe in itlike kerry bar says1252011 at 115356 amcoachparent relationship when is it okay to discuss playing time with my daughters coach shes on a competitive 4th grade team and there are many times that neither she or i understand why she is removed from the game for example she is a very aggressive defensive player and rarely allows the other team to score she rarely fouls but at the last game she got two fouls on her in the first period they play 4 periods the coach pulled her and only put her back in the game for a few minutes he never gave her an explanation and since shes only 9yearsold she doesnt understand what she did wrong even though shes only 9  she is also smart and realizes that she wasnt the only girl on the team to make fouls that game and that some of the other girls foul every game and they do not get pulled from the game shouldnt he have explained to her why she was sitting like joe haefner says1302011 at 103010 amkerry i would find a time that believes in fairly equal playing time a player is never going to develop on the bench i also dont believe in competitive at that age whats more competitive the kids or the adults like benchwarmer says252011 at 102302 ami am on a middle school girls basketball team and i dont play that much sometimes never but the sad thing is i am first off the bench so no one plays behind me either some games my coach doesnt sub at all unless we have taken a 20 point lead and no less when i do go in its with all the bad players so i cant show my true potential at most in a close game 6 of the 12 people on my team will play including the starters he only subs post i dont understand then in the locker room he lowers our selfesteem even more by saying he didnt want to risk the game by putting us in or he didnt think we could handle it also when we lose he blames it on him saying he shouldnt have subbed in me or another girl i try to show him in practice but i am put on a team with not as good players so again i cant show him my talent please help what do i do just take it im only 13 and trying to really get up there ive been playing basketball since 3rd grade like basketball mom says11282011 at 12206 ammy daughter plays for a coach that subs immediatley after any player messes up at the very moment of the mistakethe player is called from the bench to run to the table to check in at next dead play it is horribleto the self esteem of the playersto the confidence of the players as well the team doesnt focus on what is positive they are trained to look for mistake of teammate and be ready to run to sub inif the poor one who makes the mistake has to stay in for few minutes before dead playheaven help them because they will only focus on the mess up from 2 mins ago and how they are waiting on sub to come for them its like the sub is the grim reaper or something it is just a horrible way to coach but these kind of coaches have no idea how to teach kidsthe have no interest in teaching kids anything these coaches try to live thur their players they try to make up for the mistakes they made in life and try to become the champions that they didnt become when they had the chance my daughter is in 10th grade now she has played basketball since she was 3rd grade but this is the worst coach she has ever had and it has effected her self esteem and confidece so bad that i can see a huge problem what should i do as a parent any suggestions please like jeff haefner says11292011 at 75735 amas a parent there might not be anything you can do you can try talking with the coach but the odds of that doing any good are pretty low start the conversation positive ask the coach for advice about keeping your daughters confidence high versus accusing the coach of hurting her confidence coaches like to give advice hence their ego just explain some situations the best thing is if it ends up being the coaches idea not to sub in that fashion versus it being your idea maybe talk to the head varsity coach too beyond that you could reinforce that its ok to make mistakes httpwwwbreakthroughbasketballcomblogindexphpimproveyourbasketballmentalitylearnfromderrickroselike coach says192013 at 12627 pmi am a coach of 7th and 8th grade boys travel team and was reading these comments to try to help me figure out how to sub a 10 person squad in 8 min quarters there are a lot of interesting ideas and they all seem to make sense depending on the situation i would have to disagree with playing all players the same times at my level anyway half of the kids on my team will be in high school next year and i think the coaching staff has a pretty good idea about the talent level from our 1 kid to our 10 kid however we will always make sure even the 10 kid gets at least 8 minutes in a game and if we have a comfortable lead he will get more the only time this may change is in playoff implications when people say it isnt about winning but developing players i think there is a fine line i firmly believe all the kids want to win and the starters may resent the fact that they are given equal time when they know the team has a better chance of winning if they are in more i believe most of the bench players would also agree this is just my take on the situation like ken sartini says192013 at 35808 pmcoach  this is what i have seen around here at that age group 5 players start the game and another 5 players play the 2nd quarter there might be 13 players on the team  give or take  the second half anybody can play depending on who is playing well that day it could be a sub this seems to work around here  you playing everyone at least 8 minutes sounds good to me with your age group like eric says262013 at 43048 pmthe coach must always explain to players starters and subs how and why he allocates different people in the game especially to subs why he seldom places himher in the game all players have right to know and harm the team spirits likethechief says2102013 at 65659 pmi think the coach forgets the power and influence heshe has in the lives of the kids we coach some of the comments above really bear that out in australia the highest level of junior basketball is representative where you play for your local association against other associations in the metropolitan region as a coach at that level now into my third year where there is massive expectation from the associations the kids and the parents and coaching 12 and 13 yr old boys i have seen some unbelievable behavior from coaches belittling humiliating screaming at what really are just little boys i have seen good kids with skills try something on court fail and run back up the court with their head hung low while the coach berates them so what did that kid just learn back himself trust his ability try something to build his confidence no he learned that if you mess up youre an idiot and you let your team down infuriates me to see this happen yes at some levels winning is important and while sport is about fun there is no doubt it is more fun to win that get smacked every week but you can win while making mistakes and helping kids find their inner belief i have one boy in my current team who is a great little baller but he refuses to take outside shots because of the fear of failure and what is saddest of all is that this fear of failure has been coached into him  and hes only 11 pretty sad coaches encourage dont belittle like ken says2102013 at 71113 pmthis is a great post chief there is no reason to yell at little kids that will get you nowhere the game is made up of mistakes your coaches needs to get over it coach  teach them the fundamentals of the game and then let them have fun you need to have a little talk with this boy and let him know that you want him to shoot when he is open and no one expects him to make them all look up some michael jordon quotes “i’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career i’ve lost almost 300 games 26 times i’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed i’ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed”  michael jordan he needs to see this for sure like coach cater says7122014 at 125626 pmit is important for coaches to communicate with players and parents as to expectations of the team player playing time and development this all depends on what competitive level you are playing general advise coaches like to win players like to win parents and players make sure you develop your skills to contribute to the teamlevel you are playing ask the coach what does my sondaughter need to do to earn more playing time how can i help them get better parents must put team before player when having conversations do not over estimate player talent decide what is the correct level for them to play and enjoy the game if they struggle under pressure help them in a positive way ask coach for advise the most common mistake i see in youth basketball is the lack of personal development of both players and coaches too much importance is put on playing vs learning and developing skills great players are not born they are made through correct skills and development find a good trainer coach that can help your childs development is more important then playing time every time i get asked to coach i try to make each player better and teach them more about the game winning and losing is a product of the work we do in practice conditioning skills personal development and team strategy coach cater likea grandma says1242017 at 24257 pmlast night our freshman boys played the freshman from a neighboring team unfortunately there arent enough teams in our area to have a regular freshman rooster so these are specially arranged non conference games only freshman played and all got to play a good thing as there are so many on our jv team playing time is at a premium when the freshman games was over the jv played what did the coach dohe played mostly freshman again leaving sophomores with a minimum of playing time my grandson has started for jv all year did not start i dont know if he was given a reason but i will ask him when i have a chance to visit with him the coach put him in shortly after the game started he did well making a basket getting a couple rebounds and doing wellfor abut three minutesthen he fouled and was immediately sit on the bench later he was put back inprobably less than a minute when he fouled the coach again immediately sit him on the bench however the freshman were allowed to keep playing after making one mistakeor more and played for a large part of the game we lost by about 20 points and that has been the story of our jv team the past two years there are two freshman who the coach played in nearly all the freshman game then again in the jv game i never saw the coach offer any reason or encouragement when he pulled someone out i see a player who loved the game is considered a better than average player gradually loosing his confidence and spirit while the coach overlooks him in favorites of his favorites i know my grandson is not the only one who is discouraged i think some coaches have no empathy for kids who arent his favorites if we were winning with his chooses that might be differentbut were not like dennis says2212018 at 13550 amwhat is the etiquette in a varsity basketball game to remove the seniors and starters in the last couple minutes of the last game of their season when they are loosing by more than 15 points also note it is senior night for these kids replaced by putting in jv players like 1 reply jeff says2212018 at 23523 pmgenerally you sub out one senior at a time with a younger players so fans can show appreciation each senior as they come out but it depends a little on the situation how many players you need to sub out if you need to sub a senior in and how much time is left when the game is clearly out of hand sometimes opposing coaches andor referees help out by calling timeout etc so you can sub out the seniors the refs usually understand and i have even seen refs call a timeout and pretend they are picking something up off the court and then resume play like leave a comment name email not published five times two is equal
