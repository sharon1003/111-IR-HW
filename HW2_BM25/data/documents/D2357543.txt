behavior or cultural artifact that is defined by society as being outside of the normal range i e a violation of norms  societys informal rulesdeviance is behavior or ideology that does not conform to the prevailing norms of society deviance is defined as the recognized violation of cultural norms the functionalist perspective in deviance  social control is best represented by emile durkheim  talcott parsons one category of deviance is crime the violation of a societys formally enacted criminal law what all deviant actions or attitudes have in common is some element of difference that causes us to regard another person as an outsidernot all deviance involves action or even choice dev is the violation of norms  expectations dev is the violation of norms accepted by either a significant number of people in a community or society or those w the power to enforce them just as there are important differences among situations in which norms are appropriate there are also important differences about the relative seriousness of types of norm or law violating behavior deviance like conformity is shaped by society the concept of deviance has twelve qualities  social foundations1 deviance is defined by societydeviance  norms are created or defined by society ie a general consensus thus what is deviant is not a property inherent in the thing or act2 deviance is nonconformitydeviance does not conform to expectations  norms that exist win a society deviance varies according to cultural norms3 group interests define deviancegroup interests play important role in defining deviance4 powerful groups define deviancelarge or powerful segments of society determine norms  thus determine what is or is not deviant both norms  the way people define them involve social power people at the bottom of the socio economic scale are most often labeled as deviant because the powerful in society determine what is deviant link however deviant something may be unless the powerful disapprove it is not deviant thus a behavior participated in by all or a majority of people can still be considered deviant for conflict theorists deviance is defined  enforced in a way that perpetuates the dominance of elites over the less powerful or powerless studies of the sociology of rule making show that what is defined as deviant is the outcome of a political process group interests play an important role in defining what behaviors are considered deviant or normal conflict theorists agree that a disharmony of interests exists in modern society from the conflict perspective norms dont involve agreement among a majority of people norms reflect the interests of people w enough power to enforce norms power influences social normssoc norms are strongly influenced by the divisions of power the grp w the most power can define the norms the dominant group tries to enforce its norms but not everyone agrees w the dominant grp the existence of power points to the existence of inequality some grps may follow norms  values even though they dont agree w them for some grps norms  values are not in their best interest conflict  inequality are created when grps follow norms  values even through they dont agree or when those norms  values are not in their best interest5 definitions of deviance vary by who does the actobservations of social interaction reveal that definitions of deviance tend to vary according to who performs the act6 most people violate rulesfew people are arrested  processed as criminals self report surveys reveal most people violate rules7 the effect of deviance is often magnified by the labeling effect where people are more impacted by the label of being deviant that they are by the performance of the deviant actpeople become deviant as others define them that way see also labeling theory8 deviance varies across contextsbehavior must be context appropriate what is normal in one context may be deviant in another9 deviance varies cross culturallythe nature of deviance changes from culture to culture the nature of deviance changes from culture to culture due to the fact that behavior is socially labeled as deviant or normal  the individual cultures  societies define deviance in their own ways cross cultural analysis indicates that notions of right  wrong vary among cultures10 deviance varies historicallydeviance is noticeable historically because the nature of deviance changes over time11 absolutism does not apply to deviance since it is defined by society  not by any particular standarddeviant behavior is not a violation of anything absolute ie it is not inherent in any particular forms of behavior12 relativism does not apply to deviance because while society has no absolute standard it always has some standard  thus never has non existent or relative standardsin an analysis of deviance the concept of relativism denotes that no behavior is naturally or morally deviant  bad all behavior is socially labeled either as deviant or normal but this does not mean that any behavior is acceptable relativism is the contention that what is deviant in any society is the consequence of social or political processes link examples of deviance as a violation of social norms top examples of behaviors that were approved of by large or powerful segments of society slavery discrimination based on sex  race

1002 link for functionalism some types of deviance can have positive functions for societysociologists have determined that deviance of various types can have positive functions for society for durkheim dev serves two necessary functions including that it defines the boundaries of acceptable behavior promotes integration for durkheim dev has the consequence of promoting social stability dev promotes social cohesion in that people who do not deviate feel that they belong to the group or society that supports the norms dev creates a feeling of us against them ie the ones who break the norms the fact that behavior must be context appropriate is seen in that deviance is interpreted by age  by past behavior the context in which deviance occurs may be social cultural or psychological  has a primary or secondary intensity1 primary deviance is an initial deviant actdeviant behaviors that are short term or cease w adult status primary deviance is correlated w social cultural structural  psychological conditions2  secondary deviance is deviance that result from being labeled as deviantsecondary deviance evolves out of the offenders self concept secondary deviance evolves from others conception of a person secondary deviance is long term  does not cease w adult status secondary deviance includes chronic deviant behavior by people who come to identify themselves as deviant the distinction btwn primary  secondary deviance is importance in the development of social policies that reduce the chances of primary deviance inducing secondary deviance a moral crusade is an interest groups attempt to define a behavior as deviantjoseph gusfields study of alcohol prohibition concluded that the american temperance movement was an example of a moral crusade an examination of deviance  social control is an examination of the appropriateness  correctness  necessity of govt  other social actors to utilize all types of social control labels of deviance sanctions etc to advance a moral crusade or any behavior or ideology for durkheim the positive consequences of deviance  social control include increased solidarity internal links top outline on conflict theory on deviance external links video conflict theory on deviance 130 link the conflict theory of deviance focuses on the creation distribution use  mystification of powerovert power is the ability to get others to do something against their will covert power is the ability to set parameters in which people make decisions those who control power determine what is dev those who lack power may act in ways they consider acceptable but these behaviors may be labeled dev by those who control the power from conflict theory soc change  progress occur as a result of conflict among soc grps dev beh may represent a challenge to dominant soc grps the dev beh of 1 soc grp may be a demand for a change of norms through the challenge of existing norms deviance indicates a struggle btwn soc grps  each soc grp has varying amts of powerthe grp w the most power tends to control the norms of society the ruling class determines which dev behaviors will be punished  dealt w by a formal social control sys the ruling class is the politically  economically dominant powerful grp since the ruling class has the most pol  econ power it has the largest part in deciding what is considered dev behthose outside the power structure socially create acceptable or even desirable beliefs  behaviors that the ruling class considers to be deviant at least partly because this offers some measure of opposition to the ruling class the less powerful grps find themselves subject to punishment in a formal soc control sys for things that they consider acceptable conflicts may occur win a single instit or org not just btwn 2 different grps like the ruling class  a grp lacking power conflict also occurs win an org as in the conflict in the republican party btwn the christian right  the traditional fiscal policy conservatives in the democratic party there is conflict btwn social liberals  the more fiscally conservative centrist wing dev occurs win a soc grp if conflict or power struggles exist win that grp

control of social institutions in the interest of the whole societysoc con is an important part of soc stability all of us are subject to social control attempts by society to regulate peoples thought  behavior much of soc control is done through culture socialization  formal control by authorities soc controls are organized methods for teaching  enforcing conformity cases of serious deviance may provoke action by the criminal justice system a formal response by police courts  prison officials to alleged violations of the law durkheim held that in modern society social control was slipping because the old forms found in traditions which he called mechanical solidarity had not yet been replaced by the new form found in the interdependence of society which he called organic solidarity see also durkheim where soc control fails we see deviance collective behavior soc mvmts crime alienation other social problems  other forms social behavior that are outside the norm link examples of

direct social control is regulation through the enforcement of normative standardsit is often done by a person s w authority  responsibility formal con is defined by legal sanctions  enforced by instits such as the police the courts  the various local state  fed legislatures the formal enforcement of norms is done through the threat of  implementation of rewards or punishments by those who represent an org or instit or the whole society the formal agents of socialization act on the basis of rules  laws most of which are written see also formal or direct social control informal or indirect social control is regulation through ideological or cultural manipulationit is often done by surrogate human authority such as rules customs laws even machines indirect social control is accomplished through socialization indirect social control is the most powerful type of social control at the heart of informal social controls are relationships w significant others sosreview for mead sos are people whose affection  approval are very important sos will reward punish or use other methods of socialization to enforce the norms of society link examples of direct  indirect control sanctions are rewards for conforming behavior  punishments for nonconforming behavior there are four types of sanctions1 a formal positive sanction is a formal rewarda formal positive sanction is a

are no readily apparent victims illegal acts in which all participants are consenting adults examples of victimless crimes include sex crimes drug use illegal gambling sports such as cock fighting the classic definition of victimless crime assumes there is never a victim in sex crimes drug use etc a re examination of consent indicates that people consent under pressure victimless  crime often does have a victim but at some level the harm is self inflicted conflict theory holds that victimless crimes are criminal only because politically powerful people  groups find them undesirable or offensive functionalist theory holds that social need not societal power underlies the labeling of victimless behaviors as criminals6 hate crime includes acts design to injure or terrorize a specific group of people based on race ethnicity etc hate crimes were first designated as such in the us during the 1990s hate crimes are the newest type of crime to be recognized hate crimes were designated so that

victimization given these three factors who is mostly likely to be a victim in our society    the poor male non white young are the mostly likely to be a victim in our society18  24 yr olds are most likely to be victims although white females  elderly people express the greatest fear of crime they have relatively low levels of victimization thus those that fear crime the most are the least likely to be victimized middle class old female white while only half of street crime is reported to police even less non street crime is reported to police murder  assault are generally planned  intended but many crimes are a spur of the moment event a profile of a criminal is also a young lower class male in that most crimes are crimes of opportunityit is very difficult to describe the typical

basic types of white collar crime1 petty white collar crime includes less serious nonviolent illegal acts by lower status individuals in an orgpetty white collar crime includes nonviolent offenses

racism external links while many believe that race is a primary profile factor of criminals this is spurious  the controlling factor is poverty  class  alienationwhat people consider deviant or criminal reflects the relative power  privilege of different categories of people it is a commonly held prejudice in us society that race  crime are related stereotypically people in the us believe that non whites are more likely to be criminal the incidence of crime is best explained by socioeconomic status gender age  not race regardless of race equal numbers of people in each income bracket are likely to be criminal poor whites are just as likely to be street criminal as any other race it is stereotypical  prejudice to see the poor as having greater rates of crime because we typically exclude non street crime people in the upper income brackets commit hidden unreported  unprosecuted crime while those in the lower classes commit approximately the same amount but are more engaged by the law the study the saints  sinners examined high school preppies  troublemakers  found that while they took part in the same amount of crime the sinners were socially viewed as more troublesome  were engaged w by the law more for many business people white collar crime is just businessracism makes the race profile of criminals appear worse than it is because a relatively small amt of racism

profiling  the types  causes of crim e link video profiling linkblank there are four major explanations of crime including classic criminology explanations of crime biological explanations of crime psychological explanations of crime  social explanations of crime i classic criminology was framed in the ideology of classic capitalism which holds a radical view of individualism people are totally responsible for their own acts social factors do not exist1 criminal behavior represents rational decisions made by free willed individuals2 critique research holds that severe punishment should deter people from criminal acts but certainty of punishment is more effective as a deterrent than severity violent crimes or crimes of passion involve little calculation they are crimes of frustration not rationality fear of disapproval by significant others rather than fear of formal sanctions is also effective in deterring crime ii biological explanations of crime validated the idea that factors other than individualist free will might shape criminals though early bio explanations were bogusearly interest in criminality focused on biological causes witness the work of lombroso sheldon  the gluecks1 lombroso held that criminals were atavistic i e evolutionary throwbackslombrosos theory of atavism held that criminals were atavistic atavistic means throw back prehuman characteristics studied skull anomalies among italian criminals  soldiers lombroso believed physiological abnormalities were more common among criminals than non criminals by the end of the 1800s social darwinism influenced criminology  all spheres of life during the 1800s  early 1900s the belief that people were born as criminals was widespread2 sheldons body type theory held that evidence of criminals atavism could be seen in their stout caveman like body typesheldons body type theory correlated body type to criminal behavior sheldon believed that the mesomorph physique caused juvenile delinquency critique  just because two things appear together does not mean one caused the other during sheldons time those w the mesomorph physique were immigrants from e europe  the mediterranean  it is likely that the disadvantage they experienced contributed to their criminality3 xyy theory holds that an extra y or male chromosome makes men more aggressive  criminalxyy theory or super male theory holds that the extra male y chromosome made criminals more violent this theory does not explain the existence of crime in society because the xyy chromosome occurs in less than 1 of criminal population4 genetic explanations hold that various genetic quals  abnormalities enhance criminality1 genetic marker explains 90 of all crime should we get rid of it will we see other markers as we unravel the genetic code if we show relationship btwn a genetic code  criminal behavior what should we do most scientists believe that no gene will cause crime but some characteristics may make one more prone to crime given the right environmental conditions an example of a genetically linked characteristic that may under the right conditions lead to a propensity toward crime is that a greater need or tolerance for excitement or danger may make one seek the thrill of crime5 other biological explanations include hormones brain damage chemical imbalances fetal alcohol  drug syndrome  morephysical differences make one susceptible to social factors genetics  biological factors are likely to make a person susceptible to criminal behavior because of social factors in the environment example brain damage  low intelligence  poverty  crime biological explanations have served political agendas we attribute many social problems to natural causes rather than politically created conditions many biological theories are being used to develop chemical control instead of than treatments for criminal  social psychological problems a frequent criticism of the biological theories of crime is that they offer a very limited explanation of crime iii psychological explanations of crimelink a psychoanalytic explanations hold that a malfunction of  or trauma to the psyche can enhance criminalitypsychoanalytic explanations of crime hold that a lack of balance between id  ego causes high instinctual drives or an egomaniac which may lead to crime the psychoanalytic explanation holds that criminals w high instinctual drives or an egomaniac kill for the thrill or for some purpose that is greater than life link b sociopaths are those who feel no guilt  therefore become criminal because they feel no remorse   or they seek the feeling of guiltsociopathic theory holds that sociopaths have no superego  therefore no guilt critique  good at explaining bizarre crimes a frequent criticism of the psychological theories of crime is that most serious crimes are committed by people who are psychologically normal psychological explanations have a low prediction rates  cannot predict recidivism or run of the mill crimes criminals do have a higher level of mental illness why criminals have a higher level of mental illness because of horrible prison conditions which are more mental than physical punishment criminals have a higher level of mental illness because of physical  mental abuse in prison including rape assault isolation psychological analysis is more useful in dealing w ordinary criminals in that reckless  dinitzs containment theory suggests that strong moral standards  positive self image can keep boys from becoming delinquent iv social explanations of crime hold that various social factors  conditions contribute to the level of crime in a societya conflict theory explanations of crime all hold that crime is a direct result of an economic system that offers little social mobility i e a chance to get aheadconflict theory holds that the laws the methods of enforcement the targets of enforcement  the harshness of enforcement all function to protect the interests of the ruling class1 the starvation explanation of crime holds that crime is caused by povertythe old economic view the starvation variation holds that crime is caused by poverty link2 the achievement explanation of crime holds that people become criminal because they did not achieve what they believe they rightly deservethe new economic view the achievement variation holds that if a person has not achieved they what believe they deserve or is fair for their level of sacrifice they are more likely to term to crime conflict theory holds that criminals are likely to be someone who tried to get ahead  failed3 the ideological explanation of crime holds that the direct causes of crime  the cjs itself are purposefully ignored by the ruling class to enhance crime  keep people focused on security rather than the root of their problem economic dominationthe ideological explanation of crime may be said to be based on the principle of divide  conquer crime is a direct result of an ideological system in support of an econ system that uses poverty  the resultant crime to keep society focused on crime rather than the dominant structure of power the ideological explanation of crimes holds that the justice system protects the interest of the ruling class4 the culture of poverty explanation holds that people develop a subculture which supports criminal behaviorthe culture of poverty explanation holds that criminal believes that �i cannot get ahead�note cultural explanations are also discussed below here the cop explanation is seen as being an economic based theory since the social system creates an economy that prevents social mobility  a welfare system based on band aids5  victimless crimes are illegal acts in which the only victims are the offendersvictimless crimes are established for social control over morality  other social relationship  are applied mostly to the lower classes victimless crimes are criminal only because politically powerful people or groups find them undesirable offensive or suit ideological control drugs prostitution homosexuality meda chesneylind a female criminologist argues that current theories in crime  deviance do not adequately reflect the experience of women conflict theorists believe the social order reflects the suppression of competing interests the definitions of deviance justify the dominance by the elites there is an absence of restrictions against elite deviance the small amount of street crime keeps the focus off of elite deviance it is easier  more acceptable for upper class people to be deviant engage in victimless crimes elite deviance is seen as eccentricity elites have the resources to make deviance seem more acceptable elites have the resources to prevent being caught or to get away with deviance b functional explanations of crime hold that weakness in social morality  ideology is a primary factor in affecting societal levels of crimesee durkheim on crime see merton on crime c subcultural explanations of crime hold that a culture of crime is based on criminal knowledge belief in the legitimacy of crime values that support crime  oppose work  mainstream values  norms that support breaking the law1 the lower class culture explanations of crime holds that because of a number of factors affecting the lower class i e frustration entitlement poverty culture etc the lower class is more likely to be criminalholds that people react to anomie shared frustration  resentment by forming subcultures that turn middle class values upside down lower class people have their own subculture just as every class has its own subculture2 differential association explanations of crime holds that deviant behavior is learned through intimate personal groupssutherlands differential association theory suggests that all deviance is learned in groups differential association means you have different associations ie relationships w others  as an explanation of crime the implication is that one associates w those w whom one can learn criminal behavior or similar behavior deviant behavior is learned through intimate personal groups lower class males develop male identities through peer group association in gangs lower class culture encourages  toughness  smartness  excitement  fate  autonomy  machismo machismo is an exaggerated sense of maleness that encourages delinquent behavior3 subculture of violence explanations of crime holds that the practice of violence becomes integrated into a culture making people more likely to be criminalsubculture of violence explanations of crime holds that lower class culture places more value on masculine honor than on human life example lower class males respond violently to trivial remarks  insults that are commonly disregarded in middle class culture4 corporate culture explanations of crime are seen in that people feel entitled to upper class benefits  feel they are above the lawcorporate culture explanations of crime include everybody does it you have to do it to make a profit i am not responsible i only follow orders i am not hurting anyonethe explanations of corporate culture as a cause of crime are similar to the lower class subculture explanations but applied to upper class labeling theory holds that the chance of engaging in deviant or criminal behavior increases when one is labeled as a deviant or criminal hirschis control theory holds that social bonds serve to both make one deviant if one bonds to deviant groups or not if one bonds to non deviant

holds that people are controlled because they have internalized the norms  rules  of societysocial control theory  sct  states that social control depends on imagining the consequences of ones behavior sct was derived from functionalist theories of crime  fits into the positivist school neo classical school  later right realism hirschi challenged sutherland  cresseys differential association theory on the impact of delinquent peers on delinquency four types of social controls include controls based ina attachment to parents  other sosb commitment to mainstream normsc involvement in socially approved activitiesd beliefs embraced by most of societyhirschi asserts that conformity arises from four types of social controls which he called attachment commitment involvement  beliefa the social control of attachment refers to attachment to parents peers or school people w strong  stable attachments to others win society are presumed to be less likely to violate societal normsb the social control of commitment refers to commitment to conventional lines of action a person who has invested time energy  resources into conforming to social norms  expectations by for example pursuing educational goals is less likely to deviate than someone who has not made such an investmentc the social control of involvement refers to involvement in conventional activities a person who is actively engaged in conventional endeavors by for example pursuing employment simply has less time  opportunity to engage in devianced the social control of belief refers to belief in a common value belief refers to a persons level of belief in the moral validity of shared social values  norms in american society certain values such as industrious conduct are espoused as norms  persons who strongly believe in the these norms are less likely to deviate from them those who question or challenge the norms have a greater propensity to behave in a deviant manner sct holds that the process of socialization  social learning builds self control  reduces the inclination to indulge in behavior recognized as antisocial the stronger ones attachment commitment involvement  beliefs in harmony w those of society the less the chance of becoming a deviant social bonds act as social controls because to maintain bonds one must follow general societal attachments commitments activities  beliefspersons will engage in delinquent behavior when their social bond to society is weakened the social controls of attachment commitment involvement  belief are constructed through direct indirect internal  need satisfaction bonds direct bonds are estbed when punishment is threatened or applied for wrongful behavior  compliance is rewarded by parents family  authority figures indirect bonds are estbed when one refrains from delinquency through the conscience or superego internal bonds are estbed when one identifies w those who influence behavior because his or her delinquent act might cause pain  disappointment to parents  others w whom he or she has close relationships needs satisfaction bonds are estbed when an individuals needs are met  there is no point in criminal activity hirschi demonstrated that delinquent peers would have no direct effect on delinquency when social bonds inhibiting delinquency were taken onto account unattached youth drifted together into delinquent groups because weak social bonds failed to prevent both association w delinquents  delinquency itself the groups that could strengthen the bonds were family school peers religious institutions etc critique sct does not examine how so many people fail to attach  sacrifice social bonds for a life of crime  deviancemany of the conclusions are intuitively convincing eg that individuals will not engage in crime if they think that this will sacrifice the affection or respect of significant others or cause them to lose employment or their autonomy if they face imprisonment sct is an advance from differential association theory in that it applies the ideas of soc control  bonding to grps beyond peers while in general people are controlled by attachment commitments activities  beliefs these social practices fail in many circumstances while social bonds are important sct does not explain by so many people fail to bond  why bonds break internal links

rousseau as the father of sociology saint simon comte tocqueville  spencer all utilized sociological concepts  some form of the scientific method but durkheim was first to make sociology a scientific discipline summary for durkheim one of the main problem for the social sciences which he answers w his theory was what creates social order during the modern era there is a problem w maintaining social order durkheim makes seventeen major points1 society  social behavior could  should be studied scientifically2 social facts are observable phenomena that allow the study of society3 s ocial

was dissolving but organic solidarity is slow to develop17 organic solidarity is not totally in effect therefore there is a great risk of anomie  social instability durkheim is a progressive functionalist i e advocated change focused on regulatory  integratory processessaint simon was the most influential social theorist on durkheims thinking durkheim built on saint simons work of sociology as a science social evolution etc durkheim is usually categorized as a functionalist because many of his ideas have been utilized by that discipline functionalism is usually considered to be conservative especially when compared to conflict theory durkheim is a progressive functionalist durkheim believed that contemporary philosophy should be constructive  organizational not critical contrary to what is taught by many sociologists durkheim was not a conservative durkheim was a progressive thinker who had a deep interest in socialism  social change durkheim is less interested in economics than marx or weber  but like marx  weber durkheim was very interested in the industrial revolution  urbanization for durkheim one of the main problem for the social sciences which he answers w his theory was what creates social order many issues that durkheim studied stem from his concern w the inevitable results of the development of modern society there are seventeen fundamental principles of durkheims theory1 society could  should be studied scientificallysociety  social behavior can be studied scientifically durkheim was first to make sociology a scientific discipline durkheim believed that society made individuals not vice versa2 social facts are observable phenomena that allow the study of societysocial facts include relationships institutions groups statistical patterns as well as more abstract concepts like culture  social structure durkheim conceived the idea that there were such things as social facts that were observable things that enabled the study of society durkheims famous 1st principle of sociology was to study social facts as thingswhen durkheim advocated study social facts as things he was advocating that social life can be analyzed as rigorously as object or events in nature3 social cohesion is the force that unites a society creating congruity consistency etc cohesion is necessary in both pre industrial  industrial society the social forces the cohesion that holds pre industrial  industrial societies together are different4 mechanical solidarity is a type of cohesion based on traditional relationshipsmechanical solidarity is the type of cohesion in pre industrial society cohesion is based on tradition culture mechanical solidarity is based on a relatively narrow division of labor which creates relatively high level of independence combined w nearly all relationships being primary5 organic solidarity is a type of cohesion based on self determinationorganic solidarity is the type of cohesion in industrial society cohesion is based on mutual interdependence organic solidarity is based on a very broad division of labor  which creates relatively high level of mutual interdependence combined w nearly all relationships being secondary durkheim considered organic solidarity to be the cement of a society much of durkheims theory was based on his conception of organic solidarity6 the division of labor is the basis of organic solidarity today in thatevery member participates in it  every member benefits from itthe division of labor is the primary type of mutual interdependence in society today durkheim elaborated on saint simons scheme of the new industrial class to develop his ideas on the division of labor the division of labor resulted in development of modern society  see below durkheim perceived the ideas behind the industrial system as possessing an inherent unity7 the collective consciousness consists of the knowledgebeliefs values  norms that we hold in commoncollective consciousness is our strongly held common morality8 the cult of the individual represents societys unprecedented high level of individualismthe cult of the individual is strongly held individual morality individualism is the opposite of collective consciousness individualism increases chance of suicide the cult of the individual was a source of societal disorganization9 anomie is a weakened or absent common moralityanomie is a condition of normlessness in society durkheim coined term anomie individuals are confronted w anomie when they are faced w insufficient moral constraints for durkheim anomie is the social condition of a weakened or absent common morality which leads to deviance crime  possibly even social chaos  revolution modern society has made old morality obsolete but new morality is in flux  thus weak or absent compared to the absolute power of the old morality people in modern era do not have a clear concept of what is  is not proper  acceptable behavior10 integration is the process of bringing new individuals  social phenomena into societysociety is becoming more integrated as it develops internalized social control integration is the degree in which collective sentiments are shared ie degree to which people feel part of social groups11 regulation is the process of controlling directing or ruling societyregulation is externalized social control regulation is the degree of external constraints on people wo regulation a person experiences anomie12 common morality consists of the beliefs values  norms that we hold in commoncommon morality decreased during the modern era there is a problem w maintaining social order disorder was viewed generally as an automatic consequence of an economic system in which every individual pursues hisher own interest unless such a system had a common morality of organic solidarity the division of labor etc see also durkheim on crime13 religion is a primary type of traditional cohesionthe source of religion is societys shared sentiments the nature of societys religions were also affected by the transition from mechanical solidarity to  traditional solidarity  organic solidarity  rational solidarity 14 durkheim opposed political socialism but believed ina greater level of cohesion or cooperation in societydurkheims studies of socialism were to be an analysis of the causes of an idea durkheim used the concept of socialism to emphasize or highlight his theoretical scheme while durkheim was not a socialist in marxist sense he like weber is having a debate w the ghost of marxone cannot say merely that durkheim opposed marxism because he accepted many basics  rejected many others durkheim especially opposed any revolutionary doctrine which he feared would only result in anarchy  moral disruption durkheim also refused to recognize the class character of society as being center of conflict in society but did recognize that equalization of classes was necessary in essence durkheim synthesized works of st simon  marx15 occupational associations are optimal institutions for achieving social reformoccupation associations oas are similar to business unions but have much more authority in the workplace  in society oas are organizations of professionals in a particular field who organize to advance their own interests  the interests of society today one of our most powerful oas is the american medical assoc ama which regulates doctors the healthcare field for the benefit of themselves the patient  society as a whole16 modern society was displacing traditional society  mechsolidarity was dissolving but organic solidarity is slow to developdurkheim viewed the development of the modern era with hope but later became disillusioned the development of modernity was especially dangerous because it broke down traditional society which was held together by mechanical solidarity durkheim believes that modern society is not fully developed which is a position which habermas now embraces1 7 organic solidarity is not totally in effect thereforethere is a great risk of anomie  social instabilitybecause of the transition from tradl soc to mod soc ie the trans from mechanical to organic solidarity  because societies change at different rates  because some societies have lost tradl soc but have not adopted mod soc values we are experiencing a crisis or breakdown at the personal  social level the crisis of the transition from tradl to mod society is experienced as anomie ie an absence of a common morality for the most part durkheim did support the development of modernity but after  the great war  his son was killed  he had great doubts that modern society could ever function as well as traditional society top emile durkheim 1858  1917 born in france resided in germany son died in the great war  known today as ww i  deeply hurt durkheim became cynical about society  died soon after durkheim emile 18581917 a pioneer social scientist emile durkheim established sociology as a separate discipline or field of study he was the first to subject the specific events of everyday life to close sociological study and to determine specific scientific methods of examination emile durkheim was born on april 15 1858 in epinal france he studied philosophy at the prestigious ecole normale superieure in paris upon graduation in 1882 he taught in secondary schools until 1887 when he was appointed to a lectureship especially founded for him at the university of bordeaux this was the first course of social science officially provided in a french university durkheims first book the division of labor in society published in 1893 focused on the problems of new technology and the mechanization of work this division of labor according to durkheim made workers both more alien to one another as their jobs were different and more dependent on one another as none any longer built the whole of a product the methods to be used to examine society in this new discipline durkheim laid out in the rules of sociological method 1895 his classic suicide 1897 examines the ties that bind individuals to the society in which they live and their breakdown suicide appeared to be more frequent in societies where individuals are less a part of the life around them as in modern industrial societies he distinguished three types of suicide in egoistic suicide the individual shuts himself off from other human beings anomic suicide comes from the belief that the world has fallen apart around one altruistic suicide springs from great loyalty to a cause in 1902 durkheim was appointed to the university of paris becoming a full professor in 1906 he taught there until his death on nov 15 1917 excerpted from comptons interactive

order link social order is not automatic it must be maintained through a number of social processes which are active each  every daythe key insight of the structural functional approach is that deviance is a necessary element of social organization especially in establishing social order durkheim believed that a major sociological question was the question of social order which considers how society might establish  maintain social stability  cohesiveness dev behavior keeps society stable by estbing boundaries the boundaries btwn normalcy  dev dev beh establishes boundaries btwn rewarded behavior  punished beh for durkheim some amt of dev is a normal part of social organization for durkheim social control can help maintain norm violating win some limits but it cannot eliminate it if dev were eliminated society would be less stable regardless of what we do in the name of social control there will always be some deviance for durkheim there is nothing abnormal about deviance in the sense that deviance is found in every society deviance performs essential social control functions for society the function of deviance broadly speaking is to highlight what is normal i e social order w what is abnormal  deviant  chaosa function of deviance is thata it affirms cultural values  normsb responding to it clarifies moral boundariesc responding to it brings people togetherd it encourages social change the kind of deviance people generate depends on the moral issues they seek to clarify in comparing durkheim w other theorists on social order there is a range of processes maintaining it including social approval force civic participation econ incentives etc in relation to the nature of social order durkheim contrasts his own view to hobbes the utilitarians st simon  comte hobbes believed that social order is result of fear of a leviathan a central power st simon  comte both advocated a hobbesean solution to problem of order in relation to the social order many social theorists w hobbesean leanings believe that because of industrial development conflicts of interest urbanization etc society is tearing at the very social fabric that holds it together for the many social theorists w hobbesean leanings concerned w maintaining the social order the solution was often state imposed social peace utilitarians such as js mill  harriet taylor were diametrically opposed to the hobbesean state utilitarians believed that central authority must be eliminated for durkheim social order  harmony resulted from the division of labor order was an automatic consequence of economic system where every individual pursues their own interests the modern era is characterized by laissez faire capitalism wherein the economy works best when left alone  will create the greatest good of the greatest numbersee also falseclass consciousness ideology interests durkheim recognized the successes  the failures of the utilitarian position the social order is based on mechanical or organic solidaritydurkheim developed the concepts of mechanical  organic solidarity to denote the social glue which held the respective traditional  modern social fabrics together see also mechanical  organic solidarity for durkheim the problem of social order occurs primarily when during the process of modernization mechanical solidarity breaks down  is not yet replaced w organic solidarity the problem of social order may also occur when a given traditional or modern society becomes so stressed that solidarity is weakened or destroyed anomie deviance  crime exist in all societies as they change at the margins  for boundary maintenance etc but they become social problems when solidarity breaks down deviance is so crucial to social order that societies lacking a given amount of it would redefine acceptable behavior to create deviance regarding deviance  dysfunctions durkheim believed that deviance beyond a certain level threatens the social order and can be dysfunctional for durkheim high levels of immigration may be a major social problem but not because of economic or job issues immigration is a major problem in our modern society because immigrants do not know the norms  laws of this country  therefore are a source of social instability the instability fostered by immigration can be functional if it is limited  the society can absorb  integrate the new culture the instability inherent in immigration can undermine the old order creating conflict instability anomie crime deviance etc internal links top outline on durkheim on crime external links project public punishment link durkheim  many functionalists hold the controversial position that crime is functional for societydurkheim viewed a limited amount of crime as functional for society however if crime became too pervasive this was a symptom of anomie  the breakdown of the social order durkheim believed that an affinity for crime was the result of social forces durkheim as he often did developed his own position in direct opposition to other prevailing ideas of his time late 1800sdurkheim directly refuted the positions that an affinity for crime was the result of something that is in individuals psychological or physiological makeup1 durkheims anomic explanation of crime holds that the breakdown of norms causes crimedurkheim developed the concept of anomie which is a condition of normlessness in society in a society win the normal range of anomie we find that there are always some people who are outside the system in a society outside of the normal range of anomie we find that people engage in more deviant behavior crime riot revolution etc anomie occurs at some normal level in society but becomes socially pathological when the social order breaks down  anomie becomes widespread creating waves of deviance crime chaos etc see also the problem of social order2 durkheims solidarity explanation of crime is that deviance exists because society must have a set of behavioral expectations that help to define the character of that societyfor durkheim  the functionalists there are positive consequences of deviance  social control deviance  crime promotes solidarity in mainstream society deviance  crime sets boundaries deviance is so crucial to social order that societies lacking it would redefine acceptable behavior to create deviance conflict theorists would note that deviance has many other positive consequences ie it is a source of innovation there are also dysfunctions of deviance in that deviance beyond a certain level threatens the social order durkheim holds that public punishment is functional because it sets boundaries  allows us to view criminals as deviants  outsiderspublic punishment is good for society public punishment is good for society not for the thrill but because it allows us to see us as good  others as bad  the experience of a communal punishment against an offender builds solidarity public punishment is functional for society because it creates an in group w a norm of obeying the law ie creates solidarity around the law public punishment is functional for society because the communal experience of punishing builds solidarity durkheims view of the purpose of punishment is not to deter or correct the offender rather it is to maintain the fundamental values of the community functionalists including durkheim argue that the use of coercive social control is legitimate because laws are enacted by representatives of the people in the interest of the people external links top outline on mertons  1910  2003 revision

segments of societymerton revised durkheims concept of anomie structural functionalism had said that social values  norms were universal in that all values  norms are functional for society merton posits that social values  norms are not necessarily universal for society in that some values  norms may be functional for one segment of society or one historical era  not functional for another merton revised durkheims concept of anomie which results when the goals of society break down ie the social order is weakened merton held that society socializes members for certain needs  desires but fails to provide legitimate opportunities  means to satisfy them then anomie  crime result it is not poverty itself that creates deviance but poverty surrounded by wealth ie the income gap mertons anomic argument is similar to the economic or achievement explanation of crime for merton the problem is not so often that society fails to provide norms  but that society socializes members for certain needs  desires but fails to provide legit opportunities to satisfy them society does not provide the means to achieve normal goals of society the strain between our cultures emphasis on wealth  the limited opportunity to get rich gives rise especially among the poor to theft the sale of drugs or other street crime see also durkheim see also durkheim on the problem of social order deviance  crime see also anomie link the table on mertons analysis of anomie demonstrates that to avoid anomie societally sanctioned goals must match societally institutionalized means for merton there are five types of lifestyles that compensate for societally sanctioned goals  institutionalized means including the conformist the innovator the ritualist the retreatist  the rebel conformists have no anomie because they accept the means  goals established by societythe conformist accepts means accepts goals the conformist is the normal personmerton believed that most of people color btwn the lines pay taxes  generally accept things as they are merton viewed a normal person as accepting societys goals  means to attain those goals conformity lies in pursuing conventional goals through approved means innovators have anomie because they reject the means but accept the goals established by societythe innovator rejects means accepts goals accepts the goals society offers but rejects the normal means for achieving those goals examples business entrepreneur do business in a new way criminal develops a newillegal was to do something artist develops new or innovative artistic style content etc

negative effects  makes them more likely to embrace that rolelabeling theory has roots in the symbolic interaction approach the symbolic interaction approach explains how people define deviance in everyday situations the central contribution of symbolic interaction analysis is labeling theory the assertion that deviance  conformity result not so much from what people do as from how others

theory deviant behavior is defined by society the core of labeling theory is relativism the contention that what is deviant in any society is the consequence of social or political processes the majority of people engage in deviant behavior or break rules but few are labeled as deviant labeling theory contends that deviants are fundamentally the same as non deviants except that they got caught  were labeled laws which supported genocide slavery prohibition the holocaust racism etc were all based on labels given to populations in society thus labeling theory has much in common w conflict theory there are two consequences of labelinga primary deviance is an initial deviant act or deviant behavior that is short term or ceases w adult statusprimary deviance refers to passing episodes of norm violation primary deviance is related to unique social cultural or psychological situations labeling theory cannot account for primary devianceb secondary deviance is deviance that results from being labeled as deviantsecondary deviance is when an individual repeatedly violates a norm  begins to take on a deviant identity secondary deviance evolves out of the offenders self concept secondary deviant behaviors that are long term  do not cease w adult status chronic deviant behavior occurs when people come to identify themselves as deviant the labels of society become self labels  thus deviant or criminal behaviors often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy when the person who sees themselves as deviant comes to frequently act deviant2 the example of the saints  the roughnecks demonstrates that the roughnecks were labeled as deviant for behaviors which the saints were not labeled as deviant the roughnecks labels resulted in a lifetime of trouble for them access to power is a significant factor in distinguishing btwn those who are labeled deviant  eventually take on deviant careers  those who avoid deviant identities clear policy implications of the labeling tradition include remove class  racial bias from the criminal justice system  make punishment more humane stigma the mark of shame or dishonor is a powerful force which encourages people to avoid it but sometimes once they are labeled they embrace ita stigma is a powerful negative social label that radically changes a persons self concept  social identity operating as a master status stigmas are often attached in formal rituals called degradation ceremonies retrospective  projective labeling occurs when people add the label that a person was always a  or will always be a stigmas are deepened by retrospective labeling the interpretation of someones past consistent w present deviance people may also engage in projective labeling labeling difference as deviance adds the power of ostracism to anyone who is differentthomas szasz argues that mentally ill is a label we attach to people who are only different  concludes that we should abandon the concept of mental illness entirely a critique of labeling theory is that some people are highly susceptible to labeling while others are notlabeling theory is most applicable to minor forms of deviance the consequences of deviant labeling may vary not everyone resists deviant labeling internal links top outline on deviant subcultures external links a deviant subculture is a subculture which exists outside of the mainstream of society  supports members in their actions  lifestylebecause a subculture is a set of people w a set of behavior beliefs ie culture which could be distinct or hidden that differentiates it from the larger culture a deviant subculture is one whose behavior beliefs culture etc distinguishes it by being outside the norm of the larger culture cloward  ohlin extended merton�s theory proposing that access to illegitimate opportunities for success is also problematic the concept of relative opportunity structure denotes that while merton noted that society does not provide adequate legitimate means for approved goals there is also a shortage of illegitimate means to achieve either approved or unapproved goals to organize  expand cultures of deviance three different types of delinquent subcultures may arise criminal subcultures conflict subcultures  retreatist subcultures cohen suggests that delinquency is most pronounced in lower class youths because they have the least opportunity to achieve conventional success miller characterizes deviant subcultures in terms of trouble toughness smartness a need for excitement a belief in fate  a desire for freedom anderson explains that in poor urban neighborhoods most people manage to conform to conventional that is decent values in applying hirschis social control theory a deviant subcultures very deviance serves to bond it securely together deviant subcultures are some the strongest subcultures knowndeviant subcultures are strong because the people in them often feel they have no alternative deviant subcultures are strong because they have high levels of commitment in that people often have a 100 commitment to the group in that divided loyalties are not allowed deviant subcultures are strong because they have high levels of involvement in that people often spend all their time win the group deviant subcultures are strong because their beliefs are similar to that of the subculture  have little or nothing in common w mainstream culture deviant subcultures are strong because of they are often attacked from outside building in group solidarity internal links top outline on conflict theory on crime external links definitions  sanctions of deviance  deviant practices all reflect power relations in societythe social conflict approach links deviance to social inequality who or what is labeled deviant depends on which categories of people hold power in a society the norms of any society generally reflect the interests of the rich  powerful power is the ability to get someone to think or act in a way that they would not otherwise have done while most people assume power is based on violence threat of violence econ pol or social control benign forms of power such as opportunity for growth exist that people do opening  willingly submit to the powerful have the resources to resist deviant labeling laws which prescribe what is deviant  what is normal may be inherently unfair giving an advantage to the powerful deviance which opposes capitalism is often severely sanctioned because it is questioning some of the primary values  social structures of societyspitzer suggests that deviant labels are chiefly applied to those who impede the operation of capitalism for many decades labor organizers were labeled as deviant  criminal w allegations of secret societies immorality communism  cult like activities white collar crime is less deviant than street crimewhite collar crime consists of crimes committed by persons of high social position in the course of their occupations white collar crime is usually controlled by civil rather than criminal law most white collar criminals are treated leniently corporate crime is generally considered to be less deviant than street crime  even white collar crimecorporate crime refers to the illegal actions of a corporation or people acting on its behalf organized crime exists because it keeps people fighting for security rather confronting the root cause of their oppressionorganized crime is a business supplying illegal goods or services a critique of conflict theory on deviance is that not all crime is a function of a reaction to capitalismconflict analysis often seems to assume that laws benefit only the rich while their argument is more that they benefit the rich more than the poor conflict theory implies that crime arises only in societies that treat their member unequally because there is a direct correlation btwn the level of inequality in a society  the amount of crime internal links top outline on the criminal justice system external links the us criminal justice system is made up of the law  order system  more including law enforcement prosecution  defense the court system the penal system the parole system  morethe criminal justice system cjs is a societys formal response to crime key elements of the cjs include due process equal justice for all a right to a jury of your peers the right to representation etc a due process our constitutional concept that all people are guaranteed equal fair  just process when accused of a crimedue process involves the idea that the cjs must operate win the bounds of law  is guided by the bill of rights anyone charged w a crime must receive fair notice of the proceedings a hearing on the charges  a judge or jury that weighs evidence impartially b police broadly speaking include all city police sheriffs private police fed law enforcement personnel etc in the us there are approximately 19000 police depts  1 million police officers depending on the criteria used to count them w part timers counted as 12the police serve as the primary point of contact btwn the population  the cjsthe police frequently refer to themselves as the thin blue line signifying how they stand btwn the law abiding  the lawless btwn order  chaos btwn peace  violence police quickly size up a situation in terms of six factors including1 how serious is the alleged crime 2 what is the victims preference w regard to making an arrest 3 is the suspect cooperative 4 have they arrested the suspect before 5 are bystanders present 6 what is the suspects race c the court system is generally divided into state  fed cts w lower level cts cts of appeals  a supreme ct as well as various specialized ctsafter arrest a court determines the guilt or innocence of the accused in practice about 90  of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargaining a legal negotiation in which the prosecution reduces a defendants charge in exchange for a guilty plea d punishment in the us generally has tried but given up on a system to reform prisoners so that today prisoners are given insufficient training to make it when they are releasedthere are 22 mm people incarcerated in the us in the mid 2000s there are four basic reasons to punisha retribution is an act of moral vengeance by which society subjects an offender to suffering comparable to that caused by the offenseb deterrence is the attempt to discourage criminality through punishment specific deterrence demonstrates to the individual offender that crime does not pay in general deterrence the punishment of one person serves as an example to othersc rehabilitation involves reforming the offender to prevent subsequent offensesd societal protection is rendering an offender incapable of further offenses temporarily through incarceration or permanently by execution a critical review of the penal system is that our system is near or above capacity  that therefore rehabilitation is unlikelypunishment deters some crime yet our society has a high rate of criminal recidivism � subsequent offenses by people convicted of crimes the death penalty has limited value as a general deterrent prisons do little to reshape attitudes or behavior in the long run e community based corrections attempts to keep convicted criminals out of prison by housing them in halfway houses or simply having them do community serviceone alternative to the traditional prison is community based corrections correctional programs operating win society at large rather than behind prison walls there are several types of community based correctiona probation is a policy of permitting a convicted offender to remain in the community under conditions imposed by a court including regular supervisionb shock probation is a policy by which a judge orders a convicted offender to prison for a short time  then suspends the remainder of the sentence in favor of probationc parole is a policy of releasing inmates from prison to serve the remainder of their sentences under supervision in the local community a critical review of community based corrections is that this only works w some types of criminalsevaluations of probation  parole are mixed the sobering truth is that the criminal justice system cannot eliminate crime the end top
