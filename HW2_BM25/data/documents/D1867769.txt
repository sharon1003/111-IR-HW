question here also check our  silkworm information page here getting started q 1 do you have silkworms available also how do i purchase silkworms a yes silkworms are almost always in stock here at our shop we commonly offer size categories in extra small small and medium we seldom have large silkworms available however if we do not have a particular size in stock it will be listed as out of stock on the website if you would like to purchase silkworms at our shop please order on this website you will find the product menu here   back to top of page q 2 what do i need to get started on a silkworm colony a you will need the silkworms food for them and someplace to house them you have the option of either purchasing the eggs or the silkworm at the larval caterpillar stage eggs can be more challenging because the newborn caterpillar is at its most delicate we offer the silkworm at different sizes from extra small to medium and occasionally larges the various sizes are at different stages of development so there is no difference other than their age for food silkworms only eat mulberry leaves you can feed them fresh leaves or our prepared mulberry food the housing part is easy any cardboard box or plastic container will do fine you will find both eggs silkworm caterpillars and mulberry food here   back to top of page q 3 how do i care for my silkworms a caring for your silkworms is very easy upon arrival place the silkworms in a larger plastic container if they are overcrowded feed your worms with either mulberry leaves or premade silkworm food sold separately  a cheese grater is the best method for distributing the food evenly but you can also break the food into smaller pieces grate some food directly onto the worms and replace the lid to prevent the food from drying out quickly if condensation develops vent the lid before feeding again take the lid off until the old food and droppings dry out if your worms are the desired feeding size upon arrival you do not need to feed them they will stay alive for a week or more depending on temp and size without food repeat this feeding procedure until the worms reach the desired size obviously the more you feed them the faster they will grow as the silkworms grow and become crowded transfer them to a larger plastic container the lid you are using needs to have ventilation holes if not you need to vent the lid so the silkworms wont suffocate and to allow condensation to dissipate you may need to separate them into more than one container depending on the number and size handle the worms with extreme care as they bruise easily most of the worms will be clinging to a layer of silk old food and droppings you do not need to separate the worms from the material they are clinging to as long as it is dry for optimal growth and health keep your worms at a temperature of 75°88° f  back to top of page q 4 how long will the silkworm food last a keep the food in the refrigerator in an airtight container wash your hands before handling and the food will last for up to a month  back to top of page q 5 how much silkworm food do i need a as a rule of thumb you will need 2 lbs of silkworm food to raise 50 silkworms from egg to cocoon however please keep in mind that the actual amount needed will vary depending on quantity wasted and raising conditions  back to top of page silkworm care  general questions q 6 my silkworms are just the right size can i stop feeding them a once the silkworm has molted a couple of times you may stop feeding them every day it is possible for them to live without food for a week or longer depending on temperature and size but its a good idea to feed them every couple days to keep them hydrated and healthy thereby extending this hold period  back to top of page q 7 are silkworms better than other pet and herp feeders a yes click here to learn 11 reasons why silkworms are an excellent critter to feed your pet click here to learn about the nutritional value of silkworms compared to other common feeders  back to top of page q 8 my silkworms arent eating or moving whats wrong a this is normal and actually means that your worms are healthy and growing a silkworms only job is to eat and grow but because their soft skins do not stretch as they grow the worms must shed their skins they will molt 3 to 4 times during growth if your worms arent eating and are sitting still especially with their heads raised in the air theyre getting ready to molt your worms will spend one or two inactive days just before molting  back to top of page q 9 my silkworms are dying what am i doing wrong a excessive condensation forming in the container after feeding is the leading cause of failure be sure old food is gone or is completely dry before feeding again if droppings are not drying out be sure to remove the old waste in order for your worms to stay healthy for many weeks youll need to keep the silkworms as dry as possible if condensation builds up during feeding vent the container lid to prevent excess humidity in order to increase air exchange instead of a lid you can also use several layers of paper towels secured around the container with a rubber band mold develops from high temperatures and high humidity if the silkworms are covered with droppings silk and old food for too long mold and bacteria may develop and kill them if mold does develop grate about 14 inch of food sold separately all over the worms with a cheese grater as the worms crawl to the top of the new food pile you can transfer them off the old food and waste and place them into a new container be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before handling the worms or their food silkworms are sensitive to bacteria if you dont properly handle them the droppings and uneaten food can become a suitable germfree mat for the worms to hold onto as long as they are completely dry and the container environment remains dry if you are feeding mulberry leaves be sure they are thoroughly washed pesticides and other residues can kill silkies also silkworms are susceptible to bruising and dying if now handled with care especially as they grow larger when handling and transferring the worms be very gentle  back to top of page q 10 can i feed the silkworms other types of plant leaves a no silkworms can only survive on mulberry leaves genus morus sometimes osage orange maclura pomifera or silkworm food  which is made from mulberry leaves your worms may eat other types of vegetation such as lettuce leaves but it will kill them  back to top of page q 11 how do

colored silk a the silkworms we offer produce white silk only some silkworms will spin yellow pale green and even pink silk cocoons its mainly genetic when silkworms were still wild they all produced yellow silk to blend in with dead leaves over the centuries sericulturists have selectively bred for whiter and whiter silk until they achieved the pure white we see today the yellow cocoon genetics are still around though silkworms can also be fed certain things to make their silk a different color but we dont recommend that since they should only be fed mulberry  back to top of page q 18
