addition of fluoride to their toothpaste and drinking water to help prevent tooth decay for better or worse fluoride is ubiquitous yet many people dont know what that stuff is a ccording to a history of fluoridation prepared by the national institute of dental  craniofacial research the understanding of fluorides role in tooth decay prevention got its start in 1901 when a young dental school graduate named frederick s mc kay decided to open a practice in colorado springs colo when he arrived mc kay was astounded to find scores of townspeople with brown stains on their teeth at the same time he later learned the mottled teeth were surprisingly resistant to decay mc kays quest to determine the cause of the staining ended three decades later with the discovery that the towns drinking water had high levels of naturally occurring fluoride subsequent research determined that water fluoride levels below 1 ppm prevent decay without the attendant staining in a trial launched in 1945 grand rapids mich became the first city to fluoridate its water 11 years later the benefits of the practice were clear and widespread fluoridation began fluoride prevents decay in two main ways it reduces the ability of bacteria in plaque to generate toothweakening acids and it helps remineralize those tooth areas where acid attack has already begun the agent doing the work is the fluoride ion the chemical compound its part of does not matter as long as the ion is available in solution perhaps because of this flexibility separate classes of compounds have evolved as fluoride sources for drinking water and for toothpaste for toothpaste the food  drug administration has blessed three decaypreventing compounds stannous fluoride sodium fluoride and sodium monofluorophosphate mfp all are derived from hydrofluoric acid which in turn is made by reacting sulfuric acid with fluorspar a calcium fluoriderich ore ozark fluorine specialties in tulsa okla makes all three compounds and in fact it claims to be the only u s company producing u s pharmacopeiagrade fluorides at all business manager philip rakita says the company sells millions of pounds of dentifrice fluoride a year to toothpaste makers worldwide the trick to making fluoride toothpastes is marrying the fluoride with a compatible abrasive for example the simplest and most obvious fluoride choice sodium fluoride isnt very soluble in the presence of calcium phosphates the abrasive used in most early toothpastes procter  gamble was the first company to find a fluorideabrasive combination that worked pairing stannous fluoride with calcium pyrophosphate it launched this formula in 1955 as crest and proceeded to dominate the fluoride toothpaste market for the next 10 years pg was on top but the next dental fluoride breakthroughmfpwas already in the works ozark had discovered the compound in 1949 and by the early 1960s was selling it to toothpaste makers overseas mfp really took off in 1967 when colgatepalmolive first launched colgate with mfp providing new competition for crest and cementing fluoridated toothpaste as the marketplace standard sodium fluoride didnt debut until 1982 when pg came out with advanced formula crest which uses a hydrated silica abrasive that doesnt hinder sodium fluoride dissociation the later rise of gel toothpastes which owe their translucence to silica also created sodium fluoride demand today rakita says sodium fluoride is probably the leading dentifrice fluoride all three are still in use though their choice determined by compatibility with other ingredients in the wide variety of toothpastes made today mfp for example is in some versions of colgate and in chesebroughpondss closeup and aim a recent survey of drugstore shelves turned up stannous fluoride only once in a colgate toothpaste with 5 potassium nitrate that treats sensitive teeth water fluoridation while serving the same decaypreventive purpose as toothpaste fluoridation uses a different set of chemicals derived from a different source the chief water fluoridation chemical is hydrofluosilicic acid hfs a phosphate fertilizer coproduct the fertilizer manufacturing process starts with the digestion of phosphate rockfluorapatite or ca 3 po 4 2 3 ca f 2 in sulfuric acid the hydrogen fluoride generated reacts with silica impurities in the rock to form silicon tetrafluoride which further combines with hydrogen fluoride to produce hfs the sodium salt of hfs sodium silicofluoride ssf is also used in water fluoridation as is a water treatment grade of sodium fluoride made directly from hydrofluoric acid according to mark looney inorganic fluorides business vice president at solvay fluorides a major marketer of hfs and ssf most u s phosphate fertilizer makers collect hfs at their plants these firms tend to be in phosphate rockrich central florida and north carolina because its a coproduct hfs is subject to the vagaries of the worlds need for fertilizer much of which is supplied by the u s the export market is slow right now looney notes but the hfs market is still in balance in contrast a severe fertilizer industry downturn in the mid1980s led to shortages of hfs and the temporary cessation of fluoridation in some municipalities however looney doesnt see that happening again one trend looney does see is a slow shift from granular ssf to easiertohandle liquid hfs watertreatmentgrade sodium fluoride made in north america only by solvay is popular with small and mediumsized water systems because dispensing systems are efficient and easy to maintain he adds although the water fluoridation business is pretty mature looney notes that opportunity still knocks los angeles began fluoridating its water supply just two years ago and eight of the countrys largest 50 cities still go without in contrast virtually every toothpaste is fluoridated so the only market spark ozarks rakita can hope for is a requestunlikely he admitsfor a new toothpaste fluoride
