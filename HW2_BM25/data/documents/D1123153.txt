learn what is a ct or cat scan a ct or cat scan is a diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of xrays and computer technology to produce both horizontal and vertical crosssectional images often called slices of the body a ct scan shows detailed images of any part of the body including the bones muscles fat organs and blood vessels ct scans are more detailed than standard xrays in standard xrays a beam of energy is aimed at the body part being studied a plate behind the body part captures the variations of the energy beam after it passes through skin bone muscle and other tissue while much information can be obtained from a regular xray a lot of detail about internal organs and other structures is not available in computed tomography the xray beam moves in a circle around the body this allows many different views of the same organ or structure and provides much greater detail the xray information is sent to a computer that interprets the xray data and displays it in twodimensional form on a monitor newer technology and computer software makes threedimensional 3d images possible ct scans may be done with or without contrast contrast refers to a substance taken by mouth or injected into an intravenous iv line that causes the particular organ or tissue under study to be seen more clearly contrast examinations may require you to fast for a certain period of time before the procedure your doctor will notify you of this prior to the procedure ct scans may be performed to help diagnose tumors investigate internal bleeding or check for other internal injuries or damage you may want to ask your doctor about the amount of radiation used during the ct procedure and the risks related to your particular situation it is a good idea to keep a record of your past history of radiation exposure such as previous ct scans and other types of xrays so that you can inform your doctor risks associated with radiation exposure may be related to the cumulative number of xray examinations andor treatments over a long period of time if you are pregnant or suspect that you may be pregnant you should notify your doctor advances in computed tomography technology include the following highresolution computed tomography this type of ct scan uses very thin slices less than onetenth of an inch which are effective in providing greater detail in certain conditions such as lung disease helical or spiral computed tomography during this type of ct scan both the patient and the xray beam move continuously with the xray beam circling the patient the images are obtained much more quickly than with standard ct scans the resulting images have greater resolution and contrast thus providing more detailed information ultrafast computed tomography also called electron beam computed tomography this type of ct scan produces images very rapidly thus creating a type of movie of moving parts of the body such as the chambers and valves of the heart this scan may be used to obtain information about calcium buildup inside the coronary arteries of the heart computed tomographic angiography cta angiography or arteriography is an xray image of the blood vessels a ct angiogram uses ct technology rather than standard xrays or fluoroscopy to obtain images of blood vessels for example the coronary arteries of the heart combined computed tomography and positron emission tomography petct the combination of computed tomography and positron emission tomography technologies into a single machine is referred to as petct petct combines the ability of ct to provide detailed anatomy with the ability of pet to show cell function and metabolism to offer greater accuracy in the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of diseases particularly cancer petct may also be used to evaluate epilepsy alzheimers disease and coronary artery disease studies show that 85 percent of the population will not experience an adverse reaction from iodinated contrast however you will need to let your doctor know if you have ever had a reaction to any contrast dye andor any kidney problems a reported seafood allergy is not considered to be a contraindication for iodinated contrast if you have any medical conditions or recent illnesses inform your doctor the effects of kidney disease and contrast agents have attracted increased attention over the last decade as patients with kidney disease are more prone to kidney damage after contrast exposure if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant you should notify your health care provider if you are claustrophobic or tend to become anxious easily tell your doctor ahead of time as he or she may prescribe a mild sedative for you before the procedure to make you more comfortable it will be necessary for you to remain still and quiet during the procedure which may last 10 to 20 minutes on average how is a ct or cat scan performed
