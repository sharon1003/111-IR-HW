health newsfact checked the future of healthcare could be in concierge medicine kurt mosley was speaking to a group of physicians when the subject of concierge medicine came up he asked one of the doctors what they charge their patients for this type of guaranteed care the doctor told him 15750 a month mosley thought that was kind of arbitrary why the extra 50 cents“how did you arrive at that number” mosley asked“well that’s how much you would spend on a pack of cigarettes a day i figure if they can afford a pack a day they can afford me for unlimited access” the doctor replied mosley is a senior vice president at merritt hawkins a physician search consulting and research firm concierge medicine is one of the topics the firm has intensively studied long thought of as a perk for the rich concierge medicine has in recent years become more appealing for patients across income brackets more important perhaps is that concierge medicine is becoming more attractive to physicians read more this is what your doctor’s office will look like in 5 years »what exactly is concierge medicine concierge medicine is a private form of practice where doctors charge patients an outofpocket retainer fee for full access to their services patient loads typically decrease when a physician switches from more traditional feeperservice practice to concierge medicine while there are a small number of physicians practicing concierge medicine today — about 5000 according to the american academy of private physicians — that number has grown in recent years in addition a survey of more than 20000 physicians by merritt hawkins on behalf of the physicians foundation found that more than 20 percent of physicians today say they’re either currently practicing concierge medicine or plan to do so in the future do you think concierge medicine is the wave of the future yes no not sure vote view results“the main attraction is really one of control a lot of physicians today feel somewhat powerless in their practice they’ve gone through years of school they feel like their fees are controlled by third parties” said phil miller a spokesman for merritt hawkins “they feel they are being judged on things that are subjective and may not feel fair”younger physicians seem more inclined to transition approximately 17 percent of physicians under the age of 45 indicated in the survey that they would switch to a direct payconcierge practice“i think that has to do with the openness to change that younger people have older doctors might find it too late in the game to change their structure” miller said “their inclination is to rather opt out in medicine than go through a complete overhaul”fewer patients is a plus one of the main upsides to concierge practice is the decrease in patients coupled with an increase in pay a concierge doctor may have 500 patients while a doctor in a traditional practice may have 2000 the doctor with the 500 patients is on retainer and has predictable revenue the physician also spends more time with the patient and gets to know them the doctor with thousands of patients may be hardpressed to form that same type of relationship and is paid only when a patient comes in“it makes financial sense for a lot of doctors and i do think it will continue to proliferate it’s a model that fits the needs of more doctors and more patients and they are finding ways to structure it so that it makes more financial sense” miller said “the perspective that it’s just for the rich will eventually evolve”average retainers vary from practice to practice but at one of the largest concierge networks membership fees range from about 1650 to 1800 a year insurance through the affordable care act aca costs an average of 307 a month or about 3600 a year for a 50yearold nonsmoker according to data analyzed by avalere health and reported by bloomberg obamacare plans and other insurance policies cover things concierge medicine memberships won’t pay for but the upfront difference in cost is attractive to a growing number of consumers one reason is that healthcare spending increased 36 percent to 29 trillion or 9255 per person in the united states in 2013 it was the fifth consecutive year that healthcare costs increased between 35 and 41 percent according to the centers for medicare  medicaid services read more you survived cancer now how do you pay your bills

healthy eating courses to grocery shopping with patients doctors also go on walks with their patients and work with them extensively on things like hypertension and diabetes wellness plans it’s also a network where the ceo touts the importance of the physicians’ own happiness and leads by example the ceo can be found at the beach catching waves whenever he can physicians in traditional practices can have between 2500 and 4000 patients mdvip physicians are capped at 600 an annual membership in mdvip ranges from 137 to 150 a month the mdvip model offers some of concierge medicine’s positives the minimum appointment time is 30 minutes compared to the average seven to eight minutes at a traditional practice it also guarantees same or nextday appointments bret jorgensen the surfing chairman and ceo of mdvip sees an alignment between concierge medicine and the aca’s message of prevention and engagement“that is exactly what mdvip does we’re trying to be an option for people to get further ahead on their health” he said he said mdvip sees results they have a 90 percent renewal rate and a 90 percent reduction in hospital readmission he adds that patients benefit from the access to the doctors including the fact they can text and email their physicians“doctors feel a lot of pressure from the current requirements i don’t say this as a negative — the doctors are terrific — but they are on a treadmill” jorgensen said in recent years there has been an uptick in awareness of concierge medicine especially among doctors“the market is more and more aware there is more awareness of this than there was two years ago five years ago” jorgensen said“more patients will embrace it as it becomes better known and as they hear from their doctors who are moving” miller said getting away from ‘sick care’jorgensen said one of the reasons concierge patients like the system is because it’s not “sick care” a concierge doctor typically has more time to work on preventative care than a traditional physician“everything in our system today — and this has changed a bit which is one of the positive developments of the aca — historically has been about sick care” jorgensen said “the driving event is that the patient feels sick and goes to the doctor the goals of the aca are very compatible with what we do”instead networks like mdvip and others have reemphasized preventative care“if you keep the patients out of the hospital or the er it saves the patients a lot of money” jorgensen said“the people that buy into this model are really trying to buy into a personalized engagement model focused on prevention” he added “the fundamental model is reducing the size of the practice to a smaller patient population and i will tell you that it works”read more ra patients
