them in hot water until they’re tender meanwhile make a sauce from tamarind paste now easily found in larger supermarkets or online the paste made from the pulp of the tamarind pod is very sour but more complex than citrus it can vary widely in its potency so be sure to taste as you go fish sauce nam pla is another important ingredient made from fermented anchovies and much like the garum of

off balance i checked and marks recipe in his book how to cook everything and the two have major differences using the book as a reference i changed this recipe to the following 12 ounces rice noodles 34 tblsps pure tamarind after cooking sauce it needs to be pressed through a sieve or 1 tblsp tamarind concentrate 2 tblsps minced garlic 1 tsp dried hot chili peppers and the rest stayed the same tasted very authentic reply 147 this is helpful christopher 2 years agomeanwhile make a sauce from tamarind paste now easily found in supermarkets i dont know in which dimension mr bittman shops but if one leaves driving distance of the five boroughs tamarind paste is rarer than unobtainium and about as easily found as kryptonite this sentence should not have passed an editor with a pulse reply 112 this is helpful margaux laskey staff editor 1 year ago after reading several of your notes weve edited the recipe to suggest a 14 tb range of tamarind paste tamarind products vary widely in their potency so this is really a dish you need to taste and season as you go start with 1 tb and add more if you desire i hope that helpsreply 53 this is helpful ellen 2 years ago there are several good thai restaurants in my area and my husband and i enjoy their pad thai this evening we tried this recipe following it exactly except we added some chicken along with the garlic frankly it was barely edible and tasted nothing like good pad thai that weve had in our local restaurants the sauce was too tart and overpowered the noodles and vegetables we will not be trying this recipe again reply 49
