normal circulation and congestive heart failure the heart is a wondrous structure which manages to continuously pump an average of 5 liters of blood per minute throughout the body through a series of complex electrical and biochemical interactions an electrical impulse generated in the sinoatrial node quickly disperses through the heart to generate a synchronized series of contractions first in the atria and then in the ventricles the left ventricle serves as the main pumping chamber of the heart forcing blood through the aortic valve into the high resistance systemic circulation providing oxygen to the entire body when left ventricular failure occurs initially the body’s demands may be met but at the cost of abnormally high filling pressures within the left ventricle ultimately left heart failure may result in an inability of the left ventricle to pump blood forward to meet the body’s demands leading to organ hypoperfusion acidosis shock and death for the sake of this course we will have to consider an idealized heart which functions as a simple muscular pump which can be exposed to various filling and emptying conditions each single beat of the heart can be described as one cardiac cycle a diagram of the cardiac cycle taken from page 30 of the textbook is reproduced here the normal cardiac cycle showing pressure relationships between the leftsided heart chambers during diastole the mitral valve mv is open so that the left atrial la and left ventricular  lv pressures are equal in late diastole la contraction causes a small rise in pressure in both the la and lv the a wave during systolic contraction the lv pressure rises when it exceeds the la pressure the mv closes contributing to the first heart sound s1 as lvpressure rises above the aortic pressure the aortic valve av opens which is a silent event as the ventricle begins to relax and its pressure falls below that of the aorta the av closes contributing to the second heart sound s2 as lv pressure falls further below that of the la the mv opens which is silent in the normal heart in addition to the a wave the la pressure curve displays two additional positive deflections the c wave represents a small rise in la pressure as the mv closes and bulges toward the atrium and the v wave is due to passive filling of the la from the pulmonary veins during systole when the mv is closed the cardiac cycle  diastole and systole the cardiac cycle consists of two major components diastole is the period of left ventricular relaxation and filling beginning with the closure of the aortic valve and ending with closure of the mitral valve the majority of ventricular filling occurs during the first phase of diastole the rapid ventricular filling phase the remainder of ventricular filling occurs at the very end of diastole at which time there is atrial contraction followed immediately by closure of the mitral valve approximately 10  25 of left ventricular filling occurs during this atrial kick phase of diastole during which the left ventricular enddiastolic pressure rises slightly in stiff or noncompliant hearts the atrial kick component of left ventricular filling is proportionately higher a major influence on how well the left ventricle fills is the compliance of the left ventricle compliance is defined as the inverse of stiffness where stiffness  d p  d v and where compliance  d v  d p ie a more compliant left ventricle will allow for a larger change in volume for any given change in pressure left ventricular compliance is described using left ventricular filling curves which plot change in volume versus change in pressure the slope of the curve reflects the myocardial stiffness at any given point during left ventricular filling note that at low filling pressures the left ventricular compliance curve is almost linear but that at higher volume and pressures it begins to curve upward more steeply note that the upper of these two curves represents a less compliant left ventricle in which a higher left ventricular enddiastolic pressure is present at a given volume load a patient may be brought from point b to point a or from d to c by giving a diuretic to decrease intravascular volume or by giving a venous vasodilator  thereby increasing the capacitance of the venous system and reducing volume entering the heart left ventricular systole occurs when the mitral valve closes and the left ventricle begins to contract first through a brief period of isovolumic contraction immediately followed by opening of the aortic valve and the main portion of systole left ventricular ejection this in turn is followed by closure of the aortic valve systole can be considered the active phase of the cardiac cycle where myocardial contractility becomes the key to left ventricular performance left ventricular systolic performance can be graphed on a frankstarling performance curve which plots left ventricular performance ie cardiac output as related to left ventricular enddiastolic pressure which in turn relates to the degree of filling which occurred during diastole a sample curve is included below cardiac output the cardiac output simply defined is the net volume ejected by the left ventricle per minute and is equal to the stroke volume times the heart rate expressed in units of liters per minute in turn the stroke volume the volume of blood ejected by the heart with each beat is determined by a number of factors as diagrammed below each of these terms is defined in the table below as taken from the textbook page 150 table 91 terms related to cardiac performance term definition preload the ventricular wall tension at the end of diastole in clinical terms it is the stretch on the ventricular fibers just prior to contraction often approximated by the enddiastolic volume or enddiastolic pressure afterload the ventricular wall tension during contraction the resistance that must be overcome in order for the ventricle to eject its contents it is often approximated by the systolic ventricular or arterial pressurelnotropic state contractility a measurement of the magnitude of contractile force at a given resting fiber length stroke volume volume of blood ejected from the ventricle in systole  enddiastolic volume  endsystolic volume ejection fraction the fraction of enddiastolic volume ejected from the ventricle per beat  stroke volume  enddiastolic volume normal range  5575cardiac output volume of blood ejected from the ventricle per minute  stroke volume x heart rate loading conditions  preload and afterload the terms preload and afterload are defined as the wall tension or wall stress during diastole and during systole respectively what does this mean in real terms wellwall tension is defined as follows wall tension  p x r2h where r  lv radius and h  wall thickness during diastole the major variable which is changing is the radius of the ventricle as it fills with blood since the radius changes in proportion to the cube root of the volume while the pressure changes little see the cardiac cycle diagram and the thickness changes little it is for this reason that clinically we relate preload to the degree of volume which is loading the ventricle during systole the major variable which is changing is the pressure again look at the cardiac cycle diagram while relatively the radius and the thickness of the ventricle are not changing as much we therefore relate afterload to the pressure which the ventricle is pumping against ie aortic pressure or the blood pressure note that any factor which lowers blood pressure will therefore lower afterload likewise any factor that lowers left ventricular enddiastolic volume will lower preload also note that a compensatory increase in left ventricular wall thickness ie left ventricular concentric hypertrophy will decrease wall tension both in systole and diastole and will therefore decrease both preload and afterload contractility during systole often thought of as the active phase of the cardiac cycle the left ventricle contracts forcefully ejecting approximately twothirds of its contents with each beat the force of contraction is determined by the contractility of the ventricle which in turn varies with the length of the individual sarcomere in general the farther each individual sarcomere is stretched the greater the force of contraction there is a limit of course to the length which each sarcomere can be stretched and there is a point beyond which no further incremental force will be generated to demonstrate the relationship between loading conditions and lv performance a curve called a frankstarling performance curve can be created by plotting left ventricular enddiastolic volume or pressure  ie preload  versus left ventricular cardiac output  lv performance the position and slope of the curve reflect the contractile state of the individual ventricle at the point in time that the curve is drawn factors that augment the contractile state of the ventricle ie adrenergic agents positive inotropes etc tend to shift the starling curve of a ventricle upwards and to the left see figure below measurement of cardiac output well the above curves sure look nice but how on earth do we obtain the values to create such a curve  ie how do we measure lvedp and how do we measure the cardiac output so far the most reliable way to do both is to place a balloontipped flexible tube called a swanganz catheter into a vein and thread it through the right side of the heart to the pulmonary artery there inflation of the balloon allows us to measure the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure which in turn reflects the left atrial pressure since the mitral valve is open during diastole the left atrial pressure equals the left ventricular diastolic pressure barring any mitral valve stenosis we have therefore indirectly been able to measure the lvedp using the same catheter we can estimate the cardiac output using either the fick principle or the thermodilution method in brief the fick principle states that the cardiac output is proportional to the patient’s oxygen consumption divided by the av o 2 difference cardiac output is proportional to o2 consumption av o2 differencewhere the av o2 difference is the difference in the blood’s oxygen saturation between where it exits the heart and where it enters the heart in essence the slower the blood travels through the body the more oxygen is extracted by the body’s tissues the greater the av o2 difference and the lower the cardiac output this is illustrated schematically below by none other than the daughter of eugene braunwald m d chairman of the dept of medicine at the brigham and women’s hospital note that oxygen consumption can be measured directly or can be estimated based on a patients age sex and body size av o2 difference is calculated by measuring blood samples from a peripheral artery oxygenated blood and from the pulmonary artery mixed venous blood which has been mixed together in the right ventricle pressure  volume loops a pressure  volume loop graphically displays the relationship between lv pressure and lv volume in a single cardiac cycle these curves can be used to graphically depict the effects of various therapies on lvedp and stroke volume the figures below illustrate how changing a single parameter ie afterload preload or contractility can change the stroke volume measured as the distance between the left and right vertical lines of the loop and thereby change the cardiac output the effect of varying preload afterload and contractility on the pressurevolume loop a when arterial pressure afterload and contractility are held constant sequential increases lines 1 2 3 in preload measured in this case as enddiastolic volume edv are associated with loops that have progressively higher stroke volumes but a constant endsystolic volume esv b when the preload edv and contractility are held constant sequential increases points 1 2 3 in arterial pressure afterload are associated with loops that have progressively lower stroke volumes and higher endsystolic volumes there is a nearly linear relationship between the afterload and esv termed the endsystolic pressurevolume relation espvr c a positive inotropic intervention shifts the endsystolic pressurevolume relation upward and leftward from espvr1 to espvr2 resulting in loop 2 which has a larger stroke volume and smaller endsystolic volume than the original loop 1 heart failure a very reasonable definition of heart failure is given in your textbook heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump blood forward at a sufficient rate to meet the metabolic demands of the body forward failure or the ability to do so only if the cardiac filling pressures are abnormally high backward failure or both given that this definition is fairly broad it follows that there are a number of different causes of heart failure in general we try to distinguish between socalled diastolic dysfunction in which the left ventricle is noncompliant resulting in impaired filling of the ventricle and systolic dysfunction even in the absence of systolic dysfunction diastolic dysfunction may result in all the signs and symptoms of backward failure due to elevation of the lvedp resulting in transudation of fluid into the interstitium of the lungs classic examples of pure diastolic dysfunction include left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to longstanding hypertension and socalled hypertrophic cardiomyopathy more commonly heart failure reflects an abnormality of lv contractile function resulting in systolic dysfunction and impaired emptying of the left ventricle with a resultant fall in cardiac output it should be noted that virtually all patients with systolic dysfunction also have some degree of diastolic dysfunction as well resulting from the decreased compliance of the dilated fibrotic or hypertrophied ventricle finally all of the signs and symptoms of heart failure can occur in the absence of true lv dysfunction of either kind as a result of mitral stenosis impaired filling of a normal ventricle or pericardial constriction impaired filling due to external pressure on the heart all the major possibilities are summarized in the diagram below which has been taken and modified from page 219 of the text virtually all of these causes will be discussed in future lectures covering valvular heart disease cardiomyopathies pericardial disease ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction compensatory mechanisms in heart failure several natural compensatory mechanisms are called into action in heart failure in an effort to counteract the effect of falling cardiac output on perfusion to vital organs these mechanisms include the frank starling mechanism in which cardiac output is increased at the expense of a rise in lvedp left ventricular enddiastolic pressure which in turn may lead to pulmonary congestion for example the patient who was originally at point a on the upper curve sustained a myocardial infarction resulting in mild lv systolic dysfunction and changing his starling curve to the middle curve below he was able to augment his forward cardiac output to its previous level by moving from point b to point c on the curve but at the expense of a significantly increased lvedp neurohumoral compensations including activation of the adrenergic nervous system and the reninangiotensin system and increased secretion of adh antidiuretic hormone all occur in the face of a reduced cardiac output in order to maintain blood pressure and thereby perfusion to vital organs and to augment cardiac output these factors result in an increase in preload by causing fluid retention and venous constriction and an increase in heart rate and contractility thereby raising cardiac output  but at the expense of an increase in myocardial oxygen demand and an increase in afterload the diagram below illustrates the effects of these neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms finally chronic compensatory mechanisms for heart failure include structural alterations in the heart muscle such as concentric left ventricular hypertrophy lvh which occurs in patients with longstanding hypertension and aortic stenosis and eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy in which the lv cavity dilates and lv mass increases as a result of chronic volume overload states such as chronic mitral regurgitation or chronic aortic regurgitation patients who sustain large myocardial infarctions may also develop postinfarction leftventricular remodeling during which the area of infarct dilates disproportionately and results in worsening systolic dysfunction as well as predisposing to lifethreatening cardiac
