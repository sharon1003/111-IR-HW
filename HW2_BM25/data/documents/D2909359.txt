four men along with their wives devised lists of 20 experiences or feelings about their kids which totaled 15 among the four couples and the story went from there in 1991 howard directed backdraft another highbudget film that featured a popular cast including kurt russell william baldwin donald sutherland scott glenn jennifer jasonleigh rebecca de mornay jason gedrick and robert de niro the film became an immediate hit for its insights into the lives of firefighters and enjoys its own attraction at universal studios in hollywood howards first boxoffice failure came in 1992 far and away starring tom cruise and nicole kidman barely broke even after it was released for worldwide distribution and howard was stunned we always scored high at test screenings he told merideth berkman in entertainment weekly then we got some bad reviews i wasnt braced for because i wanted to make the movie for so long it felt like a conclusion to the first phase of my career however the film didnt slow howards momentum by 1994 his films had grossed a total of nearly 500 million he and grazer had worked out an arrangement to privatize imagine entertainment later that year howard released his third work with michael keaton the paper which also featured robert duvall glenn close and marisa tomei apollo 13 a soaring success howards 1995 film apollo 13 starring tom hanks kevin bacon and bill paxton returned him to the top ranks of hollywood directors the bittersweet quality of jim lovells experience definitely drew me in howard explained to jeffrey ressner in time here was a guy arguably the bestequipped individual to walk on the moon and the opportunity was pulled out from under him it was devastating and we can all relate to that kind of disappointment apollo 13 received nine academy award nominations including one for best picture howards november 1996 release ransom starred mel gibson rene russo and gary sinise despite a strong cast some critics felt that the film didnt realize its potential leah rozen wrote in her review for people this is a confident piece of commercial filmmaking but when the final credits roll youll wonder if director ron howard and the screenwriters couldnt have tried a wee bit harder to give the characters as much dimension as the chase scenes owen gleiberman commented in an entertainment weekly review in ransom howard is trying for a tone of tense malevolence he doesnt appear to be fully comfortable with howard coproduced from the earth to the moon which won an emmy award for outstanding miniseries this was followed by the series sports night and felicity both of which first aired in 1998 in 1999 howard produced the innovative eddie murphy animated program the pjs he returned to directing with 1999s edtv which he also produced with grazer it featured a young man who agreed for his entire life to be televised around the clock though it bore an uncanny resemblance to the 1998 hit the truman show edtv was more of an upbeat comedy than a cynical commentary as howard described its theme to jeannie williams of usa today he might as well have been commenting on his own rich and longstanding fame he explained that the film outlined how being a celebrity is sometimes painful sometimes kind of embarrassing but it can also be thrilling and rewarding further reading entertainment weekly april 1 1994 p 22 november 15
