oldest best answer a full body wax is men and womans waxing eyebrows arms underarms cheststomach back bikini wax buttocks legs although most woman wouldnt need all these places waxed lol and men wouldnt want some of these places waxed if you are thinking about a full body was make sure you ask about the arm and leg waxing because most places here anyway in australia they charge for the upper arms to be waxed and then charge again for the lower part of the arms to be waxed and same with the legs otherwise if you dont ask you may only end up with half of your legs andor arms waxed and then be stuck like that if you dont have enough money to cover the rest of the arms and legs lol katielouise · 9 years ago1 0 comment whole body wax source shttpsshorteima8g2ideandrea · 1 year ago0 0

waxing httpsbiturlimyeuwj anonymous · 3 years ago0 0 comment stay away from the full body waxing i would suggest you stick with the basics of underarms legs and a trim in the southern regions of course the bikini wax is fairly acceptable well because it keeps things from sticking out when you wear your bikini those should be the limits of your social obligations hair has evolved in the southern regions for a few reasons first to keep things cool dry comfortable and airy in an effort to keep moisture limited the hair creates space and allows air to circulate it also wicks moisture away from the skin moisture in that area can have serious results leading to yeast infections to say the least the hair also serves as a lubricant that allows you to move with little friction and without rubbing your inside thighs and other areas raw  which again can lead to infections the hair also protects the sensitive parts from bacteria and abrasions finally the hair in that region acts as sort of a sexual attractant it absorbs and concentrates female pheromones which serves as a sachet of smells that are appealing to men its not some great odor or anything but a subtle thing that is designed specifically for attracting males i find that the removal of all this hair or even a significant amount of it causes more problems then its worth the early purposes of complete hair removal were purely hygienic when bathing was not common most of us bath daily and that is enough to keep us from that necessity anonymous · 9 years ago5 0 commentwell i dunno jack first they have to heat the vat of wax the size of the fire under it is very important for consistancy  it would take two full time employees to manage this then they have to hydrolically lift you into the vat that alone needs the very best polyfibre nylon suspension lines as they must be attached to your fingertips and toetips the only places on your body without hair they use little suction cups i hear next you are dipped this process takes about 6 minutes for the hot wax to adhere properly so make sure you train for 6 months before hand so that you can hold your breath that long of course after being dipped you have to be lowered onto the table of parchment and lie spreadeagled of course keep in mind that the grade of parchment you choose can affect the cost of your treatment after being completely sealed in the parchment your two attendants will use surgical scissors to slice the full body covering into managable swatches a team of 10 professional waxing associates then enters the facility to surround your body they have been specially trained to use both hands when gripping and peeling again keep in mind that your costs can increase if your choose the quick method and have 20 associates come to pull and peel next the associates will begin pulling depending on the level of your screams you can expect this process to take 5 to 10 minutes but dont worry these professionals will never waver as they come prepared with earplugs and have been assisted in their training by watching babies pull kitten tails for 14 hours straight the entire experience could cost anywhere from 1000 to 15000 depending on your choices as outlined above ps i want pictures jennifer · 2 years ago0 0 comment for the best answers search on this site httpsshorturlimaxb6p dude my best friend is a very hairy guy and somehow
