get a cystoscope where they look into your bladder to see whats going on i had a bunch of polyps and they stretched my urethra in the office and it helped also they can do cultures and make sure they get the right antibiotics for you this is important because obviously the problem is resistant to the antibioticsthough they work some my docs kept giving me the same dose of the same thing over and over and it didnt work my situation is different though if your urine fails to culture than you may have an infection the culture wont grow or you have another type of chronic problem personally i prefer a female urologist because they are more sympathetic and often specialize in our more complicated biology male urologists are really good with prostates but the two i went to didnt do well at all with my situation i ended up getting treatment at an er at mayo clinic when it progressed to being really really really bad love marjisometimes i think the surest sign that intelligent life exists

date joined dec 2005 total posts  1950posted 7132008 1018 am gmt 6i read an interesting page on trigger foods for interstitial cystitis and i found that avoiding some of them or cutting back did make a difference even with infections for some reasonprobably because the foods may be acidic or generally irritating heres the list i looked at i was surprised by some of the stuff

regular member date joined may 2003 total posts  56posted 7132008 901 pm gmt 6linda i have had the same problems in the past i did get some literature on trigger foods that helped i also found that advil caused the problem it took me a long time to figure that one out if you take any ibuprofen you might want to take a break from it and see if that helps although ive never heard of anyone else having that problem also my urologist told me to stay away from the usual cranberry juice remedy as it was too acidic im going to check the site suggested by cured4real too i hope some of this info
