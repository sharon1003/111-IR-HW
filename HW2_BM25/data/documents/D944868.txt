what happens to an ira with no beneficiary designation by kulas law group florida law firms profile  articles find more legal articlessearch when you establish your ira you have the opportunity to designate beneficiaries  people who will receive the funds in your account after you pass away and most married people name their spouse as beneficiary but what if you and your spouse pass away in a common accident or your spouse passes away and you don’t name a new beneficiary before you pass away when you die leaving no beneficiary for your irate account is paid to your estate there are two reasons that you don’t want this to happen first if your ira becomes part of your estate then it has to go through probate before it can pass to your heirs second having your ira pass to your estate rather than to a designated beneficiary can severely limit the benefits that your heirs get from the account here’s why decisions decisions when an ira is paid to a designated beneficiary that beneficiary can make the very wise choice to take only the required minimum distribution or rmd from the account each year this is the minimum amount that by law your beneficiary has to withdraw your beneficiary’s rmd is based on the ira’s balance and the beneficiary’s life expectancy by taking only the rmd each year – which is also known as “stretching” the ira your beneficiary saves himself income taxes associated with a traditional ira because he’s only taxed on the amount that he withdraws and he preserves the account allowing it to earn interest and grow over the years of course he always has the alternative of withdrawing more than the rmd at any given time so it’s important that you educate any beneficiary about the benefits of stretching an ira or talk to your estate planning attorney about options for ensuring that your beneficiary’s inheritance is preserved special rules for estates if your ira is left without a designated beneficiary then it’s paid to your estate when this happens irs rules dictate that the account has to be fully distributed within five years so even though your heirs ultimately share in your ira funds it’s likely that a good portion of those funds will be eaten up by income taxes plus being distributed within five years significantly limits the life expectancy of your ira cutting short its growth – and its benefit to your loved ones what to do so as the owner of an ira make sure that you designate not just a primary beneficiary but an alternate beneficiary as well and especially if you plan to leave your beneficiaries a significant inheritance using your ira talk to your estate planning attorney about options for making sure your loved ones get the maximum benefit from your account about the author robert kulas experienced estate planning attorneys port st lucie fl of the robert j kulas p a offers estate planning and business planning resources to residents of port st lucie fl copyright kulas law group more information about kulas law group disclaimer while every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this publication it is not intended to provide legal advice as individual situations will differ and should be discussed with an expert andor lawyer for specific technical or legal advice on the information provided and related topics please contact the author
