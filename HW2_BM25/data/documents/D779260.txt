inflammation 4 specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include kawasaki disease pericarditis and rheumatic fever 4 aspirin given shortly after a heart attack decreases the risk of death 4 aspirin is also used longterm to help prevent heart attacks ischaemic strokes and blood clots in people at high risk 4 it may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer particularly colorectal cancer 5 for pain or fever effects typically begin within 30 minutes 4 aspirin is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid and works similar to other nsaids but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets 4one common adverse effect is an upset stomach 4 more significant side effects include stomach ulcers stomach bleeding and worsening asthma 4 bleeding risk is greater among those who are older drink alcohol take other nsaids or are on other blood thinners 4 aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy 4 it is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of reye syndrome 4 high doses may result in ringing in the ears 4a precursor to aspirin in the form of leaves from the willow tree has been used for its health effects for at least 2400 years 6 7 in 1853 chemist charles frédéric gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time 8 for the next fifty years other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it 8 69–75 in 1897 scientists at the bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a lessirritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines 8 69–75 by 1899 bayer had named it aspirin and sold it around the world 9 aspirins popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations 10 the word aspirin was bayers brand name however their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries 10aspirin is one of the most widely used medications globally with an estimated 40000 tonnes 44000 tons 50 to 120 billion pills consumed each year 6 11 it is on the world health organizations whos list of essential medicines the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system 12 as of 2014 the wholesale cost in the developing world is 0002 to 0025 usd per dose 13 as of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the united states is less than 2500 usd 14 it is available as a generic medication 4contents  hide 1 medical use11 pain12 fever13 inflammation14 heart attacks

editaspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions including fever pain rheumatic fever and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis pericarditis and kawasaki disease 15 lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack or the risk of stroke in some circumstances 16 17 18 there is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear 19 in the united states low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10 risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy 20pain  editaspirin 325 mg  5 grains for pain uncoated aspirin tablets consisting of about 90 acetylsalicylic acid along with a minor amount of inert fillers and binders aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding 21 aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps bloating gastric distension or acute skin irritation 22 as with other nsaids combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone 23 effervescent formulations of aspirin such as alkaseltzer or blowfish 24 relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets 25 which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines 26 topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain 27headache  editaspirin either by itself or in a combined formulation effectively treats certain types of a headache but its efficacy may be questionable for others secondary headaches meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma should be promptly treated by a medical provider among primary headaches the international classification of headache disorders distinguishes between tension headache the most common migraine and cluster headache aspirin or other overthecounter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache 28aspirin especially as a component of an aspirinparacetamolcaffeine combination is considered a firstline therapy in the treatment of migraine and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan it is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning 29fever  editlike its ability to control pain aspirins ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of cox 30 although aspirins use as an antipyretic in adults is well established many medical societies and regulatory agencies including the american academy of family physicians the american academy of pediatrics and the u s food and drug administration fda strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of reyes syndrome a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection 31 32 33 because of the risk of reyes syndrome in children in 1986 the fda required labeling on all aspirincontaining medications advising against its use in children and teenagers 34inflammation  editaspirin is used as an antiinflammatory agent for both acute and longterm inflammation 35 as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 15heart attacks and strokes  editaspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction heart attack 36 one trial found that among those likely having an stsegment elevation mi aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30day death rate from 118 to 94 37 there was no difference in major bleeding but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin 37high risk  editfor people who have already had a heart attack or stroke taking aspirin daily for two years prevented 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem heart attack stroke or death but also caused nonfatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people 38 39 40lower risk  editin those with no previous history of heart disease aspirin decreases the risk of a nonfatal myocardial infarction but does not change the overall risk of death 41 one study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1667 from having a nonfatal heart attack or stroke but caused 1 in 3333 to have a nonfatal bleeding event however the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke 42aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke—for instance those without a history of these events or with preexisting disease some studies recommend aspirin on a casebycase basis 43 44 while others have suggested the risks of other events such as gastrointestinal bleeding were enough to outweigh any potential benefit and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely 45 aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease 46 47complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance 48 49 for people who are resistant aspirins efficacy is reduced 50 some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin 51after surgery  editafter percutaneous coronary interventions pcis such as the placement of a coronary artery stent a u s agency for healthcare research and quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely 52 frequently aspirin is combined with an adp receptor inhibitor such as clopidogrel prasugrel or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots this is called dual antiplatelet therapy dapt united states and european union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery u s guidelines recommend dapt for at least 12 months while eu guidelines recommend dapt for 6–12 months after a drugeluting stent placement 53 however they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after dapt is complete cancer prevention  editaspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer 54 this effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer crc 19 55 56 57 but must be taken for at least 10–20 years to see this benefit 58 it may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer 59 breast cancer and prostate cancer 60some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk 54 others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk 61 62 given this uncertainty the 2007 united states preventive services task force guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of crc in people with average risk 63 nine years later however the uspstf issued a grade b recommendation for the use of lowdose aspirin 75 to 100 mgday “for the primary prevention of cvd and crc in adults 50 to 59 years of age who have a 10 or greater 10year cvd risk are not at increased risk for bleeding have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and are willing to take lowdose aspirin daily for at least 10 years” 64other uses  editaspirin is a firstline treatment for the fever and jointpain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever the therapy often lasts for one to two weeks and is rarely indicated for longer periods after fever and pain have subsided the aspirin is no longer necessary since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease 65 66naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic but due to the limited clinical experience naproxen is recommended only as a secondline treatment 65 67along with rheumatic fever kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children 68 in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness 69lowdose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of preeclampsia 70 71 this benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy 72resistance  editfor some people aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others an effect known as aspirinresistance or insensitivity one study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men 73 and a different aggregate study of 2930 people found 28 were resistant 74 a study in 100 italian people though found of the apparent 31 aspirinresistant subjects only 5 were truly resistant and the others were noncompliant 75 another study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant but some had pseudoresistance reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption 76dosage  editcoated 325 mg 5grain aspirin tablets the 5grain aspirin the usage guidance label on a bottle of aspirin indicates that the dosage is 325 mg 5 gr adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes which vary slightly from country to country for example 300 mg in britain and 325 mg or 5 grains in the united states smaller doses are based on these standards eg 75 mg and 81 mg tablets the 81 mg 1 1⁄ 4 grain tablets are commonly called baby aspirin or babystrength because they were originally—but no longer—intended to be administered to infants and children 77 no medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75 mg and the 81 mg tablets in general for adults doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis 78 with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever 79 for the prevention of myocardial infarction mi in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease much lower doses are taken once daily 78march 2009 recommendations from the uspstf on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in mi for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage 80 the whi study said regular low dose 75 or 81 mg aspirin female users had a 25 lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14 lower risk of death from any cause 80 lowdose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events and lower aspirin doses 75 or 81 mgday may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for longterm prevention 80in children with kawasaki disease aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks 81adverse effects  editcontraindications  editaspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen 82 83 or who have salicylate intolerance 84 85 or a more generalized drug intolerance to nsaids and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or nsaidprecipitated bronchospasm owing to its effect on the stomach lining manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers mild diabetes or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin 82 86 even if none of these conditions is present the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin 82 83 people with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates 82 86 aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease 87 use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency 88 people with kidney disease hyperuricemia or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys ability to excrete uric acid thus may exacerbate these conditions aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms as this has been linked with reyes syndrome 89gastrointestinal  editentericcoated 325 mg aspirin pills aspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding 90 although some entericcoated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being gentle to the stomach in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk 90 combining aspirin with other nsaids has also been shown to further increase this risk 90 using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding 91blockade of cox1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of cox2 as part of a gastric defense 92 and that taking cox2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion 93 therefore caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any natural supplements with cox2inhibiting properties such as garlic extracts curcumin bilberry pine bark ginkgo fish oil resveratrol genistein quercetin resorcinol and others in addition to enteric coating buffering is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used bufferin for example uses magnesium oxide other preparations use calcium carbonate 94taking it with vitamin c has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining taking equal doses of vitamin c and aspirin may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone 95 96central effects  editlarge doses of salicylate a metabolite of aspirin cause temporary tinnitus ringing in the ears based on experiments in rats via the action on arachidonic acid and nmda receptors cascade 97reyes syndrome  editmain article reyes syndrome reyes syndrome a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection from 1981 through 1997 1207 cases of reyes syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the u s centers for disease control and prevention of these 93 reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of reyes syndrome most commonly with a respiratory infection chickenpox or diarrhea salicylates were detectable in 819 of children for whom test results were reported 98 after the association between reyes syndrome and aspirin was reported and safety measures to prevent it including a surgeon general s warning and changes to the labeling of aspirincontaining drugs were implemented aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the united states as did the number of reported cases of reyes syndrome a similar decline was found in the united kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued 98 the u s food and drug administration now recommends aspirin or aspirincontaining products should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever 89 and the uk national health service recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin unless it is on the advice of a doctor 99skin  editfor a small number of people taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction including hives swelling and headache the reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin resulting in an overdose aspirin and other nsaids such as ibuprofen may delay the healing of skin wounds 100 aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment 101other adverse effects  editaspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people in one study angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people however when the aspirin was taken alone it did not cause angioedema in these people the aspirin had been taken in combination with another nsaidinduced drug when angioedema appeared 102aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on mri scans of 5 to 10 mm or smaller hypointense dark holes patches 103 104 such cerebral microbleeds are important since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage binswanger disease and alzheimers disease  original research a study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage ich of 12 events per 10000 persons 105 in comparison the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10000 persons and a reduction of 39 events per 10000 persons in ischemic stroke 105 in cases where ich already has occurred aspirin use results in higher mortality with a dose of about 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich around 25 95 confidence interval 13 to 46 106aspirin and other nsaids can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis however these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state 107aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days in one study 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site diffuse but not discrete bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other nsaids in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people 108on 9 july 2015 the fda toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid aspirin is an nsaid but is not affected by the new warnings 109overdose  editmain article aspirin poisoning aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic in acute poisoning a single large dose is taken in chronic poisoning higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2 chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25 110 chronic overdose may be especially severe in children 111 toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments including activated charcoal intravenous dextrose and normal saline sodium bicarbonate and dialysis 112 the diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate the active metabolite of aspirin by automated spectrophotometric methods plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100 mgl after usual therapeutic doses 50–300 mgl in people taking high doses and 700–1400 mgl following acute overdose salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate methyl salicylate and sodium salicylate 113 114interactions  editaspirin is known to interact with other drugs for example acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs 82 83 aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from proteinbinding sites in the blood including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide warfarin methotrexate phenytoin probenecid valproic acid as well as interfering with beta oxidation an important part of valproate metabolism and other nsaids corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention 115 the pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin and it is known to compete with penicillin g for renal tubular secretion 116 aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin c 117 118  unreliable medical source 119chemical properties  editaspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates carbonates citrates or hydroxides of the alkali metals it is stable in dry air but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids in solution with alkalis the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate 120like flour mills factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building because the powderair mixture can be explosive the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit in the united states of 5 mgm 3 timeweighted average 121 in 1989 the occupational safety and health administration osha set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5 mgm 3 but this was vacated by the aflcio v osha decision in 1993 122synthesis  editthe synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride an acid derivative causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acids hydroxyl group into an ester group roh → rococh 3  this process yields aspirin and acetic acid which is considered a byproduct of this reaction small amounts of sulfuric acid and occasionally phosphoric acid are almost always used as a catalyst this method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs 123reaction mechanism formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar 124 because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions yielding salicylic and acetic acids 125physical properties  editaspirin an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid is a white crystalline weakly acidic substance with a melting point of 136 °c 277 °f 3 and a boiling point of 140 °c 284 °f 126 its acid dissociation constant  p k a is 35 at 25 °c 77 °f 127polymorphism  editpolymorphism or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph for a long time only one crystal structure for aspirin was known that aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s the elusive second polymorph was first discovered by vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005 128 and fine structural details were given by bond et al 129 a new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile the form ii is only stable at 100 k and reverts to form i at ambient temperature in the unambiguous form i two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the acidic methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds and in the newly claimed form ii each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one with respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures  citation neededmechanism of action  editmain article mechanism of action of aspirin discovery of the mechanism  editin 1971 british pharmacologist john robert vane then employed by the royal college of surgeons in london showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes 130 131 for this discovery he was awarded the 1982 nobel prize in physiology or medicine jointly with sune bergström and bengt ingemar samuelsson 132prostaglandins and thromboxanes  editaspirins ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase cox officially known as prostaglandinendoperoxide synthase ptgs enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the ptgs enzyme  suicide inhibition  this makes aspirin different from other nsaids such as diclofenac and ibuprofen  which are reversible inhibitors  lowdose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a 2 in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet 8–9 days this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack unstable angina ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack 133 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a 2 release provoked acutely with the prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected however higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition 134prostaglandins local hormones produced in the body have diverse effects including the transmission of pain information to the brain modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat and inflammation thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction cox1 and cox2 inhibition  editat least two different types of cyclooxygenases cox1 and cox2 are acted on by aspirin aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox2 cox2 normally produces prostanoids most of which are proinflammatory aspirinmodified ptgs2 produces lipoxins most of which are antiinflammatory 135  verification needed newer nsaid drugs cox2 inhibitors coxibs have been developed to inhibit only ptgs2 with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects 11however several of the new cox2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib vioxx have been withdrawn in the last decade after evidence emerged that ptgs2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke 136 137 endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express ptgs2 and by selectively inhibiting ptgs2 prostaglandin production specifically pgi2 prostacyclin is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels as ptgs1 in platelets is unaffected thus the protective anticoagulative effect of pgi2 is removed increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems since platelets have no dna they are unable to synthesize new ptgs once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme an important difference with reversible inhibitors furthermore aspirin while inhibiting the ability of cox2 to form proinflammatory products such as the prostaglandins converts this enzymes activity from a prostaglandinforming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase like enzyme aspirintreated cox2 metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirintriggered lipoxins aspirintriggered resolvins and aspirintriggered maresins these mediators possess potent antiinflammatory activity it is proposed that this aspirintriggered transition of cox2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the antiinflammatory effects of aspirin 138 139 140additional mechanisms  editaspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous and hepatic mitochondria by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix where it ionizes once again to release protons 141 aspirin buffers and transports the protons when high doses are given it may actually cause fever owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses in addition aspirin induces the formation of noradicals in the body which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation this reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection however evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection 142 more recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through nfκb 143 nfκb a transcription factor complex plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid which itself has antiinflammatory antipyretic and analgesic effects in 2012 salicylic acid was found to activate ampactivated protein kinase which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin 144 145 the acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets acetylation of cellular proteins is a wellestablished phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the posttranslational level aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to cox isoenzymes 146 147 these acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin pharmacokinetics  editacetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach the increased p h and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there as more of it is ionised owing to the formation of concretions aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion 148 149 150about 50–80 of salicylate in the blood is bound to albumin protein while the rest remains in the active ionized state protein binding is concentrationdependent saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity the volume of distribution is 01–02 lkg acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates 150as much as 80 of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters the conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide these metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid with large salicylate doses the kinetics switch from firstorder to zeroorder as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important 150salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid 75 free salicylic acid 10 salicylic phenol 10 and acyl glucuronides 5 gentisic acid  1 and 23dihydroxybenzoic acid 151 when small doses less than 250 mg in an adult are ingested all pathways proceed by firstorder kinetics with an elimination halflife of about 20 h to 45 h 152 153 when higher doses of salicylate are ingested more than 4 g the halflife becomes much longer 15 h to 30 h 154 because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated 155 renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary p h a 10 to 20fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine p h is increased from 5 to 8 the use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination 156history  editmain article history of aspirin1923 advertisement medicines made from willow and other salicylate rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient sumer as well as the ebers papyrus from ancient egypt 8 8–13 10 hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 bc and were part of the pharmacopoeia of western medicine in classical antiquity and the middle ages 10 willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever pain and inflammation in the mideighteenth century 157 by the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid the active component of willow extract 8 46–55in 1853 chemist charles frédéric gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time 8 46–48 in the second half of the nineteenth century other academic chemists established the compounds chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis in 1897 scientists at the drug and dye firm bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a lessirritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines and identified a new way to synthesize it 8 69–75 by 1899 bayer had dubbed this drug aspirin and was selling it around the world 9 27 the word aspirin was bayers brand name rather than the generic name of the drug however bayers rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries aspirins popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products 10aspirins popularity declined after the development of acetaminophenparacetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962 in the 1960s and 1970s john vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirins effects 8 226–231 while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirins efficacy as an anticlotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases 8 247–257 the initial large studies on the use of lowdose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and us federal law and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women 158 159 160aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century and remain strong in the twentyfirst with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes 8 267–269trademark  editbayer lost its trademark for aspirin in the united states in 1918 because it had failed to use the name for its own product and had for years allowed the use of aspirin by other manufacturers  161 today aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries 162 aspirin with a capital a remains a registered trademark of bayer in germany canada mexico and in over 80 other countries for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets but using different packaging and physical aspects for each 163 164compendial status  editunited states pharmacopeia 165british pharmacopoeia 166veterinary medicine  editaspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis aspirin should only be given to animals under the direct supervision of a veterinarian as adverse effects—including gastrointestinal issues—are common an aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning characterized by hemorrhaging seizures coma and even death 167cats and dogs  editdogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are 168 cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly 167 169 no clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25 mgkg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks 168 but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is 10 mgkg every 48 hours to allow for metabolization 167 170cattle and horses  editaspirin has shown some promise in the treatment of laminitis in horses

however it was too late in the autumn of 1915 to reclaim the word which had already passed into the public domain if the consuming public had once learned to know aspirin as the accepted name for the drug perhaps it is true that an extended course of education might have added to it some proprietary meaning but it would be very difficult to prove that it had been done in 17 months and in any case the plaintiff does not try to prove it  yet had it not been indifferent to the results of selling to the consumer it could have protected itself just as well at the time when consumers began to buy directly as in 1915 nothing would have been easier than to insist that the tablet makers should market the drug in small tin boxes bearing the plaintiffs name or to take over the sale just as it did later instead of this they allowed the manufacturing chemists to build up this part of the demand without regard to the trademark having made that bed they must be content to lie in it hence it appears to me that nothing happening between october 1915 and march 1917 will serve to turn the word into a trademark” cbe style manual committee huth edward j 1994 scientific style and format the cbe
