deities 1 2 3 4 less broadly atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist 5 6 in an even narrower sense atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities 1 2 7 8 atheism is contrasted with theism 9 10 which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists 10 11 12the etymological root for the word atheism originated before the 5th century bce from the ancient greek ἄθεος  atheos  meaning without god s in antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society 13 those who were forsaken by the gods or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods 14 the term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed 14 the actual term atheism emerged first in the 16th century 15 with the spread of freethought skeptical inquiry and subsequent increase in criticism of religion application of the term narrowed in scope the first individuals to identify themselves using the word atheist lived in the 18th century during the age of enlightenment 16 15 the french revolution noted for its unprecedented atheism witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason 17 the french revolution can be described as the first period where atheism became implemented politically arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of empirical evidence 18 19 the problem of evil the argument from inconsistent revelations the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified and the argument from nonbelief 18 20 proponents contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that it is the position in which everyone is born therefore they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of god but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism 21 1 however others have disagreed with the view of being born into such a position 22 although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies eg secular humanism  23 24 there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere 25since conceptions of atheism vary accurate estimations of current numbers of atheists are difficult 26 two global polls on the subject have been conducted by wingallup international their 2015 poll featured over 64000 respondents and indicated that 11 were convinced atheists whereas an earlier 2012 poll found that 13 of respondents were convinced atheists 27 28 however other researchers have advised caution with wingallup figures since other surveys which have used the same wording for decades and have a bigger sample size have consistently reached lower figures 29 an older survey by the british broadcasting corporation bbc in 2004 recorded atheists as comprising 8 of the worlds population 30 other older estimates have indicated that atheists comprise 2 of the worlds population while the irreligious add a further 12 31 according to these polls europe and east asia are the regions with the highest rates of atheism in 2015 61 of people in china reported that they were atheists 32 the figures for a 2010 eurobarometer survey in the european union eu reported that 20 of the eu population claimed not to believe in any sort of spirit god or life force 33contents  hide 1 definitions and types11 range12 implicit vs explicit13 positive vs negative14 definition

believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief sizes in the diagram are not meant to indicate relative sizes within a population writers disagree on how best to define and classify atheism 34 contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one and whether it requires a conscious explicit rejection atheism has been regarded as compatible with agnosticism 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 and has also been contrasted with it 42 43 44 a variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism range some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining atheism arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like deity and god the plurality of wildly different conceptions of god and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheisms applicability the ancient romans accused christians of being atheists for not worshiping the pagan deities gradually this view fell into disfavor as theism came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity 45with respect to the range of phenomena being rejected atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity to the existence of any spiritual supernatural or transcendental concepts such as those of buddhism hinduism jainism and taoism 46implicit vs explicit main article implicit and explicit atheism definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist this broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas as far back as 1772 baron dholbach said that all children are born atheists they have no idea of god 47 similarly george h smith 1979 suggested that the man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god this category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved but who is still unaware of those issues the fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist 48 smith coined the term implicit atheism to refer to the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it and explicit atheism to refer to the more common definition of conscious disbelief ernest nagel contradicts smiths definition of atheism as merely absence of theism acknowledging only explicit atheism as true atheism 22positive vs negative main article negative and positive atheism philosophers such as antony flew 49 and michael martin 45 have contrasted positive stronghard atheism with negative weaksoft atheism positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist negative atheism includes all other forms of nontheism according to this categorization anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist the terms weak and strong are relatively recent while the terms negative and positive atheism are of older origin having been used in slightly different ways in the philosophical literature 49 and in catholic apologetics 50 under this demarcation of atheism most agnostics qualify as negative atheists while martin for example asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism 38 many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism 51 52 which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction 51 the assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a leap of faith 53 54 common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven religious propositions deserve as much disbelief as all other unproven propositions 55 and that the unprovability of a gods existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility 56 australian philosopher j j c smart even argues that sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself even passionately as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized philosophical skepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic 57 consequently some atheist authors such as richard dawkins prefer distinguishing theist agnostic and atheist positions along a spectrum of theistic probability —the likelihood that each assigns to the statement god exists 58definition as impossible or impermanent before the 18th century the existence of god was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned this is called theistic innatism —the notion that all people believe in god from birth within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial 59there is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in god in times of crisis that atheists make deathbed conversions or that there are no atheists in foxholes  60 there have however been examples to the contrary among them examples of literal atheists in foxholes 61some atheists have doubted the very need for the term atheism in his book letter to a christian nation sam harris wrote in fact atheism is a term that should not even exist no one ever needs to identify himself as a non astrologer  or a non alchemist  we do not have words for people who doubt that elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs 62pragmatic atheism pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a pragmatic life this view is related to apatheism and practical atheism 63arguments paul henri thiry baron dholbach an 18thcentury advocate of atheism the source of mans unhappiness is his ignorance of nature the pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy which interweave themselves with his existence the consequent prejudice that warps his mind that prevents its expansion that renders him the slave of fiction appears to doom him to continual error 64epistemological arguments further information agnostic atheism and theological noncognitivism atheists have also argued that people cannot know a god or prove the existence of a god the latter is called agnosticism which takes a variety of forms in the philosophy of immanence divinity is inseparable from the world itself including a persons mind and each persons consciousness is locked in the subject according to this form of agnosticism this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence the rationalistic agnosticism of kant and the enlightenment only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle and therefore cannot be known to exist skepticism based on the ideas of hume asserts that certainty about anything is impossible so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists hume however held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as sophistry and illusion 65 the allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed it can also be regarded as an independent basic worldview 66other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or ontological including ignosticism assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as god and statements such as god is allpowerful theological noncognitivism holds that the statement god exists does not express a proposition but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless it has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism philosophers a j ayer and theodore m drange reject both categories stating that both camps accept god exists as a proposition they instead place noncognitivism in its own category 67 68metaphysical arguments further information monism and physicalism philosopher zofia zdybicka writesmetaphysical atheism  includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism the homogeneity of reality metaphysical atheism may be either a absolute — an explicit denial of gods existence associated with materialistic monism all materialistic trends both in ancient and modern times b relative — the implicit denial of god in all philosophies that while they accept the existence of an absolute conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to god transcendence a personal character or unity relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism pantheism panentheism deism 69epicurus is credited with first expounding the problem of evil david hume in his dialogues concerning natural religion 1779 cited epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions 70 is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is impotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god logical arguments further information arguments against the existence of god problem of evil and divine hiddenness some atheists hold the view that the various conceptions of gods such as the personal god of christianity are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities such atheists present deductive arguments against the existence of god which assert the incompatibility between certain traits such as perfection creatorstatus immutability omniscience omnipresence omnipotence omnibenevolence transcendence personhood a personal being nonphysicality justice and mercy 18theodicean atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to god and gods by theologians they argue that an omniscient omnipotent and omnibenevolent god is not compatible with a world where there is evil and suffering and where divine love is hidden from many people 20 a similar argument is attributed to siddhartha gautama the founder of buddhism 71reductionary accounts of religion further information evolutionary origin of religions evolutionary psychology of religion and psychology of religion philosopher ludwig feuerbach 72 and psychoanalyst sigmund freud have argued that god and other religious beliefs are human inventions created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs this is also a view of many buddhists 73 karl marx and friedrich engels influenced by the work of feuerbach argued that belief in god and religion are social functions used by those in power to oppress the working class according to mikhail bakunin the idea of god implies the abdication of human reason and justice it is the most decisive negation of human liberty and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind in theory and practice he reversed voltaire s famous aphorism that if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him writing instead that if god really existed it would be necessary to abolish him 74atheism religions and spirituality further information nontheistic religions atheism is not mutually exclusive with respect to some religious and spiritual belief systems including hinduism jainism buddhism syntheism raëlism 75 and neopagan movements 76 such as wicca 77 āstika schools in hinduism hold atheism to be a valid path to moksha but extremely difficult for the atheist can not expect any help from the divine on their journey 78 jainism believes the universe is eternal and has no need for a creator deity however tirthankaras are revered that can transcend space and time 79 and have more power than the god indra 80 secular buddhism does not advocate belief in gods early buddhism was atheistic as gautama buddha s path involved no mention of gods later conceptions of buddhism consider buddha himself a god suggest adherents can attain godhood and revere bodhisattvas 81 and eternal buddha atheism and negative theology further information atheism and negative theology apophatic theology is often assessed as being a version of atheism or agnosticism since it cannot say truly that god exists 82 the comparison is crude however for conventional atheism treats the existence of god as a predicate that can be denied “god is nonexistent” whereas negative theology denies that god has predicates 83 god or the divine is without being able to attribute qualities about what he is would be the prerequisite of positive theology in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism negative theology is a complement to not the enemy of positive theology 84atheistic philosophies further information atheist existentialism and secular humanism axiological or constructive atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a higher absolute such as humanity this form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to god marx and freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation fulldevelopment and unfettered happiness 66 one of the most common criticisms of atheism has been to the contrary that denying the existence of a god either leads to moral relativism and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation 85 or renders life meaningless and miserable 86 blaise pascal argued this view in his pensées 87french philosopher jeanpaul sartre identified himself as a representative of an  atheist existentialism  88 concerned less with denying the existence of god than with establishing that man needs  to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself not even a valid proof of the existence of god 89 sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that if god does not exist there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept and  this being is man 88 the practical consequence of this atheism was described by sartre as meaning that there are no a priori rules or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct and that humans are condemned to invent these for themselves making man absolutely responsible for everything he does 90religion and morality see also atheism and religion criticism of atheism secular ethics and secular morality association with world views and social behaviors sociologist phil zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and nonbelief and concluded that societal wellbeing is positively correlated with irreligion he found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer less developed nations particularly in africa and south america than in the richer industrialized democracies 91 92 his findings relating specifically to atheism in the us were that compared to religious people in the us atheists and secular people are less nationalistic prejudiced antisemitic racist dogmatic ethnocentric closedminded and authoritarian and in us states with the highest percentages of atheists the murder rate is lower than average in the most religious states the murder rate is higher than average 93 94irreligion buddhism is sometimes described as nontheistic because of the absence of a creator god but that can be too simplistic a view 95people who selfidentify as atheists are often assumed to be irreligious but some sects within major religions reject the existence of a personal creator deity 96 in recent years certain religious denominations have accumulated a number of openly atheistic followers such as atheistic or humanistic judaism 97 98 and christian atheists 99 100 101the strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity as such atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs for the same reason atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs ranging from the moral universalism of humanism which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans to moral nihilism which holds that morality is meaningless 102 atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of hinduism jainism and buddhism 103philosophers such as slavoj žižek 104 alain de botton 105 and alexander bard and jan söderqvist 106 have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists divine command according to platos euthyphro dilemma the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary the argument that morality must be derived from god and cannot exist without a wise creator has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate 107 108 109 moral precepts such as murder is wrong are seen as divine laws requiring a divine lawmaker and judge however many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a false analogy and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do 110 friedrich nietzsche believed in a morality independent of theistic belief and stated that morality based upon god has truth only if god is truth—it stands or falls with faith in god 111 112 113there exist normative ethical systems that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity some include virtue ethics social contract kantian ethics utilitarianism and objectivism sam harris has proposed that moral prescription ethical rule making is not just an issue to be explored by philosophy but that we can meaningfully practice a science of morality any such scientific system must nevertheless respond to the criticism embodied in the naturalistic fallacy 114philosophers susan neiman 115 and julian baggini 116 among others assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern for example that thou shalt steal is immoral even if ones religion instructs it—and that atheists therefore have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations 117 the contemporary british political philosopher martin cohen has offered the more historically telling example of biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs rather than vice versa but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers 118 cohen extends this argument in more detail in political philosophy from plato to mao where he argues that the quran played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society 119criticism of religion see also criticism of religion some prominent atheists—most recently christopher hitchens daniel dennett sam harris and richard dawkins and following such thinkers as bertrand russell robert g ingersoll voltaire and novelist josé saramago —have criticized religions citing harmful aspects of religious practices and doctrines 120karl marx the 19thcentury german political theorist and sociologist karl marx called religion the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people  he goes on to say the abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness to call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions the criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo 121 lenin said that every religious idea and every idea of god is unutterable vileness  of the most dangerous kind contagion of the most abominable kind millions of sins filthy deeds acts of violence and physical contagions  are far less dangerous than the subtle spiritual idea of god decked out in the smartest ideological constumes  122sam harris criticizes western religions reliance on divine authority as lending itself to authoritarianism and dogmatism 123 there is a correlation between religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religion when religion is held because it serves ulterior interests 124 and authoritarianism dogmatism and prejudice 125 these arguments—combined with historical events that are argued to demonstrate the dangers of religion such as the crusades inquisitions witch trials and terrorist attacks —have been used in response to claims of beneficial effects of belief in religion 126 believers counterargue that some regimes that espouse atheism such as the soviet union have also been guilty of mass murder 127 128 in response to those claims atheists such as sam harris and richard dawkins have stated that stalins atrocities were influenced not by atheism but by dogmatic marxism and that while stalin and mao happened to be atheists they did not do their deeds in the name of atheism 129 130etymology the greek word αθεοι  atheoi  as it appears in the epistle to the ephesians  212 on the early 3rdcentury papyrus 46 it is usually translated into english as  those who are without god 131in early ancient greek the adjective átheos  ἄθεος from the privative ἀ  θεός god meant godless it was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning ungodly or impious in the 5th century bce the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of severing relations with the gods or denying the gods the term ἀσεβής  asebēs then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods even if they believed in other gods modern translations of classical texts sometimes render átheos as atheistic as an abstract noun there was also ἀθεότης  atheotēs  atheism cicero transliterated the greek word into the latin átheos the term found frequent use in the debate between early christians and hellenists with each side attributing it in the pejorative sense to the other 13the term atheist from fr athée  in the sense of one who  denies the existence of god or gods 132 predates atheism in english being first found as early as 1566 133 and again in 1571 134 atheist as a label of practical godlessness was used at least as early as 1577 135 the term atheism was derived from the french athéisme 136 and appears in english about 1587 137 an earlier work from about 1534 used the term atheonism 138 139 related words emerged later deist in 1621 140 theist in 1662 141 deism in 1675 142 and theism in 1678 143 at that time deist and deism already carried their modern meaning the term theism came to be contrasted with deism karen armstrong writes that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the word atheist was still reserved exclusively for polemic  the term atheist was an insult nobody would have dreamed of calling himself an atheist 16atheism was first used to describe a selfavowed belief in late 18thcentury europe specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic abrahamic god 144 in the 20th century globalization contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities though it remains common in western society to describe atheism as simply disbelief in god 45history main article history of atheism while the earliestfound usage of the term atheism is in 16thcentury france 136 137 ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the vedic period and the classical antiquity early indic religion main article atheism in hinduism atheistic schools are found in early indian thought and have existed from the times of the historical vedic religion 145 among the six orthodox schools of hindu philosophy samkhya the oldest philosophical school of thought does not accept god and the early mimamsa also rejected the notion of god 146 the thoroughly materialistic and antitheistic philosophical cārvāka or lokāyata school that originated in india around the 6th century bce is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in india similar to the greek cyrenaic school this branch of indian philosophy is classified as heterodox due to its rejection of the authority of vedas and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of hinduism but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within hinduism 147 chatterjee and datta explain that our understanding of cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools and that it is not a living traditionthough materialism in some form or other has always been present in india and occasional references are found in the vedas the buddhistic literature the epics as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess but almost every work of the other schools states for refutation the materialistic views our knowledge of indian materialism is chiefly based on these 148other indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include classical samkhya and purva mimamsa the rejection of a personal creator god is also seen in jainism and buddhism in india 149classical antiquity in plato s apology socrates pictured was accused by meletus of not believing in the gods 150 151western atheism has its roots in presocratic greek philosophy 152 153 but atheism in the modern sense was nonexistent or extremely rare in ancient greece 154 155 153 presocratic atomists such as democritus attempted to explain the world in a purely materialistic way and interpreted religion as a human reaction to natural phenomena 150 but did not explicitly deny the gods existence 150 in the late fifth century bce the greek lyric poet diagoras of melos was sentenced to death in athens under the charge of being a godless person ἄθεος after he made fun of the eleusinian mysteries 154 155 150 but he fled the city to escape punishment 154 155 150 later writers have cited diagoras as the first atheist 156 157 but he was probably not an atheist in the modern sense of the word 155a fragment from the lost satyr play sisyphus which has been attributed to both critias and euripides claims that a clever man invented the fear of the gods in order to frighten people into behaving morally 158 155 159 155 153 this statement however originally did not mean that the gods themselves were nonexistent but rather that their powers were a hoax 153 atheistic statements have also been attributed to the philosopher prodicus philodemus reports that prodicus believed that the gods of popular belief do not exist nor do they know but primitive man out of admiration deified the fruits of the earth and virtually everything that contributed to his existence protagoras has sometimes been taken to be an atheist but rather espoused agnostic views commenting that concerning the gods i am unable to discover whether they exist or not or what they are like in form for there are many hindrances to knowledge the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life 160 154the athenian public associated socrates c 470–399 bce with the trends in presocratic philosophy towards naturalistic inquiry and the rejection of divine explanations for phenomena 150 151 aristophanes  comic play the clouds performed 423 bce portrays socrates as teaching his students that the traditional greek deities do not exist 150 151 socrates was later tried and executed under the charge of not believing in the gods of the state and instead worshipping foreign gods 150 151 socrates himself vehemently denied the charges of atheism at his trial 150 151 161 and all the surviving sources about him indicate that he was a very devout man who prayed to the rising sun and believed that the oracle at delphi spoke the word of apollo 150 euhemerus  c 300 bce published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers conquerors and founders of the past and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures 162 although not strictly an atheist euhemerus was later criticized for having spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods 163the last prayer of the christian martyrs 1883 by jeanléon gérôme one of the main reasons why early christians were sometimes persecuted was because they were deemed atheists  atheoi  since many of them denied the existence of the graecoroman gods 164 155 165 166the most important greek thinker in the development of atheism was epicurus  c 300 bce 153 drawing on the ideas of democritus and the atomists he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention see scientific determinism  167 although epicurus still maintained that the gods existed 153 167 he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs 167 the aim of the epicureans was to attain ataraxia peace of mind and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational the epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death 167 in the 3rdcentury bce the greek philosophers theodorus cyrenaicus 157 168 and strato of lampsacus 169 did not believe in the existence of gods the roman philosopher sextus empiricus held that one should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs—a form of skepticism known as pyrrhonism —that nothing was inherently evil and that ataraxia is attainable by withholding ones judgment his relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers 170the meaning of atheist changed over the course of classical antiquity 155 early christians were widely reviled as atheists because they did not believe in the existence of the graecoroman deities 164 155 165 166 during the roman empire christians were executed for their rejection of the roman gods in general and emperorworship in particular 166 171 when christianity became the state religion of rome under theodosius i in 381 heresy became a punishable offense 171early middle ages to the renaissance during the early middle ages the islamic world underwent a golden age with the associated advances in science and philosophy arab and persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists including muhammad al warraq fl 9th century ibn alrawandi 827–911 alrazi 854–925 and almaʿarri 973–1058 almaarri wrote and taught that religion itself was a fable invented by the ancients 172 and that humans were of two sorts those with brains but no religion and those with religion but no brains 173 despite being relatively prolific writers nearly none of their writing survives to the modern day most of what little remains being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by muslim apologists attempting to refute them 174 other prominent golden age scholars have been associated with rationalist thought and atheism as well although the current intellectual atmosphere in the islamic world and the scant evidence that survives from the era make this point a contentious one today in europe the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the early middle ages and middle ages see medieval inquisition  metaphysics and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion 175 there were however movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the christian god including differing views of the nature transcendence and knowability of god individuals and groups such as johannes scotus eriugena david of dinant amalric of bena and the brethren of the free spirit maintained christian viewpoints with pantheistic tendencies nicholas of cusa held to a form of fideism he called docta ignorantia learned ignorance asserting that god is beyond human categorization and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture william of ockham inspired antimetaphysical tendencies with his nominalistic limitation of human knowledge to singular objects and asserted that the divine essence could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect followers of ockham such as john of mirecourt and nicholas of autrecourt furthered this view the resulting division between faith and reason influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as john wycliffe jan hus and martin luther 175the renaissance did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry individuals such as leonardo da vinci sought experimentation as a means of explanation and opposed arguments from religious authority other critics of religion and the church during this time included niccolò machiavelli bonaventure des périers michel de montaigne and françois rabelais 170early modern period historian geoffrey blainey wrote that the reformation had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the catholic church which in turn quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new protestant churches 176deism gained influence in france prussia and england the philosopher baruch spinoza was probably the first well known semiatheist to announce himself in a christian land in the modern era according to blainey spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe in 1661 he published his short treatise on god 177criticism of christianity became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries especially in france and england where there appears to have been a religious malaise according to contemporary sources some protestant thinkers such as thomas hobbes espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences while spinoza rejected divine providence in favor of a panentheistic naturalism by the late 17th century deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as john toland who coined the term pantheist 178the first known explicit atheist was the german critic of religion matthias knutzen in his three writings of 1674 179 he was followed by two other explicit atheist writers the polish exjesuit philosopher kazimierz łyszczyński and in the 1720s by the french priest jean meslier 180 in the course of the 18th century other openly atheistic thinkers followed such as baron dholbach jacquesandré naigeon and other french materialists 181 john locke in contrast though an advocate of tolerance urged authorities not to tolerate atheism believing that the denial of gods existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos 182the philosopher david hume developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism and immanuel kant s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical arguments for the existence of god ludwig feuerbach s the essence of christianity 1841 would greatly influence philosophers such as engels marx david strauss nietzsche and max stirner he considered god to be a human invention and religious activities to be wishfulfillment for this he is considered the founding father of modern anthropology of religion blainey notes that although voltaire is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the revolution he also considered fear of god to have discouraged further disorder having said if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him 183 in reflections on the revolution in france 1790 the philosopher edmund burke denounced atheism writing of a literary cabal who had some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the christian religion this object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety  these atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own  but burke asserted man is by his constitution a religious animal and atheism is against not only our reason but our instincts and  it cannot prevail long 184baron dholbach was a prominent figure in the french enlightenment who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion the most famous of them being the system of nature 1770 but also christianity unveiled one goal of the french revolution was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the civil constitution of the clergy attempts to enforce it led to anticlerical violence and the expulsion of many clergy from france lasting until the thermidorian reaction the radical jacobins seized power in 1793 ushering in the reign of terror the jacobins were deists and introduced the cult of the supreme being as a new french state religion some atheists surrounding jacques hébert instead sought to establish a cult of reason a form of atheistic pseudoreligion with a goddess personifying reason the napoleonic era further institutionalized the secularization of french society in the latter half of the 19th century atheism rose to prominence under the influence of rationalistic and freethinking philosophers many prominent german philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion including ludwig feuerbach arthur schopenhauer max stirner karl marx and friedrich nietzsche 185george holyoake was the last person 1842 imprisoned in great britain due to atheist beliefs law notes that he may have also been the first imprisoned on such a charge stephen law states that holyoake first coined the term secularism 186 187since 1900further information marxism and religion atheism particularly in the form of practical atheism advanced in many societies in the 20th century atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other broader philosophies such as existentialism objectivism secular humanism nihilism anarchism logical positivism marxism feminism 188 and the general scientific and rationalist movement1929 cover of the ussr league of militant atheistsmagazine showing the gods of the abrahamic religions being crushed by the communist 5year plan in addition state atheism emerged in eastern europe and asia during that period particularly in the soviet union under vladimir lenin and joseph stalin and in communist china under mao zedong atheist and antireligious policies in the soviet union included numerous legislative acts the outlawing of religious instruction in the schools and the emergence of the league of militant atheists 189 190 after mao the chinese communist party remains an atheist organization and regulates but does not completely forbid the practice of religion in mainland china 191 192 193while geoffrey blainey has written that the most ruthless leaders in the second world war were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both judaism and christianity 194 richard madsen has pointed out that hitler and stalin each opened and closed churches as a matter of political expedience and stalin softened his opposition to christianity in order to improve public acceptance of his regime during the war 195 blackford and schüklenk have written that the soviet union was undeniably an atheist state and the same applies to maoist china and pol pots fanatical khmer rouge regime in cambodia in the 1970s that does not however show that the atrocities committed by these totalitarian dictatorships were the result of atheist beliefs carried out in the name of atheism or caused primarily by the atheistic aspects of the relevant forms of communism 196the british philosopher bertrand russell logical positivism and scientism paved the way for neopositivism analytical philosophy structuralism and naturalism neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism proponents such as bertrand russell emphatically rejected belief in god in his early work ludwig wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse a j ayer asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements citing his adherence to the empirical sciences relatedly the applied structuralism of lévistrauss sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning j n findlay and j j c smart argued that the existence of god is not logically necessary naturalists and materialistic monists such as john dewey considered the natural world to be the basis of everything denying the existence of god or immortality 57 197other developments other leaders like periyar e v ramasamy a prominent atheist leader of india fought against hinduism and brahmins for discriminating and dividing people in the name of caste and religion 198 this was highlighted in 1956 when he arranged for the erection of a statue depicting a hindu god in a humble representation and made antitheistic statements 199atheist vashti mc collum was the plaintiff in a landmark 1948 supreme court case that struck down religious education in us public

gaylor and her daughter annie laurie gaylor in 1976 in the united states and incorporated nationally in 1978 it promotes the separation of church and state 204 205since the fall of the berlin wall the number of actively antireligious regimes has reduced considerably in 2006 timothy shah of the pew forum noted a worldwide trend across all major religious groups in which godbased and faithbased movements in general are experiencing increasing confidence and influence visàvis secular movements and ideologies 206 however gregory s paul and phil zuckerman consider this a myth and suggest that the actual situation is much more complex and nuanced 207a 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths nonbelievers scored better on questions about tenets central to protestant and catholic faiths only mormon and jewish faithful scored as well as atheists and agnostics 208in 2012 the first women in secularism conference was held in arlington virginia 209 secular woman was organized in 2012 as a national organization focused on nonreligious women 210 the atheist feminist movement has also become increasingly focused on fighting sexism and sexual harassment within the atheist movement itself 211 in august 2012 jennifer mc creight the organizer of boobquake founded a movement within atheism known as atheism plus or a that applies skepticism to everything including social issues like sexism racism politics poverty and crime 212 213 214in 2013 the first atheist monument on

evolutionary psychologist nigel barber atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure particularly in the social democracies of europe as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy by contrast in underdeveloped countries there are virtually no atheists 243in a 2008 study researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in europe and the united states in a sample of 137 countries the correlation between national iq and disbelief in god was found to be 060 244 evolutionary psychologist nigel barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social environmental and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well he doubts that religion causes stupidity noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex 245in a 2017 study it was shown that compared to religious individuals atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors such as age education and country of origin 246attitudes toward atheism see also discrimination against atheists statistically atheists are held in poor regard across the globe nonatheists and

harvey van a agnosticism and atheism in flynn 2007 p 35 the terms atheism and agnosticism lend themselves to two different definitions the first takes the privative a both before the greek theos divinity and gnosis to know to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter the second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who because the existence of gods is unknowable suspends judgment regarding them  the first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives either one believes in the gods or one does not consequently there is no third alternative as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim insofar as they lack belief they are really atheists moreover since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief the proponents of the second definition by contrast regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists

of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a god a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in god for the following reasons   for an anthropomorphic god the atheist rejects belief in god because it is false or probably false that there is a god for a nonanthropomorphic god  because the concept of such a god is either meaningless unintelligible contradictory incomprehensible or incoherent for the god portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers  because the concept of god in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—eg god is just another name for love or  a symbolic term for moral ideals  edwards 2005 on our definition an atheist is a person who rejects belief in god regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that god exists expresses a false proposition people frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition it is common among contemporary philosophers and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless sometimes too a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion  rowe 1998 as commonly understood atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of god so an atheist is someone who disbelieves in god whereas a theist is someone who believes in god another meaning of atheism is simply nonbelief in the existence of god rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of god  an atheist in the broader sense of the term is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity not just the god of traditional western theology  j j c smart
