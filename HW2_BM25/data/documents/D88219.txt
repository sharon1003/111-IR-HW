create a free account maybe later sort accuracy refers to the correctness of the mean value how close it is to the true population value it is comparable to validity validity the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure all tests are designed to measure something hopefully something specific if the test does indeed measure what it is intended to measure then we can say that the test is reliability refers to the accuracy consistency  stability of test scores across situations 1 testretest cronbachs alpha 2 interrater cronbachs alpha it is generally used as a measure of internal consistency or reliability of a psychometric instrument generally alpha coefficient ranges in value from 0 to 1 some professionals insist on a reliability score of 070 or higher in order to use a psychometric instrument precision the degree to which a calculated central value eg mean varies with repeated sampling narrower the variation the more precise the value is said to be it is comparable to reliability construct validity extent to which performance on a test fits into a theoretical schema about the attribute the test attempts to measure predictive validity whether test result accurately predicts some external criterion the relationship between test scores and later performance on a knowledge skill or ability sats are said to have predictive validity that is there is a relationship between scores on the sat and an individuals performance in college the higher the predictive validity the more useful the test incremental validity what the test adds to the predictive validity already provided by other measures how better than scales already available criterion related validity tests correlation with a similar measure if the related measure concurrent validity if a similar measure is administered at the same time the degree of association is termed concurrent validity convergent validity agreement between instruments that measure same construct correlate with similar scales availabl discriminant validity disagreement between two scales measuring different constructs differentiates from unrelated theoretical concepts experimental validity refers to sensitivity to change show difference in results when an intervention is carried out to modify the measured domain construct validity refers to the ability of a measurement tool eg a survey test etc to actually measure the psychological concept being studied in other words does it properly measure what its supposed to measure for example if we want to know our height we would use a tape measure and not a bathroom scale because all height measurements are expressed in inches and not in pounds internal validity occurs when a researcher controls all extraneous variables and the only variable influencing the results of a study is the one being manipulated by the researcher this means that the variable the researcher intended to study is indeed the one affecting the results and not some other unwanted variables take a look at the definition for confound there are several threats to internal validity including history maturation of participants testing instrument decay and statistical regression external validity this refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized or extended to others for example if a study on a drug is only conducted on white middle aged overweight women with diabetes can the results of the study be generalized to the rest of the population are the results only valid to the population studied researchers go to great lengths to select a group of people for the study a sample that is representative enough that the results can be extended to lots of people splithalf reliability a measure of consistency where a test is split in two and the scores for each half of the test is compared with one another if the test is consistent it leads the experimenter to believe that it is most likely measuring the same thing this is not to be confused with validity where the experimenter is interested if the test measures what it is supposed to measure a test that is consistent most likely is measuring something the experimenter just does not know what that something is this is why it is said that reliability sets the ceiling of validity ecological validity it is the degree to which the behaviors observed and recordied in a study reflect the behaviors that actually occur in natural settings in addition ecological validity is associated with generalizability essentially this is the extent to which findings from a study can be generalized or extended to the real world in virtually all studies there is a tradeoff between experimental control and ecological validity the more control psychologists exert in a study typically the less ecological validity and thus the less they may be able to generalize for example when we take people out of their natural environment and study them in the lab we are exerting some control over them and as a result possibly limiting how much we can generalize the findings to all people in natural settings face validity this is a very basic form of validity in which you determine if a measure appears on the face of it to measure what it is supposed to measure in other words does the measure appear to measure what it is supposed to measure for example if you were going to measure anxiety does your measure appear to actually measure anxiety if so it has face validity obviously this is not a test you should use to determine if a measure should be used but more of a first step in determining validity is a property of a test intended to measure something it is the validity of a test at face value criterion validity instrumental validity reflects the use of a criterion  a wellestablished measurement procedure  to create a new measurement procedure to measure the construct you are interested in the criterion and the new measurement procedure must be theoretically related uses concurrent  predictive validity content validity also known as logical validity refers to the extent to which a measure represents all facets of a given social construct advertisement
