new discussion graduate school admissions 101molliebatmit super moderator posts 12374super moderator05242007 at 504 am edited november 2013 in graduate school from molliebatmit biomedical sciences there are lots of different kinds of graduate programs because each graduate program at a university admits students independently we cant help you if you dont specify your field history ir english clinical psych mechanical engineering molecular biology and the degree for which you want to apply masters ph d mph and if you cant specify your field and the degree you want you really have no business thinking about going to graduate school grad school isnt something you have to do and you should be very comfortable with studying in a pretty specific area for several years also note if you are interested in medical school business school or law school this is not the forum for you those are professional schools and this is the grad school board graduate schools are looking for future scholars in your field not wellrounded students very broadly speaking graduate schools care a lot about your letters of recommendation and your statement of purpose  the essay you write about why you want to attend graduate school in a particular field and what your qualifications are in some fields admissions committees care about things like undergraduate research writing samples your work or internship history or an inperson interview graduate schools generally do not care about extracurricular activities whatsoever unless theyre directly related to the field you want to study  often theres not even a place to write about extracurriculars on the application graduate school admissions are not usually as numbersbased as undergraduate admissions we cant tell you the magic gpa or gre score that will help you get into the program of your dreams and actually that datas not even generally available on the web  very few programs publish their average gpas or average gre scores thats because those numbers arent usually used as major determinants of your status a bad gpagre score will probably hurt you but a good one definitely wont secure you a spot you should try to do your best in college and get a good gpa and good gre scores but theres probably no number thats going to absolutely keep you out of every program keep in touch with professors at your school whom you trust and respect since graduate school admissions is so fieldspecific youll get the best advice from professors in your field and you need to cultivate relationships with them anyway to get good letters of recommendation right before you apply to a set of programs run your list by a trusted professor friend does heshe think youre aiming too high or too low would heshe suggest any hidden gems that might fit your research interests your professors will have a better idea of your chances than anyone on the internet and as a bonus they often have connections with professors at other schools in your field you dont need to have all the answers early enjoy college you should be thinking about whether or not youd want to attend graduate school in your junior year the summer after your junior year is a good time to line up recommenders pick programs and study for and take the gre although you can take the gre in the fall of your senior year if its easier you can even take time off after college and do something else for a few years before going back to graduate school  it wont hurt your chances as an applicant and may even help in some cases you dont need to start thinking about graduate school in your freshman year of college from uclari east asian studiesget out and do spend more time in undergrad doing than worrying if you go out and do a bunch of interesting stuff get involved with a professor on a project and maybe demonstrate some leadership abilities you will be a much more interesting candidate than the 40gpabutnosocialskillstypes professors have to live with you for 4xyears and they usually dont want someone who doesnt do anything but study and regurgitate graduate school is at least at the ph d level about original research and producing something new even most ma programs are going to look for research potential seriously a 37 with tons of extra stuff on the side is much better than a 40 with nothing else consider the payoff not all graduate degrees are made equal an ma in ir financed completely with loans may not actually offer you any sort of financial benefit in the long run always consider the payoff if you plan on working in nonprofit after you graduate where do you think the money to pay off that 60100k in loans is going to come from you dont need to have all the answers late either if you dont know what you want to do dont go to grad school thats a catastrophically bad idea a couple of years in the workforce will not only make you a better candidate it will tell you why you want that ma ph d or whatever waiting is usually a good idea from william c classics study the websites of the programs youre interested in virtually everything you need to know will be there or at the universitys grad school pages if you still have questions just call them up and because every school is a little different you want to do that for every program you apply to realign your ideas about prestige for most fields there are few if any reliable rankings and the big name undergraduate institutions will not necessarily have the best ph d programs in your field here again your professors will be the best source of information for you remember most of us are students too  we dont yet have the perspective and experience of even a brand new assistant professor from apple linguist linguistics make real contact with individuals in the departments you apply to these are the people that will be part of the admission decision making process communicate your interests clearly and try to arrange a campus visit meet face to face with the professors that you would like to work with make sure to look at the department website thoroughly because in my experience profs will just refer you to the website if its a faq grades are not everything when it comes to grad school if you are particularly worried about it it may behoove you to do things that would complement your cv and help to draw attention away from your grades for example you might consider getting some work experience after you graduate that way though your grades may not be the best in the bunch it could still benefit you to have that experience admissions people like work experience especially relevant we from professor x director of graduate studies in an anonymous historyish fieldmoney matters at the ph d level there are assistantships and fellowships assistantships are awarded by the department in which a student will be studying and are usually either research assistantships teaching assistantships or graduate assistantships ras usually carry full tuition remission as well as a stipend and require in return serving as a research assistant to a professor in ones department tas also usually carry full tuition remission and a stipend and require in return serving as a teaching assistant in ones department gas also usually carry full tuition remission and a stipend and can require many different sorts of service generally with an inflexible expectation of a certain number of hours a week often 20 examples of graduate assistantships are tutoring in the writing center serving as a resident assistant in undergraduate campus housing serving as a trainer in the rec center working in the library in some specified capacity etc students who do not receive departmental assistantships can and do often apply for gas of various sorts so they do not have to fund their own studies fellowships are a cut above assistantships unlike assistantships they are not awarded by the department but by the university departments must nominate their strongest candidates fellowships always carry full tuition remission and often require absolutely no service some require only one year of service out of the three to five years for which they are awarded this service is usually performed as a teaching or research assistant because fellowships are universitywide awards competition is stiffer gres are often a central factor in the fellowship committees decision making because there are few truly interdisciplinary measures by which to rank candidates from desp seek ph d historyits all about your advisor fit is important your advisor is going to be the one to get you those jobs after dissertation by writing recs and helping you network the best scholarly work on your topic may be coming from a person at an institution ranked well below the top 10 or 20 however academics understand this and they will respect you coming from that advisor as opposed to a program that doesnt fit your interests as well they will wonder why did he go there there are so many distinctions when it comes to your ph d work  take a history ph d for example is it european african southern if its asian is it east asia southeast asia say its east asia china korea japan what about time period  ancient medieval early modern modern what type of history  social religious political maybe its a comparative field  poverty race relations economic develpment what about history of science the permutations are rather endless an advisor thats doing work close to what you want to do can advise you better making your dissertation better and giving you better recs for job hunting yes fit matters  a lot post edited by molliebatmit on november 2013reply
