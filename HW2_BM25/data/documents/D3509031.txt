social and personality development in childhood by ross thompson university of california davis childhood social and personality development emerges through the interaction of social influences biological maturation and the child’s representations of the social world and the self this interaction is illustrated in a discussion of the influence of significant relationships the development of social understanding the growth of personality and the development of social and emotional competence in childhood attachment conscience emotional development parenting peer temperament theory of mind learning objectives provide specific examples of how the interaction of social experience biological maturation and the child’s representations of experience and the self provide the basis for growth in social and personality development describe the significant contributions of parent–child and peer relationships to the development of social skills and personality in childhood explain how achievements in social understanding occur in childhood moreover do scientists believe that infants and young children are egocentric describe the association of temperament with personality development explain what is “social and emotional competence“ and provide some examples of how it develops in childhood introduction“how have i become the kind of person i am today” every adult ponders this question from time to time the answers that readily come to mind include the influences of parents peers temperament a moral compass a strong sense of self and sometimes critical life experiences such as parental divorce social and personality development encompasses these and many other influences on the growth of the person in addition it addresses questions that are at the heart of understanding how we develop as unique people how much are we products of nature or nurture how enduring are the influences of early experiences the study of social and personality development offers perspective on these and other issues often by showing how complex and multifaceted are the influences on developing children and thus the intricate processes that have made you the person you are today  thompson 2006a  humans are inherently social creatures mostly we work play and live together in groups image the daring librarian httpsgoogllm a2p s cc byncsa 20 httpsgoogltoc0zfunderstanding social and personality development requires looking at children from three perspectives that interact to shape development the first is the social context in which each child lives especially the relationships that provide security guidance and knowledge the second is biological maturation that supports developing social and emotional competencies and underlies temperamental individuality the third is children’s developing representations of themselves and the social world social and personality development is best understood as the continuous interaction between these social biological and representational aspects of psychological development relationships this interaction can be observed in the development of the earliest relationships between infants and their parents in the first year virtually all infants living in normal circumstances develop strong emotional attachments to those who care for them psychologists believe that the development of these attachments is as biologically natural as learning to walk and not simply a byproduct of the parents’ provision of food or warmth rather attachments have evolved in humans because they promote children’s motivation to stay close to those who care for them and as a consequence to benefit from the learning security guidance warmth and affirmation that close relationships provide  cassidy 2008  one of the first and most important relationships is between mothers and infants the quality of this relationship has an effect on later psychological and social development image premnath thirumalaisamy httpsgoogl66brof cc bync 20 httpsgooglfilc2ealthough nearly all infants develop emotional attachments to their caregiversparents relatives nannies their sense of security in those attachments varies infants become securely attached when their parents respond sensitively to them reinforcing the infants’ confidence that their parents will provide support when needed infants become insecurely attached when care is inconsistent or neglectful these infants tend to respond avoidantly resistantly or in a disorganized manner  belsky  pasco fearon 2008  such insecure attachments are not necessarily the result of deliberately bad parenting but are often a byproduct of circumstances for example an overworked single mother may find herself overstressed and fatigued at the end of the day making fullyinvolved childcare very difficult in other cases some parents are simply poorly emotionally equipped to take on the responsibility of caring for a child the different behaviors of securely and insecurelyattached infants can be observed especially when the infant needs the caregiver’s support to assess the nature of attachment researchers use a standard laboratory procedure called the “strange situation” which involves brief separations from the caregiver eg mother  solomon  george 2008  in the strange situation the caregiver is instructed to leave the child to play alone in a room for a short time then return and greet the child while researchers observe the child’s response depending on the child’s level of attachment he or she may reject the parent cling to the parent or simply welcome the parent—or in some instances react with an agitated combination of responses infants can be securely or insecurely attached with mothers fathers and other regular caregivers and they can differ in their security with different people the security of attachment is an important cornerstone of social and personality development because infants and young children who are securely attached have been found to develop stronger friendships with peers more advanced emotional understanding and early conscience development and more positive selfconcepts compared with insecurely attached children  thompson 2008  this is consistent with attachment theory’s premise that experiences of care resulting in secure or insecure attachments shape young children’s developing concepts of the self as well as what people are like and how to interact with them as children mature parentchild relationships naturally change preschool and gradeschool children are more capable have their own preferences and sometimes refuse or seek to compromise with parental expectations this can lead to greater parentchild conflict and how conflict is managed by parents further shapes the quality of parentchild relationships in general children develop greater competence and selfconfidence when parents have high but reasonable expectations for children’s behavior communicate well with them are warm and responsive and use reasoning rather than coercion as preferred responses to children’s misbehavior this kind of parenting style has been described as authoritative  baumrind 2013  authoritative parents are supportive and show interest in their kids’ activities but are not overbearing and allow them to make constructive mistakes by contrast some lessconstructive parentchild relationships result from authoritarian uninvolved or permissive parenting styles see table 1 table 1 comparison of four parenting styles parental roles in relation to their children change in other ways too parents increasingly become mediators or gatekeepers of their children’s involvement with peers and activities outside the family their communication and practice of values contributes to children’s academic achievement moral development and activity preferences as children reach adolescence the parentchild relationship increasingly becomes one of “coregulation” in which both the parent s and the child recognizes the child’s growing competence and autonomy and together they rebalance authority relations we often see evidence of this as parents start accommodating their teenage kids’ sense of independence by allowing them to get cars jobs attend parties and stay out later family relationships are significantly affected by conditions outside the home for instance the family stress model describes how financial difficulties are associated with parents’ depressed moods which in turn lead to marital problems and poor parenting that contributes to poorer child adjustment  conger conger  martin 2010  within the home parental marital difficulty or divorce affects more than half the children growing up today in the united states divorce is typically associated with economic stresses for children and parents the renegotiation of parentchild relationships with one parent typically as primary custodian and the other assuming a visiting relationship and many other significant adjustments for children divorce is often regarded by children as a sad turning point in their lives although for most it is not associated with longterm problems of adjustment  emery 1999  peer relationships peer relationships are particularly important for children they can be supportive but also challenging peer rejection may lead to behavioral problems later in life image twentyfour students httpsgoogl3is2g v cc bysa 20 httpsgooglj ssrc oparentchild relationships are not the only significant relationships in a child’s life peer relationships are also important social interaction with another child who is similar in age skills and knowledge provokes the development of many social skills that are valuable for the rest of life  bukowski buhrmester  underwood 2011  in peer relationships children learn how to initiate and maintain social interactions with other children they learn skills for managing conflict such as turntaking compromise and bargaining play also involves the mutual sometimes complex coordination of goals actions and understanding for example as infants children get their first encounter with sharing of each other’s toys during pretend play as preschoolers they create narratives together choose roles and collaborate to act out their stories and in primary school they may join a sports team learning to work together and support each other emotionally and strategically toward a common goal through these experiences children develop friendships that provide additional sources of security and support to those provided by their parents however peer relationships can be challenging as well as supportive  rubin coplan chen bowker  mc donald 2011  being accepted by other children is an important source of affirmation and selfesteem but peer rejection can foreshadow later behavior problems especially when children are rejected due to aggressive behavior with increasing age children confront the challenges of bullying peer victimization and managing conformity pressures social comparison with peers is an important means by which children evaluate their skills knowledge and personal qualities but it may cause them to feel that they do not measure up well against others for example a boy who is not athletic may feel unworthy of his footballplaying peers and revert to shy behavior isolating himself and avoiding conversation conversely an athlete who doesn’t “get” shakespeare may feel embarrassed and avoid reading altogether also with the approach of adolescence peer relationships become focused on psychological intimacy involving personal disclosure vulnerability and loyalty or its betrayal—which significantly affects a child’s outlook on the world each of these aspects of peer relationships requires developing very different social and emotional skills than those that emerge in parentchild relationships they also illustrate the many ways that peer relationships influence the growth of personality and selfconcept social understanding as we have seen children’s experience of relationships at home and the peer group contributes to an expanding repertoire of social and emotional skills and also to broadened social understanding in these relationships children develop expectations for specific people leading for example to secure or insecure attachments to parents understanding of how to interact with adults and peers and developing selfconcept based on how others respond to them these relationships are also significant forums for emotional development remarkably young children begin developing social understanding very early in life before the end of the first year infants are aware that other people have perceptions feelings and other mental states that affect their behavior and which are different from the child’s own mental states this can be readily observed in a process called social referencing in which an infant looks to the mother’s face when confronted with an unfamiliar person or situation  feinman 1992  if the mother looks calm and reassuring the infant responds positively as if the situation is safe if the mother looks fearful or distressed the infant is likely to respond with wariness or distress because the mother’s expression signals danger in a remarkably insightful manner therefore infants show an awareness that even though they are uncertain about the unfamiliar situation their mother is not and that by “reading” the emotion in her face infants can learn about whether the circumstance is safe or dangerous and how to respond although developmental scientists used to believe that infants are egocentric—that is focused on their own perceptions and experience—they now realize that the opposite is true infants are aware at an early stage that people have different mental states and this motivates them to try to figure out what others are feeling intending wanting and thinking and how these mental states affect their behavior they are beginning in other words to develop a theory of mind and although their understanding of mental states begins very simply it rapidly expands  wellman 2011  for example if an 18monthold watches an adult try repeatedly to drop a necklace into a cup but inexplicably fail each time they will immediately put the necklace into the cup themselves—thus completing what the adult intended but failed to do in doing so they reveal their awareness of the intentions underlying the adult’s behavior  meltzoff 1995  carefully designed experimental studies show that by late in the preschool years young children understand that another’s beliefs can be mistaken rather than correct that memories can affect how you feel and that one’s emotions can be hidden from others  wellman 2011  social understanding grows significantly as children’s theory of mind develops how do these achievements in social understanding occur one answer is that young children are remarkably sensitive observers of other people making connections between their emotional expressions words and behavior to derive simple inferences about mental states eg concluding for example that what mommy is looking at is in her mind  gopnik meltzoff  kuhl 2001  this is especially likely to occur in relationships with people whom the child knows well consistent with the ideas of attachment theory discussed above growing language skills give young children words with which to represent these mental states eg “mad” “wants” and talk about them with others thus in conversation with their parents about everyday experiences children learn much about people’s mental states from how adults talk about them “your sister was sad because she thought daddy was coming home”  thompson 2006b  developing social understanding is in other words based on children’s everyday interactions with others and their careful interpretations of what they see and hear there are also some scientists who believe that infants are biologically prepared to perceive people in a special way as organisms with an internal mental life and this facilitates their interpretation of people’s behavior with reference to those mental states  leslie 1994  personality although a childs temperament is partly determined by genetics environmental influences also contribute to shaping personality positive personality development is supported by a good fit between a childs natural temperament environment and experiences image thomas hawk httpsgoogl2so40o cc bync 20 httpsgooglfilc2eparents look into the faces of their newborn infants and wonder “what kind of person will this child will become” they scrutinize their baby’s preferences characteristics and responses for clues of a developing personality they are quite right to do so because temperament is a foundation for personality growth but temperament defined as earlyemerging differences in reactivity and selfregulation is not the whole story although temperament is biologically based it interacts with the influence of experience from the moment of birth if not before to shape personality  rothbart 2011  temperamental dispositions are affected for example by the support level of parental care more generally personality is shaped by the goodness of fit between the child’s temperamental qualities and characteristics of the environment  chess  thomas 1999  for example an adventurous child whose parents regularly take her on weekend hiking and fishing trips would be a good “fit” to her lifestyle supporting personality growth personality is the result therefore of the continuous interplay between biological disposition and experience as is true for many other aspects of social and personality development personality develops from temperament in other ways  thompson winer  goodvin 2010  as children mature biologically temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time a newborn is not capable of much selfcontrol but as brainbased capacities for selfcontrol advance temperamental changes in selfregulation become more apparent for example a newborn who cries frequently doesn’t necessarily have a grumpy personality over time with sufficient parental support and increased sense of security the child might be less likely to cry in addition personality is made up of many other features besides temperament children’s developing selfconcept their motivations to achieve or to socialize their values and goals their coping styles their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness and many other qualities are encompassed into personality these qualities are influenced by biological dispositions but even more by the child’s experiences with others particularly in close relationships that guide the growth of individual characteristics indeed personality development begins with the biological foundations of temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated extended and refined over time the newborn that parents gazed upon thus becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance social and emotional competence social and personality development is built from the social biological and representational influences discussed above these influences result in important developmental outcomes that matter to children parents and society a young adult’s capacity to engage in socially constructive actions helping caring sharing with others to curb hostile or aggressive impulses to live according to meaningful moral values to develop a healthy identity and sense of self and to develop talents and achieve success in using them these are some of the developmental outcomes that denote social and emotional competence these achievements of social and personality development derive from the interaction of many social biological and representational influences consider for example the development of conscience which is an early foundation for moral development conscience consists of the cognitive emotional and social influences that cause young children to create and act consistently with internal standards of conduct  kochanska 2002  conscience emerges from young children’s experiences with parents particularly in the development of a mutually responsive relationship that motivates young children to respond constructively to the parents’ requests and expectations biologically based temperament is involved as some children are temperamentally more capable of motivated selfregulation a quality called effortful control than are others while some children are dispositionally more prone to the fear and anxiety that parental disapproval can evoke conscience development grows through a good fit between the child’s temperamental qualities and how parents communicate and reinforce behavioral expectations moreover as an illustration of the interaction of genes and experience one research group found that young children with a particular gene allele the 5httlpr were low on measures of conscience development when they had previously experienced unresponsive maternal care but children with the same allele growing up with responsive care showed strong later performance on conscience measures  kochanska kim barry  philibert 2011  conscience development also expands as young children begin to represent moral values and think of themselves as moral beings by the end of the preschool years for example young children develop a “moral self” by which they think of themselves as people who want to do the right thing who feel badly after misbehaving and who feel uncomfortable when others misbehave in the development of conscience young children become more socially and emotionally competent in a manner that provides a foundation for later moral conduct  thompson 2012  social influences such as cultural norms impact childrens interests dress style of speech and even life aspirations image amanda westmont httpsgooglnt s5qx cc byncsa 20 httpsgoogltoc0zfthe development of gender and gender identity is likewise an interaction among social biological and representational influences  ruble martin  berenbaum 2006  young children learn about gender from parents peers and others in society and develop their own conceptions of the attributes associated with maleness or femaleness called gender schemas  they also negotiate biological transitions such as puberty that cause their sense of themselves and their sexual identity to mature each of these examples of the growth of social and emotional competence illustrates not only the interaction of social biological and representational influences but also how their development unfolds over an extended period early influences are important but not determinative because the capabilities required for mature moral conduct gender identity and other outcomes continue to develop throughout childhood adolescence and even the adult years conclusion as the preceding sentence suggests social and personality development continues through adolescence and the adult years and it is influenced by the same constellation of social biological and representational influences discussed for childhood changing social relationships and roles biological maturation and much later decline and how the individual represents experience and the self continue to form the bases for development throughout life in this respect when an adult looks forward rather than retrospectively to ask “what kind of person am i becoming”—a similarly fascinating complex multifaceted interaction

would account for your expectation in what ways does a child’s developing theory of mind resemble how scientists create refine and use theories in their work in other words would it be appropriate to think of children as informal scientists in their development of social understanding if there is a poor goodness of fit between a child’s temperament and characteristics of parental care what can be done to create a better match provide a specific example of how this might occur what are the contributions that parents offer to the development of social and emotional competence in children answer
