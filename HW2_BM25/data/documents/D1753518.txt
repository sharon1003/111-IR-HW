how to use the relative strength index rsiandy crowder april 03 2014 at 0916 investing in etfs options options trading put options one of the biggest mistakes individual investors make is simultaneously following too many technical indicators bull flags bear flags dojis channel retracements and fibonacci retracements are just a few of the indicators investors use to give them an “edge”unfortunately there is no “edge” when using technical indicators particularly when used in bunches most investors particular newbies overwhelm themselves with the latest and greatest indicators only to move on to another indicator that happens to fit their current market perspective it’s called curve fitting and it is extremely detrimental to successful longterm investing keep it simple believe me early on in my career i tried almost every indicator out there on my quest to find the holy grail of indicators but i quickly realized that it doesn’t exist to be successful you have to find a few indicators that fit your style of investing and stick with them for the long haul remember indicators are just tools to help you take the emotion out of investing the more mechanical the investment process the better i happen to be a contrarian with a strong belief in hard statistics so it makes sense that i would go with an indicator that measures meanreversion inherently i prefer to fade an index whether overbought or oversold when the underlying index reaches a “very overboughtvery oversold” state fading just means to place a shortterm trade in the opposite direction of the current shortterm trend think of it as waiting for a well hit fly ball to hit its apex or anticipating a bounce when that ball hits the ground nothing rises forever – and something that falls hard will bounce i wait for an asset to reach extreme high or low conditions… and then get on board to ride the asset back the other way so with that being said i would like to share my favorite indicator – the relative strength index rsi but more importantly i want to give you an example of how we can use it in today’s market rsi developed by j welles wilder jr is an overboughtoversold oscillator that compares the performance of an equity – in our case a highly liquid etf – to itself over a period of time it should not be confused with the term “relative strength” which is the comparison of one entity’s performance to another basically the relative strength index allows me to gauge the probability of a short to intermediateterm reversal it does not tell me the exact entry or exit point but it helps me to be aware that a reversal is on the horizon of course other factors must come into play before i decide to invest but i do know that in most cases when an index reaches an extreme state a shortterm reversal is imminent here is my guideline for using rsi on etfs very overbought – an rsi reading of greater than or equal to 850 overbought – greater than or equal to 750 neutral – between 300 and 750 oversold – less than or equal to 300 very oversold – less than or equal to 200relative strength index today’s trade since i’m looking for extreme conditions i almost always focus only on very overbought and very oversold conditions i use three different rsi time frames – the shorter the duration of the relative strength index the more i want to see an extreme reading the time frames are rsi 2 3 and 14 days the wisdom tree india fund nyse epi has pushed significantly higher over the past several months and is attracting lots of investor attention as of late you can see the “very overbought” state across every rsi timeframe in the chart above while this does not occur often when it does i consider it an incredible opportunity to make a highprobability trade of course if epi is on your watchlist as a buy now might not be the best area of entry with the etf in an extreme overbought state in most cases i would wait until the etf pulls back into a neutral state before considering a position knowing that the potential for a pullback in epi is imminent you could employ a strategy known as selling puts i don’t necessarily want to own epi at 1933 particularly given the overbought nature of the etf but i wouldn’t mind owning it around 18 or 69 lower than its current share price i don’t want to get into the details in this short column but we can sell one put contract that gives us the ability to buy 100 shares of epi at 18 a share – and collect an immediate 45 per contract and no matter what happens we get to keep that 45 if epi stays above 18 – the 45 we collected is ours but for the sake of understanding we should examine the alternative – epi closing below 18 by option expiration in that case we’d keep the 45 and be forced to buy the etf at 18 per share in our case we’d actually own the etf for 1755 per share – that’s the 18 strike price minus the 045 premium that is 92 less than epi’s current market price one way to think about it is that you’d receive 45 on a potential 1755 investment this works out to 26 on your money while you wait for the etf to hit your price simply selling puts is not inherently dangerous if used correctly it’s no more dangerous than any other type of investment in fact it’s often safer and if you’re truly interested in income it’s something you owe to yourself to look into my 1 strategy for earning 10 a
