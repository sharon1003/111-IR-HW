samruddhi gayatri wish to become one answered apr 5 2016i not am a teacher but recently i had a brief conversation with one of my teachers who currently is pursuing ma in english she told me that the teachers who teach them cannot speak a word in english and this situation prevails in most of the colleges she told me that she chose to become a teacher because it helped her understand people better and understand the psyche of the students she said that it gave her an opportunity to connect with the present generation unlike any other profession being a teacher gives you an opportunity to enjoy holidays all in all it hepls you imaprt knowledge in students and contribute to the society she also stated that it really feels good to see her students reach heights and then coming back to seek her blessings nothing in this world can be compared to the satisfaction which you get when you see your students working and contribute to the society324 views Â· view upvoters
