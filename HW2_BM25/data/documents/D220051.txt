solved need best computer for autocad civil 3dpoblatu jan 10 2014 808 amhi my boss asked me to look into upgrading our computers we are running auto cad civil 3d we have a budget of about 1500 to 2500 per computer our main desire is for them to be fast currently when i move the mouse the display lags a half a second we are extremely behind the times if you had this budget what components would you use please help13 answers last reply jan 11 2014 best answer jan 10 2014more about computer autocad civil beezy jan 10 2014 819 amare you using that 10001500 and building from scratch or do you already have towers motherboards etc to upgrade from the i5 or i7 will be a good choice 16gb of 1600mhz or faster ram for big renders running the program from a solid state drive can help improve speed too since 15002500 is a big range you may even be able to fit something like a quadro or firepro gpu into each computer these graphics cards are built for cad and workstation computers best answerssddx jan 10 2014 904 amive worked in the cadd field for quite a few years and have used autocad inventor microstation amongst others in both 2d and 3d so i do believe i can give you a good answer it also helps that ive been involved in the pc building hobby for quite some time so i know my way around lets start out with the easy topics ram you want lots and lots of it and you want it to be fast for average cad projects 16 gb 2x8gb sticks should be sufficient civil 2d or 2d horizontal shape files placed vertically in 3d to simulate 3d on its own really doesnt take up too much memory and the file sizes are small however if you convert this to 3d or use 3d elements then you definitely want the extra ram also when attaching background photos and other elements the file size and ram usage can jump while im not a civil guy i did mechancial and overall project layouts so i worked with all disciplines there are some situations where a civil pc could require more so that is why i suggested 16 not 8 going with 16 is also more future proof as far as speed is concerned at bare minimum you want 1600mhz although going with 1866 or 2133 is suggested having a low cas timing number at a higher clock rate the mhz rating is ideal for instance a 1866mhz cas9 ram is better than a 1600mhz cas11 hdd for the operating system you would want to use a ssd plain and simple while its quite possible to use a hard drive putting everything on a solid state makes windows start faster programs open faster and system responsiveness go way up i would say something around a 250gb ssd is ideal for this although you could get away with a 120gb depending on how many applications you install if files are stored locally on each machine you may want another hard drive for storage however if you store your files on a nas network storage or server this is not required at all having a nas in fact is the suggested way for such a business to operate one central source for files so that all users can access then you only have one source to back up gpu in terms of gpu the obvious clear winner is to get the best professional level card firepro quadro that you can for your given budget what you may lack in other areas you gain in terms of precision what this means is that there are less errors from gpu computing which results in faster 3d in caddmodelling programs as for 2d well it also is likely better than a consumer graphics card from nvidiaati such as a gtx770 but not by as large of a margin you could run cad on a high end consumer grade gpu like a gtx770 or gtx780 when at home i run cad on my gtx470 and it runs well but generally they are less optimized for cad which is why i suggested a professional card if you want to keep the budget low however this is likely the route you would need to take to get maximum performance for the least amount of cash a high end gtx780ti for example would power through 3d rather well but a professional level card which does the same might be 2x to 3x the price the professional level cards however do have lots of vram which if you do 3d work is important so id go for a card with 4gb if you do 3d if you strictly deal with 2d files then you dont need any sort of high end video card at all any mid level card should work but a high end card is going to be more future proof case you want something mid to large tower with usb 30 lots of fans since the systems will be running for extended periods of time with dust filters that you can clean to avoid dust buildup in the systems there are plenty of cases for this but a few of my favorites are from corsair nondescript plain flat front cases while certainly business like are absolutely horrid for performance you dont want to know what those dell xps cases looked like at work when they were opened dust magnets and they get rather hot when youre working all day long monitors quite simply two screens are best and preferable over one large screen dual 1920x1080p is great but going two 1920x1200 is better color accuracy really isnt as important as resolution and size you want as much desktop real estate as possible for cad 2224 monitors are a great size though some of your older employees may like 2326 psu a power supply rated for 100150w over the theoretical maximum load scenario we can calculate this out for you when you make your mind up about parts selection i would suggest going with pc power  cooling seasonic antec or xfx brands modular if possible again we can help you out on this once parts are decided on we will run a power calculation now as for the harder questions cpu xeon procesors are rated for 247 with a warranty which states this however have many more cores which autocad doesnt really use and is a slower clock speed which adversely affects programs like autocad many of our systems ran on xeons however i think you would be better served with an i74770 instead due to the higher clock speeds im not to sure how you guys feel about it from a business standpoint but you might even do a bit better if you went with a 4770k and clocked the cpu higher than what it comes stock cpu overclocking provided you put a decent cpu cooler on them such as a hyper 212 evo its likely the best route to take mobo if you went to overclocking route you would need a z87 motherboard if you went with a non overclocking route id suggest h87 although since you likely wouldnt be running multiple video cards you could probably make due with a h81 chipset  short list of what id suggest i74770k processor if overclocking if not then 4770 hyper 212 or 212 evo cpu cooler to keep temps low and noise levels down z87 motherboard if overclocking if not then h87 from asus or other major brand 2x8gb 1866mhz or higher ram from corsair mushkin gskill 250gb samsung 840pro though you could get away with a 840 or 840 evo or an intel model best firepro or quadro card you can get for the money left over see note above about using consumer cards instead seasonic modular psu rated for 100150w over your max load conditions we can calulate this later mid or full tower case with lots of airflow and with removable filters for cleaning 2x 1920x1200 monitors 24 size  most companies tend to like renting computers from dell since i do believe they allow you to exchangetrade up every few years the large company i worked for did this for thousands of computers i

theres no real need for a xeon i use standard auto cad 2014 and i run it off an i53450 and it handles everything that i need it to do anything above a 4770 i would go with an i74820k or an i74930k depending on the budgetssddx jan 10 2014 538 pmgunit1111 1 while technically if you have a theoretical max load of lets pick a number 430w that doesnt mean that you want a 430w psu even though 99999 of the time it would work perfectly fine no you would go with a 450w or even preferably a 500w in case you wanted to make some upgrades down the road or leave headroom for extra peripherals fans etcetera you always want a bit of headroom over whatever your max load would be while i agree 150 is excessive its all relative and also depends on the price you can get components at you can get 650w psus for the same price as 550w when they are on sale for example so while i do agree with you you also dont want to go too small either 2 if you read the ops statement you would realize that he said my boss asked me which implies a business hence the comment was 100 relevant personally i really dislike dell and think they are a bunch of crap computers and they are however they make alot of sense for mass deployment and large business since we dont know how many computers we are talking about given that the op did not state a number im going to guess 825 since its civil i just threw it in as an option if it applied 3 if you read my statement i also agreed that a 4770k would be ideal i just mentioned xeon because many workstations and companies use them our company had at least 500 of them through dell i did state that a 4770 was a more powerful option since autocad really isnt optimized for more cores over stronger individual cores i dont think theres any real need to go with socket 2011 as its a waste of moneygunit1111 jan 10 2014 847 pmquotewhile technically if you have a theoretical max load of lets pick a number 430w that doesnt mean that you want a 430w psu even though 99999

an option if it applied im not the biggest fan of dell either but i got a venue 8 pro for christmas and this thing is amazing its not entirely changed my opinion on dell but its definitely a way better tablet than i expected for a small business or student that wouldnt be the route to go but my firm that i work for has 50 people and weve gone the diy route for the last several years and it has worked out pretty well so far quoteif you read my statement i also agreed that a 4770k would be ideal i just mentioned xeon because many workstations and companies use them our company had at

go with socket 2011 as its a waste of money yeah the 47704770k is definitely the better option but the only reason id go with a 4820k or 4930k because of the extra cores and increased ram  z87 can only have at max 32gb where 2011 can have up to 96gb depending on the motherboard if youve got a drawing with several hundred layers redrawing those fine lines can be a painfully slow process and believe me ive used larger drawings on six year old machines that are still running core 2 duos  and thats with current 2014 versions of autodesk softwaressddx jan 10 2014 906 pmg there really is no need for the extra cores since autocad does best on stronger cores not more of them or 96gb ram though 16 would be a good idea with 2 slots left open for future upgrades as a just in case ive had 15gb files open in smartplant review flying around lucky we got that ram upgrade to 8gb haha the systems had 4 before talk about using older systems in any case 16 should be more than enough though 8 is probably fine for just civil workgunit1111 jan 10 2014 1054 pmssddx saidg there really is no need for the extra cores since autocad does best on stronger cores not more of them or 96gb ram though 16

before talk about using older systems in any case 16 should be more than enough though 8 is probably fine for just civil work yeah youre right 16gb would definitely be ideal but having the option open for more than 32gb definitely doesnt hurt especially if youre running a ram disk that would speed things up significantlyssddx jan 10 2014 1106 pmyeah but ramdisk is extremely volitile you dont want volitile if working on important documents which is why things are often incrementally saved to a nas in case of a power surge you might lose some data which wasnt saved to the nas but you would lose all of the data on the ramdisk unless you had it set to automatically save to the nas i guess you could create some program to do this but its not really all that necessary in the long run having to transfer all the files after you save them instead of doing it in one step is going to take more time than just saving on the nas to begin with and in business time  money ramdisk might be nice for temporary files which get autocreated but in the autocad business world its not really all that necessary i agree with leaving some space open for future upgrades though which is why i said to leave 2 slots open that would give you 32gb total possible but you would only have 16 installed now where having 96gb of ram installed would be of huge benefit would be video editing using it as a source and destination could speed up editing immensely the other option would be having 3 differend drives remember that users of autocad arent always computer smart while they can use programs not everyone is a tech geek they might forget or not realize ram disk is volitile and lose lots of data costing time and money just using the nas is safergunit1111 jan 10 2014 1112 pmquoteyeah but ramdisk is

dont have to leave your computer on to have a ramdisk you can shut it off however the data would need to be taken off and backed up from the ramdisk this can be done automatically when you shutdown and then data would need to be loaded back on at startup this could be done automatically as well which takes time while great for some applications where speed is crucial its a bit hard to recommend it for all applications oh yes ive had people who barely knew how to change the mouse speed and even one who didnt know how to clean out a trackball a little off topic oh just thought of something you might be interested in since youre in the field ou might really want to check out 3d adobe pdfs that can be created from cad while perhaps not the best thing since sliced bread its still cool enough to get your nerd sense spidey sense tingling we are gumming up the ops thread though so i suggest we stop the off topic discussion before the thread gets too longbambiboom jan 11 2014 808 ampoblatu follows is an idea for a workstation intended for 3d cad the basic recommendation is to have an lga2011 processor as these have a wider bandwidth more memory and more pcie lanes than 1155 but especially offer the possibility of 46810 and 12 cores extending the useful life of the system by upgrading the choice of options depend on the specific uses for example if one system is mostly 2d the graphics card can be the lower end but fro intense 3d the higher end gpu and if there is a system used for rendering and presentation image processing both the 6core and higher end card will be an advantage in a business situation there are a lot of advantages to buying system from dell hp or lenovo with on site service warranties i dont know any architectural industrial design graphics or animations firms using selfbuilt systems unless there is a more or less fulltime it expert the advantage to building is being able to tailor each part to your uses plus considerable cost savings the

systems it does make sense to go with prebuilt in some cases but what you get for the money is pretty pathetic at times still worthwhile for warranty issues and definitely worth a thought 1 autocad still isnt optimized for multicore it performs better on stronger single cores than it does on more cores this makes 6 10 12 cores a complete waste of money while it can use multiple cores the performance difference really is negligible i do however agree that a high clocked xeon at 3839 quad core might be a valid solution which is why i mentioned xeon as a possible cpu 2 a bit much for a cooler wouldnt you say while i agree with a nice large cooler for silence at that price you might as well step up the nhd14 which is 100 complete overkill considering smaller heatsinks will work perfectly fine on the system 3 a server board would work if going with socket 2011 however its also rather overkill as well at least its cheaper than nonserver 2011 boards though certainly 150 more than socket 1150 boards 4 agree 2x8gb 1600mhz is fine higher mhz while keeping low cas timings is better but 1600 works 5 i agree quadro cards are good for cad applications definitely expensive but they do work fairly well however as far as a performance per dollar is concerned they absolutely suck consumer level cards are cheaper much cheaper in cases where you need all the extra vram of the higher end quadro cards there really isnt any comparison but if you dont then well it needs some thought given please do see this review a 140 gtx650 beats a 370 quadro 2000 for example httpwwwpugetsystemscomlabsarticlesauto deskauto cad2013gpuacceleration164 6 i wouldnt call any 7200 drive very fast its comparable to just about any other recent 7200 i own some i should know perhaps it is faster than some 9 year old drives but not by a huge margin to get faster you would either need 10k raptors or 15k scsi however they are loud and impractical or go the ssd route since its a workplace there are likely nas servers for most of the data which means that 250gb or possibly 500 should be more than enough and will make that very fast wd black look like a turtle 7 while definitely a top of the line and very good psu there are other options available for a lower price level while i do agree with your choice here i think there are other options to consider as well also agree with a gold rating seeing as how much power the systems since there will be quite a few of them will be sucking down the more efficient the lower the power bill 8 fairly nondescript which is nice for a business scenario but lianli has always been pricey they typically have some rather nice stuff i myself own a v2000 which is well built but there are cheaper options which work just as well 9 almost anything works here ssd while not necessary they do speed up the system performance programs like autocad adobe reader etceter open faster and react faster if storing files centrally on a nas there will always be delay to deal with there but only so much you can do about it there is no need for multiple drives in a system if using a centrally located nas like most cad businesses use doing so would be a waste of cash in short either a 1tb hdd or 250500gb ssd would work i worked at a large corporation which was well known in the field and employed hundreds of people in one office and our average useable hdd space was typically only 3050gb more than what was needed for the os and programs so there is no worry about space issues too much when using a nas though with outlook email working with some photos for projects and other such things should have more space so id suggest more than what we personally used hence the recommendations i gave earlier monitors i definitely agree that new monitors should be included in the price for autocad the magic number is two the magic size is about 24 with 1920x1200 resolution two monitors is most ideal for any sort of 3d even if it is just changing the elevation of 2d civil topo lines it also allows for having up autocad on one side and another app on the other technically a 2560x1400 or 1600 monitor would work id get a 30 if going this route since it has the same ppi as regular 2224 monitors but its going to be a more expensive option and from years in the cad field i found one monitor really wasnt as convenient as two despite the resolution difference some people may like 1 some people may like 2 cant please everyone but both options are worth a thoughtgunit1111 jan 11 2014 427 pmquote6 i wouldnt call any 7200 drive very
