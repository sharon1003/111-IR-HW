well as being transmitted from animal to animal rabies virus is maintained in reservoir populations of animals in the united states these reservoir animals are wild carnivores  ie raccoons in the east skunks in the midwest and insectivorous bats in other parts of the world the domestic dog serves as a reservoir animal in those countries exposure to rabid dogs is the primary means by which people contract and die from rabies fortunately pet vaccination laws in the u s protect us and our pets from rabies all mammals including humans are susceptible to rabies virus infection once an animal is exposed and becomes ill the disease is fatal prior to the death of the animal infectious rabies virus is shed in the saliva of the sick animal when the infectious animal fights with or bites another animal the virus is transmitted and the bitten animal may develop rabies in this way rabies can be maintained in a population of animals in nc this cycle typically involves raccoons however raccoons can and do fight with other animals and cause them to become rabid it is for this reason that you hear about rabid foxes skunks coyotes groundhogs and other animals on the news this is also the reason why there are rabid dogs and cats reported every year in nc keeping dogs and cats currently vaccinated against rabies will protect them from the disease and protect the people around them the circumstances constituting an emergency situation for human exposure to suspected rabies must satisfy one of the following criteria1 unprovoked bite from a wild animal such as a raccoon fox skunk bobcat etc 2 unprovoked bite from an unvaccinated dog or cat 3 bite provoked or not resulting in skin breakage on either the head or neck 4 bites from bats 5 bat s found in a domicile where people were asleep any dog or cat regardless of rabies vaccination status that bites a person must be confined and observed for a 10day period of time per nc statute 130a196 the local health director designates the location and conditions of the 10day confinement at home confinement is not guaranteed but may be allowed at the discretion of the local health director if the dogcat does die or develop clinical symptoms suggestive of rabies during the 10day confinement period submit the head for rabies diagnostic testing if the dog or cat does not die or develop clinical signs suggestive ofrabies during the 10day confinement period then it can be concluded that the dogcat was not shedding rabies virusin its saliva at the time of the bite rabies pep would not be warranted for the bite victim general information north carolina manual for rabies prevention and animal bite management north carolina animal rabies association rabies bite report form pests a vector is any organism that can transmit diseasecausing agents such as a virus or bacterium control of the vector can prevent and control some diseases however in order to control vectors detailed knowledge must be acquired about their life cycle preferred hosts and transmission cycles as well as surveillance of populations and habitats most vectorborne diseases in the u s are animal diseases that are sometimes spread to humans often the disease in humans is worse than in the animals different vectors may spread the disease from animal to animal or from animal to humans in the united states mosquitoes flies fleas and ticks are vectors of disease by monitoring populations of these organisms as well as the incidence of human illness public health pest management plays a vital role in keeping north carolinians healthy mosquitoes ticks lice bedbugs air quality indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home high temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants there are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home these include combustion sources such as oil gas kerosene coal wood and tobacco products building materials and furnishings as diverse as deteriorated asbestos containing insulation wet or damp carpet and cabinetry or furniture made of certain pressed wood products products for household cleaning and maintenance personal care or hobbies central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices and outdoor sources such as radon pesticides and outdoor air pollution the relative importance of any single source depends on how much of a given pollutant it emits and how hazardous those emissions are in some cases factors such as how old the source is and whether it is properly maintained are significant for example an improperly adjusted gas stove can emit significantly more carbon monoxide than one that is properly adjusted some sources such as building materials furnishings and household products like air fresheners release pollutants more or less continuously other sources related to activities carried out in the home release pollutants intermittently these include smoking the use of unvented or malfunctioning stoves furnaces or space heaters the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities the use of paint strippers in redecorating activities and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in housekeeping high pollutant concentrations can remain in the air for long periods after some of these activities see home

result in a wide range of health conditions including mesothelioma a deadly cancer that attacks the lining of the lungs heart or abdomen asbestos is a naturally occurring toxic mineral that was commonly used throughout the 20th century in thousands of products buildings and many other industries asbestos dot com offers a onestop resource on all asbestos and mesotheliomarelated issues ranging from occupational exposure to a mesothelioma diagnosis for additional information on mesothelioma visit the following links mesotheliomacom mesothelioma guidecom mesotheliomahelporg mold mold is a term used to describe a type of fungus that is an often fuzzylooking growth that appears on the surface of organic materials in damp conditions both outdoors and indoors molds may be gray black green yellow orange or various other colors and may have a velvety or wooly texture like other fungi molds produce tiny spores in order to reproduce mold spores continually waft through the air both indoors and outofdoors when mold spores land on a damp spot they may begin growing and digesting whatever they are growing on in order to survive indoors molds can grow on wood paper fabrics carpet foods and other organic materials molds are a natural part of the environment but human health problems may result when people are exposed to large amounts of mold particularly indoors inhaling excessive quantities of airborne mold particles or spores may lead to allergic illness trigger asthma cause respiratory infections or bring about toxic effects from certain chemicals in the mold cells when excessive moisture or water accumulates indoors mold growth will often occur particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or unaddressed there is no practical way to eliminate all molds and mold spores indoors however indoor mold growth can be controlled by controlling moisture see home page for links with more information
