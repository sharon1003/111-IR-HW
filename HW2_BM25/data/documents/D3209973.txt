after using the air oasisi have to admit i was skeptical when i ordered the air oasis™ air purifier i had been suffering with allergy type symptoms when i would go to bed for almost a year and a month ago reached my breaking point with the annoying cough and scratchy throat throughout that year i have been researching the different home units available and was not impressed with any of them but decided that i would have to make the big purchase and just try one as fate would have it the day i was doing my final comparison analysis i stumbled across the air oasis™ 3000 what sold me was the inclusion of actual percent reduction test results for the different air pollutants typically found in houses also providing air testing kits to validate your product in the consumers residence is definitely putting your money where your mouth is i have included a photo of my test results and will be ordering another unit for the first floor of my house likewise i will be highly recommending your unit to friends and family thanks for the restful nights mark b air test kit results before aftermy family and i just moved into a new home three weeks ago we are very health oriented people and want our children to have the best chance at life that we can provide we have been hearing more and more about the poor indoor air quality in most homes today and decided to try your indoor air quality test kit i figured since our home was new that the air must be great boy was i wrong after seeing the results i was almost afraid to take another breath my husband and i decided to purchase the air oasis™ 3000 air purifier at once we took your advice and after using the unit for six days we retested in the same room they say a picture is worth a thousand words so i will let the before and after pictures i have included do the talking i only wish we would have purchased one sooner thank you air oasisapril b ps get ready for referrals because i am showing everyone my picturesdr jeff i had to write to tell you about my experience so far with your air oasis units first of all i was so excited about receiving them that i did not even do the air tests that i had ordered i wanted to be able to use the units immediately so i decided not to do the air test i put one unit downstairs and one unit upstairs as you suggested it was the perfect time to test your product because we were dog sitting for my sister at the time we have our own large dog but for two weeks we were also dog sitting for two additional dogs we have been having a ton of rain hence the house smelled of wet dog for days it took about two days after we began using your units and the smell of the dogs was completely gone we did another test when my wife spilled a whole jar of jewelry cleaner in her closet there was such a strong smell of ammonia that it was overbearing i placed a unit right in front of her closet and we left for the evening when we returned the strong order was completely gone i have been extremely happy with the air oasis and the bonus is that i dont even have to worry about cleaning it for three years thanks again for your product as i mentioned earlier id love you to keep me posted on your distributor program if that comes to pass i am looking into mass media marketing for another product and if that works out id love to see if i can do the same for air oasis ricky pafter having used the air oasis 3000 air purifier for two months in the bedroom it has stopped my nasal drainage and a hacking cough the air seems fresher it seemed to have started working the second day jack s st louis moa friend recently let me use their air oasis 3000 in my home so i could decide if i wanted to purchase one the night i first placed the unit in my home i could hardly breathe i think i had a sinus infection it was suggested for me to stay close to the unit for awhile to help clear up my infection i never took that piece of advice the next night i was still having problems sleeping because of the sinus problems i decided to go and lay on the couch so my husband could get some rest the next morning i awoke and the infection was gone i could breathe again i then realized the couch i had been sleeping on was about two feet away from the air oasis air purifier this thing really works but thats not all to top it off my father walked into my home a couple of days later and stopped right when he walked in the door and asked if i had just cleaned he went on to say that was the cleanest my home had ever smelled thank you for the great product amy mdoctor jeff i am completely blown away from the quality of air that is put out by this air oasis machine my wife and i sleep so much better now that this air purifier has cleaned our home people that visit us even make comments about

pouring in about the great results people are receiving with their air oasis™ 3000 air purifier we would like to hear your story as well to send us your testimony simply email it to us why are the ions produced by our air purifier safer than ozone simply put your body defends itself against these ions naturally mold bacteria viruses and other biological contaminants do not have the same defense mechanisms that we possess therefore the ions produced by the air oasis purifier are deadly to the harmful organisms but wont harm people or their pets an abbreviated technical explanation it is all due to the oxidation defense system within your body which utilizes a special blend of enzymes have you ever cut yourself on accident and then used hydrogen peroxide on the wound what happened the hydrogen peroxide started to fizz or bubble when it made contact with your wound right but why its due to the reaction of certain enzymes within our body that protect us from hydro peroxide ozone hydroxyls super oxides and more one example is glutathione peroxidase it is a peroxidase found in humans which contains selenocysteine it uses glutathione as a electron donor and is active with both hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxide substrates another enzyme is catalase present in the peroxisomes of nearly all aerobic cells it serves to protect the cell from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide by catalyzing its decomposition into molecular oxygen and water without the production of free radicals superoxide dismutase cu zn sod catalyses the dismutation reaction of the toxic superoxide radical to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and thus forms a crucial part of the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism your body also contains many other antioxidants to help protect you from oxidation more and more of the foods we eat and the supplements we take are being loaded with antioxidants as well made in the u s a every air oasis air purifier is assembled by hand in usa
