how fast do villi heal after being destroyed by gluten by melanie berkowitz reviewed by terri forehand rnsource if you have celiac disease your doctor has likely told you that adhering to a strict glutenfree diet is the only way to eliminate symptoms repair damage to your small intestine and prevent further injury medical experts agree on the importance of a glutenfree diet but patients often have questions about the damage already done to the villi of the small intestine and the process the body has for repairing that damage villi damage and antibodies in someone with celiac disease eating foods containing gluten causes a reaction in the villi of the small intestine villi are tiny fingerlike projections that line the inside of that organ for a person with celiac disease eating gluten flattens the villi and makes them unable to absorb nutrients effectively when a person with celiac disease eats gluten his or her body produces specific antibodies that can be detected through a blood test a positive antibody blood test is the first step in diagnosing the disease if a patient has elevated antibody levels the next step is to do a biopsy of the small intestine to look for villi damage the amount of damage in a newly diagnosed celiac is difficult to predict but several research studies report a relationship between factors such as physical symptoms and t tg levels at diagnosis and the severity of villi damage correlation between villi damage physical symptoms and blood test results a finnish study conducted in 2012 confirmed the importance of considering a patients physical symptoms and quality of life when first making a celiac disease diagnosis there was a distinct correlation between initial physical discomfort the level of antibodies in the blood and the degree of damage in the small intestine for many of the patients studied this means that adults who have been ignoring the symptoms of active celiac for years could have extensive villi damage by the time of diagnosis correlation between high t tg antibody numbers and severe villi damage according to an italian study the t tg antibody test was shown to be the most sensitive for diagnosing most patients the study found a definite relation between the overall t tg antibody number and the degree of villi damage as seen through a biopsy measuring damage to the villi when a person with celiac disease eats gluten either on purpose or more likely by accident he or she will often experience physical symptoms such as stomach upset headache muscle pain or fatigue within a few hours such symptoms may last for several days before they subside others may eat gluten occasionally and experience no physical symptoms at all the existence or lack of physical symptoms is not a good indication of villi damage however calculating the damage that eating gluten does to the villi is not that simple all gluten consumption damages the villi every time a person with celiac disease eats gluten it causes new damage to the villi the amount of damage depends on how much and how often gluten is eaten and the patients own specific physiology the only way to definitively see and measure damage to the villi is through a biopsy of the small intestine which is usually only performed at diagnosis according to the university of chicago celiac disease center postdiagnosis damage is measured with a yearly blood test to check antibody levels if antibody levels remain normal doctors assume that the patient is not ingesting any gluten and thus not causing new damage to the villi higher antibodies indicate regular exposure to gluten although even a single instance of gluten ingestion will cause some damage to the villi it is unlikely to be measurable in the form of higher antibodies the university of chicago celiac disease center reports that repeated exposure to gluten will cause antibody numbers to rise which usually takes two or three months of regular gluten ingestion if an individual has been glutenfree for at least six months and is not seeing a drop in antibody numbers it is likely that he or she is still eating gluten somewhere most doctors will recommend watching out for crosscontamination and other accidental gluten before looking for other causes of the continued high antibody levels healing damaged villi your villi will begin to heal as soon as you start a strict glutenfree diet however the healing process can take time according to the national institute of health children tend to heal more quickly than adults so a child on a strict glutenfree diet should see normal antibody levels within three to six months of going glutenfree it may take an adult up to two years for antibody levels to return to normal however taking care of yourself adhering to your diet and working closely with your doctor will have you on the road to recovery was this page useful yes no editors picks flattened villi celiac disease what is the job of villi celiac disease
