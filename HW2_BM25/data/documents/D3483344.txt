water as a propellant next highpressure air forces the mixture deep into cracks and crevices getting deep inside doors and window jambs sills and mouldings for interior voids the highpressure mister we use a highpressure mister to treat your attics and wall voids by covering surfaces of unfinished wood active ingredients are mixed with highpressure water to create small droplets for full coverage smaller droplets allow us to apply more ingredients in more places for soil treatments liquid treatments truly nolen protects your home inside and out as part of our comprehensive treatment plan we treat the soil near and under your home we apply liquid treatments in trenches or drillings to protect foundations slabs and tub traps for underslab protection the difference is in the injection rods our thinwalled lightweight stainless steel rod injection system makes the entire underslab process less intrusive while still effectively delivering our trusted treatment the new injection rods are smaller ¼inch – about the size of a pen – constructed of thinwalled lightweight stainless steel – provide comprehensive 360 degree coverage and an improved flow rate instead of using a single flood tip that limits application to just the end of the rod the multidirectional tip uses six to eight holes around the rod this modern application method is less invasive provides a more complete application in a shorter amount of time – saving you time and money for example an average sized home with a supported slab treatment would receive about 200 gallons of treatment on both the inside and outside of the foundation as well as into block voids for additional information what are termites termite inspection how to get rid of termites common signs of termite infestation termite
