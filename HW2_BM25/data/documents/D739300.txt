anybody can ask a question anybody can answer the best answers are voted up and rise to the top what do “agent” and “agency” mean respectively in “moral agent” and “moral agency”？up vote1down votefavorite“agent” oed says could mean “an active and efficient cause capable of producing a certain effect” “agency” could mean “a thing or person that acts to produce a particular result” it seems they are synonyms then i come across two related phrases moral agent moral agency “agent” in “moral agent” though means simply a subject an “actor” can be understood in a sense as a cause of an act since “moral agency” is used to mean the inner dynamics of the moral agent “agency” is to be understood as “cause” too what makes the agent act morally to treat them both as meaning “cause” cannot justify them representing two things different in order therefore i doubt that maybe “agent” refers to the causes which are of natural kind such as human or corporation while “agency” can mean the inner cause that explains how the causes work as a cause sorry this may be a very immature thought please feel free to correct memeaningshare improve this questionasked oct 13 13 at 1135benlogos709 10

basing your assertion moral agent  agency are not used in british   english i havent checked chosters research but it would argue strongly against this claim – edwin ashworth oct 13 13 at 1632the above comments are right i should have said not commonly used i was not trying to give all the meanings of the words but to stay within the scope of the question i generally work by instinct and check sometimes mainly in the oxford publications – exuser2728 oct 13 13 at 17401elu being a question and answer site for linguists etymologists and serious english language enthusiasts i think that instinctive answers though experienced english users should not discount their expertise need checking before a wrong statement that feels right is given   moral agent  agency are not used in british english is just plain wrong and from the bnc and coca results the terms seem rather uncommon in the us as well as the uk which is unsurprising given the register moral philosophy they are largely confined to – edwin ashworth oct 13 13 at 2259add a comment your answer sign up or log in sign up using google sign up using facebook sign up using email and password post as a guest name email by
