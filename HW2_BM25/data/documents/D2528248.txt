gina and i have learned that taking care of parents is a lot more than just focusing on home care andor personal health caring for a loved one at home by themselves can require the help of a number of service providers that are experts in their fields here’s a real life example of caring for our own parents remotely one minute the issue is a leak in the roof that needs immediate repair who do you call the next minute its help making payments on bills and paying penalties because they are overdue then just when you think it couldn’t get any worse you get a call from your brother turns out mom hurt herself due to a fall she didn’t tell you about because she didn’t want you to feel bad because you are doing so much you knew the house could use a major reorganization and a good safety check but you didn’t have time to get around to it to discuss with mom nor did you know somebody that can help your challenge is you have a fulltime job and you live far away from mom and there’s no immediate family nearby to help what do you do who can you turn to for advice and help it takes a village  the circle of support there are great people and companies that can help your loved ones are
