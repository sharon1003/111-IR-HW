harper’s pick for new minister unlikely to inflame science community ed holder leaves after being sworn in as canadas new minister of state for science and technology at rideau hall in ottawa march 19 2014 chris wattiereutersgloria galloway ottawapublished march 19 2014updated march 25 2017the appointment of amiable backbencher ed holder as minister of state for science and technology is not expected to inflame the testy relationship between the conservative government and many members of canadas scientific community but neither is mr holders elevation to the junior cabinet portfolio being read by the scientists – who have complained of closed research facilities muzzled scientific staff and scientific evidence being ignored – as a sign that prime minister stephen harper may become more conciliatory instead it suggests the government will stay its course on its science policy – one in which the value of research is measured by its economic potential mr holder 59 is an insurance professional with a philosophy degree he was a community leader and a conservative foot soldier in london ont for decades before winning the seat in the london west riding in 2008 and again in 2011 great day what an honour mr holder said on wednesday as he left rideau hall after he was sworn in he did not respond to a subsequent request for an interview katie gibbs a spokeswoman for evidence for democracy which promotes scientific knowledge in public decisions said her group would have preferred a minister with direct experience doing science or research but given that there really arent a lot of conservative mps who have any kind of an advanced degree in science ms gibbs said weve sort of given up hope that will happenmr holder replaces greg rickford the new natural resources minister whose appointment to the science portfolio last summer was described by some scientists as a slap in the face they accused mr rickford of remaining silent while the conservative government plotted to close the experimental lakes area a premier freshwater research station in his riding before mr rickford the portfolio was held by gary goodyear an mp from cambridge ont who was uncomfortable when asked if he believes in evolution mr holders political career has so far been unremarkable either for gaffes or for greatness he made a bid for the speakers chair in 2011 which he lost to fellow tory andrew scheer and he has been a member of the commons committee on industry science and technology the london free press noted in a profile last year that mr holders first term was marked by instances of cooperation with mps of other stripes – something the paper said did not endear him to conservative brass the free press also quoted mr holder as saying he does not feel the compulsion to behave deferentially to the prime minister but neither have there been instances when he notably stepped outside the party line andrew sancton a political science professor at the university of western ontario in london – where mr holder is from – said his impression of the new science minister is that he has been a solid constituency and community worker who has not distinguished himself in any particular way theres no possible way that this could be read that this is some great news for science policy in canada that this relatively unknown mp would be picked for this job prof sancton said and i dont think anybody would expect dramatic moves from the government in relation to science policy diane orihel one of the leaders of the fight to save the experimental lakes area congratulated mr holder and said she hopes he will start listening to the canadian science community and undo the great damage done by his predecessors before being moved out the science portfolio mr rickford was updating the federal science and technology strategy paul dufour the head of paulicy works a science and technology policy consulting firm said the harper administration missed an opportunity to signal the importance of science and technology for canadians by not appointing a senior cabinet minister supported by a national science adviser as exists in other
