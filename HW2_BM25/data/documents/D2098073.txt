final mission of the american space shuttle program 5 6 it used the orbiter atlantis and hardware originally processed for the sts335 contingency mission which was not flown sts135 launched on 8 july 2011 and landed on 21 july 2011 following a oneday mission extension the fourperson crew was the smallest of any shuttle mission since sts6 in april 1983 the missions primary cargo was the multipurpose logistics module mplm raffaello and a lightweight multipurpose carrier lmc which were delivered to the international space station iss the flight of raffaello marked the only time that atlantis carried an mplm 7although the mission was authorized it initially had no appropriation in the nasa budget raising questions about whether the mission would fly on 20 january 2011 program managers changed sts335 to sts135 on the flight manifest this allowed for training and other mission specific preparations 8 on 13 february 2011 program managers told their workforce that sts135 would fly regardless of the funding situation via a continuing resolution 9 until this point there had been no official references to the sts135 mission in nasa documentation for the general public 10 11 12 13during an address at the marshall space flight center on 16 november 2010 nasa administrator charles bolden said that the agency needed to fly sts135 to the station in 2011 due to possible delays in the development of commercial rockets and spacecraft designed to transport cargo to the iss we are hoping to fly a third shuttle mission in addition to sts133 and sts134 in june 2011 what everybody calls the launchonneed missionand thats really needed to buy down the risk for the development time for commercial cargo bolden said 14the mission was included in nasas 2011 authorization 15 which was signed into law on 11 october 2010 but funding remained dependent on a subsequent appropriations bill united space alliance signed a contract extension for the mission along with sts134 the contract contained six onemonth options with nasa in order to support continuing operations 16the federal budget approved in april 2011 called for 55 billion for nasas space operations division including the shuttle and space station programs according to nasa the budget running through 30 september 2011 ended all concerns about funding the sts135 mission 17contents  hide 1 crew11 crew seating2 funding3

astronauts were assigned to this mission versus the normal six or seven because there were no other shuttles available for a rescue following the retirement of discovery and endeavour if the shuttle was seriously damaged in orbit the crew would have moved into the international space station and returned in russian soyuz capsules one at a time over the course of a year all sts135 crew members were customfitted for a russian sokol space suit and molded soyuz seat liner for this possibility 19 the reduced crew size also allowed the mission to maximize the payload carried to the iss 20 it was

flight day 5 saw expedition 28 flight engineers mike fossum and ron garan perform a spacewalk 90 because of a short training flow and a requirement to launch the shuttle with a reduced crew of four nasa opted not to utilize two spacewalkers from the sts135 crew the main tasks for the spacewalk included retrieving a failed pump module from an external stowage platform of the iss for return to earth inside the shuttles cargo bay installing two experiments and repairing a new base for the stations robotic arm the spacewalk began at 1322 utc nasa rule for identification fossums emu spacesuit had red stripes around the legs while garans had no markings the spacewalkers used canadarm2 to retrieve the pump module which failed in 2010 operated by sts135 pilot hurley and mission specialist magnus in the stations cupola garan rode canadarm2 to the pump modules stowage platform where he and fossum removed it still on the arm garan took the pump module inside atlantiss payload bay there fossum bolted it into place on the lmc the astronauts next removed the robotics refueling mission rrm experiment from the payload bay fossum now on the arm carried the experiment to a platform on dextre for temporary storage while garan cleaned up tools and equipment in the payload bay of atlantis recognizing the historical significance take a look around ronny youre the last eva person in the payload bay of a shuttle radioed mission specialist rex walheim who served as the intravehicular officer to coordinate the spacewalk from atlantiss flight deck 91upon completion of the installation fossum moved to the front of the zarya module and freed a wire stuck in one latch door at a data grapple fixture the fixture had been installed during sts134 the previous shuttle mission the grapple fixture serves as a base for canadarm2 considerably extending its range of operation on the russian segment of the iss garan also deployed a materials experiment  misse8 that focuses on optical reflector materials also installed during sts134 on the express logistics carrier elc2 fram3 site on the stations starboard truss back together again fossum and garan moved on to the pressurized mating adapter pma3 on the tranquility node they installed an insulating cover on the end of the adapter an area exposed to considerable sunshine the two astronauts completed the sixhour 31minute

alarm on board atlantis at 2207 gmt the tone signaled a failure with one of atlantiss five ibm ap101 general purpose computers gpcs no 4 102 the alarm prompted commander ferguson to head to atlantis and evaluate the issue gpc4 was running system management software at the time of failure ferguson with the help of ground control later transferred the failed gpcs programs onto gpc2 the transfer took about 45 minutes bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at white sands new mexico after activating gpc2 and with atlantis in good shape ferguson and other crew members went back to sleep you all have done an absolutely fabulous job we have polled the room everyone is ready for you to go back to sleep radioed capcom shannon lucid from mission control 103as a result of the extra time spent on fixing the gpc4 issue mission control extended the crew sleep period by 30 minutes although no root cause was immediately identified ground controllers immediately ruled out any connection between gpc4 malfunction and the problem suffered by gpc3 ahead of docking 10415 july flight day 8 – cargo transfers  editshuttle and station crew members pose for a portrait the crew awakened at 459 utc to a special message and a song from sir paul mc cartney 105 the wake up call was 30 minutes later than atlantiss crew had been scheduled in order to give them time to

the crew was ahead of timeline on earlier days but the computer problem caused them to slow down he further mentioned that the latch on atlantiss middeck locker for li oh canisters is broken and as a result the entire panel had been fastened to floor with fasteners the li oh canisters are used to scrub carbon dioxide from the cabin air inside the shuttle when atlantis is docked to the space station the station carbon dioxide removal assembly cdra 109 takes care of both the stations and atlantiss air revitalization however when atlantis flies solo after undocking li oh canisters are required regarding the gpc4 issue mr alibaruho said that it was a very infrequent failure happened before only on sts9 and the last time a problem occurred on gpc 4 was on atlantiss sts71 mission16 july flight day 9 – cargo transfers  editastronaut sandra magnus in the cupola flight day 9 was the bonus day added by the mission management team earlier on the week as a result of atlantis having been able to save enough cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen to power its fuel cells an extra day throughout the day the four member sts135 crew spent more time to move supplies and equipment between the iss and the raffaello mplm 110early on the day commander ferguson and pilot hurley also spent some time working to successfully repair the door that gives the crew access to the li oh canisters mission specialist magnus spent about an hour and a half in the morning taking microbial air samples on various locations in the space station the collected samples will be returned for study and further analysis magnus also worked the japanese experiment module remote manipulator system jemrms mission specialist walheim along with station crew member mike fossum continued work with spacewalking equipment in the quest airlock some of them will be left on the station and will be utilized during an upcoming russian spacewalks on 3 august 2011 hurley working with station crew member
