in 1967 a few years after the first working laser was invented endre mester in semmelweis university budapest hungary wanted to test if laser radiation might cause cancer in mice 1 he shaved the dorsal hair divided them into two groups and gave a laser treatment with a low powered ruby laser 694 nm to one group they did not get cancer and to his surprise the hair on the treated group grew back more quickly than the untreated group this was the first demonstration of laser biostimulation since then medical treatment with coherentlight sources lasers or non coherent light lightemitting diodes leds has passed through its childhood and adolescence currently lowlevel laser or light therapy lllt also known as cold laser soft laser biostimulation or photobiomodulation is practiced as part of physical therapy in many parts of the world in fact light therapy is one of the oldest therapeutic methods used by humans historically as solar therapy by egyptians later as uv therapy for which nils finsen won the nobel prize in 1904 2 the use of lasers and leds as light sources was the next step in the technological development of light therapy which is now applied to many thousands of people worldwide each day lllt mechanism and application incoming red and nir photons are absorbed in cell mitochondria producing reactive oxygen species ros and releasing nitric oxide no which leads to gene transcription via activation of transcription factors nf b and ap1 source lowlevel lasers are also called cold lasers soft lasers biostimulation lasers lowintensity lasers etc lowlevel laser therapy lllt is the use of a lowpowered laser that emits specific wavelengths of light in the visible red andor far infrared range for therapeutic purposes this involves the application of low power light to areas of the body in order to stimulate healing it is also known as cold laser soft laser or low intensity laser the reason why the technique is termed lowlevel is that the optimum levels of energy density delivered are low when compared to other forms of laser therapy as practiced for ablation cutting and thermally coagulating tissue more controlled research into the effects of low level laser is currently being conducted in various european centres and in japan knee injuries and conditions treated by lowlevel laser include tendonitis bursitis meniscus tears runners kneechondromalacia patella knee joint effusion iliotibial band syndrome osgood schlatters disease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis low level laser therapy for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis a metaanalysis lucie brosseau vivian welch george wells peter tugwell robert de bie arne gam katherine harman beverley shea and michelle morinobjective osteoarthritis oa and rheumatoid arthritis ra affect a large proportion of the population low level laser therapy lllt was introduced as an alternative noninvasive treatment for ra and oa about 10 years ago but its effectiveness is still controversial we assessed the effectiveness of lllt in the treatment of ra and oa results in patients with ra relative to a separate control group lllt reduced pain by 70 relative to placebo and reduced morning stiffness by 275 min 95 ci –520 to –29 and increased tip to palm flexibility by 13 cm 95 ci –17 to –08 conclusion lllt should be considered for short term relief of pain and morning stiffness in ra particularly since it has few side effects lowlevel powers use very low power and no heating of or damage to the tissue occurs lowlevel laser treatment increases cell metabolism karu has shown that visible and nearinfrared radiation is absorbed in the respiratory chain molecules in the mitochondria eg cytochrome c oxidase which results in increased metabolism which leads to signal transduction to other parts of the cell including cell membranes and ultimately to the photo response eg stimulation of growth karu t i 2003 lowpower laser therapy in biomedical photonics handbook t vo dinh ed crc press boca raton fl 48 pp 125lowlevel lasers emit light in the red and infrared range red and infrared light penetrate deeply into human tissue where the light energy is absorbed and turned into biochemical energy by increasing cellular energy in the treated area lowlevel laser therapy is believed to speed healing and reduce inflammation and pain there are no known side effectslasers are not magical it is the light that they produce that yields the biological effect how does it work photons which are particles of electromagnetic energy are emitted from the low power laser these particles enter the tissues and are absorbed in the mitochondria which are tiny structures within the substance of each individual cell the energy is converted to chemical energy within the cell the permeability of the cell membrane changes which in turn produces various physiological effects these physiological changes affect a variety of cell types including macrophages fibroblasts endothelial cells and mast cells lowlevel laser therapy lllt photobiological techniques are sometimes less invasive than those used in other areas of science allowing the sample to respond without incurring much damage it is no coincidence that two of the most important macromolecules in biology  dna and chlorophyll  respond readily to light in fact absorption of light by plants is the driving force for much of the life on earth cold laser therapy is a treatment whereby a cold laser is utilized to treat chronic and acute pain cold laser therapy is used for persons suffering from back and neck pain musculoskeletal pain joint pain associated with arthritis fibromyalgia tendonitis busiitis neuropathy achilles tendon pain migraine headaches sprains and strains carpal tunnel and other associated pains cold laser therapy is also used in the treatment of conditions such as tmj reflex sympathetic dystrophy rsd and other inflammatory and scarring conditions what is it used for lowpower laser therapy is used by physical therapists to treat a wide variety of acute and chronic musculoskeletal aches and pains by dentists to treat inflamed oral tissues and to heal diverse ulcerations by dermatologists to treat edema nonhealing ulcers burns and dermatitis by orthopedists to relieve pain and treat chronic inflammations and autoimmune diseases and by other specialists as well as general practitioners laser therapy is also widely used in veterinary medicine especially in racehorsetraining centers and in sportsmedicine and rehabilitation clinics to reduce swelling and hematoma relieve pain improve mobility and treat acute softtissue injuries lasers and leds are applied directly to the respective areas eg wounds sites of injuries or to various points on the body acupuncture points muscletrigger points cold laser therapy whether using low intensity radiation in the visible or nearinfrared region can be beneficial in a number of clinical situations from pain remission to wound healing unfortunately the absence of this type of phototherapy from the mainstream of medicine makes it unavailable to patients who could benefit from it soft tissue injuries including sprains and strains tendonitis and haematomas joint conditions including arthritis tenosynovitis and capsulitis chronic pain including trigeminal neuralgia and chronic neck and back pain wound management including skin ulcers pressure sores and burns skin infections including cold sores warts verruca the laser may also be focussed on acupuncture points to assist with smoking cessation and the relief of short or longterm pain lllt for central nervous system cns neurological disorders nir light can penetrate through the skull into the brain reducing neuronal cell death reducing inflammation and increasing the likelihood of neurogenesis the retinal nerves and the spinal cord are classified as part of the cns and light is delivered for similar reasons into the eye or to the neck or back at the site of the spinal cord lesion source lllt for pain relief inflammation and healing in recent years there has been growing interest in the use of laser biostimulation as a therapeutic modality for pain management strong 2002 alterations in neuronal activity have been suggested to play a role in pain relief by laser therapy many published reports document the positive findings for laser biostimulation in pain management this level of evidence relates to chronic neck pain chow et al 2005 tendonitis bjordal et al 2006 chronic joint disorders bjordal et al 2003 musculoskeletal pain gerber et al 2001 and chronic pain aronoff 1999 randomised controlled trials provide evidence for the efficacy of laser therapy in chronic low back pain frazer et al 2003 lllt significantly improves wound healing in both diabetic rats and diabetic mice lllt was also effective in xradiation impaired wound healing in mice furthermore the total collagen content was significantly increased at 2 months when compared with control wounds the beneficial effect of lllt on wound healing can be explained by considering several basic biological mechanisms including the induction of the expression of cytokinesis and growth factors known to be responsible for the many phases of wound healing figure below shows the mechanism of lllt on wound healing lucas et al 2002 lllt for wound healing cells in the wound respond to light induced reactive oxygen species ros leading to the expression of growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta tgf and platelet derived growth factor pdgf which encourage synthesis of more collagen increased formation of blood vessels and less inflammation all of which increase wound healing source most health care plans do not cover lllt because the fda considers lllt investigational experimental and unproven though approved for use since 2002 by the fda more large clinical trials that follow stringent scientific guidelines are needed though there have been many trials they have been considered inadequate 1the cost of one treatment is typically about 50 with an average of 10 treatments given the number of lllt treatments needed depends upon the condition being treated the severity of the condition and individual response the effect of lowlevel laser therapy is accumulative though some people have immediate results improvements are often not noticed until after 35 treatments now you can own your own system for the approximate cost of treatments cold laser therapy increases serotonin levels which allow the body to heal itself cold laser therapy is nonthermal and noninvasive a combination of cold laser and electric stimulation cold laser therapy is one of the most effective healing therapies in the medical community today completed in one to three sessions cold laser therapy is not only significant in reducing treatment times it is cost effective as well therapeutic principleour semiconductor laser therapeutic instrument has been
