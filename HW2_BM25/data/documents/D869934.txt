1926 in this picture of the first shot the mark 10 torpedo with the experimental exploder ran underneath the target without exploding the second test shot exploded under the target submarine and sank it although the navy conducted other tests those tests were nondestructive the torpedoes would not be damaged by the tests the design of the mark 14 started in january 1931 the navy allocated 143000 for its development 3 the mark 14 was to serve in the new fleet submarines and replace the mark 10 which had been in service since world war i and was standard in the older r and sboats although the same diameter the mark 14 was longer at 20 ft 6 in 625 m and therefore incompatible with older submarines 15 ft 3 in 465 m torpedo tubes later in the war bu ord stopped producing mark 10s for the sboats and provided a shortened mark 14 4torpedoes consist of several subsystems and those subsystems evolved over time torpedoes are also tailored for their application submarine torpedoes such as the mark 14 are constrained by the dimensions of the submarines torpedo tubes 21 inches in diameter and a certain maximum length submarines are expected to close with their targets so the torpedoes do not need a long range in contrast torpedoes fired by destroyers need greater range because their approach would be under fire from their targets improvements in the propulsion engine power output allowed the mark 14 to have a top speed of 46 knots compared to the mark 10 mod 0s 30 knots 5 steering is controlled by a gyroscope the gyro on the mark 10 mod 0 was spun up in the torpedo tube and was not powered after launch the gyro on the mark 14 was continuously powered by its air flask the depth control on the mark 10 was slow — the depth would not stabilize quickly the mark 14 depth stabilization was improved  citation neededthe design for the mark 6 exploder used in the mark 14 torpedo had started at the naval torpedo station nts newport in 1922 ships armor was improving with innovations such as torpedo belts and torpedo blisters bulges to circumvent these measures torpedoes needed larger warheads or new technology one option would use a fairly small warhead 6 7 but was intended to explode beneath the keel where there was no armor 8 this technology required the sophisticated new mark 6magnetic influence exploder which was similar to the british duplex 9 and german 10 models all inspired by german magnetic mines of world war i 8 the mark 14 shared this exploder with the concurrentlydesigned surface ship mark 15 torpedo 1the mark 6 exploder designated project g53 11 was developed behind the tightest veil of secrecy the navy had ever created 11 exploders were tested at the newport lab and in a small field test aboard uss raleigh 12 at ralph christies urging equatorial tests were later conducted with uss indianapolis which fired one hundred trial shots between 10°n and 10°s 13 and collected 7000 readings 14 the tests were done using torpedoes with instrumented exercise heads an electric eye would take an upwardlooking picture from the torpedo the magnetic influence feature would set off some gun cotton 13 inexplicably no live fire trials were ever done with production units chief of naval operations william v pratt offered the hulk of cassin class 15 destroyer ericsson 14 but prohibited the use of a live warhead and insisted the bureau of ordnance commonly called bu ord pay the cost of refloating her if she was hit in error 14 these were strange restrictions as ericsson was due to be scrapped 16 bu ord declined 14 a service manual for the exploder was written—but for security reasons not printed—and locked in a safe 14torpedoes were sophisticated and expensive the cost of a torpedo in 1931 was about 10000 equivalent to 161000 in 2017 17 the development of the mark 13 mark 14 and mark 15 torpedoes was done frugally the navy did not want to do live fire tests that would destroy a 10000 torpedo the navy was also reluctant to supply target ships consequently there were no livefire tests and the designers had to rely on their judgment sadly that judgment sometimes led to problems a contact exploder that worked reliably at 30 knots 15 ms failed at 46 knots 24 ms in addition the navy had limited experience in using torpedoes in combat 18supply and production  editunited states torpedo production during world war iithe u s navy has a long history of torpedo supply problems in 1907 the navy knew there was a problem with torpedo supply a major contractor the e w bliss company could produce only 250 torpedoes per year 19 during world war i the navy had almost 300 destroyers that each had 12 torpedo tubes 20 the bliss company was to produce about 1000 torpedoes for the navy but that production was delayed by demands for artillery shells and only 20 torpedoes were close to being shipped before wwi started for the u s 21 when war was declared on germany another 2000 torpedoes were ordered in order to produce large numbers of torpedoes the government loaned 2 million to bliss company so it could build a new factory although the government had ordered 5901 torpedoes only 401 had been delivered by july 1918 22 the supply problems prompted the navy to build the u s naval torpedo station alexandria va but wwi ended before the plant was built the plant produced torpedoes for five years but was shut down in 1923 in 1923 congress made nts newport the sole designer developer builder and tester of torpedoes in the united states no independent or competing group was assigned to verify the results of mark 14 tests the navy had not learned from the torpedo supply lessons of wwi looking back in 1953 the bureau of ordnance stated production planning in the prewar years was also faulty torpedoes were designed for meticulous smallscale manufacture when military requirements demanded that they be supplied in large numbers a series of new problems was exposed there were simply no realistic plans available for providing the weapon in adequate quantity 23 there was little interest in torpedo production until 1933 when the vinson shipbuilding program recognized the need for torpedoes to fill the torpedo tubes on its newly constructed ships 24 consequently newport received new production equipment and an increased budget 25 nts produced only 1½ torpedoes a day in 1937 despite having three shifts of three thousand workers 26 working around the clock 27 production facilities were at capacity and there was no room for expansion 26by january 1938 unfilled torpedo orders at newport amounted to 29000000 a forecast that did not include war estimated newport would have a backlog of 2425 torpedoes by 1 july 1942 25 more production was needed the simplest route was to reopen the alexandria torpedo station but new england congressmen objected to reopening alexandria they wanted production concentrated in new england the navy sidestepped the opposition by including the alexandria funds as part of the naval gun factory s 1939 budget 25 the naval torpedo station at keyport washington was also expanded although torpedo production was still low – 3 a day – when the national emergency was proclaimed in september 1939 an investment of almost 7000000 assured early improvement 28 by the fall of 1941 alexandria had been reopened 29 the required production rate for torpedoes was raised to 50 per day both newport and alexandria went to 3 shifts operating 7 days per week but their combined torpedo production was 23 torpedoes per day 28 the navy contracted with the american can company to produce torpedoes the short supply of mark 14 torpedoes was compounded by a 10 december 1941 japanese air raid on cavite navy yard the attack destroyed 233 mark 14 torpedoes 30after the u s entered the war the contract with american can was expanded and pontiac motor company international harvester e w bliss company and precision manufacturing co were brought in as contractors in may 1942 westinghouse electric corporation was asked to build an electric torpedo which would become the mark 18 torpedo  31only two thousand submarine torpedoes were built by all three navy factories newport alexandria and keyport during 1942 26 27 this exacerbated torpedo shortages the pacific fleet submarine force had fired 1442 torpedoes since war began 32 until the spring of 1945 supply was a problem for the mark 14 torpedo 33the torpedo shortage at the start of the war also meant that commanders did not want to waste torpedoes on testing controversy  editcaptain theodore westfall nts co and captain carl bushnell of the bureau of ordnance inspect a mark 14 torpedo at the naval torpedo station keyport washington 1943 34the mark 14 was central to the torpedo scandal of the u s pacific fleet submarine force during world war ii inadequate production planning led to severe shortages of the weapon the frugal depressionera peacetime testing of both the torpedo and its exploder was woefully inadequate and had not uncovered many serious design problems torpedoes were so expensive that the navy was unwilling to perform tests that would destroy a torpedo furthermore the design defects tended to mask each other 35 much of the blame commonly attached to the mark 14 correctly belongs to the mark 6 exploder these defects in the course of fully twenty months of war were exposed as torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target prematurely exploded or struck targets with textbook right angle hits sometimes with an audible clang and failed to explode 36responsibility lies with the bu ord which specified an unrealistically rigid magnetic exploder sensitivity setting and oversaw the feeble testing program its pitiful budget did not permit live fire tests against real targets instead any torpedo that ran under the target was presumed to be a hit due to the magnetic influence exploder which was never actually tested 36 therefore additional responsibility must also be assigned to the united states congress which cut critical funding to the navy during the interwar years and to nts which inadequately performed the very few tests made 37 bu ord failed to assign a second naval facility for testing and failed to give newport adequate direction problems  editthe mark 14 torpedo had four major flaws it tended to run about 10 feet 30 m deeper than set the magnetic exploder often caused premature firing the contact exploder often failed to fire the warhead it tended to run circular failing to straighten its run once set on its prescribed gyroangle setting and instead to run in a large circle thus returning to strike the firing ship 38some of these flaws had the unfortunate property of masking or explaining other flaws skippers would fire torpedoes and expect the magnetic influence exploder to sink the target ship when the torpedoes did not explode they started to believe the magnetic influence exploder did not work against orders some submariners disabled the magnetic influence feature of the mark 6 exploder  citation needed suspecting it was faulty and went for contact exploder hits such efforts would confuse the issues looking back in 1953 the bu ord speculated many shots planned for impact against the side of a ship missed because of deep running yet damaged the enemy due to the magnetic influence feature of the mark 6 39 when later tests discovered the torpedoes ran deeper than set the submarine command then believed that the torpedoes ran so deeply that the magnetic influence exploder could not sense the target ship the failure to explode had been due entirely to the depth setting and that nothing was wrong with the magnetic influence exploder when the depth issue was fixed the magnetic influence exploders premature detonation made it seem like the exploder was working but little damage would be done to the target ship it was only after the magnetic influence feature was deactivated that problems with the contact exploder would be discernable running too deep  editon 24 december 1941 during a war patrol commander tyrell d jacobs in sargo fired eight torpedoes at two different ships with no results when two additional merchantmen came in view jacobs took extra care to set up his torpedo shots he pursued the targets for fiftyseven minutes 40 and made certain the tdc bearings matched perfectly before firing two torpedoes at each ship from an average range of 1000 yd 910 m the shots should have hit but all failed to explode 41a few days after he discovered the torpedoes were running too deep and corrected the problem 42 jacobs detected a big slow tanker again his approach was meticulous firing one torpedo at a close range of 1200 yd 1100 m it missed exasperated jacobs broke radio silence to question the mark 14s reliability 43a similar experience happened to pete ferrall in seadragon who fired eight torpedoes for only one hit and began to suspect the mark 14 was faulty 44deep running torpedoes had been seen before in january 1942 bu ord told the fleet that the mark 10 torpedo ran 4 feet 12 m deeper than set 4 the reasons for deeper running are not explained but the mark 10 torpedos speed had been increased from 30 to 36 knots its warhead had been increased from 400 pounds to 497 pounds of tnt and its guidance package had been updated 45lockwoods depth tests  editshortly after replacing john e wilkes as commander of southwest pacific submarines in fremantle western australia 46 newly minted rear admiral 46 charles a lockwood ordered a historic net test at frenchman bay on 20 june 1942 47 eight hundred torpedoes had already been fired in combat 47 more than a years production from nts jim coe s skipjack fired a single torpedo with an exercise head from a distance of 850 yards 780 m despite being set for a depth of 10 ft 30 m the torpedo pierced the net at a depth of 25 ft 76 m 48 james fife jr formerly chief of staff to comsubas wilkes whom lockwood was replacing 49 followed up the next day with two more test shots fife concluded the torpedoes ran an average 11 ft 34 m deeper than the depth at which they were set bu ord was not amused 48 neither was the cno admiral ernest j king who lit a blowtorch under the bureau of ordnance 50 the fact that destroyers mark 15s were suffering the same failures may have had something to do with it as well on 1 august 1942 bu ord finally conceded the mark 14 ran deep and six weeks later that its depthcontrol mechanism had been improperly designed and tested  6depth explanation  editthe mark 14 torpedo tended to run some 10 feet 30 m too deep for several reasons the first was that it was tested with an exercise warhead that was more buoyant than the warhead that was a precaution made to avoid losing an expensive torpedo a light exercise head made the torpedo positively buoyant so it would float to the surface at the end of its run the live warhead contained more mass so it reached equilibrium at a lower depth 51 also the depth mechanism was designed prior to the warheads explosive charge being increased making the torpedo even heavier overall testing conditions became more and more unrealistic obscuring the effect of the heavier warhead on depth performance 52 furthermore the depth testing device used by nts to verify the torpedos running depth the depth and roll recorder had the same measuring port placement error as the mark 14s depth control port so both were off by the same amount in the same direction and gave the impression that the torpedo was running at the desired depth when it was actually much deeper 53 after hearing of the deeprunning torpedo problem most submarine skippers simply set their torpedoes running depth to zero 54 which risked broaching the torpedo torpedo depth is a control problem good depth control requires more than just measuring the torpedos depth a depth control system that used just depth measured by a hydrostat to control the elevators would tend to oscillate around the desired depth whitehead in fiume supplied many of the worlds navies and it had trouble with depth control until it developed the balance chamber with pendulum  pendulumandhydrostat control  the balance chamber had water pressure push against a disk that was balanced by a spring the inclusion of a pendulum stabilized the mechanisms feedback loop 55 this development known as the secret was around 1868 56depth control in early torpedoes such as the mark 10 had been done with a pendulum mechanism that limited the torpedo to shallow pitches of less than 1 degree the shallow angle meant that it could take a long time for a torpedo to stabilize at its desired depth 33 for example to change depth by 30 feet 91 m on a 1° slope takes a horizontal run of about 1800 feet 550 m the improved uhlan mechanism uhlan gear for depth control had much faster depth stabilization and had been introduced in the mark 11 torpedo 57when the uhlan gear was incorporated in the mark 14 design the pressure sensing port for the depth mechanism was moved from its position on the cylindrical body to the coneshaped tail section the designers did not realize that move would affect the pressure readings 58 this repositioning meant that when the torpedo was moving a hydrodynamic flow effect created a substantially lower pressure at the port than hydrostatic depth pressure the torpedos depth control engine therefore thought the torpedo was too shallow depth and responded by trimming the torpedo to run deeper a laboratory test such as immersing a nonmoving torpedo in a pool of water would not be subject to the flowinduced pressure change and would show the torpedo trimmed at the desired depth dynamic tests using exercise heads with depth and roll recorders would have shown the depth problem but the depth measuring port suffered from the same placement problem and gave consistent though incorrect measurements 53 the problem was also exacerbated by higher speeds the depth problem was finally addressed in the last half of 1943 by relocating the sensor point to the midbody of the torpedo where hydrodynamic effects were minimized 59magnetic influence exploder and premature explosions  editmark 6 mod 1 exploder used early in the war 60 later on it was replaced with the mark 6 mod 5 by august 1942 the faulty running depth situation was resolved and submarines were getting more hits with the mark 14 however curing the deeprunning problem caused more prematures and duds even as more hits were being achieved the number of sinkings did not rise 61the deep running torpedoes would explain many warshot misses a torpedo running too deeply under the target would not allow the magnetic influence exploder to detect the target getting the torpedoes to run at the correct depth would presumably fix the problem of the torpedoes failing to explode this explanation satisfied lockwood and robert h english then comsubpac  62 who both refused to believe the exploder could also be defective 6 in august 1942 the submarine commands believed mistakenly that the torpedo reliability problem was solved the skippers however continued to report problems with the mark 14 suspicion about the magnetic influence exploder grew on 9 april 1943 uss tunny attacked an aircraft carrier formation ultra intercepts disclosed that all three torpedoes fired at the second carrier were premature explosions 63 the commanding officer stated the shallow depth setting thus caused the torpedo to reach the activating flux density of the exploder some fifty meters from the target 64on 10 april uss pompano attacked japanese aircraft carrier shokaku by firing six torpedoes there were at least three premature explosions and the aircraft carrier was not damaged 65on 10 april 1943 bureau of ordnance chief admiral blandy wrote lockwood that the mark 14 was likely to explode prematurely at shallow depths 65 blandy recommended that the magnetic influence feature be disabled if torpedoes were fired for contact hits bu ord also concluded that the mark 14s arming distance of 450 yards was too short an arming distance of 700 yards would be needed for most torpedoes to stabilize their course and depth bu ord also believed the mark 6 magnetic influence feature was less effective below 30°n latitude and did not recommend its use below 30°s latitude 66on may 8 1943 lockwood made a list of torpedo failures gleaned from ultra intercepts 67on 10 june 1943 uss trigger fired six torpedoes from 1200 yards at the aircraft carrier hiyo two torpedoes missed one exploded prematurely one was a dud and two hit the carrier was damaged but made it home 68uniquely lieutenant commander john a scott in tunny on 9 april 1943 found himself in an ideal position to attack aircraft carriers hiyo junyo and taiyo from only 880 yd 800 m he fired all ten tubes hearing all four stern shots and three of the bows six explode no enemy carrier was seen to diminish its speed though taiyo was slightly damaged in the attack much later intelligence reported each of the seven explosions had been premature 37 the torpedoes had run true but the magnetic feature had fired them too early 69many submarine commanders in the first two years of the war reported explosions of the warhead with little to no damage of the enemy the magnetic exploders were triggering prematurely before getting close enough to the vessel to destroy it earths magnetic field near nts where the trials limited as they were 70 were conducted differed from the areas where the fighting was taking place submarine skippers believed that about 10 percent of their torpedoes prematurely exploded bu ord statistics had the premature explosions at 2 percent 71deactivation  editat pearl harbor despite nearly all his skippers suspicions about the torpedoes 72 rear admiral thomas withers jr refused to deactivate the torpedos mark 6 exploder arguing torpedo shortages stemming from inadequate production at nts made it impossible 73 as a result his men did it on their own doctoring their patrol reports and overstating the size of ships to justify using more torpedoes 74only in may 1943 after the most famous skipper in the sub force dudley w mush morton turned in a dry patrol did admiral charles a lockwood commander submarine force pacific  comsubpac  accept the mark 6 should be deactivated but waited to see if bureau of ordnance commander admiral william spike blandy might yet find a fix for the problem 75 the bureau of ordnance sent an expert to surabaja to investigate who set the gyro backwards on one of sargo  s trial torpedoes the potentially deadly setting guaranteed to cause erratic running was corrected by torpedo officer doug rhymes though he found nothing wrong with maintenance or procedures the expert submitted a report laying all the blame on the crew 76in late june 1943 rear admiral lockwood by then comsubpac asked commanderinchief of the pacific fleet cincpac chester nimitz for permission to deactivate the magnetic exploders the next day 24 june 1943 cincpac ordered all of his submarines to deactivate the magnetic exploder 77rear admiral christie who had been involved in the development of the magnetic influence exploder was now commander of the australianbased submarines in the south west pacific area and not in nimitz chain of command christie insisted his areas submarines continue to use the magnetic exploder 78 at the end of 1943 admiral thomas c kinkaid replaced admiral arthur s carpender as commander allied naval forces south west pacific area christies boss and ordered christie to deactivate the magnetic influence exploder 79premature explosion explanation  edita torpedo may take a long time before it settles on its final course if the torpedo direction is still changing when the torpedo arms it may set off the magnetic influence exploder in 1939 before the war started for the u s bu ord knew the magnetic influence exploder was suffering from unexplained premature detonations 80evidence of that fact came in 1939 when newport reported to the bureau that the exploder was giving unexplained prematures admiral furlong arranged for a physicist to visit the station and investigate the failures for approximately a week the scientist and his assistants worked with the device four sources of prematures were uncovered even more significant the investigator reported to the bureau that the responsible engineers at newport were not employing proper tests on the mark 6 corrective steps were ordered by the chief but subsequent events proved that the remedial action like the original tests was inadequate there were two common types of premature explosions in the first the warhead exploded just as it armed these premature explosions were easily discerned by the submarine because the torpedo exploded before it had a chance to reach its target in the second the warhead exploded just before reaching the target ship but far enough away that it did no damage the skipper looking through the periscope could see the torpedo run right to the ship and see the explosion the crew could hear the high order explosion everything would look ok except that the target ship would get away with little or no damage sometimes the submarine command would hear about these premature explosions from intercepted enemy communications 81both premature explosion types could result from the magnetic influence exploder if a torpedo was still turning to get on course or had not stabilized its depth when the warhead armed the exploder could see a magnetic field change and detonate as the warhead approached the target it could sense a change due to the ships effect on the earths magnetic field thats a desired effect if the torpedo is set to run under the ship but not a desirable effect when the torpedo is set to hit the side of the ship another explanation for early premature explosions was electrical failure due to leaking gaskets 82the second type of premature explosion masked contact exploder failures skippers firing the torpedo for a contact exploder hit on the side of the target would see an explosion and believe the contact exploder worked but the explosions were triggered not by the contact feature but rather by the magnetic influence feature at a distance far enough from the hull to cause little or no damage contact exploder  editdetail of mark 6 exploder for contact operation the collision of the torpedo with the target ship would move the firing ring and release the firing pin stem the firing pin stem would then move vertically powered by the firing spring and detonate the tetrylbooster charge the mechanism worked for lowspeed torpedoes 83 but for the highspeed mark 14 torpedo the same impact deceleration that caused the firing ring to move was also large enough to cause the firing pin stem to bind and fail to detonate the booster inactivation of the magnetic influence feature stopped all the premature explosions 84early reports of torpedo action included some dud hits heard as a dull clang in a few instances mark 14s would strike a japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding the contact pistol appeared to be malfunctioning though the conclusion was anything but clear until running depth and magnetic exploder problems were solved the experience of dan daspit in tinosa was exactly the sort of livefire trial bu ord had been prevented from doing in peacetime it was now clear to all at pearl harbor the contact pistol was also defective ironically a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle as recommended in training would usually fail to detonate the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an oblique angle once the magnetic influence exploder was deactivated problems with the contact exploder became more apparent torpedoes would hit their target without detonating there might be a small explosion when the air flask ruptured due to the impact with the target daspit carefully documented his efforts to sink 19000ton whale factory ship tonan maru iii on 24 july 1943 he fired four torpedoes from 4000 yd 3700 m two hit stopping the target dead in the water daspit immediately fired another two these hit as well with no enemy antisubmarine combatants in sight daspit then took time to carefully maneuver into a textbook firing position 875 yd 800 m square off the targets beam where he fired nine more mark 14s and observed all with his periscope despite the japanese firing at it all were duds 85 daspit suspicious by now he was working with a faulty production run of mark 14s saved his last remaining torpedo to be analyzed by experts back at base nothing out of the ordinary was found 37lockwoods drop tests  editdaspits cruise raised enough of an issue that tests were carried out by comsubpac s gunnery and torpedo officer art taylor taylor swede momsen and others fired warshots into the cliffs of kahoolawe beginning 31 august additional trials supervised by taylor used a crane to drop warheads filled with sand instead of high explosive from a height of 90 feet 27 m the height was chosen so the velocity at impact would match the torpedos running speed of 46 knots in these drop tests 70 of the exploders failed to detonate when they hit the target at 90 degrees a quick fix was to encourage glancing shots 86 which cut the number of duds in half 87 until a permanent solution could be found contact exploder explanation  editthe mark 6s contact exploder mechanism descended from the mark 3 contact exploder both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pins travel was perpendicular to the torpedos travel so the firing pin would be subject to side loading when the torpedo struck its target the mark 3 exploder was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower the mark 10 torpedos speed was 30 knots but even then the mark 3 prototypes had problems with the firing pin binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target the solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding 88 the mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed 46 knots so it would see significantly higher deceleration but bu ord apparently just assumed the contact exploder would work at the higher speed there were no livefire tests of the mark 14 torpedo so there were nolive fire tests of its contact exploder if bu ord had tried some livefire tests of the contact exploder during peacetime it probably would have experienced some duds and rediscovered the binding problem pearl harbor made working exploders by using lighter weight aluminum parts reducing the mass reduces the binding friction bu ord suggested using a stiffer spring the fix that had worked decades before 89 in the end bu ord adopted a ball switch and electric detonator rather than using a firing pin mechanism in september 1943 the first torpedoes with new contact pistols were sent to war 90 after twentyone months of war the three major defects of the mark 14 torpedo had at last been isolated each defect had been discovered and fixed in the field—always over the stubborn opposition of the bureau of ordnance 86circular runs  editthere were numerous reports of the mark 14 running erratically and circling back on the firing boat a circular run sank the submarine tullibee but it may not have been a mark 14 38 91 likewise sargo was almost sunk by a circular but the circular run happened because the gyro had not been installed 38 the subsequent mark 18 torpedo was no better sinking tang the mark 15 torpedo had collars to prevent circular runs but the mark 14 was never given this feature resolution  edittwo mark 14 torpedoes stored in the after torpedo room of the museum ship uss pampanito once remedied sinkings of enemy ships rose noticeably by the end of world war ii the mark 14 torpedo had become a much more reliable weapon lessons learned allowed surface ships such as destroyers to remedy the failings of the mark 15 the two designs shared the same strengths and faults after the war the best features of the improved mark 14 were merged with the best features of captured german torpedoes to create the hydrogen peroxide–fueled mark 16 with a patternrunning option the mark 16 became the standard united states postwar
