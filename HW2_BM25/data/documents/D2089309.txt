1688 degrees fahrenheit is an extremely hot temperature however in metallurgy it is considered a low melting point compared to irons melting point  2786 degrees fahrenheit  the average melting point of brass at 1688 makes it a lowmelting alloy if you have experience in melting tin and aluminum in your metal furnace try melting brass extreme caution must be used but the procedure is similar to melting other metals and you can melt down brass scrap to turn into new treasures things youll need brass scrap or ingots carbon fiberkevlar gloves rubber apron tinted protective eyewear welding apron leather workbooks metal furnace charcoal optionalclaygraphite crucible long metal tongs pouring shank metal mold eliminate all nonbrass parts from your brass items remove all rubber gaskets washers and other fittings if using brass pipes put on your protective gear use gloves made of carbon fiber and kevlar materials to protect your hands from the heat select safety glasses with a tint that will protect your eyes from the fire and molten metals infrared and ultraviolet radiation wear a welding apron to protect your clothing and a pair of leather work boots to shield your feet from any accidental drips of molten metal take all of your materials outside start your metal furnace by igniting the charcoal or pilot light of the gas line let the furnace heat until it is glowing red keep a bucket of water and a fire extinguisher nearby as you may need it in case of emergency flareups after the furnace fire starts to heat up load the crucible with the brass that you would like to melt down use a crucible that is made from a claygraphite mix as metal crucibles may melt during the process lower the crucible into the furnace with a pair of tongs use longhandled tongs made for metal casting place the lid on the furnace let the furnace heat the brass remove the lid with the tongs to check on the brass periodically stoke the fire with charcoal if needed remove the crucible with a pouring shank after the brass has started to smoke and is glowing bright red pour the brass into your mold fill the mold quickly so the brass will not cool before it is inside the mold use caution when pouring that you do not spill any molten metal outside of the mold if you do spill metal pour water from your bucket onto it to cool it immediately
