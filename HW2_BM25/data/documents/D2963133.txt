uchiha sasuke うちはサスケ is the last surviving member of the uchiha clan and the deuteragonist of the naruto series after his older brother uchiha itachi slaughtered their clan sasuke made it his mission to avenge them he is put on team kakashi upon becoming a ninja and competes with his best friend uzumaki naruto as he developes his skills however he defects from konoha so he can have his revenge this leads him to become an international criminal he later helps end the fourth shinobi war after being redeemed by naruto as a nomadic vagabond sasuke returns to konoha now refer to as the  supporting kage  支う影 contents  showbackground sasuke as a infant sasuke is the second and youngest son of mikoto and uchiha fugaku he was born on july 23 therefore his father named him after the third hokages father in the hopes that he would someday be just as strong as a shinobi just like his namesake as an infant sasuke would only allowed itachi and mikoto to hold him without crying but if someone else holds him he would start crying however he would immediately be happy once he was held by his big brother again when he was a toddler while playing with itachi on the front porch sasuke unknowably saw his older brothers sharingan he then continued to hug his older brother after seeing this when itachi is about to leave the house with shisui sasuke asks itachi to play with him but he tells him that has a mission this shocks sasuke overall since itachi promised him that they will play together it was during this time that sasuke would get the forehead poke while being in the village sasuke heard how the villagers blamed naruto for minatos death however sasuke saw naruto run pass him since he heard how they villagers spoke about him in a rudely way but he didnt knew that was naruto and he had called him weird while at the age of 4 he begs itachi to teach him shurikenjutsu itachi tells him hes busy and suggests he asks their father sasuke takes itachis constant claims of business as proof he dislikes him itachi denies it pokes him in the forehead and tells sasuke the next time their parents are off he might have time to spend with sasuke at dinner sasuke asks them about it and they confirm theyll be off visiting mikotos family they offer to take sasuke and are surprised to learn itachi said hed teach sasuke the next day itachi trains sasuke in throwing kunai that night itachi makes them dinner while thinking he overdid it the two sleep outside with itachi tries to teach the meaning of the clans crest but sasuke says he will simply surpass itachi the next day itachi left for a mission during his childhood sasuke grew up in the shadow of his older brother uchiha itachi a natural prodigy who many in the uchiha clan and the village expected sasuke to match or surpass him in talent sasuke himself adored itachi never passing up an opportunity to spend time with him although itachi welcomed his company letting sasuke watch him train and taking him on adventures into the forests itachi never helped sasuke become a better shinobi when asked he would instead poke sasukes forehead and promise to do so some other time which he never would sasuke found this annoying but didnt allow it to blemish his high opinion of his brother when he enrolled into the ninja academy sasuke proved to be the standout of his class consistently getting top grades he encountered sakura as she tries to confess her feeling to him but he says he doesnt know her during a festival he refused to take a flower from ino however he could never meet the same milestones itachi had set resulting in their father paying sasuke little attention aware of this neglect itachi who being increasingly busy tried to stand in for their father by giving sasuke the recognition he craved at times even blackmailing fugaku to spend time with sasuke sasuke as a child as time went on itachi started became distant and cold towards their family culminating in a falling out with much of the uchiha clan on their suspicion that hed killed his best friend uchiha shisui sasuke did not understand the reason for this but he didnt mind the sideeffect his father began taking an interest in his development fugaku taught sasuke how to perform the great fireball technique which he mastered in a week beating itachis own time fugaku stated his pride in sasuke for this accomplishment but at the same time encouraged him not to follow in itachis footsteps nevertheless sasuke was glad to be acknowledge by his father and to finally enjoy his company a week after he master the great fireball technique sasuke told itachi that he was going to go train and asked him to help him but itachi told him that he was too tired however sasuke told itachi that he is never too tire itachi then poked sasukes forehead which surprised him while leaving itachi told sasuke that he would have to train him some other time this annoyed sasuke after hearing this at some point in the past sasuke joined itachi on a mission to catch a wild boar sasuke was wielding a bow and was told by itachi not to hit any vital points however sasuke missed the boar completely eventually they defeated the boar and sasuke apologized for his bad aiming itachi responded by telling him that he needed to train more even though sasuke was clueless that his clan was going to do a coup etat against the village he was seen at the ninja academy beating naruto in a race he told naruto that he was lying about not being serious sasuke also told naruto that hell never defeat him in anything which led for naruto to challenge him to a game of higherjump however sasuke told naruto that he is no match for him while being at home with his mother sasuke discussed with her about the relationship between him itachi and his father he was surprised when mikoto told him that fugaku does cares about him and that he talks about him all the time when she is with him before heading to the ninja academy sasuke told his father that he will awaken the sharingan someday because he is his son while walking to the ninja academy sasuke saw uruchi and teyaki outside their shop he learned a little bit about itachis past from them but was angry that he was itachis age when the former graduated from the ninja academy at the ninja academy sasuke was seen throwing shurikens after a long day of training sasuke returned home that same night to find the streets littered with the bodies of the uchiha he rushed home to notify his family of the uchiha clan massacre only to find itachi standing over the bodies of their dead parents sasuke tried to solicit help and comfort from itachi but itachi responded by using tsukuyomi on him to torment him with visions of him murdering their family horrified by what itachi had done sasuke pleaded for an explanation to which itachi replied that it was to test his own power fearful that he would be next sasuke tried to run but itachi cornered him on the streets and explained to sasuke that he was not worth killing only by becoming stronger such as by acquiring his own mangekyo sharingan could he prove a worthwhile challenge to itachis abilities itachi also lie to sasuke saying that he killed shisui by awakening his mangekyo sharingan which shocked sasuke before leaving itachi encouraged sasuke to hate him to desire revenge and to gain power from that sasuke immediately followed through pursuing itachi and using his newlyawakened sharingan to attack him the attack failed and sasuke passed out but not before glimpsing itachi crying sasuke would forget this had happened for many years sasuke defeats naruto sasuke now one of the last surviving uchiha was alone he spent the first few days after the massacre wandering in his familys compound reflecting on the people who were now gone therefore sasuke officially decided to do what itachi had instructed and dedicated his life to vengeance having no other interest than bringing about itachis death he threw himself into his studies at the ninja academy making no effort to have friends and ignoring all of the girls attempts to gain his affection even though he was still the best student in class sasuke would try to seek comfort on the little bridge where his father taught him the great fireball technique however his deadlast classmate uzumaki naruto disliked sasukes cool personality and the attention he received naruto developed a onesided rivalry in his pursuit to prove himself just to be better than sasuke for his part sasuke thought little of naruto and was usually annoyed by his outbursts however he finally understood narutos pain of being an orphan despite the fact that he never wanted to admit it but even though naruto would look at sasuke with a sad expression on his face by watching him sit on a bridge he would switch to an annoyed expression on his face to show sasuke that he hated him in which sasuke would do the same to him whenever he looked at him however before naruto would start to walk away again both would at times secretly smile at each other indicating they actually wanted to be friends due to their similarities of mainly being orphans including at how hard both worked because of each other ironically for all the attention he received naruto was the only person among his peers who understood sasuke due to the painful experiences he had nevertheless even though sasuke hated irukas class lectures he would pass every single technique that iruka would review this is when sasuke would refer to naruto as dobe in the english version he would call naruto loser while still being the best in his class sasuke notice that hiruzen would always comfort by patting him on his head however at the age of 10 sasuke would develop a habit by saying hn whenever he spoke to his classmates and teachers in the english version he would say hmph to his classmates but at the age of eleven sasuke started to fold his hands together on top of a desk and would place his hands in his pant pockets whenever he walked away personality sasuke smiling as a child sasuke was a happy child eager to please his clan and be worthy of his family name it turns out that his original dream was to join the konoha military police force when he grew up while being in his clans compound he would show great respect to his parents by calling them mom and dad in the english version he would call his parents mother and father sasuke would also show great pride to itachi by calling him brother but in the english version he refers to itachi as big brother whenever he was with uruchi and teyaki he would call them auntie and uncle however all this changed after his entire family was killed by itachi the person he most admired in the world he became cold toward others such as being unmoved by what his classmates think of him and being uninterested in what they do therefore he choose instead to keep things to himself he stopped using japanese honorifics like sensei or sama something considered rude in the japanese language and culture his only goal in life became to take revenge for his familys deaths and by extension acquire the power needed for that revenge his eyes had become darker more intense and a meaner hateful stare than the ones that the villagers of konoha had when they looked at naruto however naruto was able to tell that sasuke was looking at someone else with his hateful eyes despite this naruto played a key role in helping sasuke retain some of his former self by being happy his the main reason that naruto is pushing himself so hard to become stronger early on sasuke despised naruto because he believed his constitution to be weak but as he continued to watch him he came to silently admire narutos strength a strength that reminded sasuke of his brother before the massacre ironically whenever sasuke was with naruto he would call the latter dobe aka  usuratonkachi ウスラトンカチ while naruto would refer to him as teme but in the english version sasuke refers to naruto as loser whereas naruto calls him jerk the only thing he would say to his other classmates was hn in the english version he would say hmph to his classmates sasuke also hated cooperating with teams focusing instead on relentless personal training to become strong he is a talented prodigy in his own right garnering respect and recognition from those around him the pursuit of power difficult enough on its own is something that sasuke repeatedly struggles with whenever he meets new people he makes an evaluation of their abilities those he perceives to be weaker than himself he arrogantly disregards giving them as little attention as possible so that they wont hold him back those he perceives as stronger he fixates over and tries to surpass especially when he believes he should be their equal as a member of team kakashi he is repeatedly exposed to kakashis philosophy that there is strength in teamwork for a time sasuke accepts this and develops an attachment to his teammates to the point where he risked his life numerous times to protect them after a humiliating defeat at itachis hands in part i sasuke concluded his time in konoha with his friends had made him weak and he decided to sever his ties and left to seek the power he desired from orochimaru sasukes curse of hatred has made him more mean and cruel than before prior to sasukes defection kakashi tries to point out the contradiction in sasukes viewpoint he is driven to gain power because of the relationships he lost when his family died yet sacrifices the family he still has team 7 so as to gain that power he is affected by what kakashi says at the time but he decides to make revenge his top priority after defecting sasuke becomes more callous unemotional and confident in himself he allows orochimaru to experiment on him and showed no care for what would happen to him as long as he gained the power to kill itachi however sasuke turns on orochimaru when he concluded that the sannin is no longer needed him and killed him after he used him anyway despite wanting to complete his goal on his own he sought help from karin hozuki suigetsu and jugo who reminds him of team kakashi at first sasuke was unwilling to kill those unrelated to his revenge but after learning the truth about itachi his hatred overcame to him to the point where his chakra became more colder including that he wanted to kill anyone who stood in his way and was willing to kill the innocent among konoha to destroy the village therefore he slaughtered numerous samurai in cold blood when he attacked the kage summit he challenged four of the kage before killing danzo and stabs karin when she is useless to him sasuke also tries to kill team 7 when they try to stop him from pursuing his goal of destroying konoha and believed that he could sever all his bonds by killing naruto soon after he allies with obito and the akatsuki when their goals align however sasuke leaves them without comment when he no longer needs them his abandonment of all his former loyalties and his criminal acts convince his former classmates that sasuke is beyond salvation sasuke gets the chance to question his brothers motives and itachi on the brink of a second death gives straight answers itachi apologizes says that he will always fight for the village but also clarifies that he loves sasuke no matter what this exchange made a sobering impression on sasuke after his final encounter with itachi sasuke is left uncertain about what course to take orochimaru hypothesises this indecision is due to sasuke for the first time being without anybody to tell him what to do sasuke summons the ones who know everything and they tell him a ninja is someone who endures disillusioned by and tired of all of the pain and death that he himself and others have experienced due to the shinobi system sasuke decides that something needs to change from long contemplation sasuke decides that the desire for retribution that drove him for so long is the perfect solution to the worlds problems he thinks that if a single individual what sasuke calls the hokage is solely responsible for making the difficult decisions then killing them and the like for the greater good will make everybody unified in their hatred of that individual he volunteers himself for that responsibility and in order to prepare himself sasuke plans to eliminate what few friendships he still has namely naruto while battling sasuke notes they have both come a long way and now fight for ideals they exhaust themselves to the point that after the battle sasuke asks why naruto always insisted on getting in his way but naruto refusing to give up on saving sasuke from darkness demonstrates while answering that their friendship is too fundamental to who sasuke is and that it cannot be broken including that he feels pain whenever sasuke is hurt upon coming to terms with this sasuke stops fighting the many bonds hes made and ultimately chooses to die so the curse of hatred would die along with him however after further convincing from naruto sasuke chose to live to find redemption rather than die after accepting defeat to naruto and returning to konoha sasuke matures by becoming a genuinely warm and caring person to his friends and comrades according to boruto naruto refers to sasuke as the other hokage due to naruto protecting the village from the inside whereas sasuke supports naruto and protects the village from the outside however sasuke never recognizes himself as a hokage due his past criminal acts and his personal lifelong journey of atonement he also has strong teaching skills similar to the sixth hokage before him as demonstrated by his instruction to boruto and his faith in the younger generation as a whole where naruto falters and claims that things can change sasuke insists that a shinobis heart remains the same one of sasukes most significant bonds is the one he has with his older brother uchiha itachi who by merely being mentioned can elicit strong reactions from sasukes otherwise calm demeanor as an infant itachi was the only person that sasuke allowed to hold him without crying to which he would immediately be happy once he was held by his big brother again sasuke adored itachi when he was a child enjoying his company above all others when itachi murdered the rest of the uchiha clan sasuke was crushed not only by the loss of his family but also by what itachi told him that he had never loved sasuke sasuke devotes years of his life to avenging their family by killing itachi which itachi encourages whenever they meet sasuke is accordingly careful not to follow itachis instructions too closely such as by not acquiring a mangekyo sharingan as he doesnt want itachi to have the satisfaction after itachi dies in battle by sasukes hand he learns that the hateful older brother that itachi seemed to be was an act including that in truth sasuke was the most precious person to itachi his murder of the uchiha was done as instructions of konoha in order to protect sasuke sasuke becomes overwhelmed by this discovery and starts conspiring against konoha and all its citizens for ruining his and itachis lives even knowing full well it isnt what itachi would want him to do he changes his mind after he is able to speak to a reincarnated itachi adopting some of itachis views he decides to fight for konohas future so that itachis actions arent made meaningless and bases his understanding of the hokage around the decisions itachi made he also starts poking the foreheads of others as a sign of affection something itachi used to always do with him upon being pardoned and able to travel the world sasuke observes the same feelings of mutual pain and joy between him and naruto between others but also recognizes that not everybody has their abilities to preserve such feelings he resolves that people entrust those feelings with them because they have faith that they can endure and that makes them ninjas during his time as a wanderer sasuke was a recluse keeping contact with people to an absolute minimum however he knows he has a lot more he needs to learn this was shown when he singlehandedly defeated kidos anbu squad but not before leaving strong evidence that he was responsible along with not even saying hello to his friends who were also involved with taking down kido and his men sasuke would also maintain a strong sense of pride as shown when him ignored the messages of if he was responsible for plotting to destroy konoha and only returning upon learning that sakura was kidnapped he also briefly had a onesided conversation with kakashi to pridefully boast that only he can protect konoha if naruto was not around and left immediately afterwards without giving kakashi a chance to respond by acknowledging and atoning for his mistakes sasuke was freed from hate and vengeance and able to reflect curiously on his past without vitriol he considers itachi and naruto often two people he credits as his saviors he also uses his missing left arm as a constant reminder of everything he has overcome sasuke reverts back to the type of person he was prior to the massacre being kind to others and displaying a sense of humor but maintaining his aloof exterior although publicly regarded as a hero for his role in the war sasuke feels that his crimes and imperfections out weigh anything heroic he has ever done sasuke first met haruno sakura when they were children in the ninja academy where his good looks caused her to become infatuated with him which later grew into love on his part sasuke was aware sakura had feelings for him but he showed no interest in her and considered her to be annoying after they became teammates they began to interact more and acknowledge each others strengths and weaknesses causing sasuke to think of her as someone he needs to protect despite feeling grateful of how much she is willing to do to make him happy he still abandons the prospect of being with her to pursue revenge and defect konoha by the time the fourth shinobi war gets underway sasuke had becomes so consumed with hatred that he was willing to kill sakura who had never given up on bringing him back home but was left devastated of how cruel he had become after the war a redeemed sasuke apologizes to sakura for how much he hurt her and she tearfully forgives him therefore allowing them to reconcile they later maintain a long distant relationship while he pursues a journey of redemption however sasuke was indecisive of whether to settle in konoha until he learns from narutos letter that sakura never lost faith in him which causes him to return to the village a couple of years later they would eventually travel together during sasuke and sakuras traveling they got married and had a daughter named uchiha sarada due to his mission sasuke is absent for most of saradas childhood although he feels a deep connection to her and sakura upon meeting for the first time in years sasuke failed to recognize sarada and hurted her feelings by refusing to answer her questions about his absence however sasuke admitted his mistakes as a father and was willing to apologize for them sasuke even has strong parenting skills as he trusted saradas abilities enough to let her join in a dangerous battle with him sasuke loves his daughter dearly as he puts her safety above his own and it is shown that he has a strong soft spot for her he shows her great affection by hugging her and poking her on the forehead while promising her that hell come home from returning to his traveling true to being a parent sasuke is prone to being filled with pride upon seeing his daughters growth he is also supportive of her goal to become hokage and not end up like him sasuke is very wary of saradas feelings to the point where he criticizes anyone who upsets her even if he is willing to lie to her if the truth will make her sad or angry sasuke is especially cautious to make sure sarada never learns about his past as a criminal so this way he can make sure that she is not ostracized and will hate him while sasuke is happy in his marriage to sakura he enjoys teasing her by declining to show her affection perhaps sasukes longest relationship is the one hes had with uzumaki naruto the other member of team kakashi as an orphan naruto spent his life alone in much the same way that sasuke did after the uchiha clans assassination despite this similar background sasuke withdrew inwards by focusing on himself whereas naruto looked outwards seeking others such differences within such similarities made sasuke the best student in their ninja academy class and naruto the worst student become natural rivals sasuke refrained from acknowledging their rivalry until he discovered that competition with naruto was an effective way of improving his abilities when naruto starts shows signs of being the strongest in part i sasuke becomes jealous therefore he decides to give him a drive to not only become stronger than itachi but naruto as well since naruto took credit for defeating gaara and had took credit for their land of tea mission the two battle on the hospital rooftop where they almost killed sakura but they were stopped just in time by kakashi after their battle was interrupted sasuke was more angry when he saw that narutos rasengan had caused more damage to the back of a huge water tank at the final valley sasuke admits at the end of part i that naruto is his closest friend a bond he tries to break repeatedly during part ii by killing naruto these attempts on his life never deter naruto instead driving him to become stronger as well by the end of the fourth shinobi war naruto and sasuke are equals with neither one willing or able to decisively defeat the other when they fight past the point of being able to move naruto describes the idea of life without sasuke as painful even referring to him as his brother in that moment sasuke realizes that as with itachi that he had always been jealous of naruto he accordingly surrenders and accepts narutos friendship afterwards sasuke asked naruto to allow him to die in order to break the cycle of hatred including to give kakashi his sharingan but naruto refused and convinced sasuke to stay alive although despite traveling often he still keeps tabs on konoha and returns to protect the village whenever naruto is away though they maintain their rivalry they are on more friendly terms even with sasuke telling narutos son uzumaki boruto that his fathers many seemingly impossible accomplishments enabled him to become hokage although naruto returned sasukes forehead protector he doesnt wear it but it keeps it on his person during his long travels suggesting he values the forehead protector as proof of their friendship before passing it to boruto appearance sasuke is a fairskinned ninja who has onyx eyes and black chinlength hair his hair is spiky in the back with bangs that lengthen as the story progresses as a young child his bangs hung above his eyes later they would hang on both sides of his face too roughly frame his cheeks and later again return to their original style in adulthood his hair completely covers his right eye in boruto naruto next generations sasukes hair has changed yet again  becoming much curlier in appearance during his early childhood sasuke wore a simple longsleeved black shirt with a raised collar and the uchiha crest on the back and black shorts white in the anime sasuke wore the anbu uniform once when he joined itachi on a mission to capture a wild boar sasuke would also wear a dark blue short sleeve long collar vest with a black tshirt inside the vest white shorts and blue sandals during a flashback of naruto and hinatas childhood sometime after his whole clan was murder when iruka asked him and his classmates to write down who they would like to spend their last day with if the earth was destroy or if the moon was falling towards earth sasuke was seen wearing his part i outfit according to senju hashirama sasuke bares a striking resemblance to uchiha izuna sasuke is considered quite handsome as most girls near his age become very infatuated with him at the beginning of part i sasukes clothing consisted of the traditional uchiha clothing a navy blue shortsleeved shirt with a high collar and the uchiha crest on the back and white arm warmers which he stopped wearing after the chunin exams along with white shorts in the last stage of the chunin exams he wore a black onepieced version of this outfit with many small armbelts adorning his left arm and similar bands around both legs as the story progressed the uchiha symbol became smaller and smaller until after he defeats his brother initially sasuke wore a short blueclothed forehead protector with the konoha symbol on the metallic plate after suffering a second defeat from itachi sasuke stopped wearing it for some time he put it back on during the latter half of his battle with naruto at the valley of the end only to let it drop off at the end since then sasuke hasnt worn a forehead protector in part ii sasuke has grown noticeably taller over the two and a half years and more muscular he was first shown wearing a white longsleeved shirt similar in appearance to the lavender longsleeved shirt worn by kimimaro and which was open at the torso with a smaller version of the uchiha crest on his collar he wore dark blue pants with a blue cloth hanging from halfway up his stomach to his knees along with black arm guards that covered his forearms and stretched up to reach his upper biceps he also wore a purple rope belt around his waist tied in a bow in which he carries his sword after battling deidara he switched to a sleeveless dark grey shirt his arm guards were also removed and he started wearing bandages on his wrists under which he wore special armbands with seals where he stores various shuriken he also wore a black cloak with this after he encountered and battled itachi he reverted to a white grey in the anime highcollared shortsleeved shirt similar in appearance to the blue shirt he commonly wore in part i but with a zipper he also wears blue wrist warmers with his shuriken armbands hidden underneath he briefly wore an akatsuki cloak along with this another noticeable trait is that along with this new outfit sasuke began letting his hair hang over his forehead the uchiha crest on the back of his outfit has returned to its original size since his battle with itachi while adjusting to itachis eyes at the mountains graveyard he is seen wearing black uchiha robes similar to those worn by madara in his youth with a belt sash around his waist though he would revert back to his previous clothing after meeting the spirit of otsutsuki hagoromo and receiving his chakra and therefore the rinnegan sasuke also obtained a dark crescentmoon mark on his left palm though he later lost this mark after kaguyas sealing following his final battle with naruto after kaguyas defeat sasuke lost his left forearm though unlike naruto he opts not to have it replaced with a fully manoeuvrable prosthetic forearm sasuke as a young adult two years after the fourth shinobi war sasuke at age 19 wears a navy blue sash that is wrapped multiple times around his head which ties his usually spiky hair down and once again pushes his hair over his forehead when he is no longer wearing the sash his hair remains the way it does he now wears a black highcollared shirt similar to what he wore throughout the majority of part i his right forearm is wrapped in navy blue bandages matching his headband he also wears a tattered light brown poncho with a hood that covers the majority of his upper and lower body and serves the purpose of concealing his missing left arm underneath this poncho sasuke wears a midriffexposing flak jacket similar to those worn in kumogakure which covers his right shoulder as well sasuke is also noticeably wearing three necklaces which are each colored a faded green red and yellow over top of his poncho he now wears tattered light blue pants while his ankles are wrapped in bandages that wrap all the way around his opentoed sandals he also again wields his sword which he conceals under the poncho several years later sasukes appearance has matured greatly with his hair being grown out and his bangs being styled similarly to madaras he dons a black coat with a white shirt underneath it a purple belt black pants and sandals he also is shown wielding a new sword concealed under the coat and carries a purple bag on his right shoulder he once again wears a forehead protector letting it hang from his left hip in boruto naruto next generations sasukes cloak has also changed although virtually identical to his old one with the only noticeable difference being that it no longer has silver buttons on the collar abilities like his older brother itachi sasuke is recognised as a natural prodigy of the uchiha clan graduating at the top of his class in the ninja academy he makes a strong impression on kakashi hatake in the bell test and fights on par with strong shinobi such as haku and gaara in part i powerful individuals have noted sasukes great potential orochimaru offers to help drastically increase his power uchiha madara notes he would have liked to recruit sasuke had he only been born a few years earlier under orochimarus tutelage for twoandahalf years sasuke grows strong enough to fight members of the akatsuki such as deidara and itachi two of the five kage and defeat shimura danzo one of konohas strongest ninja with the six paths chakra he could help overwhelm madara as the tentails jinchuriki and lastly fight naruto who had received six paths sage mode to a standstill before he admits defeat kurama even compared sasukes prowess to that of the sage of six paths as an adult despite losing his left arm he could defeat all the kekkei genkai shinobi of the coliseum without using his sharingan years later his prowess had improved even further deemed as a shinobi of power and skill at legendary proportions capable of taking on the entire world and is considered to be the only equal of naruto as the seventh hokage in power and skill he could despite being weakened force a shin clone to flee and fight off shin himself for a time at full power sasuke could fight on par with otsutsuki kinshiki and help naruto in overwhelming momoshinki after he absorbed kishinki chakra sasukes chakra is quite strong in part because he is the reincarnation of otsutsuki indra though this quality is never really touched upon in part i it is frequently noted in part ii whenever sasukes curse of hatred deepens others remark how much stronger darker and more sinister his chakra becomes his reserves are also quite large enough to use chidori twice a day during part i without aid they increase by part ii as sasuke becomes able to use chidori and related techniques multiple times in a single day as well as summon creatures as large as manda his chakra control though less refined than sakura harunos is nevertheless good in adulthood after losing one of his arms he can use onehanded hand seals taijutsu sasuke is highly capable in taijutsu enough to compete in hand to hand combat against highly skilled practitioners such as kakashi demon brothers and haku on several occasions after copying lees strong fist sasuke advanced his taijutsu enough to create his own manuevers and after months of training with kakashi managed to refine much of it and improve his skill dramatically enough to briefly fight off the sound four and dominate naruto in hand to hand combat training with orochimaru improved his skill even further becoming able to fight off itachi and even duel kakashi on near equal grounds while battered and exhausted he would later stalemate naruto in their final battle despite his skill in taijutsu however it is not his emphasis he predominately uses it to create an opening for ninjutsu or when he runs low on chakra his most consistent physical display is his speed and by extension his reaction time haku remarks on how impressive sasuke is in both regards during their battle after reawakening his sharingan sasuke concentrates on honing his speed and reflexes so that he can react to the sharingans heightened visual information which he accomplishes by imitating rock lees movements his speed has improved enough to be faster than the shield of sand and physically incapacitate opponents before they realize hes even approached them in part ii sakura after reencountering sasuke for the first time in part ii finds the improvement to his abilities unnaturally high and hypothesises that he was given drugs by orochimaru orochimaru is known to have experimented on sasuke enough to make him immune to poisons but its not known what other modifications he may have received he acquires some of orochimarus attributes after absorbing him such as additional chakra reserves a faster healing rate and the ability to shed his body all of which are lost when orochimaru is removed from him sasukes speed dramatically increased by part ii such as being able to cover wide gaps in the blink of when first facing team kakashi in part ii giving his former allies no time to react he was later able to evade both deidaras clay explosions at point blank range on multiple occasions and attacks from the extremely fast killer b and lightning armor clad a though he credited the last to his sharingans ability to read their linear moves he also greatly increased his hand speed able to do many hand seals in a blur and launch weapon strikes just as quickly as seen during his fight with itachi his speed and proficiency with the body flicker technique have also grown considerably able to easily cut his opponents down without them noticing upon awakening his rinnegan and meeting otsutsuki hagoromo and gaining half his power sasuke was able to overwhelm and outpace madara despite him being the tentails jinchuriki a feat which madara praised him for sasuke was able keep this power after awakening it sasuke has shown a high level of stamina and endurance able to endure a consistent string of battles against the samurai two kage and their bodyguards before finally collapsing from exhaustion in a nearblind battered and visibly exhausted state from his latter fight with danzo and overusing the mangekyo sharingan he still had enough stamina to fight against kakashi restrain and disarm sakura and later match narutos rasengan with his chidori his raw strength has also become noticeably greater being able to lift sakura by her throat into the air with a single hand even while exhausted upon clashing with naruto in the valley of the end their physical strength proved to be on par with each other with the impact causing the valleys stones of hashirama and madara to crack by adulthood sasukes physical strength and speed have improved dramatically on par with those of naruto in his six paths sage mode cursed seal in part i sasuke was branded with the cursed seal of heaven by orochimaru when activated the cursed seal forcefully absorbed sasukes chakra replacing it with orochimarus senjutsu chakra which covered his body with a flamelike pattern and granted him enhanced chakra and physical capacity initially the seal would activate and overwhelm sasuke when using chakra or getting emotional making him only able to control it with sheer will after defecting from konoha the sound four advanced sasukes cursed seal letting him unleash and control its power at will when accessing the seals stage two sasukes skin turned dark grey with a black fourpoint starmark between his eyes and across the bridge of his nose his sclerae and irides turned black and yellow respectively except when using his sharingan along with his lips turning blue he also grew clawlike nails and his hair grows to waistlength he could also grow large webbed handshaped wings on his back that allowed him to fly this form granted him further enhanced chakra and physical capacities comparable to narutos onetailed form as a negative effect prolonged usage of the seal corroded sasukes body and mind causing him some pain and darkening his personality however in part ii his training seemingly gained him complete control of the seal able to handle it unhindered for long periods of time and even perform partial transformations at will since itachi removed orochimaru from sasukes body and sealed him the seal was also removed despite this sasukes being still proved compatible with the cursed seals source jugo who since allied himself with sasuke he can benefit from this by having jugos power perform feats like healing sasuke or augmenting his techniques with jugos senjutsu chakra ninjutsu since early childhood sasuke has displayed great skill and use of various ninja tools which has grown and diversified over time he is skilled in the use of wire strings using them for a variety of purposes ranging from rappelling to manipulating the path of his shurikens to ensnaring an opponent and setting them on fire his level with both trap and weaponbased tactics even surprised kakashi during their first bell test in the anime he also used a set of chains to ensnare foes kenjutsu by part ii sasuke became a highly skilled user of kenjutsu and acquired a chokuto which become a major part of his fighting style later on he names his sword as the sword of kusanagi his skill could defeat hundreds of otonin unscathed without killing them as well as kill multiple samurai even deflecting their barrage of chakra blasts sasukes swordsmanship was even acknowledged by mifune a famous sword master after he effectively blocked the samurais attack his lethal swordsmanship is very versatile using impressive speed and precision behind his attacks to leave little time for enemies to react he can effectively wield it in either hand using a normal or reverse grip giving him various attack and defence styles to use he can use his blade as a midrange projectile with great precision by adulthood sasuke becomes skilled enough to instantly switch between wielding his sword backhanded and normally even during a clash shurikenjutsu sasuke is also wellversed in usage of kunai and shuriken showing tremendous aim while still in the academy tactically he can use techniques like hiding a second shuriken in the shadow of the first and control the path of them using wire strings to ensnare an opponent with the strings sasukes aim and tactical skills are almost on par with itachi able to effectively hit targets in a blindspot by accurately deflecting one kunai off another since his battle with itachi in part ii he wears a pair of bracelets with a special seal to instantly summon shuriken and kunai of various size and shape becoming able to unleash a large barrage at a blazing speed that rivals that of his brothers after launching he can perform a sneak attack by rigging the blades to disconnect and launch them into separate directions sasuke can also enhance the cutting power of his weapons by infusing them with his lightning chakra kyujutsu since at a young age sasuke was trained in archery however his aim was not very good at first as he was unable to hit a large boar directly in front of him from a high vantage point as he matured in both age and skill his aim improved to the point of striking targets as quick and elusive as kabuto in his sage mode he now uses this skill exclusively through his susanoo and even incorporates his elemental nature transformations through it for more devastating techniques fuinjutsu sasukes training with orochimaru has given him great skill in fuinjutsu and he is also quite knowledgeable in other seals such as orochimarus cursed seals as an uchiha he is also one of the few who can access the naka shrine during his meeting with hagoromo sasuke was taught a powerful fuinjutsu that when used with naruto was strong enough to completely seal kaguya summoning technique during his training with orochimaru sasuke became able to summon varioussized snakes to aid him in battle even from his sleeves for hidden strikes or bind his opponents with little time to react he was also able to summon snakes from any part of his body he can also summon aoda to aid him in his fight to quickly carry him through the terrain his prowess enabled him to even summon the mightiest of snakes manda some time later sasuke also made an additional summoning contract which allows him to summon hawks once summoned garuda can help sasuke fly about and outmanoeuvre his opponents attacks in the anime he was also of capable of performing coordinated attacks with sasuke nature transformation sasuke shows the great fire ball technique sasuke can utilise all five elemental nature transformations as well as yin–yang release as a recognised uchiha sasuke has great skill in fire release having already mastered his clans rite of passage technique by age 7 this feat impressed kakashi who noted that genin usually require much more experience and developed chakra to perform elemental techniques he can also use his fire techniques in conjunction with his weapon skills he can produce a barrage of giant dragonshaped fireballs that can quickly burn an enemy even with minimal contact chidori sasuke also has a natural affinity for lightning release learning the chidori under kakashis tutelage by using the chidori he is able to easily strike through and severely injure most targets in part ii he had greatly developed his lightning chakra creating many powerful techniques derived from the chidori one of which utilises natural lightning instead of chakra when using his cursed seal or the six paths chakra his lightning chakra becomes darker in colour though its not clear if this changes its actual properties in any way sasuke can also channel his chidori through his weapons mainly his sword for extreme cutting power that also numbs anyone it cuts he even earned praise from the fourth raikage for penetrating his lightning release chakra mode utilising the six paths power sasuke can enhance his chidori allowing him to effectively combat and even bisect madara as the tentails jinchuriki he can also channel his chidori through his complete body — susanoo via its primary left hand once combining his chakra with the tailed beasts through susanoo sasukes lightningnatured techniques his strongest being indras arrow become capable of matching narutos senjutsuenhanced techniques two years after the fourth shinobi war his power and skill with the chidori grew to the point of destroying half of a falling meteor when manifesting his mangekyo sharingan sasuke developed the ability to use a special type of fire release that he dubs blaze release aside from unleashing a wave of unquenchable black flames he can control the movement of the flames and shape them as well as having the black flames surround him and create spikes for protection when gaining his eternal mangekyo sharingan sasuke could combine his blaze release kagutsuchi with susanoo to create amaterasu swords and arrows that can pierce through heavy defences and ignite them as well as a barrage of magatama composed of black flames to handle multiple enemies sasuke could also use his kagutsuchi in his hand for direct usage and infuse it into his chidori sharingan sasuke awakens his sharingan for the first time sasuke first awakened his sharingan on the night of the uchiha clan massacre though he isnt able to do so again until several years later at the start of part i sasukes sharingan is especially potent as orochimaru noted that despite not being fully developed at the time it was even stronger and greater in clarity than itachis later his prowess and skill with his fully matured dojutsu earned him the nickname  sasuke of the sharingan  写輪眼のサスケ with the sharingan sasuke can see the flow of chakra accurately reproduce any movement he sees his own physical skill permitting track fastmoving objects and by the end of part i predict opponents movement to a degree he can also use genjutsu sharingan for broad purposes such as distraction interrogation knocking targets out or placing them under his control he can use his sharingan to relay information to others or enter their subconscious which in the case of jinchuriki allows him to suppress their tailed beasts mangekyo sharingan sasuke awakened his mangekyo sharingan after learning the truth about his older brothers true intentions the tomoe of sasukes mangekyo spread and converge along the edge of its iris taking on the appearance of three intersecting ellipses like most mangekyo sharingan prolonged and regular usage of its ocular powers can deteriorate his vision leading him to see heavy blurs by the time he battled kakashi sasuke ultimately had obito transplant itachis eyes resulting in him acquiring the eternal mangekyo sharingan sasuke not only regained his full eyesight but also obtained additional might from itachis ocular power and no longer experienced the side effects of this dōjutsu with this new form his mangekyo pattern changed gaining a symmetrical more aligned rendition of itachis mangekyo tomoe that is centred within sasukes own the pattern of sasukes eternal mangekyo is known as the straight tomoe 直巴 which gives him an even higher capability of reading his opponents movements and to fluidly act upon with his left mangekyo sasuke can cast unquenchable black flames upon his focal point with amaterasu with his right mangekyo he is able to cast blaze release kagutsuchi to manipulate and extinguish them at will due to this greater degree of control sasukes use of these black flames are said to surpass itachis he has regularly used his right eye for casting genjutsu some powerful enough to break a targets will and paralyse them danzo stated that sasukes genjutsu is incapable of altering the victims perception of time and thus is vastly inferior to itachis tsukuyomi after awakening the powers of both mangekyo sharingan sasuke became one of the few uchiha capable of invoking susanoo with his extreme emotions being the root of its development while initially relying upon different partial manifestations sasuke was soon able to complete his susanoos body it can produce a sword a bow that doubles as a shield and an orb of chakra that conjures the arrows defensively its rib cage could withstand a direct barrage from gaara temari kankurō and darui without any damage offensively his susanoos fist and various weapons are strong enough to destroy many large stone pillars with a single attack and its arrows move at speeds only a sage mode user like kabuto can avoid sasukes armoured susanoo developed during his skirmish against kakashi becoming a similar yet more sinister version of itachis own armoured susanoo and changing the composition of its orb of chakra to that of black flames from which he is able to fashion a number of weapons following the recovery of itachis transplant the final stage of his susanoo underwent a drastic change with scaled hands a beaklike hood and a larger bow with a more shieldlike composition giving it an overall more intimidating appearance during the fourth shinobi war sasuke was able to conjure his susanoo complete with a lower body using jugos sage transformation he can infuse his susanoo with senjutsu chakra which appears as the flame pattern of the cursed seal of heaven covering it upon further syncing with naruto sasuke could stabilise susanoos armoured form into its complete body form and shape it onto narutos senjutsuenhanced tailed beast mode enabling them to cut through obito and his sword of nunoboko after adjusting to hagoromos power he could manifest his susanoo without activating his mangekyo form and even advance the construct to a complete body version in this state it was able to fend off madaras multiple chibaku tensei and later clash with narutos six paths sage modeenhanced tailed beast mode in the boruto movie his susanoo can also be formed around the ninetails in order to give it a sword and armour of its own and serve as a medium through which sasuke uses chidori rinnegan after receiving the six paths chakra sasukes left sharingan evolved into a rinnegan unlike hagoromos his rinnegan has a secondary state that has six tomoe around the eye representing its full power when drained of its power sasukes rinnegan cannot access this state for an extended period of time until after its restoration likewise affecting his mangekyo sharingan 84 as a true wielder sasuke can deactivate his rinnegan at will though this was only after two years of mastering it as a result using the rinnegan repeatedly seems to require sasuke to close his eye to recharge or at least speed it up although it doesnt seem to exhaust him due to his massive reserves overusage will begin straining him as seen in his final battle with naruto and it had to keep it closed for the remainder of the battle as an adult he keeps his rinnegan active constantly without any strain though his rinnegan manifested only in one eye its power is still on par with its dual variant with the rinnegan sasuke gains the ability to touch madaras chakra disruption blades without suffering their after effects 86 as well as see invisible targets black zetsu also alluded that sasukes rinnegan may be the reason for why he was able to resist the influence of the infinite tsukuyomi and why its light could not penetrate through his susanoo furthermore the rinnegan also makes sasuke the only one able to detect traces of kaguyas chakra sasukes rinnegan can still access his left sharingans powers such as amaterasu and susanoo and cast genjutsu strong enough to control all nine tailed beasts at once uniquely he has also gained the ability to transport himself or any target near him within a limited range he can use it to see invisible targets once fully mastered sasuke became able to teleport much greater distances and even between separate dimensions but only a fixed number of times before needing to recharge during which he can once again only teleport in small distances this is noticed when his rinnegan had lost its six tomoe after further adjusting to hagoromos dojutsu sasuke can wield the powers of the six paths technique he could use the deva path to seal all nine tailed beasts each within a chibaku tensei satellite and the preta path to absorb ones chakra through physical contact even with his eye closed yinkurama noted that because sasukes rinnegan was still new at the time he could not absorb and utilise techniques simultaneously using susanoo as a vessel sasuke can control the tailed beasts chakra much like the demonic statue of the outer path briefly overwhelming naruto in their final battle yinkurama also noted that sasukes merger of the tailed beasts chakra was on par with hagoromos separation of the tentails chakra with this his lightningnature techniques applied through susanoo increase greatly in power he can sense narutos chakra through dimensions and accordingly travel dimensions by himself or with others in the boruto movie these interdimensional portals manifest as dark ovalshaped spirals his most frequent usage of his rinnegan is for amenotejikara which allows him to instantly swap places with anything in a specific range intelligence from a young age sasuke repeatedly showed keen instincts and quick decisionmaking skills considered by many to be a genius he is accordingly accustomed to coming up with tactics on the fly choosing whatever approach no matter how elaborate will be most successful at the exact moment his strategies could be considered irresponsible or risky as he has on more than one occasion placed himself or allies in harms way in combat he usually remains on the offensive rarely pausing in his attacks or falling back to regroup despite how he proceeds in the midst of combat sasuke does tend to be prepared before entering a fight or as best as he can he specifically trains to be faster than gaaras sand he has shown tactical sense in teamwork able to instantly understand an allys battle plan with little communication and act accordingly to make it successful sasuke also learn various advanced techniques or utilize basic ones for crafty moves he is a proficient strategist and tactician observing his opponents skills and deducing their workings with ease and accuracy whilst remaining calm and composed likewise he can use his techniques as setups for his largerscale ones even very skilled shinobi such as namikaze minato and madara have noted sasukes impressive analytical skills sasuke is also a very capable leader able to form a team from specific ninja and effectively instruct them to engage an enemy sasuke can develop many powerful techniques on his own all based on the one technique he learned from another such as different taijutsu movies from lees techniques or innovative variations from the chidori he can be rather deceptive capable of tricking older and more experienced shinobi like danzo into confirming the mechanics of their techniques likewise sasuke can use even basic illusions to dangerous effect tricking his opponent into letting their guard down sasuke is a proficient researcher able to wellprepare himself for enemies and their various abilities such as the nature of orochimarus snake techniques and unique cursed seals including attacking orochimaru at the moment when his body is weakest also he equips himself with the lightning flash blade creation so that he can compete with itachi uchihas speed he may even have a strategy in mind that he can work towards throughout a fight as when he spends part of his fight with itachi creating conditions for kirin even relying on itachis own jutsu to facilitate in its use sasuke could also use his sharingan to perfectly sync his chakra with narutos to perform the scorch release halo gale jet black arrow style zero something tobirama noted as extremely difficult sasuke is a capable tracker able to follow itachi even though the latter used a flock of crows to block his vision sasuke is also shown to be very observant quickly noticing sakuras discarded flak jacket in a portal opened by her and obito for only a seconds and transporting to it to reunite with them other skills under orochimarus training sasuke was subjected to the sannins experiments and as a result developed physical enhancements including an immunity towards most forms of poisons after absorbing orochimaru sasuke gained the sannins regenerative powers allowing him to heal at a much faster rate than usual and access orochimarus chakra as extra reserves he could also shed his skin and produce a new body to repair any damage he sustained he is also one of the few uchiha who can access the naka shrine sasuke can also cooperate with others performing a series of precise and coordinated attacks with his brother itachi despite their previous volatile relationship after his meeting with hagoromo sasuke could temporarily use a powerful fuinjutsu alongside naruto which was strong enough to seal kaguya in the anime during tsunades infinite tsukuyomi dream sasuke was shown using his chidori stream technique with shisuis fire as an adult he also demonstrated profiency with the shadow clone technique easily being able to create 8 clones naruto part lintroduction arc team kakashi in his debut sasuke is twelveyearsold and is seen with his classmates as they perform the shadow clone technique required to graduate from the ninja academy after graduation sasuke gets into a glaring contest with naruto when sakura and ino flirt with sasuke but this leads to the two accidentally kissing sasue is placed on team kakashi otherwise known as team 7 along with uzumaki naruto and haruno sakura were forced to mingle while eating lunch alone sasuke gets ambush by naruto through an open window it was then shown that naruto had actually overpowered sasuke and tied him up meanwhile the real sasuke had managed to escape narutos bonds when the real sasuke was looking for naruto he approached sakura where she expressed her jealousy of naruto for having no parents to tell him what to do sasuke stated that those without parents grow up lonely and that sakura made him sick as naruto finally exited the bathroom he ran into sasuke and it seemed as though revenge on sasukes part was imminent naruto uses the kage bunshin no technique to attack sasuke but abruptly all of the clones had to go to the bathroom while sasuke sees this he starts walking away calling naruto a idiot soon afterwards the members of team 7 after a long wait finally met their joninsensei kakashi who used the meeting as an opportunity for them to get to know one another after kakashi and naruto introduced themselves sasuke asserted that he hated a lot of things didnt like anything and that he would someday restore his clan and kill a certain man the next day sasuke met with his teammates for their survival test accordingly hatake kakashi gave them a bell test the three of them being tasked with taking the two bells he kept on his person after naruto and sakura fail sasuke tries to take a bell on his own and using extreme measures to do so such as attacking kakashi who actually used the replacement technique with shurikenjustsu and his fire release kakashi easily defeats sasuke and lectures him to not consider himself superior compared to his teammates sasuke then hears sakura cry out and finds her as she awakens from kakashis genjutsu and freaks out when she embraces him when she suggested they give up sasuke thought of his brother and said giving up wasnt an option because he is an avenger regrouping with his team kakashi explained the purpose of the test was for them to learn teamwork and even though they failed he was willing to give them another chance at working together despite being told not to feed naruto sasuke offered him his lunch or else naruto will grow weak and slow them down as a result of them putting the team before the rules kakashi passed them land of waves arc after a series of mindless drank missions sasukes first major mission was escorting the bridge builder tazuna to his home in the povertystricken land of waves soon after setting out sasuke showed exceptional skill when attacked by the demon brothers even taunting naruto calling him a scaredycat for being shocked and useless during this encounter when they later had a treeclimbing exercise to improve chakra control he managed to stay ahead of naruto for a good length of time but as naruto began to catch up they started to push each others limits his skills improved sasuke was almost able to compete with haku who was extremely dangerous because of his extreme speed and dexterity it was during this battle that sasuke reawakened the legacy of his clan the sharingan and even selflessly put himself in the way of hakus attack to protect naruto from him although he claimed his body had moved on its own his actions showed that he was willing to put himself in mortal danger for narutos sake although it appeared that sasuke had died in the process it was later revealed that he was merely put in a temporary death state after naruto and kakashi with the help of the citrizens of the land of waves get rid of gatos thrugs sasuke and team kakashi pay their respects to the graves of momochi zabuza and haku who were defected by them in battle the bridge of the land of waves was complete and team kakashi returned to konoha while saying goodbye to inari tsunami and tazuna chunin exam arc afterwards team 7 resumed doing drank missions before kakashi offered them to enter in the chunin exams sakura asked sasuke to spend time with her but he declined and preferred to train alone before the chunin exams started sasuke fought rock lee who uses his speed to defeat him with his taijutsu prowess something sasuke lacked and this left sasuke shocked that he lost to a loser like lee however before the finishing blow could be given maito gai interrupted the match and punished his beloved student for using a forbidden technique in a normal fight but not before they lovingly reconciled much to sasuke and his teammates disgust in the first part of the exam which was taking a written test sasuke found the questions too difficult to answer and realized that to succeed in the written test it is required to cheat without getting caught while using his sharingan to copy the pencil movements of a student in front of him sasuke effectively copies the answers upon passing the first round sasuke was surprise that naruto was the only one who didnt cheat in the second test of the chunin exams everyone was placed in the forest of death while inside a different section of the forest the team is attacked by an imposter disgusted as naruto and sasuke decides they need a long hard password to verify their identity afterwards sasuke and the team were attacked by who he thought was kusagakure genin shiore shiore uses genjutsu to paralyze sasuke and sakura with fear however while seeing sakura being afraid sasuke stabs himself in the leg to free himself and get sakura to safety they are then found from hiding by a giant snake and sasuke becomes targeted by shiore until naruto returns sasuke offers to give up their scroll in exchange for their safety but naruto stops him by punching him in the face and calls out to him for being a coward this shocks sasuke and with sakura agreeing with naruto this makes sasuke fight back against shiore and he defeat him however sasuke learns that shiore is actually the missingnin orochimaru who implants his cursed seal on sasukes neck as a reward losing conscious from the immense pain of the seal as it attunes to his body sasuke suffers horrific nightmares before awakening under its influence as he mercilessly defeats the otogakure genin zaku and breaks zakus arms upon learning that he beat sakura while she was caring for him and naruto it took sakuras hug and pleas to snap him back to normal in a flashback detailed in part ii sasuke is revealed to have met karin while saving her from a bear however he lets her be as he didnt need her scroll after passing the second phase sakura tried to get sasuke to give up because of the pain the cursed seal was causing him but he told her to keep quiet about it or else it will mean he lose the opportunity to get stronger while he admits he doesnt care about becoming a chunin he now wants to fight naruto sasukes match up in the preliminaries was against akado yoroi before the fight started kakashi warned sasuke that if his cursed seal got out of control which would happen if he used any chakra he would need to be removed from the competition the match started with yoroi absorbing what little chakra sasuke had left through his hands and with sasuke being in constant pain from his cursed seal knowing that his teammates are worry about him sasuke refuses to give up having only one option and remembering his previous encounter with rock lee sasuke used the lion combo this new technique makes yoroi get knocked out and sasuke advanced to the next round following his win sasuke wanted to match everyone compete in their matches to see who will be in the finals however kakashi took sasuke away to seal the cursed seal but made it a point to tell him that the seal would only remain active as long as sasuke wanted it to not convinced that his words would deter sasuke from using the cursed seal and turning to orochimaru kakashi used the month leading up to the final rounds to teach him the chidori at the same time knowing sasuke would be facing gaara he helped sasuke to emulate some of lees speed after showing up late for his match with gaara sasuke demonstrated the fruits of his training even managing to break through gaaras defences and injure him before the match could finish however it was interrupted by the start of orochimarus attack on konoha invasion of konoha arc with the start of the invasion gaara fled the village with his siblings and sasuke was sent after them by genma sasuke chased them and after short battles with kankuro and temari caught up with gaara before fighting him again however gaara utilises his jinchuriki powers to overpower sasuke before naruto arrives when sakura is knocked unconscious and nearly killed by gaara sasuke told naruto to do whatever he could to save sakura because he didnt want to lose another precious person when naruto and gaara were having their battle sasuke rescued sakura and made sure she was okay before going to assist in the battle but naruto had already defeated and reformed gaara later sasuke and team kakashi with all the other shinobi attended the third hokages funeral mourning his death search for tsunade arc after the failed invasion sasuke went to see kakashi and later was seen reading the stone tablet in the naka shrine when he arrived at kakashis house to see him again he found his teacher in a coma although nobody in the room was willing to tell sasuke of what had happened aoba yamashiro soon arrived and let slip that itachi had returned to the village in search of naruto determined to find itachi sasuke tracks naruto down and finds his brother there despite his best efforts including the use of chidori none of his attacks were able to hit itachi itachi tormented sasuke physically and mentally belittling him for still being too weak eventually leaving sasuke with a broken wrist and mind sasuke then fell into the same tsukuyomiinduced coma as kakashi guy appeared to take sasuke back to konoha however it was not until tsunade returned to konoha and healed him that he regained consciousness a tearfully relieved sakura embraced him and for the first time ever sasuke didnt reject her affection and seemingly accepted it later on during the fireworks display since the fireworks festival is a celebration for tsunade being the current hokage sasuke is seen standing next to his teammates while looking at the fireworks he then starts to feel sakura lean on him but when naruto leans on her sasuke pushes them off him and sakura punches naruto for ruining the event he then looks at sakura after she punched naruto land of tea arc with konoha having a shortage of jonin due to orochimaru’s failed invasion tsunade was forced to use genin for more dangerous mission than normally allowed team kakashi minus kakashi who was assigned to another mission was given the assignment of the escorting a member of land of teas wasabi family through a dangerous annual race as it was rumoured the rival wagarashi family had hired ninjas of their own to sabotage the wasabi family along the way they met an arrogant teenager named idate who openly showed his hatred towards ninja he also showed off impressive speed by running away from team 7 after conning them into paying his bill at a restaurant upon arriving in the land of tea and meeting the wasabi family’s leader jirocho team 7 was shocked to see idate again and learn he was the man they were assigned to escort during the race naruto and idate continued to show their dislike of each other it was also revealed that idate was actually the younger brother of ibiki and formerly a konoha genin they also encountered the three ame genin from the chunin exams after defeating them they encountered aoi rokushō another former konoha shinobi who betrayed konoha t he was also originally idates teacher and the one responsible for idate running away from konoha after barely surviving aoi’s attack idate explained how after he was failed by ibiki himself for the chunin exams aoi tricked idate into stealing a special scroll and the sword of the thunder god from the village being able to relate with idate in both being taken advantage of and the need to have others recognise them naruto helped idate regain his selfworth and continue the race while managing to catch up in the race aoi appeared again and used the thunder sword to initially overpower the team 7 but thanks to sasuke fighting aoi and weakening the sword with his chidori naruto was able to break it when they clashed and defeat aoi with his rasengan with the danger overcome idate was free to continue and win the race for the wasabi family while returning to the village team 7 was escorted by ibiki himself while he did not openly state this fact ibiki was glad that naruto had helped his brother grow as a man since naruto took all the credit for the land of tea mission this made sasuke even more angry at narutos strength and growth sasuke retrieval arc motivated by anger over itachi still being stronger and his jealously to naruto for becoming stronger in a short period of time sasuke begins treating naruto and sakura with contempt even sakura visited him every day in the hospital and took care of him he began ignoring her he eventually forces naruto into fighting him on the hospital roof and berating naruto for acting like hes better to which naruto refutes initially naruto doesnt take the battle seriously and as sasuke begins to fight back with more force they prepare to end the fight with rasengan and chidori before kakashi stops the two as they use their strongest attacks on each other despite a scolding from kakashi sasuke leaves without comment although thinking his chidori did the most damage to a nearby water tower sasuke is shocked to find narutos rasengan obliterated one whole side of it without the structure being compromised after being lectured by kakashi over not using chidori on his own friends and sacrificing his friends to avenge the family he lost is more painful the latter sasuke became conflicted between his desire for power and revenge versus his bond with naruto and sakura sasuke was confronted by orochimarus sound four who have been sent to bring to him to otogakure revealing himself and his comrades being branded with cursed seals with full mastery over them sakon leaves sasuke with the offer to come with them if he wishes to use his cursed seals true potential deciding to take orochimaru up on his offer sasuke prepares to leave the village and is confronted by a shocked sakura as he sneaks out of konoha when asked by sakura for his actions sasuke simply says he is not like her and naruto and that while he considered staying with them he decided that revenge was his priority despite sakuras desperate pleas and confessing her love to him sasuke calls her annoying but sincerely thanks her before knocking her out and joining up with the sound four who soon afterwards advanced his cursed seal to its second level a process that left him unconscious for most of their battle with the sasuke retrieval team soon after sasuke woke up he ran his way towards the valley of the end where he is found by naruto who had learned orochimarus intent to turn sasuke into his next host seeing naruto sasuke announced his decision to sever his ties to his friends and join with orochimaru for power this leads to naruto vowing to bring sasuke back to konoha with force and they start to battle angered by narutos determination to stop him sasuke lashed out that naruto doesnt understand him because naruto never had or lost a family admitting that he has come to see naruto as his best friend sasuke also reveals his intents to kill him to obtain the mangekyō sharingan naruto agrees but says sasuke is the first person he developed a bond with and sasuke says he will simply sever that bond with sasuke gloating that naruto can not even make a scratch on his forehead protector he initially having the upper hand thanks to his cursed seal and sharingan when he managed to pierce narutos right shoulder with his chidori however the ninetails chakra surfaces to protect naruto giving him a massive power increase as he attempts to knock some sense into him sasuke merely retorted that naruto could never understand losing a family as he had never had one to begin with despite naruto feeling that sasuke is like a brother to him and refuses to let him sever that bond sasukes sharingan evolved to its final stage at that point tipping the battle in sasukes favor with sasuke now being able to predict narutos movements however narutos ninetails chakra envelops him in a foxshaped shield of chakra in response sasuke activated the second stage of his cursed seal as both he and naruto clash with their respective empowered attacks clashing with the dome produced from the conflicting energies sasuke defeats naruto with a punch to the chest rather than what remained of chidori but before the dome dissipates while losing consciousness naruto managed to scratch sasukes forehead protector as it falls off of him though considering to kill naruto then and now sasuke begins to have second thoughts and resolves to find his own way to surpass itachi leaving behind his scratched forehead protector which had fallen off after narutos last attack sasuke made his way to orochimaru who decides to train sasuke until the time to make the youth his new host preshippuuden filler arc orochimaru is meeting with amachi a scientist conducting experiments under his direction sasuke is also present and ends their conversation when its directed towards him naruto and sakura host a special recap episode the episode features highlights of five battles from the sasuke retrieval arc the battle between naruto and sasuke on the hospital roof the battle between akimichi choji and jirobo the battle between inuzuka kiba and sakon the battle between hyuga neji and kidomaru and the last battle between naruto and sasuke at the valley of the end there are also interviews with choji kiba and neji who all beat up naruto for making fun of them and saying things like chojis fight made him sweat at the end of the show jiraiya announces a surprise guest — orochimaru — who gives sakura and naruto an opportunity to briefly see sasuke about two years into his training with orochimaru sasuke overheard kabuto talk to orochimaru about needing to transfer a vial for research on suigetsu to the southern hideout sasuke uncharacteristically offered to deliver it himself saying he was simply bored upon arriving at the base and delivering the vile he momentarily meet with suigetsu while he asked sasuke to free him sasuke simply said he had to prove his strength as the medicalnin came in to begin their tests sasuke placed a genjutsu on one of them making the man release suigetsu after which sasuke offered to help karin recapture suigetsu when asking karin why she choses to stay with orochimaru as her sensory abilities could easily evade the sannin she insisted that she will always be hunted but would rather be alongside someone strong soon they found suigetsu and engaged him who fended the duo off with his water techniques ultimately karin subdued suigetsu with her chakra chains pleased with his test sasuke deemed that these two would make useful allies in the future and resolved to win them over naruto shippuuden part llsasuke and sai arc twoandahalf years after leaving konoha sasuke waits impatiently at one of orochimarus hideouts in kusagakure when orochimaru finally returns sasuke demands that he resume their training before complying orochimaru introduces him to sai his replacement in team 7 but sasuke isnt interested sai tries to engage sasuke by discussing naruto prompting sasuke to knock him over with killing intent sai persists telling sasuke that nauto thinks of him as a brother sasuke replies he has only one brother whom he will kill sai tracks him down later as he rests when sasuke demands an explanation for the disturbance sai reveals that he wishes to reunite sasuke with naruto so as to reestablish the brotherly bond they had annoyed sasuke attacks him however this draws naruto sakura and yamato to their location despite this being the first time in nearly two years that they had seen each other sasuke expresses his usual indifference towards his former team even chastising naruto for still pursuing him after all these years unperturbed of orochimarus intentions for him and the prospect going home to konoha with his former friends sasuke engages them in battle showing off his increase in speed and improved abilities team kakashi are ultimately outmatched against sasuke mostly due to the teams exhaustion with narutos fourtailed form that he had previously used to battle orochimaru causing naruto to begin struggling with kurama in his mind to the surprise of both naruto and kurama sasuke uses his heightened prowess of his sharingan to enter narutos subconscious to meet the ninetails itself finally discovering the true source of narutos strength kurama appears to be impressed with sasukes growth and ability as it states his chakra being as sinister as madara uchihas sasuke coldly dismisses knowing such a person and uses his sharingan to suppress kurama back into its sealed cage kurama concludes that this would probably be its last meeting with sasuke so it warns him not to kill naruto for he would only end up regretting it back outside sasuke escapes yamatos attempt to capture him he decides to finish off his former teammates starting with naruto only to be stopped by orochimaru orochimaru points to their recent successes against the akatsuki the organisation that itachi belongs to and explains that letting them live may further weaken the akatsuki thereby making it easier to kill itachi accepting the notion sasuke leaves with orochimaru and kabuto three tails arc sasuke only made an appearance when he met yukimaru while the boy was picking flowers sasuke told him he was deserving his training before he left with kabuto sasuke made another appearance again after his training and he meets guren itachi pursuit arc some time later orochimaru tests sasukes abilities by having him battle hundreds of otogakure ninja with no compassion or mercy a task he completes without taking a scratch and without killing any of them when inquired about the latter part of the scenario sasuke remarks that the only person he wants to kill is his brother itachi and leaves to his training room soon afterwards as orochimaru reaches the limit of his present vessel containing his soul which starts degrading his health he is notified by kabuto that the time for his ritual to take over sasukes body is near as kabuto leaves to get some medicine a vulnerable orochimaru is unexpectedly attacked by sasuke who deems orochimaru too weak to be worthy of having his body or the sharingan although sasuke appears victorious after a brief scuffle with orochimarus true snakeform he is nevertheless brought to orochimarus subconscious for his living corpse reincarnation having severely underestimated sasuke it is orochimaru in turn who is absorbed to a dormant state within sasuke who is able to reverse the process using his sharingan and hence gains access to all of orochimarus abilities with orochimaru gone sasuke goes ahead with his plan to locate and kill itachi by first recruiting some of orochimarus former test subjects — suigetsu hōzuki karin and jūgo — on the pretext of granting them virtues for their themselves after the success of their mission suigetsu wants to obtain samehada by killing itachis akatsuki partner kisame hoshigaki karin wants to be with sasuke due to her massive crush on him since their meeting and jūgo wants to see if sasuke was indeed worth of his dear friend kimimaros sacrifice and dubs their team hebi and immediately afterwards sasuke had his team split up and learn of itachis potential whereabouts while searching alone sasuke is found by the akatsuki members deidara and tobi with the former wanting to kill him for defeating orochimaru himself using his sharingan and lightningbased technique sasuke manages to counter most of deidaras attacks fueling his preexisting hatred for the sharingan stemming from his past encounter with itachi even further which to him could not see or admire his art as a last ditch effort deidara uses c0 to try blowing himself up along with sasuke in a titanic explosion which obliterates everything in the nearby vicinity sasuke however summons manda in time and uses his sharingan to have the great serpent shield him from the explosion at the cost of his life later admitting to karin that he only defeated orochimaru because he was already weakened after the latter shows disbelief that he could have after recovering from his wounds hebi continues onto one of akatsukis lairs where sasuke finds a crow clone of itachi which expresses admiration over sasukes growth in power and tells him they will have their battle at the uchiha hideout leaving the rest of hebi behind to deal with kisame once inside the hideout itachi tells sasuke the cursed history of their clan of uchiha obito being still alive as another uchiha besides themselves and his desire to obtain the flawless eternal mangekyo sharingan by taking sasukes eyes once he finishes the brothers first fight in a battle of genjutsu where sasuke demands the location of madara so that he can kill him too but after itachi declares him to be immortal he ensnares sasuke in a tsukuyomi from which sasuke breaks free much to itachis surprise due to his immense mastery of the sharingan with zetsu witnessing and recording the battle itachi appears somewhat weaker to dodge some of the simplest attacks from sasuke and even coughs blood notwithstanding itachis condition sasuke unleashes a fireball provoking itachi to do the same as sasukes fire gains on itachis the latter resorts to using his mangekyō sharingan technique amaterasu which ignites the area in the undying black flames and almost burns sasuke but sasuke survives using one of orochimarus techniques and in his cursed seal second state launches fire release great dragon fire technique which creates an artificial weather conditions around them perfectly suitable for sasuke to attack itachi with his final lightning technique that uses the power of natural lightning itself kirin but itachi barely survives only by his use of the third and final mangekyō technique susanoo having used the last of chakra on kirin orochimaru who has been absorbed and suppressed by sasukes chakra uses this opportunity to reappear in the outer world through one of his eight giant snakes in a last attempt to take sasukes body for his own however before this could happen itachi has susanoo use the sword of totsuka to seal him permanently in a genjutsu realm thereby removing every tint of orochimarus being from sasuke including the cursed seal of heaven cornered by an incoming itachi sasuke watches in horror his brother inevitably aiming for his eyes but is flabbergasted when itachi says a few words and collapses to his death after poking him in the forehead something itachi would regularly do to sasuke when they were younger shocked and exhausted sasuke too passes out albeit with a smile due to the accomplishment of his lifelong mission sasuke wakes up in a cave in the care of uchiha obito who lies to him by telling him that his name is uchiha madara as obito tries to befriend sasuke by removing his mask and revealing his sharingan sasukes left eye reacts to obitos sharingan and triggers itachis mangekyo sharingan which castes amaterasu setting the masked man on fire causing him to retreat into the darkness of the cave after dispelling the black flames with ease an unscathed and masked tobito appears again and begins to muse about how itachi never ceased to amaze him as sasuke asks what he was talking about obito reveals that itachi had most likely implanted a oneshot amaterasu in sasukes eye to attack if and when he saw obitos sharingan as sasuke complains that he is making no sense obito makes startling revelations that it had been to protect him and when sasuke still didnt believe him obito said how it must all sound crazy but assured him that he was telling the truth and introduced himself as the man who had helped itachi slaughter the entire uchiha clan sasuke vows to destroy konoha obito reveals to sasuke the truth of itachi that he killed his clan by orders from konoha how he joined akatsuki to keep an eye on the organisation from the inside to keep his village and his brother safe including that everything he had done was to make sure sasuke grew strong remembering his childhood of how itachi really was a kind good brother sasuke developed his own mangekyo sharingan he renamed hebi to taka and vowed he would destroy konoha after crying over the memories of his beloved older brother tsuchigumo kinjutsu arc sasuke is seen in flashback by naruto invasion of pain arc before hebi now renamed taka could attack konoha tobi convinced them to start working with akatsuki sasuke stated he planned to kill the elders for ordering the massacre but would spare the villagers because they are not part of his revenge tobi sent them to the land of lightning to capture the eighttails where they found its host killer b the capture attempt got off to a bad start as killer b swiftly overpowered both suigetsu and jūgo prompting sasuke to face b one on one sasuke was unable to read killer bs unique kenjutsu and b ultimately stabbed sasuke with six swords sasuke was rescued and healed by karin and the team decided to all attack at once while they had more success killer b released a great deal of the eighttails chakra and created a chakra cloak when sasuke attempted to use a genjutsu to knock b out the eighttails broke him out of it and b retaliated on the unaware sasuke with great force using the eighttails power to blow sasukes neck and chest open while sasuke was down killer b fully transformed into the beast sealed within him leaving taka outclassed jūgo healed sasuke by fusing some of his own flesh with sasukes body and suigetsu allowed the team to flee and protected them from killer bs tailed beast ball fearing the deaths of he and his teammates sasuke unleashed his new mangekyō sharingan and amaterasu to capture killer b sasuke delivered killer b to tobi before regrouping with taka in a secret conversation with tobi from earlier sasuke admitted that while he wanted to kill the elders for ordering the massacre he also wanted to kill all the residents of konoha for living happily and ignorantly in the peace itachi gave his life for he also explains that the loss of itachi and feeling the villagers are just as guilty made it impossible for him to follow in itachis footsteps of protecting the village and even threatened to kill the loved ones of anyone who dared to oppose him while resting they dealt with j who had been following them however when sasuke tipped over a glass of water he learned that his eyesight was already starting to deteriorate he opted to keep this revelation from the team upon learning they were being spied on they confronted j and seemingly killed him before leaving konoha history arc sasuke thinks that irukas class lecture is boring sasuke first appears seeing umino iruka as his homeroom teacher for the first time naruto pulls a prank on iruka but instead of scolding him iruka tells naruto sit in his seat remembering the advice given to him from daikoku sasuke said that the clone technique is lame which makes naruto angry he shows a perfect clone to his classmates and naruto trys to attack him the real sasuke was reveal to be up in a tree he then asks naruto to quit bother him when seeing naruto being bullied by the other students because of his failed attempts to be better than his rival iruka tells them not to bother

lake and naruto spots him from leaving the playground naruto stares at him sadly and he looks at naruto naruto then makes a angry look at him and he makes a angry look at his rival both turn their faces away from each other and naruto continues his walk home sasuke was later seen in class when iruka lied to him to have study hall and went to look for naruto in the back hills when naruto and sakura go get water for the comatose tsunade kakashi has a flashback of when he was appointed as the leader of team 7 after the teams formation he watches naruto sasuke and sakura seeing naruto and sasukes constant competition and remembers what minato and obito said to him about teamwork and those abandoning their comrades are worse than scum meanwhile koharu and homura discuss with hiruzen of his decision of having naruto outside the village and being put in the same team as sasuke danzō listens in on their discussion and thinks hiruzen put naruto and sasuke in the same team due to the uchiha being able to control the ninetailed demon fox with the sharingan which he thinks is a good idea after noticing sakura depressed naruto tries to pick a fight with sasuke though all his techniques are no use against sasuke sasuke easily beats naruto and the members of team 7 decide to go meet their squad leader naruto tells sasuke that he get him for thatand he responds with a hmph the flashback then ends with kakashi vowing to make sasuke not get revenge team 7 finished their mission in the land of waves naruto remembers he had forgotten an ramen ichiraku coupon at inaris house

about to flee the villagers surround them forcing them to give up akane and his friends apologise to inari for bullying him and they all become friends then inari tells naruto he left his coupon at

a man named kanabun and his gang bring katazu to tsukado who want to profit off their fight tsukado doesnt hold back and manages to get the upper hand though naruto notices something is wrong naruto suddenly stops the fight saying katazu couldnt have killed shikazo as he sword isnt sharpened and the look of his eyes katazu reveals that his twin brother kageki accidentally killed shikazo kageki loaned him some money and after his childs birth he needed money and asked shikazo if he can be repaid shikazo refused and they begin fighting resulting in shikazo falling and hitting his head hard on

didnt find anything about konoha but finds it curious that she knows nothing about her own village and is surprised to see a young kakashi in her memories kakashi has no memory of hanare and inoichi suggests he spends time with hanare hoping he can use the sharingan to learn more about hanare kakashi and hanare walk around the village ino lets sakura know kakashi is with someone and rushes to see for herself meeting naruto and sasuke on the way who already know and are also interested hanare tells kakashi who she met him years ago when she was lost and how he helped her find her way back they try to eavesdrop on the two but end up falling on top of them knocking kakashi directly on top of hanare uncovering his sharingan the three cover up by saying they approve kakashi and hanares supposed relationship konoha learns that hanares village has a konoha jōnin in custody and agree to a hostage exchange kakashi objects to the trade during the trade kakashi explodes the bridge on which the trade occurred intending to take hanare back the jōmae village head tells her to rush back to the village with the information she collected when team 7 corners him the village head commits suicide to prevent information leaking hanare reaches a cliff and kakashi reaches her he tells her that he knows about her special information gathering technique which allows her to look inside her own mind and read the mind of those probing her mind because he accidentally copied with the sharingan when he was knocked on top of her hanare tells him that she has erased all the information she had on konoha because for the first time she felt like was home and belonged somewhere when naruto sasuke and sakura accepted her having never known her parents and being raised out of her village by the time the others reach him kakashi is alone claiming hanare jumped off the cliff when she was cornered hanare lived and is seen walking where she met kakashi as a kid while inuzuka kiba and akamaru were delivering some items sakura haruno and naruto uzumaki were watching sakura commented on how naruto and sasuke were inseparable those days and naruto had a flashback to a mission where team kakashi had to retrieve a golden statue which was stolen by a band of thieves from a feudal princess as naruto and sasuke retrieve the statue sakura gets taken hostage at first sasuke insists on continuing the mission but naruto tells him that those who abandon their friends are worse than scum when they finally find sakura and the bandits it was at first hard for them because their hands got stuck together however one by one through teamwork the two quickly defeated the bandits and their leader jako although their mission was a success the statue itself was very damaged but kakashi said that it could be melted down and recasted when naruto complained about his hand being stuck to sasukes sakura said that it will naturally fall apart within two or three days much to the disappointment of naruto and sasuke this annoyed narutoand sasuke overall sasuke then get more annoyed when naruto had to use the restroom after a village headmans granddaughter was kidnapped by baji he hired konohagakures team 7 and team 10 for assistance when the teams accepted the mission to stop baji and rescue the girl an exbandit named tōfu acted as their guide shikamaru then instructed asuma and kakashi to find an alternate route to the bajis fortress tofu later gets captured and is revealed to be a double agent working for the gang leader when the six genin infiltrated the fortress shikamaru agreed to a hostage exchange between him and tofu in order to find out the location of the headmans granddaughter ino and choji managed to find the tower where the hostages were held and later helped defeat baji the mission ended with a success the bandit group were captured and the headmans granddaughter was rescued while on the way to konoha taka briefly stops by a construction sasuke recognises he thinks back to when he first came across it during a training section near the location sasuke remembers how he was falling behind naruto after he defeated gaara he punches a tree and uses chidori to take some of them out a girl named naho almost falls from a cliff nearby and sasuke saves her later sasuke and kakashi had been sent to investigate national wanted list criminals with naruto and sakura having to escort naho a relative of the fire daimyō to shizume village naho wants sasuke to escort her but he was with kakashi in another mission naruto disguises himself as sasuke so naho agrees to go with them after sasuke and kakashi noted that the fortress was empty nahos group was intercepted by sadai and his associates naruto sakura and naho come across the criminal and his associates naruto defeats the associates but cant take down their leader theyre all captured kakashi uses his ninken to track the criminal sasuke appears and the leader mocks him mentioning he alone in his clan wasnt worth killing mirroring itachis words sasuke takes on the leader who reveals an earth release armour the reason hes able to take on so many attacks sasuke defeats him with chidori and proceeds to keep punching him kakashi stops him and sasuke goes back to konoha by himself naho comments that sasuke is scary but naruto assures her that sasuke just has a lot going on with him at the moment and promises to take her to see him once hes better five kage summitt arc once taka recovered from their battle with killer b they headed for konoha but are intercepted by obito he informed taka about the destruction of konoha and their failure in capturing the eighttails which had been revealed to be nothing more than a transformed tentacle he was however willing to let the matter slide if they completed another mission tobi told them about danzo becoming hokage and the kage summit sasuke decided he wanted to kill danzo the most because he was the true conspirator of the massacre taka was led to the land of iron where the summit was held by white zetsu taka managed to infiltrate the summit without being detected but their cover was blown by white zetsu on orders from obito forced out of hiding sasuke engaged the samurai guards and slaughtered them in cold blood despite his previous strict nokill policy revealing how deep he has fallen into darkness the fourth raikage still under the impression that sasuke has killed his younger brother killer b confronted taka together with his escorts the ensuing fight was interrupted by gaara and his siblings but not before the raikage had lost an arm and sasuke was near exhaustion gaara tried to convince sasuke to let go of his vengeance because it will bring him nothing but emptiness and isolation sasuke however refused saying his goals only exist in darkness showing how dark hes become after shedding a tear for the failure sasuke has become gaara proceeded to fight him but sasuke used his susanoo to create a distraction and escaped with karin leaving suigetsu and jugo to fend for themselves karin guided sasuke to the room where the summit was held but before he could engage danzō sasuke was confronted by mifune in the meanwhile danzo managed to escape but the fifth mizukage prevented sasuke from pursuing him sasuke was ready to pass out but was reinvigorated by zetsus spore technique he escaped from the mizukage only to be confronted by the third tsuchikage he was just barely saved by obito who pulled him and karin into another dimension using his sharingan where karin nursed sasuke back to health obito brought sasuke out in front of danzo sasuke overtaken by his lust for revenge advances his susanoo to a form able to fire arrows danzo using izanagi avoids fatal injury and goads sasuke about itachi all the while each determined to kill the other they clash again danzo relying on izanagi to save him sasuke however had used a genjutsu to only create the illusion that izanagi was still active allowing him to mortally wound danzo danzo takes karin hostage in an attempt to buy time but sasuke had no hesitations in fatally wounding karin in order to finish off danzo and telling her that she has become a burden for getting taken hostage so easily dying danzo tried to flee with sasuke following him from behind before being confronted by tobi and committing suicide and trying to take the two with him but they escape sasuke wants to kill sakura with his revenge against danzo fulfilled sasuke declared his plans to go to konoha however obito pointed out that sasuke was exhausted and near blindness he also told sasuke to kill karin if she was no longer of any use before leaving himself as sasuke was about to kill karin sakura suddenly appeared and interrupted him she told him that she was willing to follow him even if it meant abandoning and even destroying konoha sasuke was sceptical and told sakura to kill karin to prove she was sincere however as sakura hesitated sasuke attempted to kill her with his chidori only to be stopped by kakashi sasuke laughs at their continued attempts to convince him to return to konoha and angrily shouted bringing his clan back would make him stop his vengeance he then attacks kakashi with the intention of killing him taking kakashis attempt to remind him about his former comrades in konoha as an insult to itachi sasukes susanoo gained a layer of armour however this form was shortlived as much to sasukes horror his eyesight deteriorates instantly to the point of seeing a blurred haze at most and sakura uses the opportunity to try and strike him down naruto and sasuke talking to each other in their minds sakura ultimately cannot bring herself to kill sasuke though nearblind sasuke senses her and nearly killed her but she is saved by uzumaki naruto naruto sympathises with sasukes motives to which sasuke cynically counters with his pleasure of revenge as well as revealing his crime of murdering danzō when naruto restrains kakashi to keep him from killing sasuke sasuke uses this opportunity to try once more to kill kakashi with chidori but naruto counters with rasengan as the two collide they mentally connect and sasuke says it is too late for him to change his ways and he still intends to destroy the village to avenge his clan he tells naruto that his only options are to kill him or die naruto rejects both stating he has a third option as their clash sends two flying back one of white zetsus clones appears and cushions sasukes fall obito then appears and prepares to take sasuke away but he tells him to wait so he can hear what naruto has to say which is that if they fight again they will both die together sasuke then becomes angry and demands naruto to answer why he cares about him so much to which naruto replies he is doing it because he is his friend leaving sasuke shocked despite this unperceived event sasuke firmly states he refuses to go back on the path he walks and vows to kill naruto first so before leaving away with obito sasuke says that they must have a talk at their hideout sasuke asks obito to replace his eyes with itachis eyes as his vision is almost faded due to his reckless overuse of his mangekyo sharingan from battling killer b a danzo and team kakashi as he wants to defeat naruto with his full power after transplanting itachis eyes tobi claimed that sasuke would need time to recuperate from the operation and adjust to the new mangekyo sasuke however remarked that it felt perfect and that he could feel itachis power flowing into him fourth shinobi war arc sasuke recovers from his surgery and asks zetsu if he could take off the bandages zetsu tells him not yet but when he does hell be looking at a whole new world after some time passes sasuke attacks white zetsu with his susanoo and sets him ablaze with amaterasu saying that his eyes could see just fine in the dark so he should try it outside he then removes his bandages revealing his eternal mangekyo sharingan back at the mountains graveyard sasuke carves an opening through the roof with his sword — and dressed in his old garbs — mobilises later as sasuke walks to the battlefield in the middle of a thunderstorm he looks behind him and grins ominously sasuke meets up with some of zetsus clones who demand to know why he left the hideout when the clones realise that sasuke killed the original white zetsu they attack him choosing this time to test his new powers further he slaughters most of the clones using a combination of susanoo and amaterasu he uses genjutsu on a surviving clone to discover that tobi has waged war and that the allied shinobi forces were moving to aid naruto in his battle sasuke wonders if naruto has forgotten what true strength is he decapitates the hypnotised clone and destroys the last zetsu clone with amaterasu before heading towards the battlefield to kill naruto himself he then reminisces about his brother and resumes his way to the battlefield as he notices something coming by the forest he takes his sword and goes to investigate only to find his brother much to his surprise sasuke chases after him and tries to catch him with an arm of susanoo after he calls out to uchiha itachi but itachi counters with his own positively identifying itachi sasuke asks what he is doing there since he was supposed to be dead to which itachi reveals kabuto had reincarnated him with impure world reincarnation sasuke bombards itachi with a slew of questions and retorts his brothers later statement that since he was dead he would not talk anymore by saying that even in death he was running away from him itachi then tells sasuke that he wasnt running away but rather was focusing on doing important tasks like ending the impure world reincarnation still pursuing his brother — who even goes as far as to summon a flock of crows in order to blind him — he manages not to lose sight of him and follows him right to kabutos location after seeing him kabuto lets out a maniacal laugh and states that his luck was finally changing after seeing kabutos form sasuke mistakes him for orochimaru but after hearing kabutos voice he realises its not orochimaru kabuto then tries to take advantage of sasukes hatred to help him defeat itachi sasuke however having learned the truth about itachi sided with his brother over kabuto stating that anything left of orochimaru was his enemy as well and then told itachi that when this was over he was supposed to keep his promise and talk to him about everything afterwards as kabuto covers his face up entirely claiming that introverts werent used to so much attention sasuke surmises that its because he wanted to protect himself from the brothers ocularbased genjutsu informing his brother of some of the abilities of the snake he watches on vigilantly as kabutos snakes grow in size and attack them activating his susanoo alongside itachi he beheads the snakes that attacked him as itachi cautions him to not be so rough sasuke tells his brother that with orochimarus powers itd take more than that to kill him after kabuto manages to elude them sasuke listens as kabuto tells him that the experiments on his former teammates had allowed kabuto to acquire new abilities firing an arrow at kabuto which the latter narrowly dodges sasuke watches on as kabuto emerges from the mouth of one of the snakes and declares that after finding the ryūchi cave and learning the way of the sage from the ite snake sage that he had transcended to a dragon as kabutos technique is initiated sasuke covers his ears and closes his eyes in pain realising that he cant maintain his susanoo as the technique ends sasuke opens his eyes to see itachis susanoo protecting him kabuto tries to implant doubt and mistrust amongst the two brothers but sasuke doesnt fall for them and attempts to hit him with his chidori sharp spear but fails as kabuto tells them that a mismatched pair like them could never defeat him itachi tells him that theyd be going with an attack pattern they had used in their youth against a wild boar forming his susanoo arrows sasuke is able to hit kabutos snaketail with his arrow effectively pinning kabuto to the ceiling of the cave he later realises that kabuto was moving to use his discarded sword to seemingly sever his snaketail itachi intercepts the swing however as itachi returns to sasuke he tells him that beating a giant pig like that was probably no problem for him now to which sasuke replies that dealing with the snake before them was the more pressing issue noticing the strong teamwork between the two brothers kabuto admits that he is surprised by it sasuke explains that he merely wants to know the truth from itachis own mouth realizing that sasuke is now aware of itachis secret past kabuto mocks sasuke for trying to get the truth from itachi when he has been lying to his younger brother all his life kabuto goes on to say it is foolish that sasuke is helping itachi when their personal goals are so different itachis being to protect konoha while sasuke wants to destroy it pointing out that he and sasuke share similar goals of destroying konoha kabuto again tries to persuade sasuke to join him ultimately itachi tells sasuke not to listen as kabuto is an even better liar than him itachi then admits to konohas dark side but still firmly considers himself a konoha ninja greatly shocking sasuke admitting to his own faults for how sasuke turned out itachi promises to tell him something important after the battle which he intends to finish with izanami the partner technique to izanagi as kabuto attacks itachi blocks it telling sasuke the technique has begun and to stay near him as kabuto attacks once again this time incapacitating itachi sasuke creates a ring of amaterasu flames around himself and his brother in order to prevent kabuto from getting any closer as kabuto begins chastising the uchiha sasuke lashes out at him but is stopped by a nowregenerated itachi growing impatient sasuke questioned itachi about whether or not they really had to keep him alive as it was hampering them seeing that kabuto was prepared to attack once more he asks itachi again if izanami was ready yet the siblings come under attack once more as a copy of sakon — which emerged from the base of kabutos naval snake — transformed into jirōbō and breached their amaterasu barricade without time to retaliate the two brothers incinerated the onslaught on webs produced by kidomaru which appeared next kabuto then produced a copy of kimimaro to barricade their exit with bones after covering their fore with more web realising that they were boxed in the brothers activate their susanoo with sasuke using his blaze release kagutsuchi to destroy the web that was in front of them whilst leaving the field of bones to itachi retreating further into the cave the brothers are afflicted by tayuyas auditory genjutsu using their own genjutsu to break each other free from the technique the brothers are able to stop the white snake form of orochimaru from attacking them however kabuto uses this opportunity to emerge from the mouth of the snake and bisect itachi much to sasukes horror as kabuto attempts to reassert his control on itachi again with his seal sasuke intervenes launching his sword at kabuto and then using his susanoo in an attempt to capture him forcing kabuto to retreat sasuke then launches a fireball at kabuto only for kabuto to easily counter it with a powerful water stream as kabuto then redirects his attention to itachi sasuke rushes to his brothers side where itachi tells him once again to stay close to him sasuke then watches as kabuto and itachi seem to repeatedly clash in the same manner it is then realised that itachis izanami has finally taken effect forcing kabuto to repeat the same series of events with the same outcome every time taking the opportunity to question his brother about the technique itachi explained the mechanism behind izanami and when he used it seemingly angered when itachi told him why he used a technique that could be cancelled by the victim sasuke listens as itachi explained his reasons for doing so before itachi tells him that he would be stopping the impure world reincarnation voicing his apprehension at first when he hears this as it meant that itachi would also be stopped once the technique was cancelled sasuke reacts angrily to itachis statement that he was proud to be able to protect his village and claiming that after all the village had done to itachi there was no way he could forgive them sasuke is later both shocked and confused following itachis response that he was stopping the technique in order to help narutos desire to change sasuke resigned to the fact that he could not change his brothers mind sasuke told itachi that it was because he remembered his time with itachi that he would not give up his vendetta against konoha and in the same manner that itachi strived to protect it he would destroy it with that he wished his brother farewell before he noticed itachi walking towards him with his hand outstretched itachi then explains to sasuke that what danzō and tobi had told him had been the truth he had been given the choice to either die along with his clan or to kill the uchiha protecting the village and sasuke itachi reaches sasuke and puts his hand on the back of sasukes head and his forehead on his telling him that he knows that he cant change sasukes mind but no matter what path he chose he would love sasuke forever sasuke then watches as his brothers soul is released from the impure world reincarnation leaving him with kabuto with his brother removed to the afterlife sasuke started to question what a village was and what shinobi truly were while still in thought suigetsu and jūgo found sasuke and give him the scroll they had found at orochimarus hideout from what he reads in the scroll he declared that he will find the human who knows everything even if it means reviving orochimaru to this end he used ankos cursed seal of heaven along with a piece of kabutos altered flesh to revive orochimaru ignoring suigetsus vehement protests after catching each other up with what has happened sasuke shows orochimaru the scroll making him wonder what sasuke wanted from them tired of being treated as a child by everyone sasuke was determined to find the truth of the past in order to find his own path while insisting that he still desired revenge sasuke explained that he must know what the idea of revenge really meant for him to know if it was truly his decision intrigued by how much sasuke has changed orochimaru decided to take him to where his questions could be answered following the sannin their travels took them to konoha where they briefly sense the volume of narutos chakra on the battlefield reacting to this as little more than a nuisance sasuke tells the group to continue on their journey which took them to a temple which had fallen into ruin on the outskirts of the village retrieving a mask from there sasuke followed orochimaru through the village where he stopped moved to a high vantage point and surveyed the village noting that it had changed somewhat not one to linger on sentimental feelings sasuke pressed on to the destroyed naka shrine where he unsealed the hidden meeting hall below the temple once there orochimaru initiated the ritual to unseal the contents of the shinigami using the spore clones that had been attached to sasuke as sacrifices to reincarnate the ones who knew everything the previous four hokage after introducing himself to the hokage sasuke asks sarutobi hiruzen why he had ordered itachi to massacre the uchiha clan to have him confirm everything he had been told before senju tobirama then tells sasuke that he was from a clan possessed by evil revealing how the sharingan was awaken and how an uchiha who experienced loss would spiral deeper into darkness and become unwieldy and that he in his attempt to help the uchiha channel that force gave them the konoha military police force which ultimately destroyed them as well though admonished for this by his brother senju hashirama sasuke told them that he was not pure nor a child and asked the latter what is a village and what is a shinobi after hashirama concluded his story sasuke mused that it was nothing if not ironic that the person who had inherited hashiramas will was an uchiha tobirama however corrected the young uchiha noting that not only did he himself not hate the uchiha but that there were many who had transcended the limitations of thinking only of the uchiha presenting his subordinate kagami as a prime example of this having heard all he needed to from the hokage including the third and the fourth sasuke seemingly broke free of the curse of hatred and resolved to protect the sacrifice his brother had made and heads to the battlefield upon exiting the naka shrine they were confronted by karin whom sasuke simply apologized to with this they all prepared to make their way to the battlefield arriving on the battlefield sasukes presence shocked haruno sakura and nara shikamaru angers inuzuka kiba and surprises the rest of the rookie nine after noting that his former comrades were as boisterous as ever sasuke earned nothing but scorn from them for his past actions after declaring to them that he would change the village and become hokage so that incidents such as these would never repeat themselves everyone became noticeably shocked shikamaru and shino noted that this would be an impossible feat given what hes done but sasuke brushed the comment away noting that he couldnt care less what they thought uzumaki naruto recalling itachis last words to him about how the village needs to acknowledge you before you can be the hokage intervened and corrected sasuke noting that he would in fact become hokage sasuke and naruto then prepared to face off against the tentails before being followed closely by sakura with that the three ninja then prepared to enter the fray with naruto noting that team kakashi had been reborn as hashirama managed to make small openings in the barrier containing the tentails sasuke charged in along with his former teammates to face the beast he initially fought several of the tentails clones using his kenjutsu skills sasuke was impressed by sakuras powerful chakra enhanced strength and he later saved sakura from the tentails clones that had managed to sneak up on her and warned naruto not to get in his way after sai informed naruto of how to reach the tentails real body sasuke sakura and naruto simultaneously used the summoning technique with which sasuke summoned a snake summon named aoda alongside katsuyu and gamakichi respectively he then used aoda to slide past the clones of the tentails while also fending off their attacks using a more enhanced version of his chidoriinfused sword after two clones managed to put up a barrier in his way sasuke manifested his susanoo and broke through it with his susanoo sword he then used the susanoo to fire an amaterasu flameenhanced arrow towards the tentails which was combined with narutos wind release ultrabig ball rasenshuriken to do even more damage to the beast afterwards he commanded the amaterasu flames to burn the tentails as sai asked jūgo if sasuke was serious in his vow to become hokage naruto then told sasuke to extinguish the flames when the tentails was weak enough to rip the tailed beasts out of its body only for sasuke to refuse fanatical on his path to end the twisted system and create a new one later as madara began to use obito to revive himself sasuke and aoda made their way towards uchiha obito in order to stop the process after aoda was captured by the tentails sasuke lunged at obito manifested susanoo and fired another flameenhanced arrow at obito however obito managed to deflect the attack just as sasuke was about to take out obito with chidori namikaze minato teleported to obito and cut him down however he survived the attack and surprised everyone by becoming the tentails jinchūriki sasuke was shocked to witness obito cut through the first and second hokage so easily when naruto questioned his father about whether or not he couldnt prevent teleport the third to safety sasuke told him to stop worrying because it was part of the hokages plan to determine obitos new skills since they couldnt die because they were reincarnated sasuke later intercepted obitos attack on naruto with his susanoo and declared that he would be the one to erase the past however obito managed to break through the susanoo and attack both sasuke and naruto with minato unable to teleport to their aid as the marking for the flying thunder god technique had seemingly vanished narutos quickthinking is able to save them from obitos attack remembering what minato had said about how the flying thunder god technique worked sasuke realised that naruto had connected them to minato through the use of chakra arms allowing him to teleport them to safety sasuke later watched on as the event unfolded on the battlefield and on minatos orders prepared to launch a consecutive collaborative attack with naruto after minato had attacked obito during this time when minato was attacked by obito sasuke reprimanded naruto reminding him that they needed to stay focus he later looked on in shock as the ball obito had attached to an unaware minato prepared to expand threatening to eradicate them all manifesting his susanoo and grabbing naruto as well they are saved by tobirama who teleported the orb away from them while tobirama and minato came up with a new plan of attack sasuke rushed forth and launched amaterasu at obito much to minatos protests however obito managed to deflect sasukes attack stating he could see the build up of chakra in sasukes left eye he and naruto then launched their counterattack against obito forming another kagutsuchiinfused rasenshuriken as they charged minato teleported in front of them taking the blow of the technique minato then used the mutually instantaneous revolving technique to land a surprise attack on the new jinchūriki though they believed the attack to have worked initially they are all shocked to see obito emerge from the attack unscathed as they rushed forward sasuke noted that obito would not be an easy one to defeat as the readjusted their strategy naruto informed sasuke that he was going to go all out again and asked if he would be able to keep up to which sasuke noted that he should not look down on the uchiha watching as obito attempted to deflect gamakichis starch syrup gun technique sasuke later watched on in shock as naruto was able to land an attack on obito wondering how he had accomplished this upon hearing narutos explanation of the situation sasuke came to realise that he meant that only senjutsu could counter the tentails and its jinchūriki and the young uchiha later watched on as obito trapped them in a barrier and prepared to launch several tailed beast balls at them with the situation getting even more dire sasuke agreed with jūgo and noted that he was going to get them both and naruto out of dodge however when naruto dismissed their idea and insisted they come before him sasuke and the others soon found themselves on the outside of the barrier where the attack had been launched as sasuke looked on dumbfounded naruto explained what had happened and the uchiha realised that they had once again used the basic principle of the flying thunder god technique to teleport them all outside of the barrier watching on as the battle progressed with naruto and minato on the frontlines sasuke silently wondered how naruto could so effortlessly control such a large volume of chakra and contemplated just how far his childhood teammate had come sasuke later watched on as obito manifested the tentails and had it assume its final form that of the god tree and obito continued with the eye of the moon plan as countless shinobi began being drained of their chakra leaving everyone else filled with despair hashirama had yamanaka ino link everyone telepathically so that he could pass on the info that his original had heard about the shinju and the eye of the moon plan and to try and rally them to continue fighting while hashiramas words fail to inspire anyone sasuke continued to battle without fear or doubt donning his susanoo and cutting down a limb of the enormous tree shocking everyone calling out to naruto sasuke asked the young man if he was done as he himself had just begun through inos telepathc link narutos emotions and memories were conveyed to everyone leading the young uchiha to sympathise with the loss of itachi sasuke in his complete susanoo joins naruto in an assault after naruto informs sasuke not to forget that only senjutsu will work against obito sasuke tells him that he is not quick to forget unlike naruto with this statement sasuke has jūgo use the senjutsu chakra from his sage transformation on his susanoo which covers sasukes susanoo with the cursed seal of heaven markings sasuke and naruto then proceed to attack obito who once again used the tentails malleable chakra to aid in protecting himself from their assault in unison with narutos senjustsuenhanced tailed beast ball sasuke fires a senjutsuenhanced arrow at obito sasuke and naruto were unhappy to see that their combined technique did not harm obito due to him surrounding himself in a sphere formed from the tentails malleable chakra the battle continued resulting in sasukes susanoo and narutos tailed beast mode form being destroyed however sasuke and naruto got up on their feet again their resolves untouched standing alongside his comrade he noted that they would end the battle with their next attack to which naruto agrees with this sasuke manifests his final susanoo which begins to encase narutos tailed beast mode mantle after sasukes susanoo fully encased narutos tailed beast mode mantle sasuke then manifested his susanoo sword noticing their powerful combination obito manifested a huge shield and the sword of nunoboko preparing to engage the two young shinobi after agreeing that they had one opportunity to take down obito sasuke and naruto charged into battle while the konoha 11 destroyed the shield sasukes susanoo sword managed to shatter obitos legendary weapon with his sword destroyed sasuke and naruto managed to slash through obito with the susanoos senjutsuenhanced sword due to the success of sasuke and narutos attack obito began losing control of the tailed beasts and naruto began pulling the chakra of the tailed beasts out of obito sasuke and the rest of the allied shinobi forces later assisted naruto in the great chakra tugofwar against obito eventually succeeding in extracting the tailed beasts from him as obito lies exhausted and defenceless sasuke drew his sword and quickly went in for the kill only for hatake kakashi to teleport in front of sasuke and prepare to do it himself as kakashi was stopped by minato minato then told naruto to help hashirama against madara to which naruto told sasuke to join him sasuke arrived to the battlefield from atop sais inkbird and immediately began incinerating madara with his amaterasu however madara shrugged off sasukes attack and absorbed it after madara defeated naruto and sai as well as absorbing hashiramas sage mode sasuke attacked madara viciously with his sword madara allowed sasuke to pierce his bicep and grabbed his blade while also offering the young uchiha the opportunity to join him in the battle against the allied shinobi forces however sasuke refuses his offer and informs the elder uchiha that he plans to kill him to which madara responds that he will take sasukes eyes as a temporary replacement for his lost rinnegan as naruto and sai attempted to assist sasuke in his battle against madara the elder uchiha managed to evade the three attacking shinobi and turned his attention towards the tailed beasts sasuke summoned a hawk to go after madara but was halted by hashirama who offered him a technique that would be able to bind madara even if his own senjutsu chakra sasuke wondered why hed offer such a technique to an uchiha and hashirama compares him to madaras brother izuna and as such had the best chance of stopping madara without resorting to strength sasuke flew towards madara and attacked him using an opening created by tobirama who was fighting madara however madara immobilised sasuke in the air and stabbed him with his own sword despite tobiramas pleas after getting impaled by his own sword sasuke struggles to remain alive by remembering his resolve to honour his brothers sacrifice and change the shinobi world however sasuke finally collapses as madara walks away tobirama and karin later noticed grimly that they could not sense sasukes chakra which suggested that sasuke had died from his injuries later on sasuke was approached by a barefooted individual the individual turned out to be kabuto who was able to rediscover himself and thus break free from izanami he chose to save sasukes life as obito volunteered to save narutos life declaring that he now knew who he was and where he belonged and would pay itachi back for helping him realise all this within sasukes unconscious mind he met the spirit of the sage of six paths himself hagoromo ōtsutsuki he told sasuke of his family history and revealed to sasuke his status as the reincarnation of his eldest son indra admitting to his own faults as a father and leader hagoromo asked sasuke to help fix his mistakes after accepting hagoromos request the ancient sage passed a portion of his power to sasuke upon awakening sasuke quickly readied himself to return to the battle after sasuke took out madaras chakra rods from tobiramas body the second used his flying thunder god technique to send sasuke on the main battlefield as he teleported him to minatos kunai that naruto had taken with him madara watched on with surprise as sasuke arrived next to naruto as the young uzumaki noted that he and sasuke are going to defeat him together after he told him that hes not going to beat him alone sasuke who unlocked the rinnegan in his left eye after his meeting with hagoromo told madara to get ready and the older uchiha replied that he have both their powers the rinnegan and the senjutsu of the six paths and that they were about to find out whos stronger between them madara then proceeded to use his various techniques against the duo to which sasuke and narutos combined power was able to defend against as madara continued to seemingly manipulate targets from afar sasukes rinnegan saw through the charade discovering that madara was actually producing an invisible doppelganger to aid him realizing that any damage the copy took would be transferred to madara sasuke proceeded to stab it stopping madara to regain his composure sasuke then explained his analysis to naruto and the two then proceeded to assault madara again realizing the situation was shifting to sasuke and narutos advantage madara instead stole kakashis sharingan and a temporary replacement left eye and used its power to teleport to the kamuis dimension to retrieve his actual left eye from obito but not before sasuke bifurcated the older uchiha shortly afterwards sakura was teleported back to the normal dimension by obito who warned her allies of madaras potential power should he gain both his eyes after naruto restored kakashis original left eye kakashi asked sasuke what his true goal as hokage would be as sasuke remained silent kakashi chose to not push the question instead reminding sasuke that they are still all former members of team 7 as madara began his return to the battlefield sasuke and the others prepared themselves after madara returns fully regenerated and with both rinnegan eyes madara creates four shadows to hold off his opponents he then takes to the air and performs the chibaku tensei sasuke respods by unleashing his fully formed susanoo to repel the massive stones madara then reveals his newlyformed third eye and prepares to perform the infinite tsukuyomi finally ready to complete his plan madara casts his infinite tsukuyomi and begins assimilating everyone in its spell sasuke with his rinnegan protecting him from madaras genjutsu decides to envelopes himself and his rookie team within his susanoo to protect them from the the genjutsu as everyone asks sasuke the nature of this technique sasuke stubbornly tells them to be quite insisting that he is in command while naruto is furious at sasukes still independent attitude kakashi solemnly admits that with sasukes rinnegan he may be the only one able to save the world as the light of madaras technique finally ends sasuke lets down his susanoo noting that only a rinnegan has a chance of canceling the infinite tsyuyumi madara then confronts the remaining free individuals only for black zetsu to suddenly betray madara and impale his hand through madaras chest shocking its audience as madara asks his own manifestation why he would do this black zetsu boldly states that it is actually a manifestation of otsutsuki kaguya black zetsu then proceeds to expand its being into madara sasuke was also seen in inos genjutsu dream in this case fighting with sai for inos affection when madara began to absorb a huge amount of chakra from those captured by the infinite tsukuyomi while swelling up to many times his normal size naruto and sasuke attempted to stop him before being caught by hairlike appendages madara eventually shrunk back down but was replaced by kaguya while black zetsu was completely absorbed in the process leaving obito free of his presence and unconscious when questioned on her motives kaguya went to comment that she wanted no more fighting before reshaping their location into a lava river sasuke immediately summons his hawk to save himself from the molten river and he quickly saves naruto as well ignoring narutos pleas to save kakashi and sakura who are saved by a quickthinking kakashi when naruto questions his complete disregard for the safety of his comrades sasuke informs naruto that they are the only ones who can defeat kaguya and so neither one of them can die even if they survive at the sacrifice of others such as sakura and kakashi kaguya immediately rebuttals with a pinpoint attack which sasuke tries to block with his susanoo but ultimately fails which results in his hawks wing being pierced as well as sasukes left arm as he falls into the pit of lava once more sasuke activates susanoo to protect himself and is swiftly saved by naruto who manages to fly while naruto proceeds to attack kaguya he manages to provide an opening as sasuke with his perfect susanoo activated attacks kaguya once more ultimately sasukes attack fails and he is forced out of his perfect susanoo and begins to fall into the ocean of lava once again as his blade is destroyed by the lava sasuke manages to teleport himself to narutos location and he receives a platform to stand on from naruto angry that his susanoo has no effect on kaguya he and naruto do not notice kaguya as she sneaks up behind them with tears in her eyes black zetsu emerges from kaguya latches onto naruto and sasuke and begins absorbing their power while he also explains the history of kaguyas defeat his creation and his attempt to revive kaguya once black zetsu finishes his tale naruto manages to rip black zetsu off of himself and sasuke and the two shinobi prepare their counterattack sasuke and naruto later discuss a counterattack plan which gets put into action when the former uses amaterasu on kaguya albeit she absorbs the attack and the latter uses the new technique ultimately the plan is successful as kaguya is distracted long enough to be punched by naruto sasuke prepares to strike kaguya with yin release while naruto proceeds to strike kaguya with yang release however the sealing attempt is unsuccessful as kaguya shifts them to a different dimension and traps the two in a prison of ice sasuke uses blaze release kagutsuchi to free himself and naruto from the ice black zetsu tells kaguya that she should separate the two and so kaguya emerges behind sasuke and pulls him into her portal leaving him trapped in a desert dimension isolated and confused he tries to find a way to escape but to no success and quickly becomes exhausted sasuke senses narutos chakra but is unable to find him later he notices obito and sakura opening a portal and calls for him to come the portal becomes smaller as obito falters but sasuke shifts to get in and catches sakura as she collapses he then explains how his ability works and thanks them sasuke returns to the ice dimension along with obito and sakura as sasuke makes his way towards naruto with the latter asks him if he has thanked obito and sakura to which he coldly rebuffs by telling naruto to focus on kaguya kaguya immediately shifts everyone to a high gravity dimension and prepares to eliminate sasuke and naruto thanks to the effects of the gravity sasuke and naruto manage to dodge the attack but kaguya launches the attack once more intent on eliminating the threat kakashi and obito jump in front of sasuke and naruto but obito uses kamui to save kakashi as well and is stabbed in the process shocking sasuke and everyone else sasuke recharges his left eye while everyone listens obitos final words as his rinnegans power is restored sasuke takes the opportunity to surprise kaguya and instantly teleports next to her he attempts to pierce her with chidori but fails as kaguya flees away while naruto attempts to save obito sasuke informs him that he cannot do anything to save him and so he should instead focus on kaguya sasuke activates his perfect susanoo and flies towards kaguyas location preparing to take her on in battle as he continues to battle her sasuke presents a dismayed and angry naruto an opening which he takes to rip off kaguyas arm with black zetsu still attached to it while sasuke begins pressuring kaguya naruto launches nine separate attacks each imbued with on of the tailed beasts chakra after hitting kaguya with it her body becomes unstable transforming into an amalgamated mass of the tailed beasts naruto then asked sasuke what animal form is it and sasuke tells naruto that it doesnt matter since it will be easier to get close to kaguya and it will be easier to seal the latter as well the beast produced several outstretching hands sucking up everything it came in contact with as it approached sakura kakashi having inherited obitos sharingan powers from the departed spirit uses susanoo to save sakura much to everyones surprise sasuke then wonder how kakashi got his sharingan back even though he lost it naruto then told sasuke that it doesnt matter since their former senseis namesake is the copy ninja kakashi and kakashi of the sharingan regaining control of herself kaguya then shaped tailedbeast mass into a giant truthseeking ball kakashi devised a plan and shared it with his students telling them to be ready for what could be their last mission as a team as naruto distracts kaguya with his clones sasuke waits for the opportunity to leap into action while kaguya is distracted sasuke swaps place with one of narutos shadow clones and appears next to kaguya as she attempts to escape sakura comes from above and knocks kaguya down as naruto and sasuke finally manage to touch her with their special sun and moon tattoos they received from hagoromo preparing to seal away the rabbit goddess once and for all immediately upon contact sasuke and naruto begin the ultimate sealing technique the chibaku tensei kaguya wonders how she the ancestor of all chakra could be defeated by mere fragments of chakra as she reverts back to the demonic statue of the outer path and is encased by the landscape creating an enormous satellite similar in size to the moon after sealing away kaguya the moon tattoo disappears from sasukes hand as the sun tattoo disappears from narutos hand and reappears on the hand of hagoromo relieved that they have defeated kaguya they immediately worry about how they will return back to the real world suddenly team kakashi and the tailed beasts are summoned back to earth by hagoromo and all of the previous kage satisfied hagoromo thanks sasuke and his comrades for saving the world while everyone celebrates kaguyas defeat sasuke senses some life in madara and rushes to eliminate his fallen enemy once and for all however he is stopped by hagoromo as hashirama approaches his former comrade following hagoromos advice sasuke listens to hashirama and madaras final words to each other as madara passes away peacefully and the reanimated hokage return to the afterlife as the tailed beasts begin to talk about their future plans now that they are free sasuke makes his own intentions known starting with killing the current five kage still trapped within infinite tsukuyomi sasuke then proceeds to take control of the nine tailed beasts and seal them away within separate chibaku tensei as kakashi asks if he still simply desires revenge sasuke plainly states that what he wants is to recreate the world the way it should be doing so with revolution noting that only naruto still stands in his way sasuke faces his former friend and ally while hagoromo sadly looks on to see that once again his children battle each other naruto firmly says he will end this feud once and for all before they depart for their battle naruto urges sasuke to at least release the tailed beasts but sasuke tells he he intends to destroy the tailed beasts which would require killing naruto in order to eliminate the chakra of the tailed beasts within him while also keeping the ones he trapped alive in order to end the infinite tsukuyomi he orders naruto to follow him as he wants to take their fight elsewhere as sasuke turns to leave sakura makes a final plea to keep sasuke from abandoning them again and while this has an affect on him he only replies she is still annoying and silenced her with a genjutsu of him impaling her chest in order to prevent her from interfering with their fight ignoring kakashis scolding of how he is ignoring the fact that sakura loves him so much it is breaking her heart sasuke says there is no reason for him and sakura to love each other and he believes her love is from a failed past before he led naruto to the valley of the end though naruto tries to persuade sasuke once more with itachis words sasuke rebuttals by preparing to tell naruto what he means when he says the word hokage sasuke explains itachis sacrifice to naruto stating that itachi is the definition of a true hokage despite the fact that his one mistake was allowing sasuke to live so that he could learn the truth about his brother explaining his goal further sasuke tells naruto that as he will become the hokage he will become darkness itself and take on all of the hatred of the world alone by absorbing the hatred of the shinobi world himself sasuke will eliminate the darkness of the failed system allowing it to shine once more naruto attempts to explain the error in sasukes ways once more claiming that sasuke does not know anything about his brother or what he believed in however sasuke does not take narutos words into account and states that narutos death will be the beginning of the new clean slate he is determined to inflict on the world with nothing else left to say sasuke and naruto clash with enough force to begin cracking hashiramas statue repelling against each other sasuke immediately fires a massive fireball at naruto who manages to deflect the attack by activating his six paths sage technique leaving naruto little time to react sasuke shifts behind naruto activates his chidori and knocks naruto into the water as naruto recovers sasuke activates his susanoo and fires three arrows towards naruto though he manages to block sasukes attack by utilizing three of his truthseeking ball resulting in several small explosions sasuke activates his perfect susanoo and tries to slice down naruto only for his attack to be countered by one of narutos tails as he enters tailed beast mode the two titans fists clash together as memories of the past are shared between the two taking a moment sasuke warns naruto to pick up the pace if he doesnt want to die while naruto refuses to abandon sasuke despite their differences while naruto forms a tailed beast ball sasuke applies the chidori to his perfect susanoo the two techniques clash resulting in a massive explosion as naruto and sasuke enter their inner subconscious once again sasuke tells naruto that they are no longer children and that despite their differing opinions they should be able to understand each other at this point while remembering sasukes words about two high class shinobi learning each others feelings through their fists naruto tries once more to convince sasuke to stop fighting stating that his goal is pointless since the five shinobi villages have already united however sasuke explains that they only united to defeat a common enemy with their enemies defeated sasuke believes the world will become like it was before the war resolved to becoming the common threat for the sake of the shinobi world sasuke explains that he will find some way to gain immortality through the use of his immense power stating that is what he means by becoming hokage returning to the real world sasuke and naruto are knocked back as a result of the explosion of their colliding attacks pleased that naruto is becoming serious sasuke summons the satellites encasing the tailed beasts and begins channeling their chakra into his perfect susanoo as it changes into a more humanoid form while stating he is quite possibly the strongest person in the world which is later noted by kurama as he states that sasuke is on the level of hagoromo himself while naruto summons three shadow clones sasuke immediately attacks him from behind knocking one of his clones into the earth the two battle in the sky as naruto tries to attack sasuke but fails as sasuke uses a lightningbased senbon to counter narutos technique resulting in a massive explosion naruto combines his clones to form one powerful chakra avatar and throws two rasenshuriken while sasuke fires a lightingenhanced arrow as the two attacks prepare to collide in the air sasuke and narutos attacks collide in the air creating a massive explosion that devastates the land and destroys the heads of the madara and hashirama statues completely drained of chakra the two fall to the earth and into the valley once more surprised that naruto has survived the last encounter sasuke attempts to use amaterasu to incinerate naruto but fails as naruto uses kuramas chakra to protect himself from the damage as sasuke begins to feel the effects of using too much chakra naruto takes the opportunity to create clones that attack sasuke altogether sending him into the air naruto plans to deliver a decisive blow but sasuke also manages to land a hit as well sasuke summons shuriken to eliminate narutos clones and attacks what he believes is the real naruto body only to be fooled with a clone as naruto lands a large blow sasuke tries to use his chidori but fails as naruto activates his rasengan only for him to trip and lose the technique seeing this opportunity sasuke kicks naruto onto his and begins punching naruto repeatedly in the face until naruto finally manages to break free with a headbutt as naruto rises the two engage in a long battle of taijutsu for an entire day upon nightfall sasuke and naruto continue to fight with only their strong wills as the two are both completely exhausted kurama gives naruto more chakra to use for one final attack but sasuke manages to use his rinnegans preta path ability to absorb narutos chakra for his own activating the chidori once more sasuke prepares to end narutos life stating that he will finally be alone once his one and only best friend is dead refusing to give up however naruto struck back sending sasuke into the wall of the valley enraged at his persistence sasuke channeled the last of his chakra into a kagutsuchi infused chidori and met once more with narutos rasengan destroying the rest of the valley and taking both his and narutos arm both completely drained the two lay next to each other with sasuke asking why naruto would go through such lengths for someone like him acknowledging that he himself had truly been jealous of naruto from the start sasuke admitted defeat though naruto told him he wouldnt let the uchiha die on the battlefield declaring no matter what happens next he would always be there for his friend moving sasuke to tears sakura arrived shortly after and healed the two guiltridden for the pain he put her through sasuke tries to speak to her but she tells him not to because she has to focus on healing them sasuke then apologizes to sakura for everything hes don which she reacts with criticism but tearfull accepts and he smiles at her as a pleased kakashi looked on at his team reuniting once again sasuke forms the special sign with naruto by resulting in the release of the infinite tsukuyomi and the world being saved from the final threat following this he released the tailed beasts from their prison in the satellites much to the delight of naruto as they do this sasuke talks about how he now understands why naruto never gave up on him and credits him for teaching him the true meaning of being a shinobi blank period after the battle sasuke is sent to prison while the kage contemplate his fate several months later sasuke was officially pardoned by kakashi who had become the sixth hokage following tsunades retirement based on his service in ending the war and a good word from naruto opting to see the world through clearer eyes sasuke prepares to leave konoha choosing not to wait for his prosthetic new hand to finished sakura asked once more if she could come with him and while sasuke tells her this journey is for him alone he affectionately poked her on the forehead like his brother itachi used to do to him promising hed be back and thanking her as he departed from the village he ran into naruto who had been waiting for him saying their final words to each other naruto gives sasuke his former forehead protector that he had discarded at the end of their first fight accepting the headband as a sign of reconciliation sasuke leaves naruto and the village traveling around the world as a nomadic vagabond for many years in order to find redemption and analyses the world as part of his atonement sasuke travels around the world to seek any threats that occur within the five great nations that threaten the peace between them although he often deals with the threats without being seen he leaves behind obvious hints that he was responsible this redeems him in the eyes of the five kage who come to trust him enough to ask for his assistance in mysterious or dangerous situations and maintain correspondence with him in case they need his help a year later after the war ended sasuke is suspected of associating with a terrorist organisation with the prime motivation of attacking konohagakure once more despite the evidence piled against him many konoha shinobi do not believe these claims and vouch for his innocence it is eventually revealed that the perpetrator is not sasuke but a konoha shinobi who is rebelling against the village and has been using his identity as a means to further his own goals konoha manages to inform the real sasuke of these events and request his assistance but he turns them down as he believes it does not concern him however once he finds out that the enemies have captured sakura he immediately rushes home though sakura manages to fend for herself sasuke returns to finish off her captors before leaving once again remaining unseen by sakura sasuke returns to the village at some point due him stating im home as sasuke emerges from the forest he sees a patch of flowers growing at the base of a nearby tree because he likely would never have even noticed the flowers only a few years ago he stops for a moment to appreciate them while admiring the flowers sasuke overhears two young brothers in the nearby field who are throwing paper shuriken at each other while they pretend to be ninja omitsu the older brother is much better at throwing the shuriken than his younger brother komitsu who clearly reveres omitsus skill sasuke is reminded of his own admiration for his brother itachi after expending their inventory of shuriken komitsu begins gathering the shuriken from the ground when a gust of wind starts carrying them away he chases after them not noticing that hes headed for a ravine just as komitsu starts going over the edge he is caught by sasuke who has also gathered all of the paper shuriken komitsu tries to insist that he knew what he was doing but on seeing how relieved omitsu is by sasukes intervention thanks sasuke for the help because of sasukes obvious skill komitsu asks if he is naruto sasuke is so surprised by the question that he doesnt respond further convincing komitsu komitsu asks naruto to help them train and omitsu is unable to calm him deciding that this might be a kind of penance sasuke agrees to give them some of his time he first corrects them about his name as they practice sasuke keeps telling himself not to stay for too long and informs the brothers of his intention to leave soon and yet he continues to linger drawn to komitsus youthful innocence and omitsus burdensome overprotectiveness after a few hours of training komitsu shows clear improvement finally managing to actually hit the targets he aims at komitsu is proud of himself but notices that the sun is setting the sky is growing dark and the clouds are turning red it reminds him of the akatsuki sasuke is stunned to hear the word and finds some relief when ōmitsu corrects komitsu that akatsuki refers to daybreak not sunset when komitsu continues to remain quiet omitsu is forced to confess to sasuke that their family was killed by the akatsuki sasuke finally says goodbye to omitsu and komitsu and departs as he travels back through the forest he crosses paths with kiino omitsu and komitsus older brother he mistakes sasuke for itachi and begins talking to him forcing sasuke to correct him as they talk kiino concludes that despite all the terrible things itachi did when he was alive he was still a good person deep down sasuke sadly agrees as sasuke starts investigating about kaguya during his journey of redemption he is forced to examine his former role as an avenger and how this past will influence his future although he is offered to return to konoha he is unsure if he should or not due to the guilt he feels for betraying his friends during his traveling he receives a message from kakashi regarding the disappearances of konoha kumo and kiri shinobi and sasuke agrees to investigate on his way to the land of lightning sasuke arrives at a bamboo village in the land of hot water and learns from the villagers of a rogue ninja group called the dark thunder group whose leader karyu admires sasuke yet wants to kill him in order to surpass him sasuke finds the group attacking the village and defeats them saving all the villagers from harm karyu admits he has admired sasuke since the latter attacked the kage summit much to sasukes dismay that karyu is tarnishing his name after interrogating karyu he learns that the group is responsible for the disappearances and placed all the kidnapped shinobi under genjutsu to attack the hidden villages before he can turn karyu over to konoha karyu is killed by the father of one of his victims when the genjutsu fails to dispel after karyus death sasuke suspects the real culprit is on the loose sasuke later meets with orochimaru and his former team taka comrades to investigate the matter further sasuke maintains contact with sai when konoha is attacked and later meets with yamato who gives him intel on the missing shinobi sasuke finds most of the missing kiri and kumo shinobi on an isolated island and through luck discovers that chino and nowaki are in fact enemies chino possessing red eyes and lava release after they flee sasuke delivers the shinobi to their villages where he is thanked by the raikage and darui for helping them the raikage offers to send other shinobi to help sasuke find the groups leaders but sasuke declines since only he can cancel their genjutsu abilities he also tells the raikage about chino and his abilities after hearing this the raikage grudgingly acknowledges sasuke as someone qualified to take care of the leaders whom he says are likely in yugakure sasuke also acknowledges he now has respect for the raikage for his forgiveness and he will inform him of the outcome he then goes to yugakure where he finds and battles chino she reveals that she is seeking revenge due to that she is from a clan that was eliminated due to her village fearing its lava release because sasuke understands her pain and hatred he defeats them without seriously injuring them and convinces them to accept defeat sasuke drops them off at his villages prison but he leaves a good word for them to be forgiven after resuming his journey sasuke receives a letter from naruto that mentions sakura comparing his efforts to protect the village to that of his childhood dream of joining the konoha military police force sasuke decides his home is with sakura and makes the decision to return to konoha upon returning to the village sakura happily greeting sasuke saying welcome home sasuke he then continues walking after sakura got his message epilogue13 years later sasuke lived in the village for a while before resuming his travels however sakura refused to stay in konoha without sasuke and he allows sakura to accompany him on his journey eventually they got married and she became pregnant with their daughter uchiha sarada who was born in one of orochimarus hideouts with karin delivering her afterwards sasuke returned to konoha with sakura and sarada and they lived as a normal family for a couple of years with sasuke raising sarada till she is a toddler when sarada is a toddler sasuke leaves the village to investigate about kaguya due to this it left sarada with few memories of him when naruto becomes hokage sasuke is shown traveling in a sand dimension and walks pass sakuras old flak jacket that is lying on the ground during his investigation sasuke comes to suspect that she created the white zetsu army in order to face some greater threat upon secretly coming back home he asks naruto now the seventh hokage to call a five kage summit so that he can share his theory with the other kage sasuke comes to suspect that she created the white zetsu army in order to face some greater threat not wishing to cause a panic the kage agree to keep this to themselves for the time being wanting to safeguard the future of his daughter and the new generation sasuke continues his wanderings as he tries to find more information using his rinnegan to inspect other dimensions in the anime after a remnant of root failed to destroy the village naruto brought the research of gozu tenno to sasuke realizing the true nature behind it sasuke was amazed at how close danzo came to replicating kaguyas technique after noting that it would help in his investigation naruto suggested that sasuke return to the village for a while sasuke however simply asked naruto to apologize to sakura for his continued absents before leaving11 years later while sasuke is traveling he notices that something has gone amiss he then gets attacked by a cloaked individual wielding a kusarigama after fending his opponent off with his sword and a stream of lightning sasuke notices that the person has a sharingan and wears the uchiha clans family crest on his back as the mysterious shinobi flees a confused sasuke ponders how this is possible following this sasuke sends a messenger hawk to inform uzumaki naruto of the recent event asking to meet with him later at the waiting point sarada arrived having joined naruto on the journey to finally see her father again sasuke caught her by surprise where sarada was crying with joy after finally seeing her father for as long as she could remember sasuke however being cautious and not recognizing his daughter drew his sword in suspicion that she was affiliated with the boy that attacked him sasuke then moved to attack sarada who dodged his blade he then moved to attack her with his hand only for sarada to scream out daddy causing sasuke to realise who she is and cease his attack sarada then questioned who her real mother was but received no answer she then demanded to know what sasuke had been up to all this time but he told her it was none of her business causing her to run out the door crying with naruto in pursuit to comfort her afterwards after sensing shin and his father were attacking outside sasuke hurried outside to aid naruto and to protect his daughter sasuke quickly engaged the mysterious man swatting away his blades with his own sword only for the man to catch sasukes own blade one the shins then attacked from behind only for sasuke to use his rinnegan to swap places and launch a great fireball technique the man quickly pulled shin in the way of the blast to take the blunt of the damage amazed at sasukes dojutsu might he voiced his desire to make it his own and introduced himself as shin uchiha as well adultshin then took advantage of sasuke letting his guard by manipulating sasukes sword into stabbing naruto the enemy then took advantage of sasukes fatherly instincts by launching more blades at sarada forcing sasuke to shield his daughter with his body sakura appeared and quickly pummeled the man in to submission shocking sasuke and the others of her sudden arrival with the fight seemingly over sakura apologized for how this all happened to which sasuke insisted it wasnt her fault suddenly a small sharingan creature appeared and teleported shin his son and sakura realizing that shins arm was embedded with multiple sharingan like danzos sasuke surmised that orochimaru was behind this accepting narutos call to bring the kids along due to that sarada is also being targeted they went to orochimarus hideout for answers along they way they met with yamato who watched over orochimaru from the outside upon arriving they were greeted by suigetsu and jugo shortly followed by orochimaru sasuke promised retaliation if orochimaru was involved in the attack on his daughter and the kidnapping of his wife orochimaru denied any involvement but he explained the origin of shin uchiha as well as his clones following orochimarus explanation sasuke asked where shin is orochimaru happily decided to tell so sasuke could kill shin for him later sasuke waited outside with orochimaru and his men for naruto and the kids to which sasuke berated them for making him wait as orochimaru noted that sakura might be dead sasuke calmly denied that being possible with his rinnegan finally regaining its full power after using it to investigate kaguyas dimensions he prepared his susanoo to take everyone with him and ordered naruto not to upset sarada soon after entering the separate dimension with his allies sasuke asked naruto to detect where sakura was they soon found her engaged in battle against shin sasuke quickly dove in with susanoo and use it to crush shin into submission while sasuke checked to make sure his wife was okay shin called his clones to distract the enemies while he escaped instead the clones betrayed and stabbed shin to which one of them simply explained that they outgrew the need of shin thousands of more shinclones then appeared while naruto dealt with the army through his shadow clones sasuke swiftly took down a giant shinclone with his susanoo shin took advantage of this fight to escape with his time–space technique attempting to take the children with him through his creature but sasuke warned sarada to this sarada quickly killed the creature while shin overtaxed himself sasuke then watched in shock and pride as sarada revealed her own strength to join the fight and defeated several shinclones by activating her sharingan and using the same monstrous strength like her mother after learning that sakura is indeed her biological mother sarada asks sasuke if he believes their family was connected to each other by their feelings which he replies he does when asked why he says its because sarada as their daughter is proof of their bond sasuke then asks naruto what should they do with the clones and naruto proposes they be left at the new orphanage in konoha which sasuke considers too soft but doesnt disagree with him upon returning to konoha he shares his first family dinner with sakura and sarada at some point sasuke and his family pose for a portrait together after an unknown amount of time he prepares to leave the village to continue with his traveling seeing sarada upset he surprises her by hugging her and affectionately pokes her in the forehead promising to come home soon when sakura initiates a kiss from him he turns around and bids them farewell leaving sakura disappointed while leaving he silently smiles in amusement after seeing this while holding the lunch box that sakura made for him film appearances naruto movie 1sasuke in the first naruto movie sasuke joined his fellow teammates on a mission to protect the actress koyuki as she travelled to the land of snow later sasuke encountered fubuki kakuyoku and defeated her with the lion combo sasuke used chidori to damage dotō kazahanas armour which led to him being knocked out he was seen looking out at the newly created land of the spring with sakura holding his head in the ending credits in a postcredits scene he was the one who got kazahana koyuki s autograph for naruto naruto movie 2sasuke made a very short cameo when naruto was unconscious he had a dream of him and sasuke walking towards each other however they passed by each other without a word with this naruto woke up into the battle the point of the dream however emphasised narutos regret over losing sasuke and strengthened his resolve not to lose any more friends naruto shippuuden movie 1sasuke was mentioned by tsunade when lee became his replacement naruto shippuuden movie 2sasuke was summoned by orochimaru and was told by him about the recent sky ninjas attack on konoha to which sasuke made clear that he didnt care orochimaru then gave him an assignment telling him to go retrieve a scroll from a man named shinnō near the end of the movie he made his appearance just as naruto was about to finish off shinnō stopping naruto and cutting off shinnōs flow of chakra by hitting his chakra points with chidori senbon something only the byakugan can usually see he and naruto quickly chased after a fleeing shinnō only to find themselves in a deep chamber with a strange large cocoon that seemed to absorb any chakra in the area it was revealed to be a seed of the zerotails that shinnō had planted he taunts both of them and an angry naruto jumps down to fight him sasuke soon follows suit the cocoon then attacked sasuke and naruto and was able to restrain them until they both released their chakra from the cursed seal and the ninetails respectively together naruto defeated the cocoon with the tornado rasengan while sasuke used his flapping chidori amaru released hinata hyūga and the rest of the villagers who had been taken prisoner as sasuke and naruto exited the building hinata and the villagers all boarded a flying lifeboat which they found outside the temple amaru scrambled to reach a launching lever away from the boat but naruto appeared again and ordered amaru to get in the boat assuring her that he would take care of the launch she refused but sasuke appeared behind her and threw her in by force as the lifeboat left a tentacle appeared and tried to stop the boat leaving but sasuke cut it away naruto then forced sasuke off the flying fortress onto the ship with a rasengan leaving him alone to destroy the flying ruins sasuke then uses the full cursed seal to fly away he is next seen watching naruto being saved by jiraiya from a distance sasuke turns around and goes back to orochimarus hideout he gave him the scroll orochimaru had asked for though kabuto pointed out that he didnt bring shinnō and its not like him to fail a mission orochimaru notices that sasuke seemed different and asks him if a good thing happened to him he pauses into the doorway but doesnt say anything and walks out once outside he thinks about what naruto had said to him as he blew sasuke onto the lifeboat that he would bring him back home one day he then resumed his training naruto shippuuden movie 3sasuke appeared in a few flashbacks when sai asked naruto about what kakashi had taught him naruto shippuuden movie 6the alternate worlds sasuke didnt became a missingnin and thus is still a resident of konoha furthermore while still cocky and assertive this sasuke is more carefree compared to the brooding loner that naruto and sakura know and dresses more casually and fashionably the alternate sasuke seems to return sakuras feelings by giving her a rose to show how he cares for her that makes her happy however it is later revealed this sasuke takes full advantage of girls being naturally attracted to him becoming a flirt who gives roses to a lot of other girls much to sakuras dismay naruto shippuuden movie 7continuing his journey around the world sasuke eventually crosses paths with hyuga hiashi who had earlier been injured in his battle against toneris puppets while rescuing hiashi he watches as a large meteorite descends from the sky and obliterates nearby returning to konoha sasuke indiscreetly drops hiashi off to be healed while other konoha shinobi protect the village from falling comets lee and other taijutsu users manage to destroy a piece of a large meteorite but the remainder of it continues hurdling towards the village with no one else able to stop the meteorite sasuke activates his chidori and destroys it resulting in a massive explosion after informing kakashi that it was his job to protect the village since naruto was away sasuke mysteriously vanishes coinciding with narutos marriage to hinata sasuke continues his journey around the world wandering in the desert once more boruto movie during his continued travels sasuke engaged in a fight with otsutsuki kinshiki he is then confronted by otsutsuki momoshiki who starts eating small red chakra fruits that gives him the power to create a massive sphere of chakra which he hurls at sasuke by using his rinnegans abilities he is ultimately able to escape unable to read the scroll with his rinnegan sasuke takes it back to konoha to have it deciphered he stops at narutos house to deliver it to him but is attacked by narutos son uzumaki boruto who mistook sasuke for his father sasuke easily blocks the attack and after boruto apologized for the misunderstanding he asks him for his name since he knows that he is narutos sonsoon after he asks hinata where naruto is while boruto who realizes that sasuke is his fathers rival looks at him with admiration sasuke leaves shortly after hinata tells him that naruto is at his office as sasuke is half way to the hokage’s office he finds naruto’s tattered old outfit that boruto previously threw out the window and picks it up he arrives at narutos office to ask him to help decipher the scroll and hands him the jacket sasuke says he met boruto and says that the boy seems to be like how naruto was at that age however naruto insists that boruto is similar to sasuke when he was younger but then goes back on that statement  noting that boruto is different from both of them because he has never truly worked as hard as the ninja of their time  using the perfect condition of borutos clothing as an example they make a bet on whether the nature of a shinobi has changed even in regards to boruto to which sasuke says it hasnt and naruto says it has sasuke then calls naruto a loser after he declared that he won the contest this time after leaving narutos office while sasuke was on his way home to see his wife and daughter he is then attacked by boruto who he easily defeats by kicking his legs upon seeing that naruto was right about borutos clothes sasuke hears boruto asking him to be his apprentice because there is someone he wants to defeat unimpressed sasuke asks him if he can use the rasengan to which boruto says shows an angry look on his face therefore sasuke tells him that he cant be his student unless he learns the technique while walking away sasuke declared that his earlier conversation with naruto hasnt been over or decided yet after a while boruto managed to master the rasengan but when sasuke noted how small it was boruto thought this meant sasuke was disappointed and threw the rasengan in his frustration which disappeared before running off sarada then reveals herself to her father and tries to convince him that he was being too hard on boruto as he usually didnt apply that kind of dedication to anything sasuke tells his daughter that boruto jumped to the wrong conclusion and that he was going to agree to make him his student in truth sasuke was quite satisfied further impressed by the wind nature boruto applies to his rasengan the next day boruto demonstrates a normalsized rasengan which sasuke recognises to be a result of using the kote when sasuke asks if he did it all in one day boruto tries to cover this up by saying his talent is nothing like narutos sasuke cryptically references the fact that boruto was willing to cheat to attain his goal by saying boruto was quite different from naruto and he hoped it wasnt the case nonetheless he agrees to train boruto since he already met his requirement after his day training with sasuke the two sit by a fire and talk boruto asks him to tell him about naruto however sasuke tells boruto about narutos childhood by saying that all he did was go around saying hed become the hokage he goes on saying that naruto was quite a loser and stubborn as hell but when boruto asks about his fathers weaknesses sasuke explains that naruto had many weaknesses but nonetheless managed to pull himself up with his own strength and becamee the hokage believing borutos approach to be incorrect  sasuke explained that boruto doesnt need to understand the current naruto but the naruto that made it all the way here this doesnt satisfy boruto so he throws himself into training for the upcoming chunin exams he learns the shurikenjutsu while boruto throws the shuriken sasuke tells boruto to curve the shuriken boruto asks him how is he suppose to bend it that far but after sasuke throws the shuriken by having it curve he tells boruto to use his head a little and dont expect an immediate answer while training after passing the first round of the exams boruto struggles with bending his throws  complaining that shurikenjutsu is saradas specialty because she is sasukes daughter sasuke retorts this assertion by applying the same reasoning to boruto regarding the shadow clone technique he makes 8 shadow clones in front of boruto when sasuke asks boruto if the shadow clone technique is his speciality boruto says its his fathers however sasuke tells boruto that cant make anymore excuses he also says that naruto can make a thousand shadow clones as the finals of the chunin exams commence sasuke visited one of naruto in the lab he asks if the scroll had been deciphered and naruto said it wont be long now however before leaving naruto says he learned from konohamaru that sasuke is training boruto naruto then tells him that he might be right about the soul of a shinobi never changing sasuke agrees and takes his leav when the scroll is deciphered on the day of the chunin exams finals he reads what it says and finds his suspicions about the threat kaguya was preparing for confirmed and rushes to inform naruto while saying that they had to cancel the exams when he arrives at the stadium where the finals are being held kinshiki and momoshiki are already attacking sasuke rescues sarada from falling debris but is confronted by kinshiki when he lands on the ground however shikamaru briefly restrains kinshiki and momoshiki allowing sasuke to tell naruto what the scroll said he says that kinshiki and momoshiki harvest planets chakra in order to prolong their lives and that kaguya was building a white zetsu army to prepare for their inevitable invasion as momoshiki starts attacking naruto forms his tailed beast mode around boruto and sarada in order to protect them whereas sasuke layers his susanoo over this to provide additional protection the shield is insufficient against momoshiki so naruto instructs sasuke to focus on protecting the children while he fights momoshiki alone sasuke does so staying with boruto and sarada and as a result preventing him from stopping narutos capture with his father gone boruto feels guilty about how he treated naruto while boruto walks to the hokage office sasuke picks up the kote that boruto threw to the ground when sasuke goes into narutos office to look for boruto he finds the boy wearing narutos old jacket even overhearing boruto comment about how uncool he looks which makes sasuke agree with him sasuke mentions to boruto that he received scorn at the exam for cheating that he is technically not even a shinobi anymore and that if it wasnt for his little sister who adores him and his mother who worries over him hed be just like how naruto was when boruto demands to know how his father overcame his hardships sasuke says that boruto should ask naruto himself and goes on to explain that he can still sense narutos chakra meaning that he is alive and that he intends to rescue him when boruto asks sasuke why he even bothered with someone like him sasuke replies that he lost to naruto but he believes boruto is a strong shinobi with the potential to surpass even naruto as well however sasuke says that boruto is his number one student because he is a bigger loser who hates to lose effectively restoring borutos confidence and determination the five kage then reveal themselves and offer their assistance to rescue naruto revealing they are on friendly terms with sasuke however before they leave sasuke lends his forehead protector to boruto who had his confiscated by naruto for cheating in the exams sasuke gathers the rest of the kage with boruto on top of the hokage tower there sasuke uses his rinnegan to open a portal to momoshikis planet before they leave hinata tries to stop boruto from leaving  who then puts on sasukes headband and affirms confidently that hes going to go save his father reminding hinata of naruto when he was young sasuke approves of this demeanor and notes that boruto is finally starting to carry himself like a true shinobi he the heads into the portal and tells boruto to come on when they get there they find naruto being bound on a tree similar to the shinju and about to have kurama extracted from him sasuke and boruto manage to free naruto while the other kage fight off the enemies when naruto asks sasuke what boruto is doing there sasuke simply explains that many things happened and that his son has become a shinobi before he rushes off to fight sasuke helps kurotsuchi and chojuro restrain kinshiki before going to fight momoshiki where he warns naruto not to use ninjutsu on him because he can absorb it however kinshiki manages free himself and fends sasuke and naruto off knowing that there was no other course of action kinshiki tells momoshiki to consume his chakra as he had done to his mentor before him  to which momoshiki agrees in an effort to increase his power momoshiki turns him into a chakra fruit and devours him sasuke and naruto then fight momoshiki awith taijutsu and initially have the upper hand until naruto is briefly imprisoned by momoshiki and sasuke is badly burned by momoshikis lava release after bring freed by the other kage naruto comes to his friends aid and sasuke is healed by kuramas chakra sasuke and naruto combine susanoo and tailed beast mode to cut momoshikis lava creature in half and defeats him however katasuke who had followed them uses his kote in an attempt to finish momoshiki off for good but his attacks are absorbed and momoshikis strength is restored momoshiki uses the techniques he absorbed against them as sasuke protects boruto from the attack momoshiki restrains naruto and the rest of the kage by using the shadow imitation technique and prepares to finish them off sasuke orders boruto to use his rasengan on momoshiki to prevent him from killing the kage but boruto doubts it will work sasuke encourages him to believe in himself including to trust him and borutos rasengan manages to hit momoshiki this works as all the kage are free but an earlier injury prevents naruto from fighting while naruto helps boruto create a parent and child rasengan sasuke holds momoshiki off long enough for boruto to use his shadow clone to destroy his rinnegan boruto then unleash his rasengan and destroys momoshiki after momoshikis defeat sasuke remarks to naruto that he looks terrible to which naruto replies that he doesnt look any better the two sit next to each other looking at boruto and sasuke declares he won their bet by soul of a shinobi remains the same even in boruto after the battle sasuke posed for a photograph with naruto boruto and the other 4 kage considering his life mission complete sasuke returns to konohagakure to spend the rest of his life with his friends and family sasuke is lastly seen on a rooftop with his wife as they watch boruto sarada and mitsuki from afar boruto naruto next generations manga boruto later tells sasuke of his encounter with momoshiki and informs him of the mark on his palm leading to sasuke telling boruto that it wasnt normal and to also be on gaurd a few days later after shojoji the mujina bandits leader was apprehended sai has sasuke come in to interrogate him as he questions shojoji about the mark on borutos palm shojoji reveals that its associated with the oganisation kara and the marks nature is vaguely similar to orochimarus juinjutsu during narutos fight against boruto at the training hall sasuke watches the match from the sideline afterwards sasuke arrives at the hokages office where he tells boruto of the value of scientific ninja weapon and that the danger of the world has yet to be driven out he explains of a coming danger of enemies like the otsutsuki clan naruto also admitted to knowing about borutos mark on his right palm which was another reason naruto approved the development of this advanced weaponry while boruto still insisted they should rely solely on ninjutsu like in the chunin exams naruto noted that the chunin exams were to test ones growth as ninja where as they are now in a battle for survival katasuke then arrived to retrieve his prototype to which naruto assigned team konohamaru a crank mission to escort the lead scientist back to the lab in ryuben city while boruto stormed off in a huff sasuke is certain boruto will calm down soon enough video games uchiha sasuke is a playable character in the following video games battle stadium d o

relationships uchiha mikoto sasukes mother is uchiha mikoto a beautiful woman that was kind to her family sasuke loved his mother dearly and shared a close relationship with her when sasuke was an infant mikoto would always hold him and play with him she was the one who often comforted him when he felt that he was being neglected by his father and she was always quick to assure him that he was wellloved by his father she even secretly told her son that he is the number one topic that his father always talks about when she is with him uchiha fugaku sasukes father is uchiha fugaku the leader of the uchiha clan and military police force despite being a prodigy himself sasuke always felt he was being unfairly compared to itachi by their father as a result of his father spending no time with him while focusing so much on itachi sasuke was determined to win his fathers recognition first by excelling in the ninja academy and then learning the uchihas great fire ball tecnhique which his father taught him and this led him to finally be recognized for his own abilities when itachi began withdrawing from the clan sasukes relationship with his father started to get better until the uchiha clan massacre took place in his final words fugaku asked itachi to take care of sasuke showing his affection and concern for his youngest son uchiha itachi sasukrs older brother is uchiha itachi a men who bears a resemblance to him as accorded by kisame sasukes relationship with itachi is a critical center piece of sasukes life starting from him loving and admiring his older brother to hating him for killing their family to once again loving and admiring him after realizing the truth that itachi spared him out of love as a child sasuke always followed itachi around and wanted nothing more than to train with him and itachi developed a habit of poking sasuke on the forehead and promising to do so later even though itachi never kept his promises with their father paying less attention to sasuke itachi took on the duty to keep sasuke occupied and look out for him even when his missions kept him busy however by the time sasuke entered in the ninja academy itachi started acting hostile towards the clan and distancing himself from them when they suspected him of murdering his best friend before the clans demise sasuke and itachi were able to spend a little more time together while itachi tried to give sasuke methods on winning their fathers acceptance on that fateful night sasuke was horrified to see that itachi killed their entire family and itachis words saying that he spared him because sasuke was unworthy to kill including that itachi demanded for sasuke to get stronger and seek revenge on him as a result sasuke devoted his life to seeking power and clinging to his hatred for itachi in order to achieve revenge on him even to the point where he was willing to sever his bonds to his friends and abandon the village when they first fought sasuke had grown strong enough to be deemed a threat to itachi but the battle abruptly ended when itachi succumbed to his illness upon learning the truth that itachi killed their clan to stop it from revolting against the village and he spared sasuke out of love sasuke initially refused to believe it but as he remembered itachi as a loving brother he came to believe it and was consumed with grief of losing the brother he loved dearly this leads him to conspire to destroy the village to avenge itachi and while he knows this is against itachis wishes the pain of losing his brother and the rage of the villagers living happily in ignorance of itachis sacrifice made it impossible for him to respect his brothers wishes however upon reuniting with itachi in reanimation form sasuke demanded for itachi to tell him the entire truth about the village and his mission but was ignored they then decided to worked together to stop kabuto and the reanimation jutsu itachi tells sasuke that he regrets manipulating him into becoming the person he currently is for the simple reason for allowing sasuke to be the one to judge him for his crimes itachi admits he never intended for sasuke to go the lengths of abandoning his friends and going rogue and ultimately ending up as a criminal but sasuke retorted that he can never accept that itachi wanted him to live in ignorance and walk the path of righteousness forever sasuke proceeded to tell itachi that he can forgive him but the memories of their childhood made it impossible for him to forgive the village and he will destroy it no matter what itachi desired for him while blaming himself for how sasuke turned out itachi apologized to him for everything he had done to him and said he would love sasuke no matter what he chose to do with his life before returning to the afterlife upon being confused on why itachi sacrificed so much for the village sasuke sought out answers to determine whether he should follow itachis wish on protecting the village or continue his quest to destroy it ultimately deciding the villages demise would make itachis sacrifices meaningless sasuke resolves to protect it at all costs his methods though of protecting it was meant to be done through destruction and rebirth which are destroying the village and rebuilding it to a village without darkness which naruto points out is still against itachis wish sasuke said he respected what itachi wanted for him but feels that itachi errored in letting him live and his failure to maintain peace for the village costed him his life although sasuke still holds his brother dearly to him sasuke opted to sever all ties to his memories of itachi in order cut off the past something naruto said would be impossible because of the blood bond between the two brothers and all the events that happened between them eventually after hearing from naruto that he feels pain without sasuke the latter admitts he was always jealous of naruto just like he had always been with itachi sasuke abandons his plans and makes it his final decision to return to the village in order to protect it fulfilling itachis wish for his brother sasuke later adopts itachis ninja way a ninja moving in the shadows to protect the village from threats when sasuke married sakura they decided to name their daughter sarada in honor of itachi as the last kanji in saradas name is similar to the ta of itachis name sasuke would later adopt itachis habit of poking on the forehead as a form of affection which he does with his wife and daughter haruno sakura back in their ninja academy days sasuke considered haruno sakura an annoyance because of her attempts in gaining his affection not practicing her ninja skills and being the only on their team who still have a family sasuke was aware of the fact that sakura had feelings for him but he harbored no interest in her even when they were assigned to team kakashi sasuke was dismayed at being teammates with her and showed no interest in working together with her but when she went too far to tease about narutos childhood on the fact that he was an orphan and didnt have parents a statement which angered sasuke since he shared this trait with naruto sasuke in turn told sakura off for saying that and explained to her that being an orphan make kids without families grow up lonely and that she couldnt possibly understand naruto or him at all sasuke angrily told sakura that she is annoying and she finally knew how naruto felt she decided to be more nicer to naruto for now on in order to understand him and sasuke more after their mission in the land of waves sasuke and sakuras relationship started to change to the point where he began considering her as comrade and someone he needed to protect but he continued to display a disinterest in her desire for romance when sakura wanted to go on a date with sasuke he told to just focus on her training instead of dates this made her sad but what made her angry the most was when sasuke told her that naruto was stronger than her and that she was the weakest of the group when the chunin exams started along with orochimaru giving sasuke the curse mark heaven seal sakura stayed at his and narutos side to protect them from team dosi along with having a goal to surpass both of her teammates when sasuke saw how badly hurt sakura was while he was experimenting with the cursed seals powers he angrily and repeatedly demanded that she tell him who hurt her before he proceeded to break zakus arms after the latter mockingly confessed knowing this is not the sasuke she knows sakura tearfully hugged sasuke and begged him not to kill zaku once sasuke defeated team dosi he begged sakura not to tell naruto about his curse mark since naruto would be worried that the curse mark would damage their teamwork including that naruto would worry about the team overall which was something sasuke didnt wanted and sakura agreed not to tell her teammate about it but when the preliminaries started sakura tried to make sasuke forfeit since the curse mark seal was causing him pain angry at this sasuke rudely told her that his new curse mark seal was none of her business and he could never forgive her if she took away his opportunity of gaining the power he needed for his revenge once sasuke won his preliminarie match she and naruto were happy for him but sakura became more worried for him when he was matched to face gaara in the finals when sasuke was fighting gaara at the finals sakura was still worried about his curse mark seal but kakashi told her it was nothing to worry about sakura was shock that sasukes taijutsu skills were identical to lees she was even more surprise that sasuke had learned a new technique called the chidori while unknown to her that naruto was jealous that the latter had learned a nature type technique something that he havent even learned yet once the invasion of konoha started naruto and sakura were tasked by kakashi to hunt down sasuke and gaara when she and naruto finally got up to sasuke sakura realized that his curse mark seal was getting worse but once gaara tried to attack sasuke she used her body as a shield to protect him much to gaaras shock at remembering his late uncle who also did the same thing gaara then crushed her with his sand hand and sasuke told naruto he needed to do everything in his power to save sakura because he didnt want to lose another precious person again this made naruto had to fight gaara all on his own without her or sasukes help naruto used his teammates as an inspiration to defeat gaara by using the summoning technique something that made sasuke jealous on the fact that his teammate learned the summoning technique before he did once sakura was free from the sand sasuke rescued her and made sure she was taken care of before he returned to fight gaara later when she learned from sasuke that naruto was the one who saved her from gaara during the invasion of konoha she was surprised but grateful and smiled at him however she didnt noticed the jealous scowl on sasukes face because naruto had took credit for defeating gaara at the third hokages funeral sasuke and sakura were seen standing side by side against each other when sasuke lost his attempt for revenge to defeat itachi and was left severally injured sakura stayed at his side while he was unconscious in the hospital but when tsunade arrived in konoha to become the fifth hokage she succeed in waking sasuke up which made sakura tearfully embrace the latter and for the first time he accepted her affectionate gesture however on their land of tea mission sakura told sasuke that naruto defeated aoi and that naruto has took credit for a mission yet again sakura still failed to notice that sasukes curse of hatred was making him more angry and violent than before as he recuperated at the hospital sasuke began rejecting sakuras efforts to help him and he challenged naruto to a fight out of jealousy even though sakura told her teammates that this was crazy she asked naruto to say something but was surprised when he agreed with sasuke upon seeing that the fight was destroying her relationship with her team sakura ran begging her teammates to stop and sasuke upon seeing her tried to pull back but couldnt but she was surprise that kakashi stepped in to stop her teammates from killing each other after the fight naruto who knew about sasukes curse of hatred since their childhood told sakura to stay away from sasuke for her own protection and not to interfere with their fight again this shocked sakura who was worry for sasuke and narutos well being while speaking with naruto alone sakura finally broke her promise to sasuke and told naruto about sasukes curse mark seal naruto on the other hand told sakura that he already knows about orochimaru which surprised her he then told her that everything would be fine between them and sasuke which made her happy however sakura was not completely swayed and feared sasuke would eventually abandon everything and confided in naruto about her fears naruto assured her that sasuke would never leave because he was already strong and this comforted sakura a little bit but still she worried that sasuke was going down the wrong path and decided to confront him herself when sasuke finally defected from konoha sakura was deeply saddened and asked him why he always shuts her out to which he retorts his affairs dont concern her sakura asked him to remember their times as team 7 and telling him that getting revenge wont bring happiness sasuke told her that he did consider staying in konoha with her and their friends but decided revenge was more important a now crying and desperate sakura confessed she was in love with him and begged him to stay even offering to bring him happiness wither he stayed or took her with him despite thanking her and sounding grateful sasuke called her annoying then he knocked sakura unconscious when she threatened to alert the village of his betrayal sakura tearfully begged naruto to bring sasuke back to which he promised her that he will but when the mission became a failure and had made naruto whine up in the hospital seriously injured sakura cursed herself for not being strong enough like naruto to stop sasuke from leaving therefore she decided to help naruto bring sasuke back to konoha nearly two years later when team kakashi gets sai as a replacement for sasuke he refers to sasuke as a traitor which prompts sakura to punch him and threaten him with violence if he ever badmouths sasuke again naruto and sakura agreed that sasuke was a much better teammate than sai while sakura even told the latter that naruto always saw sasuke as his older brother sakura and naruto decided to put their differences with sai aside in order to work together with him to get sasuke back when they finally saw sasuke since that day he defected from konoha the former teammates were surprise to see each other again in so long as sasuke left after admitting that he cut his bond with his former teammates so he can share a bond of hatred with itachi naruto and sakura were depressed that sasuke no longer cares about them and moreso when they realized he was willing to kill them if they stood in his way this left them sad that they failed yet again with naruto admitting that he was weak sakura on the other hand told naruto not to cry and that they should use this failed attempt to train more to become stronger like sasuke even though they fail the mission sakura and naruto formed a good friendship with sai in order for them to help latter understand about sasuke more the importance of teamwork and friendship initially sasuke severed his bond with sakura and no longer cared about her however after forming team taka he slowly began to compare them to team 7 and remembered times he spent with sakura and his former teammates and the fact that he was aware of sakura being a medical ninja seems to imply he kept tabs on her during their threeyear separation this implies that despite his indifference he still harbored a connection to sakura and she remained in his mind but due to his goal of killing itachi and later plotting against konoha he pushed those feelings aside even further as a result of his hatred for konoha overcoming him his feelings for sakura turned into temporary hatred for her just because she is a konoha shinobi and he thought of her as an enemy however as time went on and sasuke became more of a dangerous criminal sakura realized that sasuke could and would not return to konoha by force or his own will she was deeply distressed at the fact that he had to be killed to prevent a war between nations but decided she would do it herself after finding out that narutos promise to bring sasuke back was causing him so much pain sakura also felt that as someone who loves sasuke dearly she would rather kill him than watch him sink further into darkness when she confronted him she was horrified to see how cold and cruel he had become she tried to have him let his guard down by professing her desire to join him in destroying konoha but he knew she was lying in the end she found herself unable to kill sasuke which almost caused her to be killed by him twice and this left her greatly devastated that she came close to being killed by him upon seeing narutos resolve to bring sasuke back no matter the cost sakura decided she would put her faith in both of them during the war sakura still silently admitted that she was still in love with sasuke which troubled and saddnened her due to them technically being enemies but during the climax of the war when sasuke finally returned to fight alongside his former teammates and the alliance she was shocked sasuke told her and the rookie nine that he would become hokage something that shocked her overall all since she knew that this was narutos dream goal overall as they fought the tentails clones sasuke was impressed by sakuras monstrous strength when sai asked sakura how she felt about this sakura using a fake smile told him that she was happy that sasuke has returned to her and her team was finally together again sakura kept tabs on sasuke as he fought obito and madara with naruto and expressed pride at them sasuke saved sakura a few times in critical situations during the battle hinting he still harbors some care for her but she was dismayed when he opted to put the enemy before his comrades such as when he decided against saving her when kaguya teleported them to a lava dimension so he and naruto could focus on sealing kaguya however naruto pointed out that these are times when the body moves on its own such as when sasuke saved naruto on the bridge and sasukes expression seems to confirm that he did subconciously save sakura when the infinite tsukuyomi was activated however he didnt save her when they fell because kakashi acted quickly to save her instead when everyone except team kakashi were trapped in the genjutsu sakura asked sasuke what they should do but sasuke told her that she doesnt need to know since there is nothing she can do in the situation when sasuke was trapped in kaguyas dimensions sakura with the help of a reformed obito used almost all of her chakra to get sasuke out which succeed while being worn out sasuke caught her as she was about to collapse and he thanked her for helping him get out after kaguyas defeat sakuras suspicion that sasuke could not be trusted was confirmed when he announted his intent to start a revolution sakura tried to appeal to sasuke confessing her deep love for him once more and pleading for him to return home if he ever loved her while this had an affect on sasuke he called her annoying again and silenced her with genjutsu when sasuke dismisses her desire for romance kakashi scolds him by stating that sakura loves him so much that she wants to save sasuke from his dark path sasuke took note of this and compared sakuras love for him to that of the one he felt for his family and replied it was from their failed past after sakura woke up from the genjutsu by remembering her childhood of seeing naruto and sasukes rivalry she was worried when kakashi told her that her teammates are having their final battle to settle their rivalry after naruto and sasukes final battle sakura rushed to their side to begin healing them sasuke now redeemed and guiltridden for what had done to sakura sincerely apologized to sakura for all he had put her through despite her slight hesitation she tearfully forgives him and sasuke smiles at her showing his relief that she doesnt hate him when the war ended with kakashi as the six hokage sakura was happy that naruto and kakashi had used their respective influences to absolve sasukes status as a criminal in the wars aftermath sasuke and sakura spent some time together and sasuke genuinely falls in love with her when sasuke was leaving konoha to going on a journey to see the world for himself sakura begged for him to take her with him but he told her no this made her sad as she sulked in front of him and kakashi however sasuke showed genuine affection by poking her forehead by telling her that hell come back to see her again ending it with a thank you two years after the war when hinata asks sakura why is she helping her so much in getting narutos attention she replies that they need to look out for each other in their feelings for others as she feels the exact same way for sasuke although sakura was overall supportive of sasukes journey and resolved to wait for his return she gradually became impatient and even began to doubt he would return she tried to reassure herself that they were getting closer than ever and sasuke despite his lack of expressing it promised her that he would return to see her again in truth while sasuke told the truth about this to sakura he doubted he could ever settle in konoha due to the guilt he felt for betraying her and their friends he would spend two years traveling before a letter sent from naruto mentioning of sakura seeing the good in him compels him to return to konoha and have a better relationship with her based on the novels sakura hiden and sasuke shinden sakura is the first person to meet sasuke when he arrives at the villages gates and he tells her im home sakura in which sakura happily tells sasuke welcome home sasuke sometime later they got married and sakura started to followed sasuke in his travels which led her to become pregnant with his child by refusing to leave sasukes side even during her pregnancy sakura went with sasuke on one of his missions however she gave birth to their daughter sarada in orochimarus hideout with the aid of karin and they returned to konoha where they lived as a normal family for a few years when naruto became hokage sasuke was shown in the sand dimension looking at sakuras old flak jacket sakura would later attend a five kage summit alongside her husband who revealed evidence of why kaguya formed a white zetsu army he says that a potential threat even greater than kaguya was a possibility ultimately it was agreed to keep this all a secret from the public and to allow sasuke to continue his research and go investigate his sources although it was difficult for him to leave his family sasuke said it was the best thing to do in order to protect them during sasukes time away sakura adopted itachis habit of poking sarada in the forehead and telling her maybe next time like itachi always did with sasuke although sakura misses sasuke and wishes for him to be home more often she is very supportive of his duties and is content with her marriage whereas sasuke always feels connected to her and their daughter through his emotions for the sake of protecting their daughter sakura and sasuke vowed to never reveal his past as a criminal to sarada as neither of them want her to hate sasuke or be burdened with ostracism as proof of being in love with sakura sasuke would criticize people for thinking that sakura was weak when facing a powerful enemy and expressed impatience on interrogating orochimaru into revealing shins whereabouts after the latter kidnapped sakura sakura also demonstrates her loyalty to sasuke which is seen when she pretended to be a helpless hostage to trick shin into revealing information about his plans on sasukes behalf before deciding to finish him off sakura smiled when sarada asked her father if he believed that they are bonded by connections which he confirmed yes by reasoning that he and sakura have her as their daughter upon returning to konoha sakura had her first family dinner with sasuke and sarada and even taking their first family photo together after an unknown period of time sasuke prepared to leave to continue his travelling sakura happily watched sasuke embrace and affectionately poke sarada on the forehead promising to return but when sakura wanted a kiss sasuke ignored her initiative for a kiss due to their daughter watching them and sakura sulked just as she did as a genin which amused sasuke while he was holding his lunch now as a married couple sakura refers to sasuke as darling and her husband whereas sasuke often refers to sakura as his wife while sasuke refuses to show affection to sakura in public and makes a habit of teasing her over it he shows her a more soft and gentle side when they are alone and it is strongly implied that they have a very intimate relationship both of them would not only watch over their daughter but their teammates son boruto as well since both of their children are now on the same team and that naruto still have his duties as hokage to handle uchiha sarada sasukes daughter is uchiha sarada sarada looks identical to sasuke with her facial features and personality mirroring sakuras while traveling with sakura she gave birth to sarada in one of orchimarus hideouts while karin assisted them during the delivery before leaving for his mission sasuke was very attentive and loving towards his daughter as sarada recalls him and her mother teaching her how to walk since saradas birth sasuke was determined to keep his past criminal acts a secret from her out of concern she will hate him or be ostracized by others if she ever found out sasuke hoped that if sarada ever does find out the memory of him being a good father will allow her to forgive him after saradas birth sasuke continued his investigation of kaguya and tried to visit with his family whenever he could but his visits were so irregular that sarada quickly forgot about him from her early childhood although sasuke left when she was very young he never forgets about her and feels a deep connection to her and it turns out that he ceased contact with her during his mission because he was worried that his reputation as a powerful shinobi and an uchiha would make her a target by any threats sarada has a strong attachment to her father and always longed to meet him when they did meet for the first time in years sasuke nearly attacked her in a misunderstanding and later hurt her feelings by refusing to answer her questions regarding his absence which briefly strained their relationship sarada also expressed anger at both of her parents for keeping secrets from her and she doubted her father ever cared about her while sasuke admits his mistakes as a father sasuke displays strong parenting skills despite being protective of her sasuke trusted saradas abilities enough to let her join in the battle against shin which was deemed dangerous even for him and naruto although sasuke is willing to lie if will mean protecting her he is also considerate of her feelings such as ordering naruto to not upset sarada although naruto retorted that sasuke is more likely to scare her and is willing to apologize to her for his mistakes sasuke is able to show sarada that he cares about her when he risks his life several times to protect her from shin after the battle with shin he does tell sarada that he and sakura are happy because they have her as their daughter their relationship improved even further once sasuke assures sarada that he loves her as shown where she was able to talk to her father with ease during their first family dinner together and when he hugged her to comfort her being sad of him returning to his mission after his brother and parents sarada is the only person sasuke is comfortable showing affection to in public initially sasuke kept his mission a secret in order to keep sarada safe and give her a normal happy life however when he hears from sarada about how lonely and unloved she felt by his absence sasuke felt guilty for putting the importance of his mission above his daughters feelings seeing how this is similar to how itachi kept the truth about the uchiha massacre from him for a similar reason sasuke makes amends to his daughter by spending more time with her which includes visiting with her more often and being honest with her he also harbors deep pride for his daughter as she demonstrates that she is a strong ninja especially after he learns that she dreams to become hokage one day when he came back to konoha for the chunin exams she still doubted that he would come to watch her perform in the chunin exams however when he met one of her teammates uzumaki boruto who wanted to train as his apprentice since hes narutos rival sasuke told the boy he can be his apprentice when he masters the rasengan but when boruto did master the technique by showing it to him he mistook sasukes comment of how small the rasengan was as a sign that he fail and angrily ran off after he left sarada told her father that boruto is someone that doesnt work too hard and its great that he gotten this far to learn how to do the rasengan sasuke then told his daughter that boruto jumped to the wrong conclusion and he never said that he fail meaning that he did made boruto his apprentice when sasuke finally accepts boruto as his apprentice this made sarada become excited on borutos behalf during the finals of the chunin exams when kinshiki and momoshiki attacked the stadium he saved his daughter from being crushed by falling concrete and expressed relief that she was unharmed he opted to keep her with him as he joined with naruto and boruto when they confronted kinshiki and momoshiki after the stadium got ruined to ensure her safety when the battle got too dangerous sasuke protected his daughter and boruto during the attack since the order was given to him by naruto when naruto got captured by the enemy he was seen off by his daughter and wife before he and boruto went into the portal to go save naruto after naruto was rescued with the defeat of momoshiki and kinshiki sasuke happily watched his daughters team stand on the hokage monument alongside his wife in the novel of the boruto movie sasuke refers to sarada as his beloved daughter uzumaki naruto the rivalry between naruto and sasuke uzumaki naruto is sasukes main rival best friend and surrogate little brother sasuke refers to naruto as dobe whereas naruto refers to sasuke as teme in the english version he calls him loser whereas naruto calls him a jerk when he first met naruto back in the ninja academy sasuke never wanted to befriend naruto while knowing to well that he was an orphan right from the beginning sasuke even consider narutos dream of becoming hokage as nothing but a hopeless task that could never be achieved he admitted that he had always been jealous of naruto for the fact that despite them being so similar naruto turned the loneliness he felt into strength by making bonds with others while sasuke pushed those bonds away thinking them to be a weakness and subjected himself to training and solitude instead in the process sasuke found himself always being in narutos shadow just as he did with his older brother itachi but when sasuke proved to be better than him at everything gaining popularity and admiration naruto was jealous and made it his goal to surpass him ever since then naruto instantly saw sasuke as his main rival and was bent to prove himself as an equal before both youths were made members of team kakashi even though he thought of naruto as a loser sasuke finally understood narutos pain of being an orphan so well to the point that he told sakura off for blaming narutos stupidity on him not having parents something that sasuke could relate to since his while his clan was murdered in truth although naruto was adamant on winning against sasuke who was indifferent to narutos challenges the two actually wanted to be friends but felt unable to admit such thoughts to each other as the series progressed naruto came to view sasuke as a surrogate older brother in turn sasuke also saw naruto as his best friend and main rival up due to narutos influence sasuke was able to achieve some happiness for the first time since losing his family and lose focus on revenge a little bit and developed an attachment to his friends sasuke even acknowledged naruto by wanting to fight him before the preliminary round of the chunin exams however this lasted up until his humiliating defeat at itachis hands convinced him to defect from konoha to train under orochimaru to achieve his goal to avenge his clan against his brother itachi sasukes justification for his defection is that naruto is starting to surpass him since the latter took credit for defeating gaara and had took credit for their land of tea mission the two battle on the hospital rooftop where they almost killed sakura but they were stopped just in time by kakashi after their battle was interrupted sasuke was more angry when he saw that narutos rasengan had caused more damage to the back of a huge water tank when naruto confronts sasuke at the final valley he learns that sasukes decision to abandon the village causes him to develop a new form of indifference and brutality sasuke doesnt care about their friends risked their lives to find him and he decides to kill naruto to not only achieve the mangekyo sharingan but to sever his bond with naruto when naruto refused to accept defeat and vowed to bring sasuke back by force if necessary sasuke was stunned and asked why to which naruto said he thought of sasuke as a brother however this made sasuke seriously try to kill naruto at the end though sasuke wins their fight but can not bring himself to kill naruto and proceeds to met with orochimaru instead even after being defeated by sasuke in an attempt to stop him from leaving naruto still vowed to bring sasuke back no matter what and always believed that sasuke no matter how deep his darkness is can be redeemed narutos desire to save sasuke inspires others to join his cause particularly sai who has been assigned to assassinate sasuke but decided to help team kakashi bring him back when the two met for the first time in two years naruto was angry when sasuke was indifferent to him and said he spared narutos life on a whim rather than guilt and tries to make good on his promise by killing him for real naruto manages to dodge his attack but is still left injured and sasuke escapes which leaves naruto devastated when he learns sasuke killed orochimaru naruto was happy and believed that sasuke was coming back home but when he realized sasuke was going after itachi naruto and his friends began searching for him during a confrontation with itachi naruto was asked if he would kill sasuke if he ever turned against konoha and naruto replied he would defend the village with his life and stop sasuke without killing him by the time they tracked his traces itachi was already dead and sasuke was taken by obito ironically when jiraiya die during his battle with pain naruto finally understood what sasuke meant by losing somone very close to you soon after naruto was horrified to learn sasuke had joined the akatsuki and nearly caused an international incident with kumogakure and he wondered what had drove sasuke to do such a thing gradually naruto came to understand both the nature of the cycle of hatred and the reason of sasukes malice his desire to save sasuke grew even more it became so immense that naruto was willing to take physical abuse from the kumonin rather than sell sasuke out even pleading with the fourth raikage to pardon sasuke for his crimes against his village naruto would later learn that obito manipulated sasuke into focusing his hatred on konoha by telling him why the uchiha clan was killed off according to obito naruto and sasuke were considered mortal enemies as they respectively embody the will of fire and the curse of hatred respectively naruto initially refused to beleive sasuke would ever harm others or turn against konoha if protecting it was itachis wish however he was forced to acknowledge that his dream of saving sasuke was more likely to fail when he learned his friends were plotting to kill sasuke for konohas sake and this left his deeply despaired and made him fell unconscious the bond between naruto and sasuke but upon realizing the depth of sasukes hatred was enough to make him second guess this and made him want to see the current sasuke himself if that was the case upon finding sasuke trying to kill team kakashi and confirming his suspicions inlcuding hearing sasuke refer to him as an outsider and vowing to destroy konoha and kill everyone in order to avenge his clan naruto still refused to back down and kill him but instead said he understood sasukes actions which angered sasuke they proceeded to fight and their mental states connected and sasuke gave naruto two options  kill him or get killed but naruto rejected both naruto concluded that reasoning him out of destroying konoha was no longer a possible option and believed that they would most likely die during their fated conflict naruto was unswayed by sasukes vow to kill him and naruto replied that he was ready to die in their next battle if it came to that but he would do so once he saved sasuke narutos words greatly angered sasuke to the point that sasuke decided to have itachis eyes implanted into him so he can gain the power to kill naruto despite his earlier refusal to accept them upon returning to konoha naruto told his friends of his confrontation with sasuke but not saying their decision to fight to the death and persuaded them to call off their plan to kill sasuke naruto explains only he is capable to stopping sasuke despite everyones concern for him naruto remained optimistic in his belief that he can still get through to sasuke and convince him to return home although naruto was fully prepared to die if he were to fight sasuke during the war he still held out hope that sasuke would have a change of heart beforehand aside from igniting the fourth shinobi war and causing so much deaths and chaos naruto vowed to never forgive obito for turning sasuke against everyone for his own goals as the fourth shinobi war began sasuke once finding out about it was more focused on finding naruto and cutting him down however once he learns the goals of the war and concluding that konohas destruction will make itachis sacrifices meaningless sasuke renounced his intent to destroy konoha and decided to join forces with the allied shinobi forces to stop obito madara and the tentails this made naruto a little bit suspicious at first but he acted causally when sasuke arrived with naruto mocking him for arriving late despite the past incidents the rivalry between the two had not changed and their innate rivalry still causes naruto and sasuke to challenge each other in every way when sasuke said he would become hokage to change the village naruto finally understood itachis words and says that he was the who would be hokage also as sasuke witnessed the magnitude of narutos newfound abilities on the battlefield during the fourth shinobi war he was increasingly jealous ironically naruto also witness sasukes new mangekyo sharingan which surprised him throughout the war sasuke protected naruto from obito madara and kaguya for the sole reason of them being the only ones capable of ending the war as well as retaining his goal of fighting naruto once it was over later when both naruto and sasuke meet the sage of the six paths and learning they are the reincarnations of his sons naruto declares even though they are not brothers he was confident that together they could change the world sasuke on the other hand acknowledges naruto as his best friend but decides to kill him to erase the past after they successfully seal away kaguya sasuke reveals his intent of a revolution and notes that naruto is the only one capable of stopping him of achieving his goal hagoromo believed this was a result of the constant fighting between his sons although naruto is quick to claim he is not asura and sasuke is not indra naruto also reveals his intent to end the brothers feud and his feud with sasuke despite the fact that sasuke intends to kill his former comrade naruto decides that he has no other choice but to stop sasuke since sasuke doesnt understand what it means to become hokage and that he choose to be alone over all including that sasuke doesnt understand itachi at all and that the shinobi world will not agree with him on the choices that he will make along with learning things from people in his own past and to use teamwork as well when they battle kaguya sasuke responds that itachi errored by sparing him during the massacre and his actions only resulted in his death including that he doesnt care what others think of his goal and his idea of being hokage means to be the worlds sole enemy in order to force the nations into working together rather than fighting each other again sasuke says to naruto as the only person capable of stopping him that he will be the last person he kills and this will allow him to erase the past and bring forth a brighter future much to narutos outrage the two engaged in a battle but sasuke frequently mocked naruto for not fighting seriously and naruto said he didnt want to kill him sasuke then started using more force to get naruto to fighting seriously which succeeded as naruto was in tail beast mode while sasuke was using his susanoo while inside their subconscious naruto asked sasuke several times to look at the error in his judgment but sasuke was adamant on pursuing his goal and narutos death will allow him to be alone for good so he can fulfill his goal as the battle drew to a close both teens were left injured to the point of being unable to move and lost their dominant arms lying together as they waited for death naruto explained that he and sasuke are still friends despite everything because of the pain they feel when the other is going through a tough time finally touched by narutos resolve sasuke acknowledged naruto and admitted defeat with sasuke finally breaking free of his clans curse of hatred sasuke asked naruto to allow him to die in order to break the cycle of hatred including to give kakashi his sharingan but naruto refused and convinced sasuke to stay alive and redeem himself as such they were able to undo the infinite tsukuyomi together when the war ended naruto was a key factor in helping secure a pardon for sasukes crimes by giving a good word of the heroic deeds he did to help end the war as sasuke left the village to travel the world naruto came to greet him and gave him back his forehead protector with sasuke saying he would keep it until their next battle confirming their friendship and surrogate brotherhood as he left sasuke credited naruto for teaching him the true meaning of a ninja and he finally understood why naruto never gave up on him as sasuke was on his journey he and naruto maintained contact with naruto providing tabs of konoha for sasuke two years after the war ended while naruto was on the moon going on a mission to rescue hinata and hanabi from toneri sasuke returned to konoha with an injure hiashi while in the village fighting off the meteors that were heading straight for the village sasuke told kakashi since naruto is not in the village that it was his job and choice to protect kakashi and the rest of the village while naruto was away after naruto defeated toneri and have saved the hyuga sisters along with saving the shinobi world once again sasuke left konoha again to travel the world once more sasuke was the only rookie nine member that didnt attend naruto and hinatas wedding at the same time when sasuke was suspected of joining a terrorist organization and refused to comment on the rumors naruto wasnt concerned because he concluded sasuke thought the rumors were too ridiculous for attention but naruto only got worried when the five kage were considering on hunting him down and went on a mission to help find the imposters later on naruto expresses pride at sasuke for helping criminals turn their lives around by expressing his own experiences to them sasuke and naruto stay in contact through letters as sasuke continues his journey but didnt return to watch narutos hokage inauguration when naruto attend a five kage summit alongside his former teammates in which sasuke revealed evidence that kaguya formed a white zetsu army because of a threat greater than her ultimately it was agreed to keep this all a secret from the public and to allow sasuke to continue his research and go investigate his sources naruto wanted to help his former teammate with the mission but sasuke told him to protect the village overall since that its the hokages duty now that he is the seventh hokage including that they are still trying to bring peace to the shinobi world to which naruto agree with naruto would later tell sasukes daughter that the two were still rivals and that despite sasukes shortcomings as a person and a father he was a terrific shinobi that he could see a lot of in her despite this naruto showed a degree of frustration and disdain towards sasuke when he found out sarada was actually the daughter of karin presumably because this would likely mean sasuke cheated on sakura however all of this turned out to be untrue as revealed by karin herself that she only helped deliver sarada in orochimarus hideout while naruto was too busy preparing the village for the chunin exams sasuke and met naruto in the hokage office they talked about the scroll that sasuke found and that he met boruto when sasuke told naruto that boruto is exactly like him when he was young naruto told him that boruto is exactly like the uchiha when he was young nevertheless both agree that boruto is like their younger selfs much later naruto approved of sasuke training boruto to get him prepared for the exam because konohamaru told him including that naruto believes that sasuke was right about a shinobis will never changing then when momoshiki and kinshiki attacking the stadium where the chunin exam finals were taking place naruto protected his son from momoshiki before being joined by sasuke and sarada sasuke informed naruto that the two enemies are the new threat theyve been anticipating for all along determined to protect his son and friends naruto shields them from momoshikis jutsu and disappears after asking sasuke to take care of boruto and sarada sasuke quickly forms a rescue mission with the four kage and meets with a grieving boruto to tell the boy of his plan seeing how much boruto is like naruto sasuke gives him his own headband declares him a ninja once more and asks him to join the mission once he and his rescue team found naruto sasuke and boruto cutted naruto from from the shinju tree after the other kage failed to defeat kinshiki naruto and sasuke joined forces to fight him but had trouble keeping up after momoshiki absorbed him naruto reacted in anger after seeing sasuke burned and injured but was relieved to find he was alright and still able to fight while boruto expresses doubt that he can help both naruto and sasuke encourage him to give his best after the battle ends naruto sits with sasuke and the two have a friendly argument over how dirty they look even by making jokes along with sasuke declaring that he won their bet in which naruto happily agrees that sasuke won their bet they even took a photo together with boruto and the other four kage the relationship between the two men has become much more friendly allowing them to entrust the safety of their respective children to each other whereas even through boruto has no intention of becoming hokage he wants to become a great shinobi like sasuke who supports the hokage and protects the village from the shadows including that both of their children are now on the same team hinting that both men keeps each others respective new families at high guard even though sasuke says he no longer desires to be hokage and says it is a job not suited for him naruto refers to him as the other hokage as the person who protects the village from the outside whereas naruto protects it from the inside hyuga hinata up until the fourth shinobi war there was almost no interaction between sasuke and hyuga hinata since she was the only girl of their age group who was not romantically interested in sasuke and only had feelings for naruto hinata was aware of sakuras feelings for sasuke and she felt comfortable discussing her feelings for naruto with sakura because of this hinata reluctantly agreed with her friends to consider eliminating sasuke for the villages sake but right away took narutos side in letting him deal with sasuke alone during the war hinata was shocked when sasuke arrived to help and also when he announced he would become hokage she used her byakugan to observe sasuke and naruto fight obito and madara before falling victim to the infinite tsukuyomi after the war hinata forgives sasuke for his crimes and she is on friendly terms with him which is seen years after the war when she happily greets him during his visit to her and narutos house in the boruto movie she also trusts sasuke enough to let him take her son boruto into battle against momoshiki and kinshiki hyuga neji sasuke and hyuga neji strongly disliked each other and continued to until nejis death during the war neji thought of sasuke as someone arrogant and never hesitated to make his thoughts of him clear sasuke also thought of neji as someone arrogant but paid no attention to him due to him finding someone like neji not worth his attention however during the second phrase of the chunin exams sasuke saw how strong neji was and seemingly began to respect him for his powers neji was one of the genin chosen to stop sasuke from going to orochimaru and abandoning konoha finding it is hopeless to stop sasuke as he commits serious crimes neji has no hesitations on agreeing to kill sasuke to protect the village when naruto opposed them and ordered them to leave sasuke to him neji was angry that naruto didnt take the opportunity to stop sasuke but naruto said only he can fight sasuke but this leaves neji unsatisfied after neji dies in combat it is implied that sasuke felt bad for nejis death following the end of the war and attended his funeral with their friends uzumaki boruto uzumaki boruto is narutos son and sasukes apprentice although they didnt formally meet until boruto was a genin the two quickly developed a strong bond because sasuke is narutos best friend and rival boruto refers to him as uncle sasuke and looks up to him despite knowing that sasuke once betrayed the village and was a criminal once sasuke heard from naruto about borutos laziness when it comes to training and preferring to take shortcuts to increase his abilities including to complete missions along with trying to do all of this by not wanting to get his clothes dirty including that he acts like sasuke when it comes to being arrogant and not wanting to use teamwork sasuke decided to do something about it in order to make boruto understand how naruto was at his age but when boruto asked him to be his student so he could surpass his father sasuke offered him a deal which was he would accept boruto as his student if he mastered the rasengan knowing how difficult it takes to perfect the technique and forcing boruto to take his training seriously for once although he was initially unimpressed with borutos desire to surpass naruto sasuke was impressed with borutos small rasengan due to that he can subconsciously apply a change in the chakra nature including that the boy didnt notice how dirty his clothes were even when he then discovered that boruto had created a normal sized rasengan the next day by using a kote and was disappointed in the boy sasuke felt obligated to keep his promise to boruto and agreed to train him hoping their training will persuade boruto to work hard to increase his abilities like how he and naruto had to sasuke teaches boruto the shurikenjutsu and often lectured him to use his head to succeed in his training rather than worrying how to complete the training as well as reminding him that hard work makes it possible for others to learn techniques that are specialties to certain clans like narutos shadow clone technique as they trained together sasuke told boruto about how naruto was as a child describing him as someone who would always ranted about becoming the hokage and was a stubborn loser but boruto said he wanted to learn his fathers weaknesses and sasuke explained that naruto was full of weaknesses but he worked hard to overcome them and become hokage he told boruto that it was best for him to understand the past naruto rather than the current naruto as momoshiki and kinshiki began their rampage in konoha sasuke protected boruto and sarada from getting killed and promised naruto that he would take care of boruto before naruto was captured with his fathers disappearance this devastates boruto greatly and leaves him guiltridden for how badly he treated naruto knowing lecturing the boy would do no good sasuke instead sympathized with him and tells him that he is repeating the same mistakes his father had at his age when boruto asked sasuke how naruto endure from his past mistakes and why would he bother with someone like him sasuke elaborates that as narutos son boruto has the potential to surpass his father including that boruto is his number one student and just like naruto he is a bigger loser because he hates to lose this conversation finally makes boruto get out of his guiltridden state and made him feel confident again sasuke truly believes boruto can be a stronger ninja than naruto and had faith in the boy to the point where he felt it was acceptable to bring boruto along with him and the other kage to rescue naruto sasuke seems to be fond of boruto and is willing to risk his life to protect boruto and trusts borutos abilities which is seen when he told boruto to use his rasengan to stop momoshiki from killing the kage and when boruto doubted it would work sasuke told him to trust him or else he would have never brought the boy along sasuke even helps boruto teleport in front of momoshiki to destroy his rinnegan as a result of his bond with sasuke it finally boruto reconcile with his father for good including that boruto decided to make it his dream to become a ninja like sasuke a ninja who protects the village from the shadows and supports the hokage which is why boruto promises to sarada that he will protect her when she becomes hokage hatake kakashi sasukes teacher is hatake kakashi when he was assigned to team kakashi after becoming a genin and was his first mentor kakashi was assigned as sasukes teacher at the request of the third hokage to ensure that sasuke would not follow the path of revenge and hatred initially seeing sasuke as an immature boy who allows his emotions to cloud his judgment and disregard help from others kakashi came to realize that sasukes feelings of hate and anguish stemming from his brother killing their clan are much deeper than he believed and fears this will become his ultimate downfall unless there is no intervention to appease sasukes desire for power kakashi took on the duty to personally train him and taught him the chidori and also included sasuke on several highranking missions kakashi also frequently reminded sasuke the importance of teamwork and how the whole team 7 has become like a big family in turn sasuke was able to briefly let go of his desire for revenge and establish bonds with kakashi naruto and sakura and was able to achieve some happiness for the first time since his clans murder although he doesnt refer to him as sensei sasuke has nothing but respect for kakashi but is often annoyed with kakashis habit of arriving late for meeting and acting carefree in situations once sasuke relapsed back into darkness due to his jealousy at naruto kakashi was quick to restrain him and lecture him by reminding him that sacrificng the new family he has to avenge the one he lost is more painful than losing his original family which affected sasuke and made him question whether revenge or his bond with team 7 was more important when sasuke defected from konoha kakashi took the blame for not being able to get through to his student almost three years later kakashi becomes deeply disappointed as sasuke becomes a dangerous international criminal and was plotting to destroy the village to avenge his clan as sakura and the rest of the konoha 11 minus naruto were prepared to kill sasuke to prevent him from starting a war among the nations kakashi felt it was his duty as his teacher to personally stop sasuke and was able to stop sasuke in time from killing sakura kakashi made two attempts to convince sasuke that there is more to life than his clan and begged for him to remember the happy times he shared with his friends but sasuke took this as an insult to itachis sacrifice and further exressed rage at kakashi for possessing a sharingan despite not being a uchiha making him wanting to kill him even more now believing that saving sasuke was a lost cause kakashi fought him with the intent on killing him until naruto arrived and convinced kakashi and the others to let him deal with sasuke during the fourth shinobi war sasuke arrived on the battlefield after deciding that destroying the village would make itachis sacrifice meaningless and joins forces with the allied shinobi forces he and kakashi putted their differences aside as they and the rest of the allied forces fought obito madara and kaguya as they fought madara kakashi remembered when he first met sasuke after team 7 was formed and how much sasuke has changed since their introductions and questions sasuke what his intents are now that itachi is gone when sasuke didnt answer kakashi didnt push the issue because they had a war to worry about however much like how kakashi was when he was younger sasuke was unwilling to save his teacher and sakura when they fought kaguya because he told naruto sealing kaguya came before their comrades which saddened kakashi he also reacted to dismay when sasuke announced he was taking full leadership of team 7 but kakashi eventually agreed that it was best to let sasuke be in charge because his rinnegan was likely the only way to stop kaguya despite sasukes crimes and disregard for his wellbeing kakashi still cares for sasuke as his student which is evident when he instantly jumps in front of sasuke to save him from being killed by kaguya after sealing kaguya kakashi was enraged at sasuke for announcing his intent to start a revolution and then for putting sakura under a genjutsu after she pleaded for him to return home as sasuke said there was no reason for him and sakura to love each other kakashi said he only needs a reason to hate someone and sakura not only simply wants to save him but her love for him is breaking her heart once sasuke was redeemed by naruto kakashi happily looked at his team coming back together for good kakashis first act after becoming the sixth hokage is to pardon sasuke for his crimes based on his service in the war and warns him to keep himself under control or else it will be his responsibility sasuke thanks kakashi for his forgiveness and apologizes for everything he had done over the next several years kakashi would continue to act as a mentor for sasuke who keeps tabs on the village during his travels and he would become a surrogate grandfather to sasuke and sakuras daughter sarada sai sai was assigned to team kakashi as sasukes replacement in the beginning of part ii nearly three years after sasuke left konoha when they first met sai tricked orochimaru and kabuto into thinking he was interested in joining them in plotting against konoha so that he can assassinate sasuke at danzos order sasuke showed no interest in introducing himself to sai and referred to him as a loser when sai persisted and used fake friendliness sasuke grew irritated and used a powerful genjutsu to scare him which was successful and caused sai to fall to his knees sai questioned himself why someone with no emotion like him can so easily be intimidated by sasukes genjutsu due to meeting naruto and hearing his resolve to save sasuke no matter what and despite his betrayal sai went against his mission of assassinating sasuke and tried to reason with him into seeing the bond he had with naruto however this only enraged sasuke who had admitted that he severed his bond with his former teammates a long time ago to maintain a bond of hatred with his brother although not liking sasuke and still considering him a traitor sai continued to assist naruto and sakura into chasing after sasuke and bringing him home this also allowed sai to gradually understand the meaning of love friendship and how narutos promise to sakura to bring sasuke back is affecting him as sasukes actions cause tension between the nations and affect his former teammates sai expresses anger at sasuke for the damage he is inflicting on naruto and sakura troubled by the pain naruto is going through seemingly to keep his promise sai confronts sakura and tells her that he believes naruto is suffering because of the pain she and sasuke are putting him through as well as the fact that naruto was in love with her however this causes sakura to hurt narutos feelings when she falsely confesses to naruto that she loves him in order to free him from the promise but he knew she was lying realizing sakuras intents sai informs naruto that he believes sakura plans to kill sasuke to save him from darkness and he blames himself for her decision however sai believes that saving sasuke is now a lost cause and seemingly supports the possibility that he will have to be eliminated for everyones safety but naruto is able to sort all this out with sai and the others by saying he will deal with sasuke alone as the war raged on sai was surprised when sasuke arrived on the battlefield to help the allied forces and told sakura that while he doesnt know sasuke well sasuke can not be trusted due to his prior crimes sakura however said she was happy sasuke was back and smiled which sai saw was fake and only convinced him that she too didnt trust sasuke still sai worked alongside with sasuke as they fought the tentails obito and madara after the war ended sai forgives sasuke for his crimes and feels comfortable to consider him a comrade during sasukes travels he and sai stay in contact in which sai provides details of konoha to sasuke who provides information on potential threats to sai however sasuke still dislikes sai and only seems to tolerate him for naruto and sakuras sake nara shikamaru nara shikamaru and sasuke are childhood classmates and both are considered to be a genius although shikamaru was considered a dead last like naruto for his laziness when they were in the ninja academy the two paid little to no attention to the other as sasukes status as a uchiha made him stand out compared to shikamaru when they enrolled in the chunin exams with their respective teams the two briefly worked together and later on a few other missions with other comrades however shikamaru admits to naruto that he doesnt particularly like sasuke for his attitude but he is willing to do whatever it takes to help sasuke because is a fellow comrade of their village this is seen after sasuke leaves the village and shikamaru is given the task to gather naruto and several other genin to find him nearly two years later shikamaru continued to support naruto and sakuras quest to find sasuke for their sake and not mentioning his own conclusion that their efforts were meaningless due to sasuke committing more crimes eventually the discovery that sasuke had worked for the akatsuki and nearly caused an international incident with kumogature led shikamaru to inform his comrades that konoha can no longer continue protecting sasuke and he will have to be killed in order to prevent a war among the nations he personally asks for sakuras consent to this and was unsure how to tell naruto knowing naruto would greatly oppose it but sakura offered to tell naruto herself in the end though naruto finds out what his friends had planned to do and is able to settle it when sasuke arrived to the battlefield during the war shikamaru was at first shocked and then angry and suspicious he was further dumbfounded with the rest of his friends when sasuke said he would become hokage and shikamaru angrily said that was impossible because of the crimes he has committed however the fact that sasuke was willing to help them allowed shikamaru to put his distrust for sasuke aside years after the war shikamaru forgives sasuke for his crimes as sasuke goes through great lengths to protect the village shikamaru seems to be on friendly terms with him such as defending sasuke when naruto complained about sasuke sending a letter rather than using his phone while he was on a mission during the times in which sasuke is in the village he spends some time with naruto and shikamaru yamanaka ino like sakura and so many girls from their age group yamanaka ino was infatuated with sasuke due to his good looks when she learned sakura also had a crush on sasuke the two ended their friendship so they can compete for his affections however sasuke has no interest in ino and thought of her as annoying he always paid no attention to her and rarely spoke to her as she tried to desperately get his attention as the years passed following sasukes departure ino started to realize the imperfections sasuke had and began to genuinely care for his wellbeing although her crush on him had lessoned after she meets sai and takes an interest in him however as most of the konoha 11 discussed the possibility of killing sasuke after learning he had become a dangerous international criminal and was close to getting konoha involved in a war ino broke into tears which showed she still had feelings of endearment for him this was also shown when he suddenly arrived to the battlefield to lend help tot he allied forces and ino wanted to speak to him before being told by shikamaru and choji to stay away from sasuke for her own safety sasuke only replies that ino is as noisy as ever while under the infinite tsukuyomi ino dreamed of sasuke and sai fighting for her love eventually inos crush on sasuke had faded and she went on to marry sai and have a son named inojin she still cares for sasuke as a friend and comrade and went as far as to encourage sakura to be more openminded in her relationship with sasuke if they wanted to have a successful relationship but sasuke and sakuras daughter sarada worries that ino may still have an attraction to him which confuses ino inuzuka kiba inuzuka kiba is one of sasukes childhood classmates but the two strongly dislike each other while sasuke often ignored him kiba is very vocal about his dislike towards sasuke and how he hates it that sasuke feels superior to everyone despite this he was unwilling to let sasuke abandon konoha for the purpose of getting stronger and joined in on a mission with naruto shikamaru choji rock lee and neji to unsuccessfully bring him back although thinking it is pointless to convince sasuke to return home kiba worked together with naruto and sakura to help find him even though he knew this was against what naruto wanted kiba was one of the first to agree among konoha 11 to eliminate sasuke for the villages sake out of everyone when sasuke arrived during the war to help them kiba was the most angry and demanded what he wanted from them and berating sasuke for responding he would be hokage when sasuke doesnt know the meaning of the title and is a rogue ninja although kiba reluctantly putted their differences aside to stop the war and later for narutos sake kiba still dislikes sasuke who feels it is mutual aburame shino aburame shino is one of sasukes childhood classmates but the two didnt have direct contact until the chunin exams shino presents himself as someone who doesnt like sasuke and feels he has no sense on what the world around him is about shino was considered to help with the mission of bringing sasuke back after his defect but for reasons unknown shikamaru decided against bringing shino along for this shino remains angry at his comrades for not including him on the mission because he strongly feels sasuke could have been stopped if he had joined them shinos anger at sasuke only increased when sasuke declared his goal to become hokage to which shino responded that the crimes he committed against them and others can not be forgiven or forgotten sasuke replies he understands why they cant forgive him but he didnt care what they thought of him after the war however shino forgives sasuke due to him helping with ending the war and shino later becomes the ninja academy teacher of sasukes daughter sarada umino iruka iruka was sasukes teacher when he was a student at the ninja academy due to the minimum interactions between them sasukes relationship with iruka is unknown but he found irukas teachings boring and too easy to learn rock lee sasuke first met rock lee during the chunin exams when lee challenged sasuke to a match before the first round of the exams finding lee annoying and repulsing sasuke fought lee and lost due to lees superior skills in taijustu which left sasuke shocked that he lost to a loser like lee however he was disgusted to see more of lees personality and emotional punishment from guy although not considered as friends lee always respected sasuke and was more than willing to help him in need during critical situations in turn sasuke appreciated lee for his efforts in battles and later had no problems working with him when their teams were assigned to mutual missions lee was one of the genin assigned to the mission of brining sasuke back after he left the village for orochimaru despite feeling betrayed by sasuke lee was more than willing to help naruto and sakura find him and bring him home however he sadly agreed with his comrades that sasukes status as an international criminal was too much of a liability for konoha like the others after the war lee forgives sasuke for his actions due to his aid in helping to end the war inari sasuke first met inari during his first crank mission to the land of the waves when sasuke and his team were assigned to guard inaris grandfather initially finding inari as childish and immature sasuke has nothing against inari due to him being a small child and having issues sasuke was willing to risk anything to help protect inari when caught in critical situations inari seems to have some admiration for sasuke due to his excellent abilities and even once asked naruto and sakura where he was when inari briefly returned to konoha to help with its restoration sarutobi konohamaru sasuke initially had a low opinion of hiruzens grandson sarutobi konohamaru due to finding the boy too similar to naruto although he barely interacts with him sasuke defended konohamaru from gaara and his siblings insult on the boy and konohamaru develops some admiration for sasuke years later konohamaru becomes the squad teacher of sasukes daughter sarada and he often compliments how strong the girl is due to that sasuke is her father sasuke seems to have no problem with konohamaru being his daughters teacher and in the novel version of boruto he politely asks for konohamarus permission to train boruto and thanks him sarutobi hiruzen after his clans demise sasuke was placed in the care of the third hokage who promised itachi that he would protect the boy no matter what although his ideals differ from hiruzens sasuke has great respect for him and appreciates him for taking care of him after hiruzen was killed by orochimaru sasuke was saddened by his death and attended his funeral however when he decided to go with orochimaru to gain the power needed to defeat itachi naruto reminded sasuke about the third dying at orochimarus hands and sasuke responded with shocking indifference due to him falling deeper into darkness upon learning the konoha elders ordered the uchiha massacre sasuke mistakenly assumed hiruzen was involved and agreed to it not knowing he was the only elder who opposed it and tried to make peaceful resolutions with the clan because of this sasuke felt betrayed by hiruzen and made him despise the village even more when he began to question his vengeance against the village sasuke had the four previous hokage reanimated to question them about his clan and the village he spoke first to hiruzen who was saddened to learn that sasuke did fall onto the path of darkness like he feared and killed itachi and danzo to achieve his vengeance hiruzen confirms to sasuke that itachi was given the mission to kill the entire uchiha clan in order to prevent a war with the village and he promised itachi he would protect sasuke from those who still wanted to eliminate him upon learning the massacre had been done behind hiruzens back and he never held any ill will towards the clan sasukes attitude to hiruzen shifted back to respect yamato when they first met sasuke was not interested in knowing who yamato was and proceeded to attack him and the rest of team 7 leading him to stab yamato in the shoulder with his lightning blade although yamato felt sasuke was becoming a lost cause to save he was compelled by narutos desire to save his friend to continue helping him despite being troubled that naruto would care so much for sasuke who is deemed a traitor and criminal despite everything yamato truly wishes for sasuke to return to the village and rejoin with team 7 in his infinite tsukuyomi dream yamato dreams of sasuke returning home on his own and accepting him as the new leader of team 7 when sasuke redeems and helps konoha from the shadows yamato remained cautious such as when sasuke met with orochimaru to learn more about shinobi that have gone missing from the villages yamato asked sasuke if he was doing this for konohas sake to which sasuke confirmed yamato then let him through to met the sannin and said that since sasuke was his comrade it was important to trust him and sasuke thanked him over several years they feel more comfortable working together on matters involving orochimaru as they were seen working together in spying on orochimaru when he was suspected of being involved in the attack on sarada and the kidnapping of sakura gaara sasuke first met gaara during the chunin exams and has disliked him since then but sasuke was intrigued by gaaras sand powers and wished to fight him during the exams he did so but before the winner could be decided konoha was ambushed by the sand shinobi and sasuke chased after gaara when the latter fled the arena sasuke expressed rage at gaara for nearly killing sakura and challenging him and naruto into a fight however sasuke was unable to defeat gaara who was stopped and redeemed by naruto despite this incident once gaara expressed remorse for his actions sasuke although initially reluctant agrred to work together with gaara on a couple of missions to help their respective villages reconcile ultimately it would be his defeat by gaara that would become one of the reasons behind sasukes decision to defect from konoha nearly three years later sasuke becomes a dangerous international criminal and wanting to kill danzo as part of avenging his clan attacked the kage summit where he fought the raikage gaara stopped the fight and requested to speak to sasuke and noted how far sasuke had fallen into darkness he begged sasuke to let go of his hatred based on gaaras own experience with it and how it bring him nothing beneficial sasuke refused and lashed out at gaara for thinking he can understand sasukes pain shedding a tear for the failure sasuke has become gaara proceeded to fight him before sasuke fled gaara later told naruto the events with sasuke and asked him to consider what was best for his village rather than for sasuke but he never lost faith in naruto redeeming sasuke although gaara respected narutos wishes he was willing to kill sasuke if his actions endangered narutos wellbeing gaara however accepted sasukes offer to help aid them in the war because they needed as much as help due that they were in a disadvantage in the war at the time although sasuke admitted that he held nothing against gaara and knew the kazekage was a good person who wanted to work peacefully with others he was willing to kill gaara in order to bring an end to the cycle of hatred but he changed his mind after fighting naruto without knowing this gaara forgave sasuke for his actions and they two are on friendly terms to the point where they had no problem working together in rescuing naruto from momoshiki and kinshiki other kage sasuke came into contact with the kage during part ii when he attacked the kage summit the raikage was filled with rage and hatred towards sasuke for being involved in the attempt to capture his brother and tried to kill him as they fought the other three kage while having no ill will against sasuke felt obligated to kill him due to his crimes and his undeniable intent to kill them although they were unrelated to his revenge their attempts to stop sasuke prompted him to try to use deadly force to defend himself and only fueled his desire for revenge as a result of his attack on them and obito declaring war on them for refusing to hand over naruto and killer bee the kage join forces to stop the akatsuki although obito admits he manipulated sasuke into attacking them and sasuke would not have behaved this way without his influence the kage maintained that although sasuke no longer worked for akatsuki and he was being used as a pawn by obito the fact that he was siding with obito at the time made him an enemy and they would fight him during the war sasukes purpose of attacking the kage summit was to kill danzo the elder who ordered the massacre of his clan and had been selected to be the sixth hokage candidate after learning from tobi that danzo had also wanted to have him killed for years after the massacre sasuke was overcome with rage and set out to kill the elder in order to avenge itachi and their family when they fought sasuke used deadly force to make danzo confess the truth and the elder insisted he did it for the villages sake and sasukes vengeance is only tarnishing itachis sacrifice which only fueled sasukes desire to murder him sasuke succeeds in fatally injuring him but danzo commits suicide with the intent on killing sasuke and tobi but they escape in his unstable mental state sasuke expressed exhilaration at having killed the man responsible for the loss of his clan and made him conclude killing the rest of the konoha residents would feel greater even after sasuke redeems himself and spends the rest of his life protecting the village even taking up danzos habit of protecting the village in the shadows though sasuke differs from danzo in many ways he prefers searching for and interrogating threats rather than eliminating them right away he cares about others and the new generation and he is adamant on keeping the village completely out of wars and chaos rather than seeking to increase its strength by initiating chaos he seems to feel no regret for killing danzo because he says the elder would have sooner or later forced the village into a war that would have eliminated it and its residents as well as the fact that danzo was a ruthless dictator who didnt care about others but power and control although it was murder no one ever held sasuke accountable for this because ironically he did the village a favor by saving it from having someone like danzo as hokage after meeting the previous hokage their answers made sasuke come to the conclusion that the worlds current problems are the result of the tension between the previous and current kage believing that war and violence can be stopped by erasing the past and bringing forth a clean slate sasuke opted to kill the current kage and take the title of hokage for himself in order to force the nations to focus their hatred on him rather than each other while sasuke maintained his idea was with good intents to make the world more peaceful and he held no ill feelings for the kage he truly felt their constant bickering and resorting to fighting in wars would allow the cycle of hatred to continue and lead to more chaos when they learned sasuke had turned against the akatsuki and was aiding the allied forces the kage were willing to let their issues with him slide because they had a war to deal with it would be sasukes contributions in the war along with naruto and kakashis influence that would absolve sasukes status as an international criminal even though he would spend years trying to earn their trust by doing missions to benefit their villages as they see sasuke make significant efforts to redeem himself and help their villages the kage deem him as a trustworthy ally and forgive him for his past actions even the raikage who bore intense hatred towards sasuke came to respect him after sasuke helped rescue numerous kumo shinobi who were kidnapped sasuke also came to mutually respect him and expressed appreciation for the raikages forgiveness two years after the war when sasuke was suspected of joining a terrorist group plotting to destroy konoha the kage were willing to believe it was an imposter due to the heroic acts sasuke did during the war however because of the seriousness of the situation and sasukes lack of response to the rumors they felt they would have no choice but to declare him an international criminal once more when the rumors turned out to be false the kage chose against hunting down sasuke the current five kage naruto gaara darui chojuro and kurotsuchi all of whom are people who fought sasuke at the kage summit are now on friendly terms with him and hold great trust in him due to his missions in maintaining peace between the villages gaara while deeply troubled by sasukes past crimes and hatred always believed there was a possibility sasuke could be saved and felt sympathy for sasuke due to the fact both were alienated by their respective villages and bore hatred towards those whom they felt wronged them darui used to think of sasuke as the person who deserved to die and was determined to kill sasuke after his fight with the raikage even when sasuke was redeemed daui was still cautious about sasuke and still held dislike towards him but he began to respect sasuke after he rescued several kidnapped kumo shinobi and later became friends with him chojuro also was determined to kill sasuke when he attacked the kage summit but felt a little afraid of him due to sasukes intense hatred at the time however he started accepting him more as an ally after sasuke makes attempts to atone by helping his village and they also later became friends kurotsuchi was eager to meet sasuke upon learning he was the one who killed deidara and seemed to hold no ill towards him for that and of all the current kage she is the one who respects and admires him the most they feel so comfortable with him to the point where they joined forces with him to rescue naruto from momoshiki and kinshiki and posed a victory photo with him they also agree with naruto that sasuke is the other hokage and treat him as one despite his insistence he doesnt deserve it orochimaru despite orochimaru being sasukes sannin teacher and being the reason why he became so strong in less than three years sasuke actually despises orochimaru and finds his use of human experimentations disgusting when they first met during the chunin exams in which orochimaru disguised himself to meet and fight sasuke he was scared of orochimaru but seeing how terrified sakura was sasuke resolved to protect her at all costs and pushed further by naruto for being afraid he began to fight back and received the cursed seal from him after seemingly winning a fight against him sasuke was aware that orochimaru sought him out simply to seize his body as his next vessel but sasuke seemingly was willing to give up his body on the condition that orochimaru gave him the power to defeat itachi and even initially considered the cursed seal orochimaru inflicted upon him as a gift due to the intense power it granted him however after nearly three years of training sasuke had grown strong enough to where he felt orochimaru had nothing more to teach him and decided to kill him revealing he never intended to hand his body over to him and how vile he finds the sannin sasuke often refers to orochimaru as a disgusting snake or that thing as proof of his disgust for orochimaru despite his hatred and disgust for orochimaru sasuke has some respect for his powers and believes that orochimaru can never get so easily killed off sasukes desire to find his own path led him to resurrect orochimaru and ignore suigetsus protests and ask for orochimarus help in reanimating the previous four hokage curious of the change in sasuke orochimaru ignored what sasuke did to him in the past and readily agreed to help him while stating he still desired to take sasukes body realizing and liking the new kind of person sasuke is for wanting to make his own decisions orochimaru approved of sasukes choice to protect the village and go to the battlefield and he would accompany sasuke to help him and see how far sasuke had come as a shinobi when sasuke was close to dying after being stabbed by madara orochimaru appeared alarmed and rushed with karin suigetsu and jugo to help him before seeing sasuke being revived by kabuto after the war sasuke returned to konoha and orochimaru resumed his experiments but was kept under observation by konoha in case he continued experimenting on people the two had no contact in the years following the war except two years later when sasuke sought out orochimarus advice on who may be responsible for the disappearances of numerous shinobi from three of the nations sasuke also expressed surprise that orochimaru was still allowed to roam free despite his past serious crimes to which orochimaru retorted that sasuke was no different but he was less likely to fall into darkness again sasuke makes sure that orochimaru never came near his daughter sarada out of concern the sannin would try something suspicious to her as orochimarus behavior caused sarada to despise him sasuke didnt blame her because he also never stopped despising orochimaru when shin attacked sarada and kidnapped sakura sasuke suspected orochimaru was involved and threatened him with harm if he was but orochimaru denied this and explained shin was his former test subject yakushi kabuto when they first met during the chunin exams kabuto presented himself as an ally to team 7 and sasuke appreciated his help however it was revealed that kabuto was actually working together with orochimaru to locate sasuke and observe him during the chunin exams as sasuke was recuperating in the hospital kabuto tried to kill sasuke before being stopped by kakashi after joining with orochimaru sasuke grew accustomed to being around kabuto a lot but found him to be a nuisance kabuto in turn was annoyed with sasukes lack of respect for him and orochimaru but was afraid of sasukes temper and growing strength sasuke despises kabuto and finds him to be useless due to the latter having made it his life purpose of serving orochimaru after orochimaru was killed by sasuke kabuto was shocked and lost due to that he had spent years serving and following orochimaru with orochimaru dead kabuto makes the outrageous decision to replace his former master by mimicking orochimaru in power standards by collecting the remains of orochimarus body after sasuke killed him taking his admiration for orochimaru to a new level kabuto secretly experiments on himself with orochimarus cell material and chakra and travels to ryuchi cave to gain the power to surpass orochimaru kabuto later joined forces with obito in starting the fourth great ninja war and asked that sasuke be handed over to him as a compensation for the war but obito refused because he also planned to use sasuke sasuke meets with a reanimated itachi and the two find that kabuto was the one responsible for reviving the worlds previous enemies and many dead ninjas the brothers worked together to stop him with sasuke deciding killing kabuto was a simple solution but itachi wanting to keep him alive so he can undo the reanimation jutsu kabuto tried to manipulate sasuke into siding with him by reminding the latter of their mutual goal to destroy konoha and how itachi lied to him but sasuke sided with his brother sasuke was initially annoyed with kabuto for stealing orochimarus power and mocked him as still being insignificant but kabuto retorted that those with no talent can simply steal from others during the fight as kabuto continued to mock him sasuke grew frustrated and became eager to kill kabuto but itachi convinced him to hold back while he was able to trap kabuto in a izanami to release the technique although kabuto said he would never kill sasuke whom he referred to as his precious test subject the manner in which he fought the brothers suggests he was intent on finishing sasuke off at least after he could manipulate sasuke into joining with him and gaining the upperhand in the war after being freed kabuto felt guilty for his crimes and made amends to itachi by going to the battlefield and reviving sasuke who was on the verge of death after the war sasuke cut off all contact with kabuto and was shocked to learn that kabuto was given leniency for his crimes karin karin was another girl who a deep infatuation for sasuke since she first met him during the chunin exams however it wasnt until he joined with orochimaru with whom she was working for that she realized who he was enticed by his chakra karin developed a strong sexual attraction for him to the point of obsession according to suigetsu karin did something to sasuke in the past but karin smacked him to keep him from revealing what occurred she makes several attempts to get him to spend time with her alone while acting like she is not interested in him around others such as when suigetsu is present sasuke showed no interest in karin and found her advances annoying and often had to warn her to stay away from him because she made him feel uncomfortable he sought out karin to join his team hebitaka due to her healing abilities and karin accepted after faking she was not interest because she hoped to take the chance to get closer to him initially sasuke considered her instrumental in his quest to defeat itachi but he later comes to think of her a comrade which is seen when he saves her several times as time passed and his hatred overcame him sasuke showed disregard for her except for her abilities even when she was taken hostage by danzo sasuke didnt hesitate to stab them both to kill the elder and explained karin became a burden for getting taken hostage so easily and he later tried to kill her to avoid anymore trouble with her after being healed by sakura and devastated that sasuke is no longer the person she knew karin decides she is done with him however when she angrily confronts him he simply apologizes to her and she reacts with anger and excitement before deciding she cant stay angry at him after all she expressed more concern for his welfare than her own as he was mortally wounded by madara after the war karin returned with orochimaru to resume her duties while sasuke returned to konoha and married sakura who became pregnant with his child due to them traveling during the pregnancy sakura was brought to one of orochimarus hideouts when she went into labor and karin helped as a midwife due to this she becomes friends with sakura even though she still holds sasuke dear to her she is only glad that he is happy with his family despite their lack of contact sasuke allows karin to keep tabs on his family specifically sarada due to that she is the one who gave sarada her glasses while suigetsu and jugo are oblivious to why sasuke refuses to permentantly settle down in konoha karin says sasuke is aware his sharingan and rinnegan earn him enemies and he doesnt want to endanger the village if he stays suigetsu suigetsu was the first test subject of orochimarus that sasuke sought out to form hebitaka although their personalities differ the two are easily able to work together whenever suigetsu feels he has no choice but to cooperate with sasuke if it benefits his goals suigetsu finds sasukes strict nokill policy irritating while sasuke scolds him when suigetsu causes incidents as a result of going against his orders they dont consider each other as friends but are tolerant of the other and sasuke often has to break out fights between suigetsu and karin which annoys him when sasuke fell deeper into darkness to the point he killed anyone who stood in his way suigetsu was angry at sasuke for doing what he forbade suigetsu to do killing their opponents sasuke even concluded suigetsu was no longer useful during the fight with the four kage and abandoned him and jugo not caring what happens to them suigetsu and jugo were unaware of what sasuke had done and went out searching for him during which suigetsu admits his dislike for sasuke for getting them involved with the akatsuki and the five kage and endangering their lives while battling the kage they later regrouped with him before he went to the battlefield to aid the allied forces despite suigetsu pleading for sasuke to keep them out of the war and focus on using takas goals when sasuke was close to dying suigetsu risked his life to go with orochimaru karin and jugo to help sasuke years later suigetsu would be blamed for the estrangement between sasuke and sarada when he made a mistake in telling sarada that karin was likely her mother which proved to be false jugo because his surrogate brother sacrificed his life to deliver sasuke to orochimaru jugo is very loyal to sasuke and abides by his every command seeing how jugo is afraid of being overcome by his cursed seal and killing people sasuke offers to keep him under control in exchange for jugo joining team hebitaka jugos loyalty to sasuke is so immense that he believes sasuke can never do anything wrong although he admits sasuke is prone to lose his temper and act recklessly as well as not thinking rationally when they fought the five kage without knowing sasukes actions of abandoning his teammates during the kage summit jugo remained loyal to sasuke and nearly went into a rampage when suigetsu spoke negatively about sasuke after regrouping jugo stayed by his side during the battle against obito and came to his aide as he naruto and konoha 11 defeated obito after the war jugo accepted sasukes choice to leave for a journey of atonement and return to konoha and the two had little to no contact since the war uchiha obito uchiha obito while using the aliases tobi always desired to gain sasukes loyalty so he can use the latter as a tool against the ninja world he was always prevented from approaching him by itachi who suspected obito was plotting something with his brother and it wasnt until after itachi died that obito was able to speak to sasuke he tells sasuke the truth about itachi killing the uchiha clan under konohas orders but minimizing his own involvement and succeeds in winning sasukes trust he then convinces sasuke to join with the akatsuki to help gather the eighttailed beast by capturing its jinchuriki killer b although sasuke knew he helped itachi wipe out their clan after it seemed he completed his mission unknown to them at the time killer b escaped sasuke informed obito he was done with the akatsuki and left with no further comment and warned him to not attack konoha because it was a goal sasuke intended to complete himself obito turns sasuke further against konoha by leading him to the kage summit so he can fight the five kage which creates an international crisis however obito always suspected that sasuke would eventually follow itachis wish for him to protect the village despite sasukes initial refusal to do so despite working together during that brief time sasuke never considered obito as an ally and only saw him instrumental in getting part of his revenge on konoha sasuke would later order obito to transplant itachis eyes into him to cure his blindness as a result of overusing the mangekyo sharingan after a while sasuke learns of obitos plan to take over the world with infinite tsukuyomi and starting the fourth shinobi war for this purpose disapproving of this and realizing he was simply a pawn for obitos plan he ultimately turns against obito and joins forces with the allied forces to stop him from ending the world an act that seemingly didnt surprise obito during the battle obito tries many times to finish sasuke and naruto off but the two fought back and were successful in defeating him sasuke wanted to kill obito to end the war but was told not to once obito was willing to atone his mistakes by helping them stop madara as part of attempts at redemption obito helped sakura save sasuke from being trapped in one of kaguyas dimensions and later gave his life to save kakashi as the two shielded sasuke and naruto from kaguya although surprised by obitos sacrifice sasuke was then seemingly unaffected by it due to him telling naruto they needed to focus on kaguya because obito was beyond help uchiha madara when itachi told him that someone named madara helped kill off the uchiha clan sasuke doubted he was talking about their ancestor madara but sasuke said that he would kill madara if he was still alive and learns this person itachi was talking about was actually obito pretending to be madara when madara was resurrected during the war sasuke tried attacking him and stabbed him but madara was unfazed and offered sasuke to join forces with him sasuke refused and announced his intent to kill madara who decided to take sasukes eyes as a replacement until he regained his rinnegan when sasuke tried another attack madara caught him and having already warned him stabbed him in the chest with his own sword and left him on the ground to die after being saved from death and gaining half of the powers of the sage of the six paths sasuke was strong enough to be deemed a threat to madara who became shocked and amazed of how powerful sasuke became in such short period of time madara was still willing to kill sasuke to gain his eyes specifically his new left eye rinnegan but was shocked when sasuke used his new powers to catch madara off guard and attack him with his new teleporation powers madara was amazed by sasukes abilities and felt a connection to him not realizing both are reincarnations of indra otsutsuki that he considered to go beyond blood and even admitted that he would have taken sasuke as his apprentice if he had been born earlier than obito after activating the infinite tsukuyomi and declaring he was the victor madara was ultimately betrayed by the black zetsu and fatally wounded which shocked and confused sasuke despite trying to finish off his kinsman and enemy sasuke stood by watching madara reconcile with the first hokage and sasuke appeared saddened not by madaras death but with the realization that he was officially the last uchiha alive knownable relatives otsutsuki indra ancestordeaduchiha izuna past incarnationdeaduchiha mikoto motherdeaduchiha fugaku fatherdeaduchiha itachi

uchiha  is another way of pronouncing  uchiwa  団扇 which is actually the uchiha clan symbol uchiwa can be used to fan flames making the flame hotter — referring to the fact that the uchiha is a clan of fire techniques users unlike most characters in naruto sasuke doesnt address anyone with honorifics at the end of their names except to his parents clan members and itachi when he was a child and after discovering itachis true nature like kakashisensei or orochimarusama something the japanese would consider very insulting or rude in the june 2006 edition of shōnen jump kakashi remarked that while sasuke is a genius he is dull to teach because he learns everything easily compared to the less predictable naruto although sasukes first appearance is generally thought to be chapter 3 he can actually be seen sitting behind naruto in chapter 1 page 13 on the cover page of chapter 1 sasuke is seen riding a hawk which he later learns to summon in most subsequent cover pages he is only depicted with snakes another species he learns to summon according to hyo no sho while in the ninja academy sasuke had an a in ninjutsu taijutsu and genjutsu a b in classroom attitude a c in

overall grade was second place to yamanaka ino however in chapter 3 iruka states that sasukes grades were first among all 27 graduates in the naruto character popularity polls sasuke was placed in 3rd in the first 4th in the second and third and 3rd in the fourth he finished 1st in the fifth and sixth popularity polls and in the third databook which added results from the previous six polls has sasuke as the third most popular character overall with 33632 votes in the most recent poll sasuke ranked second sasuke is one of four characters to have always stayed in the top ten of every character popularity poll sasukes mangekyo sharingan which consists of three overlapping pointed ellipses giving it six points is the only one shown to have inverse colours while most are red with black designs sasukes is black with red designs sasuke is crossdominance as he typically punches and uses chidori with his left hand whereas he wields his sword with his right hand however when the sage of the six paths asked him to raise his dominant arm he chose his left sasukes nickname  …of the sharingan  写輪眼の is also held by kakashi and itachi studio pierrots settei sheets of sasuke show that he was 140cm around the time of the uchiha clan massacre studio pierrot also consistently puts sasuke at 12yrs old as 150 cm instead of 1508 cm even though in flashback episodes in shippuuden they leave his height of 1532 cm at 13yrs old intact between the time of the resurrected madara dying again and the birth of his daughter sarada sasuke was the only living blood uchiha sasuke is the second character alongside rock lee to have their own spinoff manga which is called sasukes sharingan legend it is also created by masashi kishimotos assistant kenji taira despite sasuke gaining hagoromos power which is stated to grant yinyang release yang release is not listed as one of his natures in the fourth databook in the 2015 da vinci inteview the anime voice actors of team 7 revealed that right after the anime start to airing kishimoto told them that sasuke would eventually end up together with sakura he also says that sasuke is very pure when it comes to a girl although he still gets embarrassed by it despite that he is very straight forward about his feelings it is also said later on that sasuke is the type of person to never engage in close or intimate moments with a girl unless he loved her which is why he never did so until he started reciprocating sakuras feelings sasukes japanese voice actor noriaki sugiyama joked that sasuke is fearful of sakura due to her temper and how she acts like the boss in their relationship and marriage sugiyama also hinted that sasuke realized he loved sakura romantically and they had a bond that went deeper to the point it was unbreakable after his final battle against naruto in chapter 699 yuri lowenthal said he was honored to receive the role since many actors had auditioned for it and he added that the job was stressful although fans were critical of deviations and mistakes in his recordings he enjoyed voicing the character his first impression of sasuke was of a serious guy dedicated to his training but his view changed as he learned about the characters backstory lowenthal said in 2010 that sasuke was one of the first dark characters he voiced adding hes sort of a hero but hes not the naïve young white–hat hero lowenthal said some of sasukes lines such as his use of the word kill were changed because viz media often censored parts of the series dialogue for western viewers as a result he found the original japanese version truer to the character during karins animeonly infinite tsukuyomi dream she imagines sasuke as the sixth hokage after seeing sasukes potential madara noted he would have chosen him over obito to manipulate if sasuke had been born sooner although had that happened sasuke wouldnt have his potential since much of his potential stems from being indras reincarnation and the reincarnation cycle between indra and asura doesnt happen until the current reincarnations have passed away kishimotos official sketches of sasuke show that he is 182cm in the 10th naruto movie initially in the boruto manga sasuke is depicted with wavy hair despite not bearing the title of hokage sasuke is referred to as the shadow hokage by naruto because sasuke protects the village from the outside whereas naruto as the seventh hokage protects it from the inside according to character trivia from boruto his attributes are 200 in chakra 165 in perception and dexterity 142 in negotiations 130 in strength and 100 in intelligence he has five stars in acrobatics and handtohand combat and four stars in ninjutsu there are several differences between his character in the current

itachi and making sasuke hang onto the assumption that the village is forcing his clan to change in the current timeline sasuke did agree to work temporarily for akatsuki and never questioned his decision to destroy konoha until he met with a reanimated itachi while he listened to itachis parting words that he would love sasuke no matter what path he took however in tsunades infinite tsukuyomi
