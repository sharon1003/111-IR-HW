brace for tennis elbow unless you are in the small minority the exception is that you should only pull one on for short durations when you are playing tennis golf or any other sport or activity that involves using your affected arm for repetitive movements for the most obvious reason you should not be using your arm so often if you are suffering from tennis elbow and should really cut back on sport activities and actions that only make your elbow pain worse and wearing a brace when walking around sleeping sitting at home or at work is most definitely out of the question just because a medical website said that you should wear a tennis elbow brace for a weeks to help with your recovery should you really take them for their word are they wrong it is not uncommon to see people playing sports wearing them so this would suggest that wearing one makes total sense the best tennis elbow brace is no brace at all just to be perfectly clear about the advantages and disadvantages of wearing these devices the bottom line is that they are not for the majority of sufferers when you wear a brace your affected arm is totally immobilized and restricted for days or weeks on end talk to anyone who has been using these supports of their tennis elbow injury and they will tell you that there is no change in their condition i make no apologies in saying that wearing one will most definitely not help improve your recovery time you may be wondering why your elbow feels better when you wear your strap support brace or band but does “feeling good” really mean that your injury is actually healing and getting better again normal thinking is that if your arm feels better then the brace must be doing it’s job right you already know that there are various interventions and ways to make your elbow feel better and have less pain for example getting shot up with cortisone taking antiinflammatory pills applying topical antiinflammatory creams icing your arm resting your arm are all ways to help alleviate pain in the short term but what is really happening is that they are providing symptomatic relief and not doing anything whatsoever to address the damage that has been done to your forearm extensor muscles and tendons if they don’t work and are not recommended then why are they so popular of course if you suffered a broken arm you would be put in a cast so the bone could heal if you suffered a sprain to your ankle you would most likely have it wrapped or taped wsj article can braces relieve tennis elbow and golfer’s elbow popular types of braces for tennis elbow what makes tennis elbow unique and so different from other conditions a broken bone or even a sprain has nothing to do with tennis elbow and are not related at all tennis elbow is almost never considered a strain or sprain to your elbow for most people who suffer from tennis elbow the tear to your extensor muscle or tendon is rarely ever severe but what if you have a tiny tear to your muscle or tendon at your elbow you may be thinking that you have a tear because your pain is so sharp and numbing that you automatically think the worst case scenario just because you have been battling tennis elbow for sometime doesn’t necessarily mean or indicate that you have torn your extensor muscles or tendon small tears in your extensor tendon can develop overtime but not to all tennis elbow sufferers extensor tendon tears never develop over a 24 hour period or are caused by blunt force trauma to your elbow tennis elbow takes quite a bit of time to develop and it happens gradually you should know that because you have a tendon injury it can take some time to heal and when it does start to heal it will do so very slowly for the simple fact that tendons don’t get a good supply of blood strangely for the larger percentage of sufferers it is not that your injury is getting worse it’s that your tendon is not healing at all in plain english your extensor tendon is breaking down this process is called tendinosis we’ve already learned that your tendon does not get a good supply of blood and if you are suffering from tendinosis then the last thing you want to do is restrict the blood flow or circulation to your elbow with an elbow brace strap support or tape job done they’ve done what they are supposed to do right restrict and immobilize your affected arm and elbow altogetherwearing a tennis elbow brace restricts the movement of the muscles and tendon in your forearm and around your elbow read how to erase outer elbow pain in just 5 steps as you wear them they put pressure on the tissues and blood vessels around your elbow and it doesn’t even have to be that tight to cause these sort of problems obviously the tighter the strap brace support or tape is the more restriction there will be in order to start healing your muscles and tendons need to be able to move freely without limitations or restrictions to make matters worse you probably are not even aware that wearing the compression generated around your elbow by these supports promotes the build up of sticky scar tissue the more scar tissue that develops in your elbow the less you will be able to move your arm freely because this scar tissue impedes the free movement of your muscles and tissues to sum up there are only 2 reasons why you should really use an elbow brace for tennis elbow 1 when you are playing tennis golf or other activities where you will be using your affected arm for repetitive movements and 2 for severe cases where your tendon is torn one to two hours is the amount of time you
