“hell even i know about the guy code never ever break guy code” oscar wilde on guy code its in the best interest of your health not to break guy code the guy code is a loose set of rules subconsciously understood by men pertaining to a mans interaction with his friends when it relates to his girlfriendsignificant other significant other is used to be inclusive and pc most homosexual men abide by  girl code  instead the guy code is commonly confused with man law which is a completely different set of rules in which a virgin male is assigned plebeian status in a conversation by nonvirgins because guy code is a creation entirely of the male subconscious and is therefore universally known by all men it is generally understood but not spoken also being that the code is a male creation it is very simple there are only three rules but they are to be adhered to most stringently and any violation of the code is considered a grievous infraction usually punishable by a savage beating the rules are as follows no telling the girl is offlimits bros before hoes contents  showedit the breakdownedit no telling most people would assume that this means that a man does not reveal any acts that his friend may or may not have done with his woman no matter how shameful or illegal nothing could be further from the truth if a man finds out that his friend has done something shameful ie giving himself a sex injury the first man is actually encouraged to tell all of his friends so they can make fun of the injured man at a later date however cruel this may sound this is simply normal male bonding if a man finds out that he did something illegal that does not involve anyone getting hurt in any way in which case he would be encouraged to contact the authorities then tell his friends so that they can beat the offending partys ass the same rule applies as before tell friends then ridicule the rule of no telling actually applies to adultery a man never tells his friends girlfriend if he finds out his friend is cheating on her while this may seem callous it is not in a mans interest to serve the feelings of his friends girlfriend if it was hed be in violation of rule 2 but more on that later the reason a man doesnt tell is because he understands that his friend is being an asshat by cheating and the longer he cheats the worse the consequences from his girlfriend will be this all comes back to the original principle of male psychology male bonding is deviated from mockery therefore if you let a friend get caught cheating by his woman even though you know about it you and all your friends can make fun of him at a later date for how much of a douchebag and a fuckup he is for cheating on his girlfriend who is probably hot so why not tell and get the mockery started sooner because the woman will divulge the source of her information if its you your friends will beat your ass for violating guy code and generally acting like a little bitch edit the girl is offlimits i dont care if his girlfriend looks like this she is offlimitsthis rule is fairly straightforward the romantic interest of a friend is classa unbangable for you do you remember the song jessies girl well that song was in complete violation of rule 2 the singer wants to steal his friend jessies girlfriend that is simply not kosher even though men are mean to each other for fun and for bonding purposes stealing a romantic interest is an asswhooping offense for clarification this includes when the two are not romantically involved but your friend desires to be so interfering with another mans relationship goes against every impulse in a mans body this also helps to explain why rule 1 is in effect telling on your friend is the same as hitting on his girl in both cases you are interfering with the balance of the relationship that your friend or more likely his girlfriend has set up also its probably one of the most dick moves that a man can make as a friend its a betrayal of trust and friendship all men repeat all men are horny little bastards but that does not mean that you need to act on those instincts every time they pop into your headit cannot be stressed enough if you consider your friends romantic interest anything but offlimits you will get your ass beaten savagely however this offense is technically forgivable with time as is telling as is outlined in rule 3 to be discussed shortlyedit bros before hoes dr house knows the code this is without a doubt the most important rule of the guy code since it explains rules 1  2 this rule is also probably the easiest to understand your friends always always come before women it doesnt matter if you or your friends violate the rules of the guy code so long as they take this rule to heart this rule means that all violations of the guy code will be forgiven due to the innate and inescapable fact that you and your friends are all men being men you are liable to fuck up and do something stupid with a woman it happens its what men do however men understand how men work and a man must forgive men their flaws for they are his own flaws as well however it must be impressed that this rule does not mean that you put your friends before your own girlfriend if you have a girlfriend she owns your ass do you understand she owns your ass if you ever want sex out of her you have to accept that fortunately those rules are outlined in  girl code  which is not part of the male mantra this part was written by a woman forunately if you have a decent brain capable of adding 14 which is obviously 9 you can fool your girlfriend into believing you will actually put her at a higher position than a random guy you just became bros with be vigilant though keep your friends from violating the rules with your girl and keep in mind if they do screw up you can always beat their ass then buy them a beer its just the way guys workedit see also cheese itswomen men beer girlfriend sex girl code
