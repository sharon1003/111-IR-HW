listing of nti type and brux splint tm devices winged deprogrammers nti 20 introduction see nti 20 chairside delivery protocolrapidly becoming the treatment of choice in most cases when compared to using a single nti device below the opposing devices minimize the resistance that an opposing incisor can often provide to a single device while keeping vertical dimension to a minimum also saves the usual time required to adjust the de to the opposing incisors lower incisal guidance device the lower device has the most commonly used device the discluding element de of the lower device is tapered to the lateral borders of the device primarily intended for the mandible although not exclusively the design most efficiently prevents canine occluding contact see chairside delivery protocol upper reduced vertical device the upper device is most commonly used when incisal overlap is more than ideal making the lower device contraindicated the lower device would cause for an excessive condylar rotation ie excessive vdo during occluding on the device the de can be ramped up towards the palate to ensure minimal vdo during occluding thereby minimizing condylar rotation the upper rv device is the presculpted version of the original standard device where the discluding element has been reduced auxiliary slider commonly used with a deep bite incisal overlap where the de is considerably ramped or stepped to maintain minimal opening it can also be used over the incisors that oppose an nti device typically the lower device to prevent the lower device from fracture andor to facilitate gliding movements when the incisors opposing the nti device are irregular see chairside protocol for delivery of opposing auxiliary sliderslowerwide has a thicker and therefore stronger de the lowerwide was originally designed for the patients whose extremely intense clenching could fracture the original lower device the thickness of the lower devices de has since been increased now making the lowerwide device less frequently necessary the width of the lowerwide allows for increased retention for those cases where added retention is desired standard devices the standard devices original and wide were the original design of the nti tss  but many practitioners feel it is no longer the treatment method of choice due the increased likelihood of undesired outcome from lack of proper modification in most every case the discluding element requires careful modification typically reduction however the considerable size of the discluding element provides more versatility the upper device was developed as the replacement for the standard device as its de is premodified the lower device was developed as the more commonly indicated treatment of choice over the upper device to avoid canine contact on the device in excursive positions brux splint tm  click here for fabrication and delivery protocoloften times a patient presents without symptoms but has an obvious need for dental protection from nocturnal bruxism while an nti device can fulfill that need the dentist and patient would be obligated to following nti therapeutic protocol which for the asymptomatic grinding patient may be unnecessary the brux splint is ideal for the immediate delivery of a hard flat dental guard which can be used on a provisional basis or finessed for long term use additionally the brux splint can be configured to provide the therapeutic protocol of a bsplint  which is a fullcoverage maxillary splint that has an ntistyle discluding element that opposes a mandibular full coverage splint the maxillary brux splint tra y above right has an anterior midline channel within which the practitioner allows thermo plastic to flow into to form a discluding element the de creates a bsplint bruxing splint thereby providing for both clenching suppression grinding protection and tooth position retention brux splintflat plane dental protection not every case of nocturnal parafunction requires the incorporation of a discluding element for clenching suppression in the absence of symptoms where only the objective protection of the dentition is required a simple brux splint flat plane splint can be provided by using the lower tray only quick and easy technique to provision of opposing brux splints opposing flat planes your browser does not currently recognize any
