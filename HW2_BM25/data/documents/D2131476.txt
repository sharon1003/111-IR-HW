as the ieee 8023ae supplement to the ieee 8023 base standard in late 2001 or early 2002 other technologies and protocols have been touted as likely replacements but the market has spoken ethernet has survived as the major lan technology it is currently used for approximately 85 percent of the worlds lanconnected pcs and workstations because its protocol has the following characteristics is easy to

networks8 summary9 review questions etherneta brief history the original ethernet was developed as an experimental coaxial cable network in the 1970s by xerox corporation to operate with a data rate of 3 mbps using a carrier sense multiple access collision detect csmacd protocol for lans with sporadic but occasionally heavy traffic requirements success with that project attracted early attention and led to the 1980 joint development of the 10mbps ethernet version 10 specification by the threecompany consortium digital equipment corporation intel corporation and xerox corporation the original ieee 8023 standard was based on and was very similar to the ethernet version 10 specification the draft standard was approved by the 8023 working group in 1983 and was subsequently published as an official standard in 1985 ansiieee std 80231985 since then a number of supplements to the standard have been defined to take advantage of improvements in the technologies and to support additional network media and higher data rate capabilities plus several new optional network access control features throughout the rest of this article the terms ethernet and 8023 will refer exclusively to network implementations compatible with the ieee 8023 standard ethernet network elements ethernet lans consist of network nodes and interconnecting media the network nodes fall into two major classes data terminal equipment dte  devices that are either the source or the destination of data frames dtes are typically devices such as pcs workstations file servers or print servers that as a group are all often referred to as end stations data communication equipment dce  intermediate network devices that receive and forward frames across the network dces may be either standalone devices such as repeaters network switches and routers or communications interface units such as interface cards and modems throughout this article standalone intermediate network devices will be referred to as either intermediate nodes or dces network interface cards will be referred to as nics the current ethernet media options include two general types of copper cable unshielded twistedpair utp and shielded twistedpair stp plus several types of optical fiber cable ethernet network topologies and structures lans take on many topological configurations but regardless of their size or complexity all will be a combination of only three basic interconnection structures or network building blocks the simplest structure is the pointtopoint interconnection shown in figure example pointtopoint interconnection only two network units are involved and the connection may be dtetodte dtetodce or dcetodce the cable in pointtopoint interconnections is known as a network link the maximum allowable length of the link depends on the type of cable and the transmission method that is used figure example pointtopoint interconnection the original ethernet networks were implemented with a coaxial bus structure as shown in figure example coaxial bus topology segment lengths were limited to 500 meters and up to 100 stations could be connected to a single segment individual segments could be interconnected with repeaters as long as multiple paths did not exist between any two stations on the network and the number of dtes did not exceed 1024 the total path distance between the mostdistant pair of stations was also not allowed to exceed a maximum prescribed value figure example coaxial bus topology although new networks are no longer connected in a bus configuration some older busconnected networks do still exist and are still useful since the early 1990s the network configuration of choice has been the starconnected topology shown in figure example starconnected topology the central network unit is either a multiport repeater also known as a hub or a network switch all connections in a star network are pointtopoint links implemented with either twistedpair or optical fiber cable figure example starconnected topology the ieee 8023 logical relationship to the osi reference model figure ethernet’s logical relationship to the osi reference model shows the ieee 8023 logical layers and their relationship to the osi reference model as with all ieee 802 protocols the osi data link layer is divided into two ieee 802 sublayers the media access control mac sublayer and the macclient sublayer the ieee 8023 physical layer corresponds to the osi physical layer figure ethernet’s logical relationship to the osi reference model the macclient sublayer may be one of the following logical link control llc if the unit is a dte this sublayer provides the interface between the ethernet mac and the upper layers in the protocol stack of the end station the llc sublayer is defined by ieee 8022 standards bridge entity if the unit is a dce bridge entities provide lantolan interfaces between lans that use the same protocol for example ethernet to ethernet and also between different protocols for example ethernet to token ring bridge entities are defined by ieee 8021 standards because specifications for llc and bridge entities are common for all ieee 802 lan protocols network compatibility becomes the primary responsibility of the particular network protocol figure mac and physical layer compatibility requirements for basic data communication shows different compatibility requirements imposed by the mac and physical levels for basic data communication over an ethernet link figure mac and physical layer compatibility requirements for basic data communication the mac layer controls the nodes access to the network media and is specific to the individual protocol all ieee 8023 macs must meet the same basic set of logical requirements regardless of whether they include one or more of the defined optional protocol extensions the only requirement for basic communication communication that does not require optional protocol extensions between two network nodes is that both macs must support the same transmission rate the 8023 physical layer is specific to the transmission data rate the signal encoding and the type of media interconnecting the two nodes gigabit ethernet for example is defined to operate over either twistedpair or optical fiber cable but each specific type of cable or signalencoding procedure requires a different physical layer implementation the ethernet mac sublayer the mac sublayer has two primary responsibilities data encapsulation including frame assembly before transmission and frame parsingerror detection during and after reception media access control including initiation of frame transmission and recovery from transmission failure the basic ethernet frame format the ieee 8023 standard defines a basic data frame format that is required for all mac implementations plus several additional optional formats that are used to extend the protocols basic capability the basic data frame format contains the seven fields shown in figure the basic ieee 8023 mac data frame format preamble pre  consists of 7 bytes the pre is an alternating pattern of ones and zeros that tells receiving stations that a frame is coming and that provides a means to synchronize the framereception portions of receiving physical layers with the incoming bit stream startofframe delimiter sof  consists of 1 byte the sof is an alternating pattern of ones and zeros ending with two consecutive 1bits indicating that the next bit is the leftmost bit in the leftmost byte of the destination address destination address da  consists of 6 bytes the da field identifies which station s should receive the frame the leftmost bit in the da field indicates whether the address is an individual address indicated by a 0 or a group address indicated by a 1 the second bit from the left indicates whether the da is globally administered indicated by a 0 or locally administered indicated by a 1 the remaining 46 bits are a uniquely assigned value that identifies a single station a defined group of stations or all stations on the network source addresses sa  consists of 6 bytes the sa field identifies the sending station the sa is always an individual address and the leftmost bit in the sa field is always 0 lengthtype  consists of 2 bytes this field indicates either the number of macclient data bytes that are contained in the data field of the frame or the frame type id if the frame is assembled using an optional format if the lengthtype field value is less than or equal to 1500 the number of llc bytes in the data field is equal to the lengthtype field value if the lengthtype field value is greater than 1536 the frame is an optional type frame and the lengthtype field value identifies the particular type of frame being sent or received data  is a sequence of n bytes of any value where n is less than or equal to 1500 if the length of the data field is less than 46 the data field must be extended by adding a filler a pad sufficient to bring the data field length to 46 bytes frame check sequence fcs  consists of 4 bytes this sequence contains a 32bit cyclic redundancy check crc value which is created by the sending mac and is recalculated by the receiving mac to check for damaged frames the fcs is generated over the da sa lengthtype and data fields figure the basic ieee 8023 mac data frame format  note individual addresses are also known as unicast addresses because they refer to a single mac and are assigned by the nic manufacturer from a block of addresses allocated by the ieee group addresses aka multicast addresses identify the end stations in a workgroup and are assigned by the network manager a special group address all 1sthe broadcast address indicates all stations on the network frame transmission whenever an end station mac receives a transmitframe request with the accompanying address and data information from the llc sublayer the mac begins the transmission sequence by transferring the llc information into the mac frame buffer the preamble and startofframe delimiter are inserted in the pre and sof fields the destination and source addresses are inserted into the address fields the llc data bytes are counted and the number of bytes is inserted into the lengthtype field the llc data bytes are inserted into the data field if the number of llc data bytes is less than 46 a pad is added to bring the data field length up to 46 an fcs value is generated over the da sa lengthtype and data fields and is appended to the end of the data field after the frame is assembled actual frame transmission will depend on whether the mac is operating in halfduplex or fullduplex mode the ieee 8023 standard currently requires that all ethernet macs support halfduplex operation in which the mac can be either transmitting or receiving a frame but it cannot be doing both simultaneously fullduplex operation is an optional mac capability that allows the mac to transmit and receive frames simultaneously halfduplex transmissionthe csmacd access method the csmacd protocol was originally developed as a means by which two or more stations could share a common media in a switchless environment when the protocol does not require central arbitration access tokens or assigned time slots to indicate when a station will be allowed to transmit each ethernet mac determines for itself when it will be allowed to send a frame the csmacd access rules are summarized by the protocols acronym carrier sense  each station continuously listens for traffic on the medium to determine when gaps between frame transmissions occur multiple access  stations may begin transmitting any time they detect that the network is quiet there is no traffic collision detect  if two or more stations in the same csmacd network collision domain begin transmitting at approximately the same time the bit streams from the transmitting stations will interfere collide with each other and both transmissions will be unreadable if that happens each transmitting station must be capable of detecting that a collision has occurred before it has finished sending its frame each must stop transmitting as soon as it has detected the collision and then must wait a quasirandom length of time determined by a backoff algorithm before attempting to retransmit the frame the worstcase situation occurs when the two mostdistant stations on the network both need to send a frame and when the second station does not begin transmitting until just before the frame from the first station arrives the collision will be detected almost immediately by the second station but it will not be detected by the first station until the corrupted signal has propagated all the way back to that station the maximum time that is required to detect a collision the collision window or slot time is approximately equal to twice the signal propagation time between the two mostdistant stations on the network this means that both the minimum frame length and the maximum collision diameter are directly related to the slot time longer minimum frame lengths translate to longer slot times and larger collision diameters shorter minimum frame lengths correspond to shorter slot times and smaller collision diameters the tradeoff was between the need to reduce the impact of collision recovery and the need for network diameters to be large enough to accommodate reasonable network sizes the compromise was to choose a maximum network diameter about 2500 meters and then to set the minimum frame length long enough to ensure detection of all worstcase collisions the compromise worked well for 10 mbps but it was a problem for higher datarate ethernet developers fast ethernet was required to provide backward compatibility with earlier ethernet networks including the existing ieee 8023 frame format and errordetection procedures plus all applications and networking software running on the 10mbps networks although signal propagation velocity is essentially constant for all transmission rates the time required to transmit a frame is inversely related to the transmission rate at 100 mbps a minimumlength frame can be transmitted in approximately onetenth of the defined slot time and any collision that occurred during the transmission would not likely be detected by the transmitting stations this in turn meant that the maximum network diameters specified for 10mbps networks could not be used for 100mbps networks the solution for fast ethernet was to reduce the maximum network diameter by approximately a factor of 10 to a little more than 200 meters the same problem also arose during specification development for gigabit ethernet but decreasing network diameters by another factor of 10 to approximately 20 meters for 1000mbps operation was simply not practical this time the developers elected to maintain approximately the same maximum collision domain diameters as 100mbps networks and to increase the apparent minimum frame size by adding a variablelength nondata extension field to frames that are shorter than the minimum length the extension field is removed during frame reception figure mac frame with gigabit carrier extension shows the mac frame format with the gigabit extension field and the following table shows the effect of the tradeoff between the transmission data rate and the minimum frame size for 10mbps 100mbps and 1000mbps ethernet figure mac frame with gigabit carrier extension table limits for halfduplex operation parameter 10 mbps 100 mbps 1000 mbps minimum frame size64 bytes64 bytes520 bytes with extension field addedmaximum collision diameter dte to dte100 meters utp100 meters utp412 meters fiber100 meters utp316 meters fiber maximum collision diameter with repeaters2500 meters205 meters200 meters maximum number of repeaters in network path521note 520 bytes applies to 1000baset implementations the minimum frame size with extension field for 1000basex is reduced to 416 bytes because 1000basex encodes and transmits 10 bits for each byte another change to the ethernet csmacd transmit specification was the addition of frame bursting for gigabit operation burst mode is a feature that allows a mac to send a short sequence a burst of frames equal to approximately 54 maximumlength frames without having to relinquish control of the medium the transmitting mac fills each interframe interval with extension bits as shown in figure a gigabit frameburst sequence so that other stations on the network will see that the network is busy and will not attempt transmission until after the burst is complete figure a gigabit frameburst sequence if the length of the first frame is less than the minimum frame length an extension field is added to extend the frame length to the value indicated in table limits for halfduplex operation subsequent frames in a frameburst sequence do not need extension fields and a frame burst may continue as long as the burst limit has not been reached if the burst limit is reached after a frame transmission has begun transmission is allowed to continue until that entire frame has been sent frame extension fields are not defined and burst mode is not allowed for 10 mbps and 100 mbps transmission rates fullduplex transmissionan optional approach to higher network efficiency fullduplex operation is an optional mac capability that allows simultaneous twoway transmission over pointtopoint links full duplex transmission is functionally much simpler than halfduplex transmission because it involves no media contention no collisions no need to schedule retransmissions and no need for extension bits on the end of short frames the result is not only more time available for transmission but also an effective doubling of the link bandwidth because each link can now support fullrate simultaneous twoway transmission transmission can usually begin as soon as frames are ready to send the only restriction is that there must be a minimumlength interframe gap between successive frames as shown in figure full duplex operation allows simultaneous twoway transmission on the same link and each frame must conform to ethernet frame format standards figure full duplex operation allows simultaneous twoway transmission on the same link flow control fullduplex operation requires concurrent implementation of the optional flowcontrol capability that allows a receiving node such as a network switch port that is becoming congested to request the sending node such as a file server to stop sending frames for a selected short period of time control is mactomac through the use of a pause frame that is automatically generated by the receiving mac if the congestion is relieved before the requested wait has expired a second pause frame with a zero timetowait value can be sent to request resumption of transmission an overview of the flow control operation is shown in figure an overview of the ieee 8023 flow control sequence figure an overview of the ieee 8023 flow control sequence the fullduplex operation and its companion flow control capability are both options for all ethernet macs and all transmission rates both options are enabled on a linkbylink basis assuming that the associated physical layers are also capable of supporting fullduplex operation pause frames are identified as mac control frames by an exclusive assigned reserved lengthtype value they are also assigned a reserved destination address value to ensure that an incoming pause frame is never forwarded to upper protocol layers or to other ports in a switch frame reception frame reception is essentially the same for both halfduplex and fullduplex operations except that fullduplex macs must have separate frame buffers and data paths to allow for simultaneous frame transmission and reception frame reception is the reverse of frame transmission the destination address of the received frame is checked and matched against the stations address list its mac address its group addresses and the broadcast address to determine whether the frame is destined for that station if an address match is found the frame length is checked and the received fcs is compared to the fcs that was generated during frame reception if the frame length is okay and there is an fcs match the frame type is determined by the contents of the lengthtype field the frame is then parsed and forwarded to the appropriate upper layer the vlan tagging option vlan tagging is a mac option that provides three important capabilities not previously available to ethernet network users and network managers provides a means to expedite timecritical network traffic by setting transmission priorities for outgoing frames allows stations to be assigned to logical groups to communicate across multiple lans as though they were on a single lan bridges and switches filter destination addresses and forward vlan frames only to ports that serve the vlan to which the traffic belongs simplifies network management and makes adds moves and changes easier to administer a vlantagged frame is simply a basic mac data frame that has had a 4byte vlan header inserted between the sa and lengthtype fields as shown in figure vlantagged frames are identified when the mac finds the lan type value in the normal lengthtype field location figure vlantagged frames are identified when the mac finds the lan type value in the normal lengthtype field location the vlan header consists of two fields a reserved 2byte type value indicating that the frame is a vlan frame a twobyte tagcontrol field that contains both the transmission priority 0 to 7 where 7 is the highest and a vlan id that identifies the particular vlan over which the frame is to be sent the receiving mac reads the reserved type value which is located in the normal lengthtype field position and interprets the received frame as a vlan frame then the following occurs if the mac is installed in a switch port the frame is forwarded according to its priority level to all ports that are associated with the indicated vlan identifier if the mac is installed in an end station it removes the 4byte vlan header and processes the frame in the same manner as a basic data frame vlan tagging requires that all network nodes involved with a vlan group be equipped with the vlan option the ethernet physical layers because ethernet devices implement only the bottom two layers of the osi protocol stack they are typically implemented as network interface cards nics that plug into the host devices motherboard the different nics are identified by a threepart product name that is based on the physical layer attributes the naming convention is a concatenation of three terms indicating the transmission rate the transmission method and the media typesignal encoding for example consider this10baset  10 mbps baseband over two twistedpair cables100baset2  100 mbps baseband over two twistedpair cables100baset4  100 mbps baseband over fourtwisted pair cables1000baselx  1000 mbps baseband long wavelength over optical fiber cable a question sometimes arises as to why the middle term always seems to be base early versions of the protocol also allowed for broadband transmission for example 10broad but broadband implementations were not successful in the marketplace all current ethernet implementations use baseband transmission encoding for signal transmission in baseband transmission the frame information is directly impressed upon the link as a sequence of pulses or data symbols that are typically attenuated reduced in size and distorted changed in shape before they reach the other end of the link the receivers task is to detect each pulse as it arrives and then to extract its correct value before transferring the reconstructed information to the receiving mac filters and pulseshaping circuits can help restore the size and shape of the received waveforms but additional measures must be taken to ensure that the received signals are sampled at the correct time in the pulse period and at same rate as the transmit clock the receive clock must be recovered from the incoming data stream to allow the receiving physical layer to synchronize with the incoming pulses compensating measures must be taken for a transmission effect known as baseline wander clock recovery requires level transitions in the incoming signal to identify and synchronize on pulse boundaries the alternating 1s and 0s of the frame preamble were designed both to indicate that a frame was arriving and to aid in clock recovery however recovered clocks can drift and possibly lose synchronization if pulse levels remain constant and there are no transitions to detect for example during long strings of 0s baseline wander results because ethernet links are accoupled to the transceivers and because ac coupling is incapable of maintaining voltage levels for more than a short time as a result transmitted pulses are distorted by a droop effect similar to the exaggerated example shown in figure a concept example of baseline wander in long strings of either 1s or 0s the droop can become so severe that the voltage level passes through the decision threshold resulting in erroneous sampled values for the affected pulses figure a concept example of baseline wander fortunately encoding the outgoing signal before transmission can significantly reduce the effect of both these problems as well as reduce the possibility of transmission errors early ethernet implementations up to and including 10baset all used the manchester encoding method shown in figure transitionbased manchester binary encoding each pulse is clearly identified by the direction of the midpulse transition rather than by its sampled level value figure transitionbased manchester binary encoding unfortunately manchester encoding introduces some difficult frequencyrelated problems that make it unsuitable for use at higher data rates ethernet versions subsequent to 10baset all use different encoding procedures that include some or all of the following techniques using data scrambling  a procedure that scrambles the bits in each byte in an orderly and recoverable manner some 0s are changed to 1s some 1s are changed to 0s and some bits are left the same the result is reduced runlength of samevalue bits increased transition density and easier clock recovery expanding the code space  a technique that allows assignment of separate codes for data and control symbols such as startofstream and endofstream delimiters extension bits and so on and that assists in transmission error detection using forward errorcorrecting codes  an encoding in which redundant information is added to the transmitted data stream so that some types of transmission errors can be corrected during frame reception note forward errorcorrecting codes are used in 1000baset to achieve an effective reduction in the bit error rate ethernet protocol limits error handling to detection of bit errors in the received frame recovery of frames received with uncorrectable errors or missing frames is the responsibility of higher layers in the protocol stack the 8023 physical layer relationship to the iso reference model although the specific logical model of the physical layer may vary from version to version all ethernet nics generally conform to the generic model shown in figure the generic ethernet physical layer reference model  figure the generic ethernet physical layer reference model the physical layer for each transmission rate is divided into sublayers that are independent of the particular media type and sublayers that are specific to the media type or signal encoding the reconciliation sublayer and the optional mediaindependent interface mii in 10mbps and 100mbps ethernet gmii in gigabit ethernet provide the logical connection between the mac and the different sets of mediadependent layers the mii and gmii are defined with separate transmit and receive data paths that are bitserial for 10mbps implementations nibbleserial 4 bits wide for 100mbps implementations and byteserial 8 bits wide for 1000mbps implementations the mediaindependent interfaces and the reconciliation sublayer are common for their respective transmission rates and are configured for fullduplex operation in 10baset and all subsequent ethernet versions the mediadependent physical coding sublayer pcs provides the logic for encoding multiplexing and synchronization of the outgoing symbol streams as well symbol code alignment demultiplexing and decoding of the incoming data the physical medium attachment pma sublayer contains the signal transmitters and receivers transceivers as well as the clock recovery logic for the received data streams the mediumdependent interface mdi is the cable connector between the signal transceivers and the link the autonegotiation sublayer allows the nics at each end of the link to exchange information about their individual capabilities and then to negotiate and select the most favorable operational mode that they both are capable of supporting autonegotiation is optional in early ethernet implementations and is mandatory in later versions depending on which type of signal encoding is used and how the links are configured the pcs and pma may or may not be capable of supporting fullduplex operation10mbps ethernet10baset10baset provides manchesterencoded 10mbps bitserial communication over two unshielded twistedpair cables although the standard was designed to support transmission over common telephone cable the more typical link configuration is to use two pair of a fourpair category 3 or 5 cable terminated at each nic with an 8pin rj45 connector the mdi as shown in figure the typical 10baset link is a fourpair utp cable in which two pairs are not used pair is configured as a simplex link where transmission is in one direction only the 10baset physical layers can support either halfduplex or fullduplex operation figure the typical 10baset link is a fourpair utp cable in which two pairs are not used although 10baset may be considered essentially obsolete in some circles it is included here because there are still many 10baset ethernet networks and because fullduplex operation has given 10base t an extended life10baset was also the first ethernet version to include a link integrity test to determine the health of the link immediately after powerup the pma transmits a normal link pulse nlp to tell the nic at the other end of the link that this nic wants to establish an active link connection if the nic at the other end of the link is also powered up it responds with its own nlp if the nic at the other end of the link is not powered up this nic continues sending an nlp about once every 16 ms until it receives a response the link is activated only after both nics are capable of exchanging valid nlps100 mbpsfast ethernet increasing the ethernet transmission rate by a factor of ten over 10baset was not a simple task and the effort resulted in the development of three separate physical layer standards for 100 mbps over utp cable 100basetx and 100baset4 in 1995 and 100baset2 in 1997 each was defined with different encoding requirements and a different set of mediadependent sublayers even though there is some overlap in the link cabling table summary of 100baset physical layer characteristics compares the physical layer

of 1 or more binary bits although not all three 100mbps versions were successful in the marketplace all three have been discussed in the literature and all three did impact future designs as such all three are important to consider here100basex100basex was designed to support transmission over either two pairs of category 5 utp copper wire or two strands of optical fiber although the encoding decoding and clock recovery procedures are the same for both media the signal transmission is differentelectrical pulses in copper and light pulses in optical fiber the signal transceivers that were included as part of the pma function in the generic logical model of the following figure were redefined as the separate physical mediadependent pmd sublayers shown in figure the 100basex logical model figure the 100basex logical model the 100basex encoding procedure is based on the earlier fddi optical fiber physical mediadependent and fddicddi copper twistedpair physical mediadependent signaling standards developed by iso and ansi the 100basetx physical mediadependent sublayer tppmd was implemented with cddi semiconductor transceivers and rj45 connectors the fiber pmd was implemented with fddi optical transceivers and the low cost fibre interface connector commonly called the duplex sc connector the 4b5b encoding procedure is the same as the encoding procedure used by fddi with only minor adaptations to accommodate ethernet frame control each 4bit data nibble representing half of a data byte is mapped into a 5bit binary codegroup that is transmitted bitserial over the link the expanded code space provided by the 32 5bit codegroups allow separate assignment for the following the 16 possible values in a 4bit data nibble 16 codegroups four control codegroups that are transmitted as codegroup pairs to indicate the startofstream delimiter ssd and the endofstream delimiter esd each mac frame is encapsulated to mark both the beginning and end of the frame the first byte of preamble is replaced with ssd codegroup pair that precisely identifies the frames codegroup boundaries the esd codegroup pair is appended after the frames fcs field a special idle codegroup that is continuously sent during interframe gaps to maintain continuous synchronization between the nics at each end of the link the receipt of idle is interpreted to mean that the link is quiet eleven invalid codegroups that are not intentionally transmitted by a nic although one is used by a repeater to propagate receive errors receipt of any invalid codegroup will cause the incoming frame to be treated as an invalid frame figure the 100basex codegroup stream with frame encapsulation shows how a mac frame is encapsulated before being transmitted as a 100basex codegroup stream

both support halfduplex and fullduplex transmission100baset4100baset4 was developed to allow 10base t networks to be upgraded to 100mbps operation without requiring existing fourpair category 3 utp cables to be replaced with the newer category 5 cables two of the four pairs are configured for halfduplex operation and can support transmission in either direction but only in one direction at a time the other two pairs are configured as simplex pairs dedicated to transmission in one direction only frame transmission uses both halfduplex pairs plus the simplex pair that is appropriate for the transmission direction as shown in figure the 100baset4 wirepair usage during frame transmission the simplex pair for the opposite direction provides carrier sense and collision detection fullduplex operation cannot be supported on 100baset4 figure the 100baset4 wirepair usage during frame transmission100baset4 uses an 8b6t encoding scheme in which each 8bit binary byte is mapped into a pattern of six ternary threelevel 1 0 1 symbols known as 6t codegroups separate 6t codegroups are used for idle and for the control codegroups that are necessary for frame transmission idle received on the dedicated receive pair indicates that the link is quiet during frame transmission 6t data codegroups are transmitted in a delayed roundrobin sequence over the three transmit wirepairs as shown in figure the 100baset4 frame transmission sequence each frame is encapsulated with startofstream and endofpacket 6t codegroups that mark both the beginning and end of the frame and the beginning and end of the 6t codegroup stream on each wire pair receipt of a nonidle codegroup over the dedicated receivepair any time before the collision window expires indicates that a collision has occurred figure the 100baset4 frame transmission sequence100baset2the 100baset2 specification was developed as a better alternative for upgrading networks with installed category 3 cabling than was being provided by 100baset4 two important new goals were defined to provide communication over two pairs of category 3 or better cable to support both halfduplex and fullduplex operation100baset2 uses a different signal transmission procedure than any previous twistedpair ethernet implementations instead of using two simplex links to form one fullduplex link the 100baset2 dualduplex baseband transmission method sends encoded symbols simultaneously in both directions on both wire pairs as shown in figure the 100baset2 link topology the term tdx32 indicates the 2 most significant bits in the nibble before encoding and transmission rdx32 indicates the same 2 bits after receipt and decoding figure the 100baset2 link topology dualduplex baseband transmission requires the nics at each end of the link to be operated in a masterslave looptiming mode which nic will be master and which will be slave is determined by autonegotiation during link initiation when the link is operational synchronization is based on the master nics internal transmit clock the slave nic uses the recovered clock for both transmit and receive operations as shown in figure the 100baset2 loop timing configuration each transmitted frame is encapsulated and link synchronization is maintained with a continuous stream of idle symbols during interframe gaps figure the 100baset2 loop timing configuration the 100baset2 encoding process first scrambles the data frame nibbles to randomize the bit sequence it then maps the two upper bits and the two lower bits of each nibble into two fivelevel 2 1 0 1 2 pulse amplitudemodulated pam5 symbols that are simultaneously transmitted over the two wire pairs pam5x5 different scrambling procedures for master and slave transmissions ensure that the data streams traveling in opposite directions on the same wire pair are uncoordinated signal reception is essentially the reverse of signal transmission because the signal on each wire pair at the mdi is the sum of the transmitted signal and the received signal each receiver subtracts the transmitted symbols from the signal received at the mdi to recover the symbols in the incoming data stream the incoming symbol pair is then decoded unscrambled and reconstituted as a data nibble for transfer to the mac1000 mbpsgigabit ethernet the gigabit ethernet standards development resulted in two primary specifications 1000baset for utp copper cable and 1000basex stp copper cable as well as single and multimode optical fiber see figure gigabit ethernet variations  figure 722 gigabit ethernet variations1000baset1000baset ethernet provides fullduplex transmission over fourpair category 5 or better utp cable 1000baset is based largely on the findings and design approaches that led to the development of the fast ethernet physical layer implementations100basetx proved that binary symbol streams could be successfully transmitted over category 5 utp cable at 125 mbd100baset4 provided a basic understanding of the problems related to sending multilevel signals over four wire pairs100baset2 proved that pam5 encoding coupled with digital signal processing could handle both simultaneous twoway data streams and potential crosstalk problems resulting from alien signals on adjacent wire pairs1000baset scrambles each byte in the mac frame to randomize the bit sequence before it is encoded using a 4d 8state trellis forward error correction fec coding in which four pam5 symbols are sent at the same time over four wire pairs four of the five levels in each pam5 symbol represent 2 bits in the data byte the fifth level is used for fec coding which enhances symbol recovery in the presence of noise and crosstalk separate scramblers for the master and slave phys create essentially uncorrelated data streams between the two oppositetravelling symbol streams on each wire pair the1000baset link topology is shown in figure the 1000baset link topology the term tdx76 indicates the 2 most significant bits in the data byte before encoding and transmission rdx76 indicates the same 2 bits after receipt and decoding figure the 1000baset link topology the clock recovery and masterslave loop timing procedures are essentially the same as those used in 100baset2 see figure 1000baset masterslave loop timing configuration  which nic will be master typically the nic in a multiport intermediate network node and which will be slave is determined during autonegotiation figure 1000baset masterslave loop timing configuration each transmitted frame is encapsulated with startofstream and endofstream delimiters and loop timing is maintained by continuous streams of idle symbols sent on each wire pair during interframe gaps 1000baset supports both halfduplex and fullduplex operation1000basexall three 1000basex versions support fullduplex binary transmission at 1250 mbps over two strands of optical fiber or two stp copper wirepairs as shown in figure 1000basex link configuration transmission coding is based on the ansi fibre channel 8b10b encoding scheme each 8bit data byte is mapped into a 10bit codegroup for bitserial transmission like earlier ethernet versions each data frame is encapsulated at the physical layer before transmission and link synchronization is maintained by sending a continuous stream of idle codegroups during interframe gaps all 1000basex physical layers support both halfduplex and fullduplex operation figure 1000basex link configuration the principal differences among the 1000basex versions are the link media and connectors that the particular versions will support and in the case of optical media the wavelength of the optical signal see table 1000basex link configuration support  table 1000basex link configuration

compatibility requires that the transmitters at each end of the link be connected to the receivers at the other end of the link however because cable connectors at both ends of the link are keyed the same the conductors must cross over at some point to ensure that transmitter outputs are always connected to receiver inputs unfortunately when this requirement first came up in the development of 10baset ieee 8023 chose not to make a hard rule as to whether the crossover should be implemented in the cable as shown in figure alternative ways for implementing the link crossover requirement a or whether it should be implemented internally as shown in figure alternative ways for implementing the link crossover requirement b figure alternative ways for implementing the link crossover requirement instead ieee 8023 defined two rules and made two recommendations there must be an odd number of crossovers in all multiconductor links if a pmd is equipped with an internal crossover its mdi must be clearly labeled with the graphical x symbol implementation of an internal crossover function is optional when a dte is connected to a repeater or switch dce port it is recommended that the crossover be implemented within the dce port the eventual result was that ports in most dces were equipped with pmds that contained internal crossover circuitry and that dtes had pmds without internal crossovers this led to the following oftquoted de facto installation rule use a straightthrough cable when connecting dte to dce use a crossover cable when connecting dte to dte or dce to dce unfortunately the de facto rule does not apply to all ethernet versions that have been developed subsequent to 10baset as things now stand the following is true all fiberbased systems use cables that have the crossover implemented within the cable all 100base systems using twistedpair links use the same rules and recommendations as 10baset1000baset nics may implement a selectable internal crossover option that can be negotiated and enabled during autonegotiation when the selectable crossover option is not implemented 10baset rules and recommendations apply system considerations given all the choices discussed previously it might seem that it would be no problem to upgrade an existing network or to plan a new network the problem is twofold not all the choices are reasonable for all networks and not all ethernet versions and options are available in the market even though they may have been specified in the standard choosing utpbased components and media category by now it should be obvious that utpbased nics are available for 10mbps 100mbps and 1000mbps implementations the choice is relatively simple for both 10mbps and 1000mbps operation 10baset and 1000baset from the previous discussions however it would not seem to be that simple for 100mbps implementations although three utpbased nics are defined for 100 mbps the market has effectively narrowed the choice to just 100basetx which became widely available during the first half of 1995 by the time 100baset4 products first appeared on the market 100basetx was well entrenched and development of the fullduplex option which 100baset4 could not support was well underway the 100baset2 standard was not approved until spring 1997 too late to interest the marketplace as a result 100baset2 products were not even manufactured several choices have also been specified for utp media category 3 4 5 or 5e the differences are cable cost and transmission rate capability both of which increase with the category numbers however current transmission rate requirements and cable cost should not be the deciding factors in choosing which cable category to install to allow for future transmission rate needs cables lower than category 5 should not even be considered and if gigabit rates are a possible future need category 5e should be seriously considered installation labor costs are essentially constant for all types of utp fourpair cable labor costs for upgrading installed cable removing the existing and installing new are typically greater than the cost of the original installation utp cable is backwardcompatible highercategory cable will support lowercategory nics but not vice versa the physical life of utp cable decades is much longer than the useable life of the connected equipment autonegotiationan optional method for automatically configuring link operational modes the purpose of autonegotiation is to find a way for two nics that share a utp link to communicate with each other regardless of whether they both implemented the same ethernet version or option set autonegotiation is performed totally within the physical layers during link initiation without any additional overhead either to the mac or to higher protocol layers autonegotiation allows utpbased nics to do the following advertise their ethernet version and any optional capabilities to the nic at the other end of the link acknowledge receipt and understanding of the operational modes that both nics share reject any operational modes that are not shared configure each nic for highestlevel operational mode that both nics can support autonegotiation is specified as an option for 10baset 100basetx and 100baset4 but it is required for 100baset2 and 1000baset implementations table the defined autonegotiation selection levels for utp nics lists the defined selection priority levels highest level  top priority for utpbased ethernet nics table the defined autonegotiation selection levels for utp nics selection level operational mode maximum total data transfer rate mbps91000baset fullduplex200081000baset halfduplex10007100baset2 fullduplex2006100basetx fullduplex2005100baset2 halfduplex1004100baset4 halfduplex1003100basetx halfduplex100210baset fullduplex20110baset halfduplex10note because fullduplex operation allows simultaneous twoway transmission the maximum total transfer rate for fullduplex operation is double the halfduplex transmission rate the autonegotiation function in utpbased nics uses a modified 10baset link integrity pulse sequence in which the nlps are replaced by bursts of fast link pulses flps as shown in figure autonegotiation flp bursts replace nlps during link initiation each flp burst is an alternating clockdata sequence in which the data bits in the burst identify the operational modes supported by the transmitting nic and also provide information used by the autonegotiation handshake mechanism if the nic at the other end of the link is a compatible nic but does not have autonegotiation capability a parallel detection function still allows it to be recognized a nic that fails to respond to flp bursts and returns only nlps is treated as a 10baset halfduplex nic figure autonegotiation flp bursts replace nlps during link initiation at first glance it may appear that the autonegotiation process would always select the mode supported by the nic with the lessor capability which would be the case if both nics use the same encoding procedures and link configuration for example if both nics are 100basetx but only one supports fullduplex operation the negotiated operational mode will be halfduplex 100basetx unfortunately the different 100base versions are not compatible with each other at 100 mbps and a 100basetx fullduplex nic would autonegotiate with a 100baset4 nic to operate in 10baset halfduplex mode autonegotiation in 1000basex nics is similar to autonegotiation in utpbased systems except that it currently applies only to compatible 1000basex devices and is currently constrained to negotiate only halfduplex or fullduplex operation and flow control direction network switches provide a second and often better alternative to higher link speeds in csmacd network upgrades competitively priced network switches became available on the market shortly after the mid1990s and essentially made network repeaters obsolete for large networks although repeaters can accept only one frame at a time and then send it to all active ports except the port on which it is being received switches are equipped with the following macbased ports with io frame buffers that effectively isolate the port from traffic being sent at the same time to or from other ports on the switch multiple internal data paths that allow several frames to be transferred between different ports at the same time these may seem like small differences but they produce a major effect in network operation because each port provides access to a highspeed network bridge the switch the collision domain in the network is reduced to a series of small domains in which the number of participants is reduced to twothe switch port and the connected nic see figure replacing the network repeaters with switches reduces the collision domains to two nics each  furthermore because each participant is now in a private collision domain his or her available bandwidth has not only been markedly increased it was also done without having to change the link speed consider for example a 48station workgroup with a couple of large file servers and several network printers on a 100mbps csmacd network the average available bandwidth not counting interframe gaps and collision recovery would be 10050  2 mbps network print servers do not generate network traffic on the other hand if the same workgroup were still on a 10baset network in which the repeaters had been replaced with network switches the bandwidth available to each user would be 10 mbps clearly network configuration is as important as raw link speed note to ensure that each end station will be capable of communicating at full rate the network switches should be nonsaturating be capable of accepting and transferring data at the full rate from each port simultaneously multispeed nics autonegotiation opened the door to the development of lowcost multispeed nics that for example support both half and fullduplex operation under either 100basetx or 10baset signaling procedures multispeed nics allow staged network upgrades in which the 10baset halfduplex end stations can be connected to 100basetx fullduplex switch ports without requiring the nic in the pc to be changed then as more bandwidth is needed for individual pcs the nics in those pcs can be upgraded to 100basetx fullduplex mode figure replacing the network repeaters with switches reduces the collision domains to two nics each choosing 1000basex components and media although the above table shows that there is considerable flexibility of choice in the 1000basex link media there is not total flexibility some choices are preferred over others nics at both ends of the link must be the same 1000basex version cx lx or sx and the link connectors must match the nic connectors the 1000basecx specification allows either style 1 or style 2 connectors but style 2 is preferred because some style 1 connectors are not suitable for operation at 1250 mbps 1000basecx links are intended for patchcord use within a communications closet and are limited to 25 meters the 1000baselx and 1000basesx specifications allow either the small form factor sff mtrj or the larger duplex sc connectors because sff mtrj connectors are only about half as large as duplex sc connectors and because space is a premium it follows that sff mtrj connectors may become the predominant connector1000baselx transceivers generally cost more than 1000basesx transceivers the maximum operating range for optical fibers

modeconditioning patch cord when coupling to some existing multimode fibers the operating ranges shown in the above table are those specified in the ieee 8023 standard in practice however the maximum operating range for lx transceivers over 625 µ m multimode fiber is approximately 700 meters and some lx transceivers have been qualified to support a 10000meter operating range over singlemode fiber multiplerate ethernet networks given the opportunities shown by the example in the previous sections it is not surprising that most large ethernet networks are now implemented with a mix of transmission rates and link media as shown in the cable model in figure an example multirate network topology—the isoiec 11801 cable model figure an example multirate network topology—the isoiec 11801 cable model the isoiec 11801 cable model is the network model on which the ieee 8023 standards are based campus distributor  the term campus refers to a facility with two or more buildings in a relatively small area this is the central point of the campus backbone and the telecom connection point with the outside world in ethernet lans the campus distributor would typically be a gigabit switch with telecom interface capability building distributor  this is the buildings connection point to the campus backbone an ethernet building distributor would typically be a 1000100 or 100010010mbps switch floor distributor  this is the floors connection point to the building distributor isoiec 11801 recommends at least one floor distributor for every 1000 m2 of floor space in office environments and if possible a separate distributor for each floor in the building an ethernet floor distributor would typically be a 100010010 or 10010mbps switch telecom outlet  this is the network connection point for pcs workstations and print servers file servers are typically colocated with and directly connected to the campus building or floor distributors as appropriate for their intended use campus backbone cabling  this is typically single or multimode cable that interconnects the central campus distributor with each of the building distributors building backbone cabling  this is typically category 5 or better utp or multimode fiber cable that interconnects the building distributor with each of the floor distributors in the building horizontal cabling  this is predominantly category 5 or better utp cable although a few installations are using multimode fiber as with utp cable selection the choice of link media and intermediate network nodes should always be made with an eye to future transmission rate needs and the life expectancy of the network elements unpredictable though they may be in the 1990s lan transmission rates increased 100 times and by 2002 will increase yet another 10 times this does not mean that allor even someend stations and their interconnecting links will require gigabit capability it does mean however that more central network nodes such as most campus distributors and many building distributors should be equipped with gigabit capability and that all floor distributors should have at least 100 mbps capability it also means that all network switches should be nonblocking and that all ports should have fullduplex capability and that any new campus backbone links should be installed with singlemode fiber link aggregationestablishing higherspeed network trunks link aggregation is a recent optional mac capability that allows several physical links to be combined into one logical higherspeed trunk it provides the means to increase the effective data rate between two network nodes in unit multiples of the individual link transmission rate rather than in an orderofmagnitude step link aggregation can be a costeffective way to provide higherspeed connections in ethernet lans that are reaching saturation with 100 mbps transmission rates but that wont require gigabit capability at least in the short term for example the maximum length for 625 µ m multimode fiber links is 2000 meters at 100 mbps and multimode fiber has been often used for campus backbone links the logical upgrade would seem to be to reuse these links for 1000 mbps operation but the maximum supportable length for multimode fiber is only 700 meters and only with 1000baselx if the existing links are longer than 700 meters aggregating n existing links will support an effective transmission rate of 100 n mbps link aggregation should be viewed as a network configuration option that is primarily used in the few interconnections that require higher data rates than can be provided by single links such as switchtoswitch and in switchtofile server it can also be used to increase the reliability of critical links aggregated links can be rapidly reconfigured typically in about 1 second or less in case of link failure with low risk of duplicated or reordered frames link aggregation does not affect either the ieee 8023 data frame format s or any higher layers in the protocol stack it is backwardcompatible with aggregationunaware devices and can be used with any ethernet data rate although it does not make sense for 10 mbps because it would likely cost less to procure a pair of 100mbps nics link aggregation can be enabled only on parallel pointtopoint links and those that support fullduplex samespeed operation network management all higherspeed ethernet specifications include definitions for managed objects and control agents that are compatible with simple network management protocol snmp and that can be used to gather statistics about the operation of the network nodes and to assist in network management because user information is anecdotal at best and usually comes long after the fact all larger networks should at least be configured with managed switches and network servers to ensure that potential problems and bottlenecks can be identified before they cause serious network deterioration migrating to higherspeed networks by now it should be apparent that upgrading existing networks typically does not require wholesale equipment or media changes but it does require knowledge of the current network configuration and the network location of potential problems this means that a network management system should be in place and that a cable plant database should be both available and accurate it is timeconsuming and often difficult to determine link type and availability after the cables have been pulled through conduit buried in walls and layered in cable trays links are often the limiting factors in network upgrades existing category 5 links should support all current ethernet rates from 10 mbps to 1000 mbps although they should be tested to ensure their capability to support gigabit rates if the network is equipped with only category 3 cable some links will have to be replaced before upgrading to 1000 mbps a similar situation exists with single and multimode fiber multimode fiber cannot be used for all backbone installations singlemode fiber on the other hand not only can support all backbone lengths up to 10000 meters at 1000 mbps but it also will be capable of supporting backbone use at 10gigabit data rates in the future switch replacement can begin as soon as the necessary links are available existing switches at the campus and building distributor levels can often be reused at the building or floor distributor level nics can generally be replaced to extend the useful life of end stations and so on summary the article began with an overview of the ethernet technology the network building blocks and ethernets relationship to the iso sevenlayer reference model the requirements for mac and phy compatibility also were introduced the basic mac responsibilities were defined data encapsulation  assembling the frame into the defined format before transmission begins and disassembling the frame after it has been received and checked for transmission errors media access control  in the required csmacd halfduplex mode and in the optional fullduplex mode two optional mac capability extensions and their associated frame formats were discussed the vlan tagging option allows network nodes to be defined with logical as well as physical addresses and provides a means to assign transmission priorities on a framebyframe basis a specific format for the pause frame which is used for shortterm link flow control is defined in the standard but was not covered here because it is automatic mac capability that is invoked as needed to prevent input buffer overrun the phy layer discussions included descriptions of the signaling procedures and media requirementslimitations for the following10baset100basetx 100baset4 and

copper the remaining sections of the article were devoted to systems considerations for both twistedpair and optical fiber lan implementations link crossover requirements in utp networks matching of pmds and network media to ensure desired data rates use of link aggregation to create higherspeed logical trunks implementation of multispeed networks after essentially finishing the article you should have a reasonable working knowledge of the ethernet protocol and network technology the next section should help determine whether you need to go back and reread the article review questions q  shouldnt all 10baset networks just be upgraded to 100 mbps why or why not a  not necessarilyif the current 10baset network is repeaterbased replacing the repeaters with 10100 nonsaturating switches would result in an automatic n times increase in the average available bandwidth for each end station q  which 100base version s are recommended why a  100basetx is recommended if the horizontal wiring is category5 or better utp if the horizontal cabling is category 3 100base t4 can be used but it may be difficult to acquire some reports indicate that because 100basetx was available more than a year before t4 it captured as much as 95 percent of the market 100baset2 is not available q  which 1000base version s are recommended where would they be used a  1000baset is recommended if the horizontal cabling is category 5 or better utp 1000basesx can be used if the horizontal cabling is multimode optical fiber as well as for some multimode backbones 1000baselx can be used for either singlemode or multimode optical fiber see table 75 1000basecx can be used for shorthaul equipmentroom jumpers up to 25 meters q  what cable types should be used for new networks for upgrading existing networks why a  new or replacement utp links may be category 5e or better to allow for data rate growth to 1000 mbps multimode fiber may be used as indicated in table 75 for 1000basesx or as noted in the paragraph following table 75 for 1000baselx these fibers will also provide future support for shorter distances between 100 and 300 meters depending on the wavelength at 10000 mbps to be truly futureproof and to ensure that you will be able to operate longerdistance backbones choose singlemode fiber q  how do you know when a network needs to be upgraded where do you start a  there are several ways your users will tell you but often only after they have crossed the frustration threshold your network management system should be capable of indicating the load characteristics for each dce port your organization is considering adding new applications such as multimedia that will require more communication bandwidth your organization is growing and there are not sufficient dce ports in the right locations to accommodate the additional users after you have determined the need you can consider the options remember that the network elements with the longest useful life the link media followed by the network servers and network switches can also be the most expensive to replace choose with an eye to future growth and consider reusing these elements wherever possible currently
