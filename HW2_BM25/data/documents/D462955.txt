tire size guide lea en espa√±olthe tire size branded on the sidewall provides a significant amount of information about the tires intended purpose dimensions load capacity and high temperaturehigh speed durability our primary example will be based on variations of the 22550r16 size although other sizes will appear where appropriate the tire size branded on the sidewall provides a significant amount of information about the tires intended purpose dimensions load capacity and high temperaturehigh speed durability service type most tire sizes begin with a letter or letters that identify the type of vehicle andor type of service for which they were designed the common indicators are as follows p 22550r16 91sp  when a tire size begins with a p it signifies the tire is a pmetric size that was designed to be fitted on vehicles that are primarily used as passenger vehicles this includes cars minivans sport utility vehicles and light duty pickup trucks typically 14 and 12ton load capacity the use of pmetric sizes began in the late 1970s and they are the most frequently used type of tire size today22550r16 92sif there isnt a letter preceding the threedigit numeric portion of a tire size it signifies the tire is a metric size also called eurometric because these sizes originated in europe while metric tire sizes are primarily used on european cars they are also used on vans and sport utility vehicles eurometric sizes are dimensionally equivalent to pmetric sizes but typically differ subtly in load carrying capabilities t 12590d16 98mt  if a tire size begins with a t it signifies the tire is a temporary spare space saver or mini spare that was designed to be used temporarily only until a flat tire can be repaired or replaced lt 24575r16 108104slt  if a tire size begins with lt it signifies the tire is a light truckmetric size that was designed to be used on vehicles that are capable of carrying heavy cargo or towing large trailers this includes medium and heavyduty typically 34 and 1ton load capacity pickup trucks sport utility vehicles and fullsize vans tires branded with the lt designation are the little brothers of 18wheel tractortrailer tires and are designed to provide substantial reserve capacity to accept the additional stresses of carrying heavy cargo750r16 lt 112107q 875r165 lt 104100q or 31x1050r15 lt 109qlt  if a tire ends with lt it signifies the tire is either an earlier numeric wide base or flotation light truck size designed to be used on vehicles that are capable of carrying heavy cargo and towing trailers numeric sizes use 165inch diameter rims wide base sizes or are wider over sized tires designed to help the vehicle drive on top of loose dirt or sandy surfaces flotation sizes this includes light medium and heavy duty typically 12 34 and 1ton load capacity pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles tires branded with the lt at the end of their size designation are also the little brothers of 18wheel tractortrailer tires and are designed to provide substantial reserve capacity to accept the additional stresses of carrying heavy cargo19570r15 c 104102rc  if a eurometric sized tire ends with a c it signifies the tire is a commercial tire intended to be used on vans or delivery trucks that are capable of carrying heavy loads in addition to being branded with the c in their size these tires are also branded with their appropriate service description st 22575r15st  if a tire size begins with st it signifies the tire is a special trailer service size that was designed to only be used on boat car or utility trailers stsized tires should never be used on cars vans or light trucks section width following the letter s that identify the type of vehicle andor type of service for which the tire was designed the threedigit numeric portion identifies the tires section width cross section in millimeters p 225 50r16 91sthe 225 indicates this tire is 225 millimeters across from the widest point of its outer sidewall to the widest point of its inner sidewall when mounted and measured on a specified width wheel this measurement is also referred to as the tires section width because many people think of measurements in inches the 225mm can be converted to inches by dividing the section width in millimeters by 254 the number of millimeters per inch225mm  254  886sidewall aspect ratio typically following the three digits identifying the tires section width in millimeters is a twodigit number that identifies the tires profile or aspect ratio p225 50 r16 91sthe 50 indicates that this tire sizes sidewall height from rim to tread is 50 of its section width the measurement is the tires section height and also referred to as the tires series profile or aspect ratio the higher the number the taller the sidewall the lower the number the lower the sidewall we know that this tire sizes section width is 225mm and that its section height is 50 of 225mm by converting the 225mm to inches 225  254  886 and multiplying it by 50  50 we confirm that this tire size results in a tire section height of 443 if this tire were a p225 70 r16 size our calculation would confirm that the size would result in a section height of 620 approximately a 18inch taller sidewall internal construction a letter  r in this case that identifies the tires internal construction follows the two digits used to identify the aspect ratio p22550 r 16 p22550 zr 16the r in the p22550 r 16 91s size identifies that the tire has a r adial construction in which the tires body plies radiate out from the imaginary center of the wheel radial tires are by far the most popular type of tire today representing over 98 of all tires sold if the r in the size was replaced with a d 22550 d 16 it would identify that the internal tire body plies crisscross on a d iagonal and that the tire has a bias ply construction tires using this construction are for light truck and spare tire applications if the r in the size was replaced with a b 22550 b 16 it would identify that the tire body plies not only crisscross the tire on a diagonal as before but that they are reinforced with belts under the tread area this type of tire construction is called  b elted tires using this construction are practically extinct the european tyre and rim technical organisation etrto has adopted branding standards that allowed tire manufacturers to identify tires with selfsupporting runflat constructions within the tire size designation selfsupporting runflat tires may be identified with the letter f immediately following the traditional letter identifying tire construction such as the r designating radial within the size this results in size designations such as 22545r f 17 91y for selfsupporting runflat tires that have a speed rating identified in their service description and 25540zr f 20 for zspeed rated selfsupporting runflat tires in which the speed rating is contained in the tire size since this tire size designation was adopted well after the introduction of selfsupporting runflat tires into the marketplace selfsupporting runflat tires introduced and produced before it went into effect will not be required to be branded as such speed rating today the only tires that continue to include the speed rating in the tire size p22550 zr 16 are z speed rated tires in this case following the two digits used to identify the aspect ratio are the letters zr to identify the tires speed rating  z and its internal construction  r  since 1991 all other speed ratings are identified in the tires service description which will be covered shortly tire and wheel diameter p22550r 16 91sthe 16 indicates the tire and wheel diameter designed to be matched together tires that have a rim diameter expressed in inches p22550r 16 as well as 8 10 12 13 14 15 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 26 and 28 are called inch rim sizes these are the most common types of tire sizes and are used on most cars minivans vans sport utility vehicles and light duty light trucks while not as common two additional unique types of tirewheel diameters are still in use today tires and wheels that have a rim diameter expressed in half inches 800r 165 lt as well as 145 155 175 and 195 are used on some heavyduty trailers heavyduty light trucks and box vans tires and wheels that have a rim diameter expressed in millimeters 19065r 390 as well as 365 and 415 are called millimetric sizes michelin initiated millimetric sizes for their trx tires that saw limited use on many different car models in the late 1970s and 1980s michelin pax system runflat tires have been introduced as an integrated wheeltire system on a very limited basis as original equipment o e in north america an example pax system size of 235710r460a 104t expresses tire and wheel dimensions in millimeters 235 mm section width tire overall diameter of 710 mm and a 460a mm rim diameter with the a in 460 a signifying these tires feature asymmetric beads in which the outside bead 450 mm and inside bead 470 mm are actually different diameters all of these unique tirewheel diameters were developed specifically because the tire and wheel design or intended vehicle use required them to be different than conventional tires and wheels all of these tires and wheels feature bead profiles that have a different shape than traditional inch rim sizes tires and wheels with unique rim diameters should never be combined with traditional inch rim tires and wheels it is critical that the tire and wheel diameters are always confirmed to match before the tire is mounted on the wheel service description p22550r16 91sthe 91s represents the tires service description a service description identifies the tires load index and speed rating service descriptions are
