cutera pearl peel with lime light treatment posted by kylie on july 1 2013 in beauty  11 comments i have been a beauty therapist for 8 years now and i am constantly asked my thoughts on more intense treatments like peels laser microdermabrasion and fillers etc so as any good beauty therapist does i went and had some treatments done for research for my clients not for my personal gain of course ha ha almost 2 years ago i had a cutera pearl peel with lime light laser at cozmedics in ascot brisbane costing for pearl is from 650 per treatment and is done by dr alison jamieson limelight full face is 250 per treatment this treatment is done by their registered nurses or paramedical staff i had a numbing cream applied for approximately 15 mins then the lime light laser was performed this was the most uncomfortable and annoying it felt like being flicked with an elastic band it only takes about 10 mins for the entire face so completely bearable i had the pearl peel next the difference between a pearl peel and pearl fractional is the depth of the treatment and how many layers are treated due to my age and skin texture the dr decided a pearl peel was enough for me with the pearl i only felt a warm sensation no pain at all but i have to say it is very loud and sounds like a machine gun ok maybe not as loud as a machine gun but the same consistency of noise as the button is pressed the entire procedure is over in about 3045 mins straight after the treatment my skin just felt flushed it was a really hot day when i had it done so leaving the clinic and getting into the car i did feel like my skin was burning as soon as i got the aircon pumping in the car i was fine i didn’t take any photo’s on this day as i didn’t feel looked any different if anything just a little puffy day 2 – this was on the morning i was a little puffy and slightly pink but it was just feeling like sunburn at this stage day 3 – this was taken in the morning a little redder today but still only sunburn feeling day 3 – afternoon starting to scare small children i felt really sunburnt today and a little tender day 4 – you can see the honeycomb effect of the pearl and where my pigmentation has turned really dark from the lime light day 4 – hello samantha sex in the city still really sunburnt feeling and getting quite tight day 5 – felt so tight by the end of the day couldn’t wait for the peeling to begin day 6 – the peeling has begun i can smile again without feeling like my face is going to crack day 6 – still pink but not sore at all i can see the light day 7 – almost there still some patches to peel off day 8 – no foundation just a little mascara loving the results day 8 – loving the texture the even skin tone and my fine lines have gone i would recommend this treatment to anyone wanting to improve texture pigmentation and tone down time for me was 6 days but this will be different for everyone please ensure you do your research on the person and clinic performing this treatment i would only have it done by a registered doctor there are so many dodgy clinics around and although they may advertise it at a lower price do not take the risk as the damage can be permanent if you have any other questions please don’t hesitate to ask kb xx below is information about both treatments and the possible risks provided by cozmedics ascot limelight therapy
