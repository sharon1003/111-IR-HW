plants are about to come into flower 269 cultivation details an easily grown plant it succeeds in any rich soil 1 the plant is adapted to a wide range of soils from sandy to heavy growth being poor on light sandy or gravelly soils 269 niger is often cultivated on very poor acid soils on hilly slopes where fertility is low due to leaching and washing away of the plant nutrients by erosion 269 niger seed is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 66 to 179cm an annual temperature range of 136 to 275°c and a p h in the range of 55 to 75 269 niger is often cultivated especially in africa as an oil seed crop 2 46 51 269 it has also been cultivated in germany 61 the flowers are very attractive to bees 269 several factors lend credence to fears that niger might become a pest if introduced into warm temperate areas  grazing animals do not relish it the plant tolerates poor soil and drought it has few serious pests or diseases especially outside its native range the seeds store for a year or more without deterioration and the seeds mature 3  45 months after planting 269 arguing against its weed potential are the facts that it is a short day plant and therefore does not flower or set seed until daylight hours average 13 hours or less it is selfsterile and requires bees for pollination 269 propagation seed  sow spring in situ and only just cover the seed make sure the soil does not dry out because this would delay germination in warm weather germination should take place within 3  4 days of sowing the seed when sowing larger areas the seed may be broadcast at rate of 10 kgha or sown in rows 40 to 50 cm apart at rate of 5 kgha 269 books by plants for a future other names found in weed potential right plant wrong place we are currently updating this section please note that

also have a lot of these plants growing beneath my bird feeders i have some concerns re whether this plant could be invasive and cause problems if it escapes into the wild i have decided to leave one

approximately 250000 ha it is also grown in marginal areas in india and to some extent in east africa and the west indies it is the most important edible oil crop in ethiopia supplying about half of their oilseed production it is a member of the asteraceae alt compositeae family it is a shortday plant an annual 13m tall up to 15m which is frost tolerant drought resistant and adapted to a wide range of soils there are three main types dwarf semidwarf and giant it is propagated by seed which is about 355 mm long contains 3050 of a yellow semidrying oil with a pleasant taste and a protein content of about 20 the oil from ethiopian crops contains about 70 linoleic acid while oil from crops grown in india contains about 50 for farmers it is much kinder plant to grow than safflower as the plants do not have spines and harvesting could be mechanised more research is needed on this potentially useful source of edible plant oil detailed information is available online from the publications department of the plant genetic resources institute planting propagation niger is selfsterile and needs bees for crosspollination soil niger seed grows well in poor soils if they are neither very acidic it is classified as “sensitive” to soil acidity nor waterlogged ph range 5575 in fertile soils the plants may lodge fall over and have a prolonged growth period it is not normally fertilised though it does normally respond to both fertilisers and manure seed rate 58 kgha in rows 44050cm apart 8  12 kgha when broadcast when npk fertiliser is often broadcast together with the seed then harrowed into the soil seed spacing normally broadcast sometimes in rows 3550 cm apart depth covered with light harrows when broadcast otherwise about 1 cm deep in a fine tilth germination the seed can be stored for a year or more without losing much viability intercropping commonly done with finger millet ragi cereals legumes and other annuals rotation works well with wheat andor maize growth conditions day length intermediate response varies with type but most are shortday do not flower or set seed until daylight hours average 13 hours or less growth period 100150 days temperature very frost tolerant semidwarf types are adapted to temperate climates rainfall about 6001800mm a year for all types dwarf types are more drought resistant altitude the optimum is around 20002200m but it can be grown from about 16002600m pests and diseases rarely a problem locusts grasshoppers  armyworms sometimes attack yield when intercropped with finger millet in india niger seed yields about 100200 kgha pure stand yields have been recorded in both india and ethiopia of about 300400 kgha 400600 kgha in kenya 12mtha is possible with good growing conditions oil yields are 3050 of seed yield utilisation seeds of niger seed are crushed giving about 30 of a clear edible semidrying oil which is yellow in colour and tastes of nuts seeds can also be used fried or as chutneys and condiments or fed to caged birds in ethiopia they are pressed with honey and made into cakes oil is used for cooking for making soap and for lighting some is used in making paints it is used as a substitute for olive oil can be mixed with linseed oil and is used as an adulterant for rape oil sesame oil etc whole plant can be used to attract bees and also as a green manure before flowering presscake is used as a high protein 3035 food for animals especially cattle this black oilcake is comparable in feeding value to undecorticated groundnut cake up to 30 can be added to laying poultry rations it is sometimes used as manuresoil improver limitations yields are rather modest there is a shortage of improved varieties and of large quantities of good quality seed the growing crop needs a well prepared seedbed with very few or no weeds the seeds are very small and it is more difficult for subsistence farmers to extract oil from niger seed than from other oilseed crops elizabeth h v nishitha naik sat

now heavily parasitised by western field dodder the seeds of this must have been mixed with the niger seed because field dodder is not a native of worcestershire uk elizabeth h tony winch sat sep 16
