contain my routing  account number which ive used in the past to make purchases online among other things anyone whom i pay with a check has this information it seems like this account info is even more sensitive than my credit card  since with visa i am protected with a zero liability policy but i do not know that to be the case for my checking account i may be naive but theres a lot of people ive paid with checks whom i would never give my credit card eg people ive bought from on craigslist im now wondering if its irrational to do thischeck fraudshare improve this questionedited nov 2 10 at 1222asked nov 2 10 at 1216rex e320 1 4 71i thought that your checkingrouting number can be used freely to deposit money but to withdraw money it requires confirmation from the account holder only thing i can think of is that they forge a check with the numbers – corey nov 2 10 at 15505not true you can deposit or withdraw money with that number ever seen those infomercials where you can just read that number off to them over the phone worse yet they dont even have to confirm that you approved the withdrawal before they process it – john fx ♦ nov 2 10 at 2031thats terrible and new information to me ill have to keep this in mind but i dont write many checks as it is so im not too concerned – corey nov 2 10 at 2126i send cashiers checks or money orders to avoid giving anyone my bank account numbers for this reason including mortgage and car payments – chuck cottrill dec 31 13 at 20311i am particularly wary with this situation how is it that when we go to the store they inquire balance right there but when we deposit a false check the system cashes it instead of using that routing and account number to check for balance – user22926 dec 7 14 at 1333show 1 more comment7 answers active oldest votesup vote22down voteaccepted yes and there are almost no checks no pun intended on people pulling money from your account using a routing number it is an extremely insecure system if you want a real halloween scare read this article easy check fraud technique draws scrutiny unfortunately you just have to live with it if you are curious why this loophole is allowed to continue consider how hard it is to close it without undermining the convenience of checks short of you going to the bank with each person you write a check to and showing id to validate the transaction i dont see how you could continue to use a negotiable instrument like this without such a security hole the ultimate answer is going to have to be replacing checks with other means of paymentshare improve this answeranswered nov 2 10 at 2029john fx ♦332k 7 76 1821how long can check numbers be what technical problems would exist with appending a few arbitrary secret digits to each check number so that instead of the first three checks being 101 102 103 theyd be something like 10178342 10231889 etc with the bank knowing what the digit sequence should be but recipients of individual checks not i would think that should be compatible with the existing banking infrastructure would it not – supercat mar 7 11 at 0182john fx i think supercats idea is that the bank receiving the check would verify the checknumberchecksum before cashingdepositing the check this could work except that it would require cooperatin between competing institutions – smokris nov 16 11 at 17332john fx you could easily make it so the check numbers can only be used once see nonce are not sequential and the number is large enough it cant be guessed statistically without trying millions of checks – bryan anderson nov 18 11 at 16381john fx if its so easy how do you actually withdraw money from someones account given their account information i feel like everyone says its a piece of cake but no one describes how which is ironic given that its supposed to be so easy and legal assuming you have their permission – mehrdad aug 9 14 at 0051joshua  when a withdrawal is made using the ach system there is no check number involved all thats necessary is the routing number and the account number even the account holders name is not required – kevin fegan jun 21 15 at 926show 14 more

there enwikipediaorgwikiknuthrewardcheck yup it is easy to steal from checks with just those digits – mr christer nov 2 10 at 23001actually the description of the check image itself  enwikipediaorgwikifile knuthcheck2png reads note that the machinereadable numbers at the bottom of the check have been randomly swapped or modified so that no personal information about don knuths personal bank account is leaked through this image – mskfisher nov 3 10 at 1151add a commentup vote5down vote the bottom line is to keep most of your money in accounts with no check privileges and to not give the account numbers for these accounts to anyone keep just enough in your checking account for the checks you are going to writeshare improve this answeranswered nov 2 10 at 2035michael goldshteyn221 1 3this is also a good idea of course when you have to give someone your account number so that they can send you money – poolie dec 30 10 at 2323add a commentup vote5down vote thats accurate here is another risk with the current checking system which many people are not aware of anyone who knows your checking account number can learn what your balance in that account is this is bankspecific but it is possible at the major banks ive checked how does that work many banks have a phone line where you can dial up and interact with an automated voice response system for various customer service tasks one of the options is something like merchant check verification that option is intended to help a merchant who receives a check to verify whether the person writing the check has enough money in their account for the check to clear if you select that option in the phone tree it will prompt you to enter in the account number on the check and the amount of the check and then it will respond by telling you either there are currently sufficient funds in the account to cash this check or there are not sufficient funds this check would bounce heres how you can abuse this system to learn how much someone has in their bank account if you know their account number you call up and check whether theyve enough money to cash a 10000 check note that you dont actually have to have a check for 10000 in your hands you just need to know the account number if the system says nope itd bounce then you call again and try 5000 if the system says yup sufficient funds for a 5000 check then you try 7500 if it says nope not enough for that you try 6250 etcetera at each step you narrow the range of possible account balances by a factor of two consequently after about a dozen or so steps you will likely know their balance to within a few dollars computer scientists know this procedure by the name binary search the rest of us may recognize it as akin to a game of 20 questions if this bothers you you may be able to protect your self by calling up your bank and asking them how to prevent it when i talked to my bank bank of america they told me they could put a fraud alert flag on your account which would disable the merchant check verification service for my account it does mean that i have to provide a 3digit pin any time i phone up my bank but thats fine with me i realize many folks may terribly not be concerned about revealing their bank account balance so in the grand scheme of things this risk may be relatively minor however i thought id document it here for others to be aware ofshare improve this answeranswered nov 18 11 at 547d w180 1 6add a commentup vote3down vote i was a victim of this im not sure who got my routing and account number off my check but someone subscribed to playboycom using my bank account information luckily it was only for about 30 and the bank refunded my money however it was a mess in that i had to open a new checking account and keep the other one open until all checks cleared the bank was extremely helpful and monitored the account to make sure only the checks i told them about were processed i then had to close the old account this is why i believe checks are much less secure than credit cards or debit cards a paper check can lay on someones desk for anyone to pick up or write the information down off of it i avoid checks if at all possible for things like craigs list i would try to use pay pal or some other intermediate processing serviceshare improve this answeranswered nov 2 10 at 1848schwartz e648 5

vote yes this is a huge security loophole and many banks will do nothing to refund if you are scammed for example for business accounts some wells fargo branches say you must notify within 24 hours of any check withdrawal or the loss is yours basically banks dont care  they are a monopoly system and you are stuck with them when the losses and complaints get too great they will eventually implement the european system of electronic transfers  but the banks dont want to be bothered with that expense yet sure you can use paypal  another overpriced monopoly  or much better try dwolla or
