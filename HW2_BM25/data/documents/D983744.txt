queen victoria at the end of the nineteenth century dominions refers to all territories belonging to the crown at the outset a distinction must be made between a british dominion and british dominions the use of a capital d when referring to the british dominions was required by the united kingdom government in order to avoid confusion with the wider term his majestys dominions which referred to the british empire as a whole 3all territories forming part of the british empire were british dominions but only some were british dominions at the time of the adoption of the statute of westminster there were six british dominions canada australia new zealand south africa newfoundland and the irish free state at the same time there were many other jurisdictions that were british dominions for example cyprus the order in council annexing the island of cyprus in 1914 declared that from 5 november the island shall be annexed to and form part of his majestys dominions 4 5use of dominion to refer to a particular territory dates back to the 16th century and was sometimes used to describe wales from 1535 to around 1800 for instance the laws in wales act 1535 applies to the dominion principality and country of wales 6 dominion as an official title was conferred on the colony of virginia about 1660 and on the dominion of new england in 1686 these dominions never had full selfgoverning status the creation of the shortlived dominion of new england was designed—contrary to the purpose of later dominions—to increase royal control and to reduce the colonys selfgovernment under the british north america act 1867 what is now eastern canada received the status of dominion upon the confederation of several british possessions in north america however it was at the colonial conference of 1907 when the selfgoverning colonies of canada and the commonwealth of australia were referred to collectively as dominions for the first time 7 two other selfgoverning colonies —new zealand and newfoundland—were granted the status of dominion in the same year these were followed by the union of south africa in 1910 and the irish free state in 1922 at the time of the founding of the league of nations in 1924 the league covenant made provision for the admission of any fully selfgoverning state dominion or colony 8 the implication being that dominion status was something between that of a colony and a state 9dominion status was formally defined in the balfour declaration of 1926 which recognised these countries as autonomous communities within the british empire thus acknowledging them as political equals of the united kingdom the statute of westminster 1931 converted this status into legal reality making them essentially independent members of what was then called the british commonwealth following the second world war the decline of british colonialism led to dominions generally being referred to as commonwealth realms and the use of the word dominion gradually diminished nonetheless though disused it remains canadas legal title 10 and the phrase her majestys dominions is still used occasionally in legal documents in the united kingdom 11hisher

that had never been annexed that is were not colonies of the crown but were league of nations mandates protectorates or united nations trust territories were granted independence the united kingdom act granting independence always declared that such and such a territory shall form part of her majestys dominions and so become part of the territory in which the queen exercises sovereignty not merely suzerainty the later sense of dominion was capitalised to distinguish it from the more general sense of dominion 3historical development  editoverseas dominions  editthe word dominions originally referred to the possessions of the kingdom of england oliver cromwell s full title in the 1650s was lord protector of the commonwealth of england scotland and ireland and the dominions thereto belonging in 1660 king charles ii gave the colony of virginia the title of dominion in gratitude for virginias loyalty to the crown during the english civil war  citation needed the commonwealth of virginia a state of the united states still has  the old dominion  as one of its nicknames dominion also occurred in the name of the shortlived dominion of new england 1686–1689 in all of these cases the word dominion implied no more than being subject to the english crown  citation neededresponsible government precursor to dominion status  editmain articles responsible government and selfgoverning colony the foundation of dominion status followed the achievement of internal selfrule in british colonies in the specific form of full responsible government as distinct from  representative government  colonial responsible government began to emerge during the mid19th century the legislatures of colonies with responsible government were able to make laws in all matters other than foreign affairs defence and international trade these being powers which remained with the parliament of the united kingdom bermuda notably was never defined as a dominion despite meeting this criteria but as a selfgoverning colony that remains part of the british realm nova scotia soon followed by the province of canada which included modern southern ontario and southern quebec were the first colonies to achieve responsible government in 1848 prince edward island followed in 1851 and new brunswick and newfoundland in 1855 all except for newfoundland and prince edward island agreed to form a new federation named canada from 1867 this was instituted by the british parliament in the british north america act 1867 see also canadian confederation  section 3 of the act referred to the new entity as a dominion the first such entity to be created from 1870 the dominion included two vast neighbouring british territories that did not have any form of selfgovernment ruperts land and the northwestern territory parts of which later became the provinces of manitoba saskatchewan alberta and the separate territories the northwest territories yukon and nunavut in 1871 the crown colony of british columbia became a canadian province prince edward island joined in 1873 and newfoundland in 1949 the conditions under which the four separate australian colonies— new south wales tasmania western australia south australia —and new zealand could gain full responsible government were set out by the british government in the australian constitutions act 1850 12 the act also separated the colony of victoria in 1851 from new south wales during 1856 responsible government was achieved by new south wales 13 victoria 14 south australia 15 and tasmania 16 and new zealand the remainder of new south wales was divided in three in 1859 a change that established most of the present borders of nsw the colony of queensland with its own responsible selfgovernment 17 and the northern territory which was not granted selfgovernment prior to federation of the australian colonies 18 western australia did not receive selfgovernment until 1891 mainly because of its continuing financial dependence on the uk government 19 after protracted negotiations that initially included new zealand six australian colonies with responsible government and their dependent territories agreed to federate along canadian lines becoming the commonwealth of australia in 1901 in south africa the cape colony became the first british selfgoverning colony in 1872 until 1893 the cape colony also controlled the separate colony of natal  following the second boer war 1899–1902 the british empire assumed direct control of the boer republics but transferred limited selfgovernment to transvaal in 1906 and the orange river colony in 1907 the new zealand observer 1907 shows prime minister joseph ward as a pretentious dwarf beneath a massive dominion top hat the caption reads the surprise packet canada rather large for him is it not australia oh his head is swelling rapidly the hat will soon fit the commonwealth of australia was recognised as a dominion in 1901 and the dominion of new zealand and the dominion of newfoundland were officially given dominion status in 1907 followed by the union of south africa in 1910 canadian confederation and evolution of the term dominion  editin connection with proposals for the future government of british north america use of the term dominion was suggested by samuel leonard tilley at the london conference of 1866 discussing the confederation of the province of canada subsequently becoming the province of ontario and the province of quebec  nova scotia and new brunswick into one dominion under the name of canada the first federation internal to the british empire 20 tilleys suggestion was taken from the 72nd psalm verse eight he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth which is echoed in the national motto  a mari usque ad mare  21 the new government of canada under the british north america act of 1867 began to use the phrase dominion of canada to designate the new larger nation however neither the confederation nor the adoption of the title of dominion granted extra autonomy or new powers to this new federal level of government 22 23 senator eugene forsey wrote that the powers acquired since the 1840s that established the system of responsible government in canada would simply be transferred to the new dominion government by the time of confederation in 1867 this system had been operating in most of what is now central and eastern canada for almost 20 years the fathers of confederation simply continued the system they knew the system that was already working and working well 23the constitutional scholar andrew heard has established that confederation did not legally change canadas colonial status to anything approaching its later status of a dominion at its inception in 1867 canadas colonial status was marked by political and legal subjugation to british imperial supremacy in all aspects of government—legislative judicial and executive the imperial parliament at westminster could legislate on any matter to do with canada and could override any local legislation the final court of appeal for canadian litigation lay with the judicial committee of the privy council in london the governor general had a substantive role as a representative of the british government and ultimate executive power was vested in the british monarch —who was advised only by british ministers in its exercise canadas independence came about as each of these subordinations was eventually removed 22heard went on to document the sizeable body of legislation passed by the british parliament in the latter part of the 19th century that upheld and expanded its imperial supremacy to constrain that of its colonies including the new dominion government in canada when the dominion of canada was created in 1867 it was granted powers of selfgovernment to deal with all internal matters but britain still retained overall legislative supremacy this imperial supremacy could be exercised through several statutory measures in the first place the british north america act of 1867 provided in section 55 that the governor general may reserve any legislation passed by the two houses of parliament for the signification of her majestys pleasure which is determined according to section 57 by the british monarch in council secondly section 56 provides that the governor general must forward to one of her majestys principal secretaries of state in london a copy of any federal legislation that has been assented to then within two years after the receipt of this copy the british monarch in council could disallow an act thirdly at least four pieces of imperial legislation constrained the canadian legislatures the colonial laws validity act of 1865 provided that no colonial law could validly conflict with amend or repeal imperial legislation that either explicitly or by necessary implication applied directly to that colony the merchant shipping act of 1894 as well as the colonial courts of admiralty act of 1890 required reservation of dominion legislation on those topics for approval by the british government also the colonial stock act of 1900 provided for the disallowance of any dominion legislation the british government felt would harm british stockholders of dominion trustee securities most importantly however the british parliament could exercise the legal right of supremacy that it possessed over common law to pass any legislation on any matter affecting the colonies 22for decades none of the dominions were allowed to have its own embassies or consulates in foreign countries all matters concerning international travel commerce etc had to be transacted through british embassies and consulates for example all transactions concerning visas and lost or stolen passports by citizens of the dominions were carried out at british diplomatic offices it was not until the late 1930s and early 1940s that the dominion governments were allowed to establish their own embassies and the first two of these that were established by the dominion governments in ottawa and in canberra were both established in washington d c in the united states as heard later explained the british government seldom invoked its powers over canadian legislation british legislative powers over canadian domestic policy were largely theoretical and their exercise was increasingly unacceptable in the 1870s and 1880s the rise to the status of a dominion and then full independence for canada and other possessions of the british empire did not occur by the granting of titles or similar recognition by the british parliament but by initiatives taken by the new governments of certain former british dependencies to assert their independence and to establish constitutional precedents what is remarkable about this whole process is that it was achieved with a minimum of legislative amendments much of canadas independence arose from the development of new political arrangements many of which have been absorbed into judicial decisions interpreting the constitution—with or without explicit recognition canadas passage from being an integral part of the british empire to being an independent member of the commonwealth richly illustrates the way in which fundamental constitutional rules have evolved through the interaction of constitutional convention international law and municipal statute and case law 22what was significant about the creation of the canadian and australian federations was not that they were instantly granted wide new powers by the imperial centre at the time of their creation but that they because of their greater size and prestige were better able to exercise their existing powers and lobby for new ones than the various colonies they incorporated could have done separately they provided a new model which politicians in new zealand newfoundland south africa ireland india malaysia could point to for their own relationship with britain ultimately  canadas example of a peaceful accession to independence with a westminster system of government came to be followed by 50 countries with a combined population of more than 2billion people 24colonial conference of 1907  editissues of colonial selfgovernment spilled into foreign affairs with the boer war 1899–1902 the selfgoverning colonies contributed significantly to british efforts to stem the insurrection but ensured that they set the conditions for participation in these wars colonial governments repeatedly acted to ensure that they determined the extent of their peoples participation in imperial wars in the military buildup to the first world war the assertiveness of the selfgoverning colonies was recognised in the colonial conference of 1907 which implicitly introduced the idea of the dominion as a selfgoverning colony by referring to canada and australia as dominions it also retired the name colonial conference and mandated that meetings take place regularly to consult dominions in running the foreign affairs of the empire the colony of new zealand which chose not to take part in australian federation became the dominion of new zealand on 26 september 1907 newfoundland became a dominion on the same day the union of south africa was referred to as a dominion upon its creation in 1910 first world war and treaty of versailles  editthe parliamentary recruiting committee produced this first world war poster designed by arthur wardle the poster urges men from the dominions of the british empire to enlist in the war effort the initiatives and contributions of british colonies to the british war effort in the first world war were recognised by britain with the creation of the imperial war cabinet in 1917 which gave them a say in the running of the war dominion status as selfgoverning states as opposed to symbolic titles granted various british colonies waited until 1919 when the selfgoverning dominions signed the treaty of versailles independently of the british government and became individual members of the league of nations this ended the purely colonial status of the dominions the first world war ended the purely colonial period in the history of the dominions their military contribution to the allied war effort gave them claim to equal recognition with other small states and a voice in the formation of policy this claim was recognised within the empire by the creation of the imperial war cabinet in 1917 and within the community of nations by dominion signatures to the treaty of versailles and by separate dominion representation in the league of nations in this way the selfgoverning dominions as they were called emerged as junior members of the international community their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of britain 25irish free state  editthe irish free state set up in 1922 after the angloirish war was the first dominion to appoint a nonbritish nonaristocratic governorgeneral when timothy michael healy took the position in 1922 dominion status was never popular in the irish free state where people saw it as a facesaving measure for a british government unable to countenance a republic in what had previously been the united kingdom of great britain and ireland successive irish governments undermined the constitutional links with britain until they were severed completely in 1949 in 1937 ireland adopted almost simultaneously both a new constitution that included powers for a president of ireland and a law confirming a role for the king in external relations balfour declaration of 1926 and statute of westminster  editthe balfour declaration of 1926 and the subsequent statute of westminster 1931 restricted britains ability to pass or affect laws outside of its own jurisdiction significantly britain initiated the change to complete sovereignty for the dominions the first world war left britain saddled with enormous debts and the great depression had further reduced britains ability to pay for defence of its empire in spite of popular opinions of empires the larger dominions were reluctant to leave the protection of the thensuperpower for example many canadians felt that being part of the british empire was the only thing that had prevented them from being absorbed into the united states until 1931 newfoundland was referred to as a colony of the united kingdom as for example in the 1927 reference to the judicial committee of the privy council to delineate the quebeclabrador boundary full autonomy was granted by the united kingdom parliament with the statute of westminster in december 1931 however the government of newfoundland requested the united kingdom not to have sections 2 to 6 —confirming dominion status —apply automatically to it  until the newfoundland legislature first approved the statute approval which the legislature subsequently never gave in any event newfoundlands letters patent of 1934 suspended selfgovernment and instituted a  commission of government  which continued until newfoundland became a province of canada in 1949 it is the view of some constitutional lawyers  citation needed that—although newfoundland chose not to exercise all of the functions of a dominion like canada—its status as a dominion was suspended in 1934 rather than revoked or abolished canada australia new zealand the irish free state newfoundland and south africa prior to becoming a republic and leaving the commonwealth in 1961 with their large populations of european descent were sometimes collectively referred to as the white dominions 26 today canada

government soon after its founding in 1859 35 but because of ongoing financial dependence on britain western australia became the last australian colony to attain selfgovernment in 1890 36 during the 1890s the colonies voted to unite and in 1901 they were federated under the british crown as the commonwealth of australia by the commonwealth of australia constitution act the constitution of australia had been drafted in australia and approved by popular consent thus australia is one of the few countries established by a popular vote 37 under the balfour declaration of 1926 the federal government was regarded as coequal with and not subordinate to the british and other dominion governments and this was given formal legal recognition in 1942 when the statute of westminster was retroactively adopted to the commencement of the second world war 1939 in 1930 the australian prime minister james scullin reinforced the right of the overseas dominions to appoint nativeborn governorsgeneral when he advised king george v to appoint sir isaac isaacs as his representative in australia against the wishes of the opposition and officials in london the governments of the states

canada § adoption of dominion the term dominion is employed in the constitution act 1867 originally the british north america act 1867  and describes the resulting political union specifically the preamble of the act states whereas the provinces of canada nova scotia and new brunswick have expressed their desire to be federally united into one dominion under the crown of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland with a constitution similar in principle to that of the united kingdom furthermore sections 3 and 4 indicate that the provinces shall form and be one dominion under the name of canada and on and after that day those three provinces shall form and be one dominion under that name accordingly usage of the phrase dominion of canada was employed as the countrys name after 1867 predating the general use of the term dominion as applied to the other autonomous regions of the british empire after 1907 the phrase dominion of canada does not appear in the 1867 act nor in the constitution act 1982 but does appear in the constitution act 1871 other contemporaneous texts and subsequent bills references to the dominion of canada in later acts such as the statute of westminster do not clarify the point because all nouns were formally capitalised in british legislative style indeed in the original text of the constitution act 1867 one and name were also capitalised frank scott theorised that canadas status as a dominion ended when canadian parliament declared war on germany on 9 september 1939 separately and distinctly from the united kingdoms declaration of war six days earlier 38 from the 1950s the federal government began to phase out the use of dominion which had been used largely as a synonym of federal or national such as dominion building for a post office dominionprovincial relations and so on the last major change was renaming the national holiday from dominion day to canada day in 1982 official bilingualism laws also contributed to the disuse of dominion as it has no acceptable equivalent in french while the term may be found in older official documents and the dominion carillonneur still tolls at parliament hill it is now hardly used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces or historically canada before and after 1867 nonetheless the federal government continues to produce publications and educational materials that specify the currency of these official titles 30 39 40defenders of the title dominion —including monarchists who see signs of creeping republicanism in canada—take comfort in the fact that the constitution act 1982 does not mention and therefore does not remove the title and that a constitutional amendment is required to change it 28the word dominion has been used with

until 1919 41 in the 1930s the idea of making british india as it was then called into a dominion – the first one with a noneuropean population – was seriously discussed but ran into serious snags – notably british distrust of indian political leaders and the increasing tensions between hindus and muslims later on  original research pakistan including muslimmajority east bengal forming east pakistan seceded from india at the point of indian independence with the passage of the indian independence act 1947 and ensuing partition resulting in two dominions 42 for india dominion status was

pakistan gained independence from pakistan as bangladesh in 1971 irish free state  ireland  editthe irish free state ireland from 1937 was a british dominion between 1922 and 1949 as established by the irish free state constitution act of the united kingdom parliament on 6 december 1922 the new state—which had dominion status in the likeness of that enjoyed by canada within the british commonwealth of nations —comprised the whole of ireland however provision was made in the act for the parliament of northern ireland to opt out of inclusion in the irish free state which—as had been widely expected at the time—it duly did one day after the creation of the new state on 7 december 1922 44following a plebiscite of the people of the free state held on 1 july 1937 a new constitution came into force on 29 december of that year establishing a successor state with the name of ireland which ceased to participate in commonwealth conferences and events nevertheless the united kingdom and other member states of the commonwealth continued to regard ireland as a dominion owing to the unusual role accorded to the british monarch under the irish external relations act of 1936 ultimately however irelands oireachtas passed the republic of ireland act 1948 which came into force on 18 april 1949 and unequivocally ended irelands links with the british monarch and the commonwealth newfoundland  editthe colony of newfoundland enjoyed responsible government from 1855 to 1934 45 it was among the colonies declared dominions in 1907 following the recommendations of a royal commission parliamentary government was suspended in 1934 due to severe financial difficulties resulting from the depression and a series of riots against the dominion government in 1932 46 in 1949 it joined canada and the legislature was restored 47new zealand  editthe new zealand constitution act 1852 gave new zealand its own parliament general assembly and home rule in 1852 48 in 1907 new zealand was proclaimed the dominion of new zealand 49 new zealand canada and newfoundland used the word dominion in the official title of the nation whereas australia used commonwealth of australia and south africa union of south africa new zealand adopted the statute of westminster in 1947 49 and in the same year legislation passed in london gave new zealand full powers to amend its own constitution in 1986 the new zealand parliament passed the constitution act 1986 which repealed the constitution act of 1852 and the last constitutional links with the united kingdom formally ending its dominion status 50south africa  editthe union of south africa was formed in 1910 from the four selfgoverning colonies of the cape colony natal the transvaal and the orange free state the last two were former boer republics 51 the south africa act 1909 provided for a parliament consisting of a senate and a house of assembly the provinces had their own legislatures in 1961 the union of south africa adopted a new constitution became a republic left the commonwealth and rejoined following end of apartheid rule in the 1990s and became the presentday republic of south africa 52southern rhodesia  editsouthern rhodesia zimbabwe since 1980 coloured red on a map of africa southern rhodesia renamed zimbabwe in 1980 was a special case in the british empire although it was never a dominion it was treated as a dominion in many respects southern rhodesia was formed in 1923 out of territories of the british south africa company and established as a selfgoverning colony with substantial autonomy on the model of the dominions the imperial authorities in london retained direct powers over foreign affairs constitutional alterations native administration and bills regarding mining revenues railways and the governors salary 53southern rhodesia was not one of the territories that were mentioned in the 1931 statute of westminster although relations with southern rhodesia were administered in london through the dominion office not the colonial office when the dominions were first treated as foreign countries by london for the purposes of diplomatic immunity in 1952 southern rhodesia was included in the list of territories concerned this semidominion status continued in southern rhodesia between 1953 and 1963 when it joined northern rhodesia and nyasaland in the central african federation with the latter two territories continuing to be british protectorates when northern rhodesia was given independence in 1964 it adopted the new name of zambia prompting southern rhodesia to shorten its name to rhodesia but britain did not recognise this latter change 53rhodesia unilaterally declared independence from britain in 1965 as a result of the british governments insistence on majority rule as a condition for independence london regarded this declaration as illegal and applied sanctions and expelled rhodesia from the sterling area 54 rhodesia continued with its dominionstyle constitution until 1970 and continued to issue british passports to its citizens the rhodesian government continued to profess its loyalty to the sovereign despite being in a state of rebellion against her majestys government in london until 1970 when it adopted a republican constitution following a referendum the previous year 55 this endured until the states reconstitution as

messageinitially the foreign office of the united kingdom conducted the foreign relations of the dominions a dominions section was created within the colonial office for this purpose in 1907 canada set up its own department of external affairs in june 1909 but diplomatic relations with other governments continued to operate through the governorsgeneral dominion high commissioners in london first appointed by canada in 1880 australia followed only in 1910 and british legations abroad britain deemed her declaration of war against germany in august 1914 to extend to all territories of the empire without the need for consultation occasioning some displeasure in canadian official circles and contributing to a brief antibritish insurrection by afrikaner militants in south africa later that year a canadian war mission in washington d c dealt with supply matters from february 1918 to march 1921 although the dominions had had no formal voice in declaring war each became a separate signatory of the june 1919 peace treaty of versailles which had been negotiated by a britishled united empire delegation in september 1922 dominion reluctance to support british military action against turkey influenced britains decision to seek a compromise settlement diplomatic autonomy soon followed with the u scanadian halibut treaty march 1923 marking the first time an international agreement had been entirely negotiated and concluded independently by a dominion the dominions section of the colonial office was upgraded in june 1926 to a separate dominions office however initially this office was held by the same person that held the office of secretary of state for the colonies the principle of dominion equality with britain and independence in foreign relations was formally recognised by the balfour declaration adopted at the imperial conference of november 1926 canadas first permanent diplomatic mission to a foreign country opened in washington d c in 1927 in 1928 canada obtained the appointment of a british high commissioner in ottawa separating the administrative and diplomatic functions of the governorgeneral and ending the latters anomalous role as the representative of the british government in relations between the two countries the dominions office was given a separate secretary of state in june 1930 though this was entirely for domestic political reasons given the need to relieve the burden on one ill minister whilst moving another away from unemployment policy the balfour declaration was enshrined in the statute of westminster 1931 when it was adopted by the british parliament and subsequently ratified by the dominion legislatures britains declaration of hostilities against nazi germany on 3 september 1939 tested the issue most took the view that the declaration did not commit the dominions ireland chose to remain neutral at the other extreme the conservative australian government of the day led by robert menzies took the view that since australia had not adopted the statute of westminster it was legally bound by the uk declaration of war—which had also been the view at the outbreak of the first world war—though this was contentious within australia between these two extremes new zealand declared that as britain was or would be at war so it was too this was however a matter of political choice rather than legal necessity canada issued its own declaration of war after a recall of parliament as did south africa after a delay of several days south africa on 6 september canada on 10 september ireland which had negotiated the removal of british forces from its territory the year before remained neutral there were soon signs of growing independence from the other dominions australia opened a diplomatic mission in the us in 1940 as did new zealand in 1941 and canadas mission in washington gained embassy status in 1943 from dominions to commonwealth realms  editthis section does not cite any sources please help improve this section

australia initially the dominions conducted their own trade policy some limited foreign relations and had autonomous armed forces although the british government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars however after the passage of the statute of westminster the language of dependency on the crown of the united kingdom ceased where the crown itself was no longer referred to as the crown of any place in particular but simply as the crown arthur berriedale keith in speeches and documents on the british dominions 1918–1931 stated that the dominions are sovereign international states in the sense that the king in respect of each of his dominions newfoundland excepted is such a state in the eyes of international law after then those countries that were previously referred to as dominions became commonwealth realms where the sovereign reigns no longer as the british monarch but as monarch of each nation in its own right and are considered equal to the uk and one another the second world war which fatally undermined britains already weakened commercial and financial leadership further loosened the political ties between britain and the dominions australian prime minister john curtin s unprecedented action february 1942 in successfully countermanding an order from british prime minister winston churchill that australian troops be diverted to defend britishheld burma the 7th division was then en route from the middle east to australia to defend against an expected japanese invasion demonstrated that dominion governments might no longer subordinate their own national interests to british strategic perspectives to ensure that australia had full legal power to act independently particularly in relation to foreign affairs defence industry and military operations and to validate its past independent action in these areas australia formally adopted the statute of westminster in october 1942 57 and backdated the adoption to the start of the war in september 1939 the dominions office merged with the india office as the commonwealth relations office upon the independence of india and pakistan in august 1947 the last country officially made a dominion was ceylon in 1948 the term dominion fell out of general use thereafter ireland ceased to be a member of the commonwealth on 18 april 1949 upon the coming into force of the republic of ireland act 1948 this formally signalled the end of the former dependencies common constitutional connection to the british crown india also adopted a republican constitution in january 1950 unlike many dependencies that became republics ireland never rejoined the commonwealth which agreed to accept the british monarch as head of that association of independent states the independence of the separate realms was emphasised after the accession of queen elizabeth ii in 1952 when she was proclaimed not just as queen of the united kingdom but also queen of canada queen of australia queen of new zealand and of all her other realms and territories etc this also reflected the change from dominion to realm in the proclamation of queen elizabeth ii s new titles in 1953 the phrase of her other realms and territories replaced dominion with another mediaeval french word with the same connotation realm from royaume  thus recently when referring to one of those sixteen countries within the commonwealth of nations that share the same monarch the phrase commonwealth realm has come into common usage instead of dominion to differentiate the commonwealth nations that continue to share the monarch as head of state australia canada new zealand jamaica etc from those that do not india pakistan south africa etc the term dominion is still found in the canadian constitution where it appears numerous times but it is largely a vestige of the past as the canadian government does not actively use it  see canada section  the term realm does not appear in the canadian constitution the generic language of dominion did not cease in relation to the sovereign it was and is used to describe territories in which the monarch exercises sovereignty it also describes a model of governance in newly independent british colonies featuring a westminster parliamentary government and the british monarch as head of state after world war ii britain attempted to repeat the dominion model in decolonizing the caribbean  though several colonies such as guyana and trinidad and tobago maintained their formal allegiance to the british monarch they soon revised their status to become republics britain also attempted to establish a dominion model in decolonizing africa but it too was unsuccessful  ghana the first former colony declared a dominion in 1957 soon demanded recognition as a republic other african nations followed a similar pattern throughout the 1960s nigeria tanganyika uganda kenya and malawi in fact only gambia sierra leone and mauritius retained their dominion status for more than three years 58many distinctive characteristics that once pertained only to dominions are now shared by other states in the commonwealth whether republics independent realms associated states or territories the practice of appointing a high commissioner instead of a diplomatic representative such as an ambassador for communication between the government of a dominion and the british
