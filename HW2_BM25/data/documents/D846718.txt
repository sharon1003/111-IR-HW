the studio segments for the pilot were taped on july 26 2008 to generally favorable reviews citing close following of the uk versions format 16 nbc was expected to have top gear premiere as a midseason replacement in 2009 17jay leno who originally turned down offers to host the show expressed concern in 2008 over whether or not a show like top gear could be successful in america 18 19 in a column published by the sunday times in 2008 leno expressed concern that an american version could lack the critical reviews for which the british version is known 20 the british show is produced for the bbc with public funds while the american show airs on commercial television leno believes that the show may have to worry about offending current and potential sponsors by giving their products poor reviews leading to a compromise in the journalistic integrity and freedom of the original show on december 11 2008 nbc reversed its decision to place the show as a midseason replacement citing concerns about the potential success of a carthemed show in light of the failure of knight rider nbc allowed the bbc to shop it around to cable networks to possibly pick it up 21 in february 2009

as of 2014 the series has been renewed for its fifth season commenting on the second season renewal uk host jeremy clarkson noted top gear is our baby so you can understand why hammond may and i were anxious about passing it on to the presenters of the us show we needn’t have worried because top gear is clearly in safe hands even if they do insist on speaking in those stupid accents watching an episode from series 1 with richard and james we found ourselves in a genuinely heated debate about which of the presenters’ cars was best we were just three ordinary chaps watching a car show and loving it which is exactly what top gear should be bring on series 2 24in a facebook post on june 26 2016 wood stated his belief that the episode set to air the same week would be the last for the

32reception  editbefore the show started there was a mixed response to top gear being remade for a us audience stuart heritage of the guardian noted the brutal response to the first trailer of the history channel version of the show on the internet with you tube users noting historys version to be an insult to the actual top gear among other less favorable comments agreeing with the commenters heritage notes that us television doesnt have  jeremy clarkson captain slow and the hamster  but noting the original bbc version isnt exactly british per se and figured the show could possibly translate easily if done right 33top gear premiered at 19 million viewers in its first episode which dropped to 13 million viewers after the first episode the secondseason premiere had a viewership of 2 million viewers 34 metacritic collected an aggregated score of 72 for season one 35the show has received mixed reviews from numerous critics tim goodman of the hollywood reporter judged the show as a whole noting its a promising beginning for a show most thought would end up in a ditch goodman noted the shaky history of the show being brought over to the us including jay leno s take on the star in a reasonably price car segment for his shortlived show and the venom of online comments to which goodman replies everyone gets it 36 mike hale of the new york times had mixed reactions to the show going from how historys version almost slavishly follows the formula the bbc version uses that any subject or concept can appeal to a wide audience if you find the right balance of competition and destruction the childlike smashing of large objects with humor sentiment and pretty locations to how the show has gaps between the bbc and history channel version hale had concerns the show was not translating well as the history version lacks the going out of the lines aspect of the original and the host lineup for historys version being younger and more callow than the bbc versions hosts 37john krewson of gawker media writing for jalopnik encouraged readers to watch the show watching the first three episodes of season one he noted the first episode would be little strange for most viewers but towards the third episode viewers should have the snack tray full and an hour free and praising the show despite its initial roughness 38 chris shunk writing for autoblog was impressed with the first show but warned readers to not compare historys version of top gear to the bbc version of top gear so easily also the show would encourage autoblog to keep watching at least for nine more weeks 39 lee pray of edmunds inside line noted the show seems worthwhile but while it wont match up the original bbc version it was worth to have two versions of top gear around 40 the a v club gave the show an overall rating of c lamenting that season one of the series ended with a clip show and not liking host adam ferrara the review compared both the bbc and history channel versions and claimed that historys version borrowed the graphics music and editing of the original but that the show felt like it was imported from a 1980s beer commercial 41dvd release  editseason release date
