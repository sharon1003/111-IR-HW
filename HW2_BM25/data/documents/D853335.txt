2007 1000 pmi was planning to visit ireland over spring break easter is march 23 next year so something like march 14 to the 22nd reading the guidebooks i think im mostly interested in the southwest areas dingle kerry galway does it make sense to go that time of year im reading rick steves whos noting that a lot of places are closed until after easter he also notes that while dublin and the cities are just fine year around the landscape outdoors beauty of ireland is a lot less interesting in dreary weather so now im rethinking the wisdom of going in march any insights or advice thanks in

me go through your post1 your guidebooks are correct the dingle kerry galway areas are spectacular your guidebooks are also verry incorrect they are leaving out most of ireland they are leaving out so many counties what a shame there is so much more to be seen in ireland2 easter can be a lovely time to visit if your decide to come here make sure to reserve your accommodation asap the weather can be nice but can also be bad this being ireland who knows some attractions will be closed but easter being the start of the holiday season most will open then3 rick steves is saying that  dublin and the cities are just fine year around the landscape outdoors beauty of ireland is a lot less interesting in dreary weather dreary weather yes we get a lot of that but it makes for wonderful skies green fields rainbows and just different light at all times of day4 the wether ireland is unpredictable at any time of the year it is up to you to make your stay here enjoyable come on were here to help

march  is weather a problem nov 3 2007 453 amfirst bit of advice dump rick steves book guy hasnt a genuine clue about ireland sooo out of date that he really is a hazard to tourists  go for the dorlingkindersley  range of eyewitness books which deals with facts and not 12 baked opinions of chancers have you had a look at tv newspapers of late and seen what is going on in caribbean well im sure lots of the opinionated travel authors would say different to weather reality that has been hurricane noel so forget what everybody tells you in their litle travel guides and be a genuine traveler and takes whats there when you arrive weather last march was fantastic here and yet june july august were terrible your dates will catch paddys weekend so you are guaranteed a lot of craic all around island it makes sense to travel whenever you feel like it and are ready  so go with your own instinct dump the cowboys and make your holiday your private experience and not a carbon copy of someone elses whatever things you are interested in visiting can all be found on web and more and more places generally start to open before paddys  moreso this year as easter is next week after paddys so start searching and let us know how you get on mentioned in this post caribbean north america report inappropriate content doneraile waterford ireland level contributor6414 posts2 reviews save reply4 re ireland in march  is weather a problem nov 3 2007 614 amthe march winds doth blow and we shall have snow well that may be true for scotland northern england and northern ireland but whether it will be true for the rest of is impossible to know i have been at patricks day parades in snow one year i was walking in the parade and we couldnt see the crowds for snow  maybe there were none  so presumably they couldnt see us in rain in that kind of cold thin drizzle thats not quite rain but certainly not sunshine on cold dry grey days and in sunshine funnily enough i dont remember a patricks day when the wind blew so hard it did damage to the parade its more than likely that march will be chilly and dull with a coldish breeze the spring flowers will be starting mostly daffodils there may be a haze of green on the trees but its hard to say  i have passion flowers still in flower in my garden in november as has been pointed out there is a lot more of ireland than the southwest but in march it is likely to be the mildest if also the wettest i think visitors have to get the south west out of their systems on the first visit so i am not going to argue about it  i would say if you really have a choice wait until may but if not go for it there is plenty to see and it could be wet and cool in may too mentioned in this post scotland united kingdom report inappropriate content

baked opinions of chancers well said pkpj clap clap clap ive just come back from killarney  during a potentially dreary time we had much worse weather than the rest of the country unusually but it was still beautiful interestingly some of the spring flowering rhododendrons were flowering in muckross march is the time of spring flowers primroses daffodils tulips bluebells and many more beauties march is also the time when the trees start to grow their leaves once more  and for those of us with a tree pollen allergy  when some of the trees start to flower once more life is what you make of it not what rick steves tells you to make of it you will have a wonderful time and see some spectacular scenery whenever you visit report inappropriate content cavan007cavan destination expertfor county
