august 23 13 430 pm  permalink confusion about 68 time and bpm perhaps this is my lack of formal musical training here but im having a hard time understanding why sonar always calculates tempos in terms of quarter notes im working on a project in 68 time at a tempo of 104 eighth notes or beats per minute but in order for sonar to play at that speed i have to set the bpm to 52 but my understanding is that in a time signature the lower numeral is the beat unit which in the case of 68 is an eighth note so surely for bpm to actually mean beats per minute it should be a measure of how many beats are in a minute a beat being defined as the lower numeral in the time signature cue a real musician to tell me why im wrong james windows 10 sonar splat 64bit intel i74930k 32gb ram rme babyface akai mpk mini roland a800 pro focusrite vrm box komplete 10 ultimate 2012 american telecaster1
