section 6 purchasing  accounts payable policy procedure 6130subject remuneration for research trial participants established date 07012012responsible department disbursement services apoverview the medical university of south carolina musc balances its responsibility to maintain confidentiality of information about human research participants with record keeping requirements of the state of south carolina grantor agencies and the internal revenue service therefore musc has developed a policy that a protects the confidentiality of research participants’ personal identifying information such as name address and social security number to the greatest extent possible b identifies cases in which the total human research participant reimbursement payments per individual per year are likely to exceed the 600 threshold that by law requires reporting of income to tax authorities  and c insures that all research participants are notified that all research participation payments are taxable income musc recognizes that some types of research pose threats of harm to research participants if their identities or research information is made available to anyone other than members of the immediate research team consequently the musc policy also has special procedures to be followed in such cases the policy recognizes that principal investigators pis have a special duty under federal law to protect research participants and that pis are in the best position to know whether total payments per year on a given research study will approach or exceed the 600 per year reporting threshold and whether disclosure of research participants’ personal information to those outside of the immediate research team would pose special risk to participants therefore the musc policy requires pis to serve as “gatekeepers” who must determine when an irs form w9 w9 will be collected from research participants when it will be shared with other musc officials and when special confidentiality procedures should be invoked precluding collection of w9 form information or disclosure of any information about research participants to anyone outside the immediate research team this policy requires all pis to inform all research participants that any payment they receive for research participation is taxable income by providing each participant with a research study payment information document or informed consent document with appropriate language general guidelines payments to individuals for participating in research studies will be recorded as remuneration payment types may include but are not limited to checks petty cash gift certificatescards personal property and other items of value musc has adopted the following procedures to ensure research participant payments are reported in accordance with state and federal income reporting requirements while maintaining an appropriate level of confidentiality the pi will be responsible for informing research participants that the value of any remuneration they receive for participation in research studies is taxable income by providing each participant with a research study payment information document or by inclusion of similar verbiage in the informed consent document the pi will keep a record of all remuneration payments provided to each research participant the study’s schedule of payments should be used to determine if w9s should be collected if the remuneration amount reaches or exceeds 600 within a calendar year for any research participant the pi will send the w9 form for that participant to the musc accounts payable office with a statement of the total amount received by that participant in no case will the w9 form completed by the research participant income forms provided to state or federal tax agencies or income forms provided to the research participant include any information indicating that payment was received for participating in research studies these records will be retained by the pi and kept in a secure location separate from the research data file some research studies deal with extremely sensitive topics that are sufficiently stigmatizing or that pose sufficient risk if participants’ identity personal information or data are disclosed for these research studies the federal government has determined that special confidentiality safeguards are needed to protect research participants’ identity personal information and research data in such cases pis may apply for certificates of confidentiality from the national institutes of health or other federal agencies reimbursed transportation expenses are not reported by musc to the federal government form 1099misc provided documentation is submitted to substantiate the expenses as required under
