credit russell watkins shutterstock the right to privacy refers to the concept that ones personal information is protected from public scrutiny u s justice louis brandeis called it the right to be left alone while not explicitly stated in the u s constitution some amendments provide some protections the right to privacy most often is protected by statutory law for example the health information portability and accountability act hipaa protects a persons health information and the federal trade commission ftc enforces the right to privacy in various privacy policies and privacy statements the right to privacy often must be balanced against the states compelling interests including the promotion of public safety and improving the quality of life seatbelt laws and motorcycle helmet requirements are examples of such laws and while many americans are quite aware that the government collects personal information most say that government surveillance is acceptable constitutional rights the right to privacy often means the right to personal autonomy or the right to choose whether or not to engage in certain acts or have certain experiences several amendments to the u s constitution have been used in varying degrees of success in determining a right to personal autonomy the first amendment protects the privacy of beliefs the third amendment protects the privacy of the home against the use of it for housing soldiers the fourth amendment protects privacy against unreasonable searches the fifth amendment protects against selfincrimination which in turn protects the privacy of personal information the ninth amendment says that the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage other rights retained by the people this has been interpreted as justification for broadly reading the bill of rights to protect privacy in ways not specifically provided in the first eight amendments the right to privacy is most often cited in the due process clause of the 14th amendment which states no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws however the protections have been narrowly defined and usually only pertain to family marriage motherhood procreation and child rearing for example the supreme court first recognized that the various bill of rights guarantees creates a zone of privacy in griswold v connecticut a 1965 ruling that upheld marital privacy and struck down bans on contraception the court ruled in 1969 that the right to privacy protected a persons right to possess and view pornography in his own home justice thurgood marshall wrote in stanley v georgia that  if the first amendment means anything it means that a state has no business telling a man sitting alone in his own house what books he may read or what films he may watch the controversial case roe v wade in 1972 firmly established the right to privacy as fundamental and required that any governmental infringement of that right to be justified by a compelling state interest in roe the court ruled that the states compelling interest in preventing abortion and protecting the life of the mother outweighs a mothers personal autonomy only after viability before viability the mothers right to privacy limits state interference due to the lack of a compelling state interest in 2003 the court in lawrence v texas overturned an earlier ruling and found that texas had violated the rights of two gay men when it enforced a law prohibiting sodomy  countdown 10 milestones in gay rights
