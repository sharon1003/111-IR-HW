if you are energy conscious or just want to save resources it helps to know how much water a typical kitchen faucet uses this allows for accurate planning of water saving measures not all kitchen faucets have the same flow rate however each one is slightly different average kitchen faucet flow rates most faucets today use between 4 to 7 gallons per minute that means if you turn on the faucet and leave it running for an entire minute 4 to 7 gallons of water is used thats a lot of water for most households considering most adults only drink a quart of water a day remember 4 quarts equal 1 gallon measuring flow rates to measure your flow rate simply open the faucet by turning on the handle in most cases this involves pushing up the single lever handle place a gallon container under the faucet and start a stop watch click the stop watch off and write down the number of seconds required to fill the gallon container now divide 60 seconds by that number this is the gallon per minute flow rate of your faucet for instance if it took 15 seconds to fill the container divide 60 by 15 which equals 4 your faucet flow rate is 4 gallons a minute why flow rates differ different faucets simply have different internal parts limiting the amount of water flowing through the faucet spout while some faucets let more water through others allow less the part mainly responsible for this flow rate is the cartridge this is a cylinder inside the faucet handle with inlet holes for the water both hot and cold water flow through the cartridge and mix inside the faucet body to form lukewarm water cold water or really hot water the tinier the holes the less water that flows through it lowflow faucets a lowflow faucet is one that limits the flow of water out of the spout through a special adapter or mechanism in the cartridge this faucet does not affect your homes water pressure and does not change the plumbing in any way the flow regulator is built into the faucet only these faucets allow a flow rate of around 15 gallons per minute that is a big drop from 4 to 7 gallons and the main focus is reducing water consumption show comments related articles how to apply plumbers grease to a shower faucet why does only the kitchen faucet run slowly how to backflush a kitchen faucet how to remove a moen kitchen faucet diverter kitchen sink faucet is not working but the sprayer hose is plumbing why does my faucet run when turned off
