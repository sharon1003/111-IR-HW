ragtime music  its history composers and influences ragtime emerged as a form of music towards the end of the 19th century and this was one of a number of musical styles which had their roots in this time period this increasing diversity resulted from the fusion of african and european musical ideas in the southern states of the u s it wasnt so much a deliberate crafting by music scholars but more the result of experimentation and informal learning by example often by selftaught musicians who played in streets and bars this informal folk music became formalised into ragtime by composers like harney and joplin who played the music to large audiences and published it so that its popularity spread across the country a brief history of ragtime in its purest form ragtime was played as an instrumental on a solo piano an instrument which most honkytonk bars and saloons possessed the word ragtime means syncopated time the main characteristic of these pieces being the right hand playing a syncopated tune while the left hand plays a simple regular line of alternating bass notes and simple chords not unlike the alberti bass used in classical music by the likes of mozart and haydn despite the fact that the right hand syncopations were far in excess of anything produced in classical music the structure of these pieces was nevertheless quite strict in a classical sense they were usual in 24 time and consisted of a number of contrasting 16 bar sections sometimes with a middle trio section with repetitions and returns to previous sections or a da capo return to the begining this structure is similar to the classical form known as a rondo and to various dance forms and marches indeed ragtime may have drawn some inspiration from the military style marches of john philip sousa 18541932 towards the end of each section or phrase there might be rising bass lines changing harmonies or accidentals to give colour and emphasis to the cadences phrase endings ben r harney was one of the first practitioners to bring ragtime to the vaudeville shows in new york an all round entertainer he did much to popularise ragtime allowing it to spread beyond its humble beginings he was closely followed by scott joplin who with the publication of the maple leaf rag had the equivalent of a top ten hit its easy to see why this style became popular the tunes and rhythm are catchy and foottapping the syncopations lively and with humour often poking fun at serious or pretentious music and anyone with a piano could participate joplin continued to lead this new art form producing a large number of piano rags many named after dances such as two steps cake walks and slow drags and even demonstrating that ragtime could be adapted with different time signatures including the 34 waltz time although many performers had a tendency to play ragtime very fast for comic effect joplin frequently indicated on many of his rags that they should be played quite slow or not fast and the piano rolls which he created and left for posterity demonstrated the desired slow tempo such piano rolls are the main audio record of the ragtime era because this was before the days of recorded music instead the commercial aspect of the music business was driven by the supply of sheet music in those days many more homes than today had a piano and so sheet music sales plus live performances were the main source of income for ragtime composers at the time of its inception and for many years afterwards noone realised that the emergence of a new form of music was in itself a culturally important phenomenon and noone thought to document the emergence of ragtime for posterity it wasnt until many decades later that rudi blesh and harriet janis thoroughly researched the subject interviewing surviving ragtime composers pianists and publishers to create their book which has been called the bible of ragtime they all played ragtime was originally published in 1950 and has been reissued and revised since then it is a major source of reference material about ragtime and includes 16 complete scores though currently out of print copies of the book are available at amazoncouk and amazoncom influences and revival of ragtime in song film and computer game musicragtime was an influence on songwriters of the day who wrote songs called rags although they were only loosely based on the conventions of genuine ragtime many of ben r harneys works were songs and among other songwriters there was irving berlin who wrote alexanders ragtime band and everybodys doing it among many other popular songs the composer eubie blake 18871983 published his charleston rag in 1915 but then turned to songwriting with the broadway musical shuffle along which included the song im just wild about harry felix arndt 18891918 a composer of light popular music best known for nola also used elements of ragtime and he was in turn an influence on george gershwin thus it is not an exaggeration to say that ragtime has had an impact on the development of modern songwriting and popular songs now frequently use lots of syncopation in the same way that jazz was later to influence classical composers like ravel ragtime also had an influence on some classical composers one of those was claude debussy who wrote a number of piano pieces in this style including the golliwogs cakewalk while erik satie used fragments of ragtime in his ballet music parade igor stravinsky was also inspired when he left russia and heard jazz and ragtime music in france and as a result he composed his piano rag music though this work is not true ragtime but an impressionistic piece with only subtle hints of ragtime and jazz a small number of ragtime pieces use a musical device called stoptime where the rhythmic pattern of the music seems to pause for a few bars before generally resuming in his ragtime dance subtitled a stop time two step and published in 1902 scott joplin introduces stoptime towards the end of the piece the lefthand rhythm stops and joplin indicates in his score that the pianist should stamp the heel of one foot to maintain the beat the halting motion in his ragtime dance was used to good effect on the soundtrack to the sting joplin later released a piece called stoptime rag which uses footstamping throughout although there are analogues of stoptime in classical music these ragtime works seem to be one of the earliest uses in popular music and stoptime later became an important musical device in jazz and blues music the middle eight and bridge are related structures used frequently in popular music and many ragtime pieces seem to have anticipated this need with a similar device though often 4 bars in duration rather than 8 this middle eight in ragtime music acts like another introduction in the middle of the piece often heralding the final or penultimate section of the music or acting as a short bridge before a return to repeat a previous section ragtime was less popular by the 1920s by which time blues music was gaining in popularity indeed w c handy 18731958 often called the father of blues composed a few ragtime works such as pattona rag and ole miss rag before turning almost exclusively to blues in the 1920s jazz music was also making an impression which unlike ragtime placed an emphasis on improvisation many early jazz pianists such as jelly roll morton 18901941 and fats waller 19041943 also came from a ragtime background and built upon ragtime traditions while introducing new techniques such as a swing rhythm a lot of mortons works are called stomps which seem to develop the concept of stoptime such as his king porter stomp composed in 1905 but not published until many years later pure ragtime was unstoppable however and made a number of comebacks both ragtime and boogiewoogie piano were popularised in the 1950s and 60s by winifred atwell who played and recorded her own versions of various pieces in these styles such as the black and white rag then there was a major revival of fortune for ragtime music when marvin hamlisch used joplins music extensively in the soundtrack to the movie the sting the sting soundtrack included the entertainer as its main theme together with solace and other rags played in the original piano versions or as arrangements more recently the soundtrack to the curious case of benjamin button included another scott joplin piece at the end of the movie called bethena a concert waltz certain film composers have composed new tracks in a ragtime style for their film scores two of the best known examples of this are when john williams used a fusion of alien ragtime jazz and latin for the cantina band music in the original star wars iv a new hope while jerry goldsmith composed the gremlins rag with whacky electronics for the film gremlins and in the world of musicals for stage and film there are set pieces such as the famous herods song from andrew lloyd webber s rock opera jesus christ superstar ragtime music also found a niche providing background music for many early computer games particular those titles involving cartoon characters exploring levels and solving fun puzzles see our article video game music history for more detail sometimes existing ragtime pieces would be employed directly such as on the repton series released for the bbc micro and other platforms the original repton game used george botsfords black and white rag and the sequel repton 2 used scott joplins the chrysanthemum the arcade game ms pacman later converted to nes used a short original ragtime piece for its chase music also on nintendo platforms koji kondo used a lively amalgam of ragtime and calypso styles for his music to the original super mario brothers the super mario brothers theme stayed with the game series in a variety of different arrangements more recently the tv series westworld has used some ragtime music among many other classical and popular tracks for the most part the ragtime is associated with the saloon bar which is in keeping with the origins of the genre so far in series 1 weve spotted pineapple rag peacherine rag and weeping willow rag all by scott

ragtime composers and selected sheet music we list just a few of the better known ragtime exponents and some of their works ben r harney 18721938benjamin robertson harney a white american is sometimes credited as the originator of ragtime that claim is uncertain but he was certainly one of its early practitioners and popularisers and his youve been a good old wagon but you done broke down is thought to be the first published rag in 1895 in 1896 harney moved to new york where in addition to publishing more sheet music he also published the book ben harneys rag time instructor which explained how to turn wellknown melodies into rags he played and sang in several venues in new york and also toured across the usa and the world with his wife and other entertainers performing his vaudeville style show many of his works are not the familiar instrumental ragtime of joplin and others but more like popular songs with a ragtime chorus his works include youve been a good old wagon but you done broke down mister johnston turn me loose i love my honey the cake walk in the sky the only way to keep a gal is to keep her in a cage james scott 18851938james scotts skills as a pianist became obvious when he worked in a music store demonstrating the pianos there some of his own compositions which he played there became very popular and the store owner charles l dumars published his a summer breeze in 1903 scott moved to st louis in 1906 where he met scott joplin who introduced him to his own publisher john stillwell stark who published many of his compositions after the success of frogs legs rag over the next decade or so scott composed a large number of successful ragtime works though once ragtime started to lose its popularity scott became a music teacher and an accompanist for silent movies among his most popular works are a summer breeze on the pike frogs legs rag kansas city rag grace and beauty ragtime oriole honey moon rag joseph f lamb 18871960joseph francis lamb was an american composer of irish descent he was a selftaught pianist with a passion for ragtime music he was purchasing some sheet music by joplin and scott in the new york office of publisher john stark when he met joplin himself joplin was impressed by lambs own ragtime compositions and like he had previously done with james scott he introduced joseph lamb to his regular publisher john stark stark duly published lambs sheet music with sensation being the first to go into publication over the next decade many more rags were published and lamb became one of the big three ragtime composers along with scott joplin and james scott among his works are sensation rag ethiopia rag american beauty rag ragtime nightingale cleopatra rag reindeer rag bohemia rag e j stark 18671962e j stark etilmon justus stark was the son of john stillwell stark the publisher who published many famous pieces by scott joplin and other ragtime composers e j stark was a music instructor at the marmaduke military academy in missouri and then bandmaster at the wentworth military academy where one of his first compositions was the w m a cadets march in 1898 he went on to compose a number of ragtime works which were published by his father including kyrene 1903 sometimes published as classical rag because it uses techniques associated with classical music such as counterpoint his later billiken rag 1913 also featured some classical elements he also supported his fathers business helping transcribe ragtime works by composers who couldnt notate their own works and by making arrangements of others ragtime pieces his ragtime orchestrations collectively given the knickname the red back book due to its colour were many years later the inspiration for director george roy hill who then asked marvin hamlisch to arrange the entertainer and other pieces for his movie the sting since stark survived into his 90s his knowledge of the major contributors to ragtime became a key input to the book they all played ragtime by blesh and janis trombone johnsen ragtime cakewalk kyrene brainstorm rag  using the pseudonym bud manchester clover blossom rag  again as bud manchester billiken rag tom turpin 18711922tom turpin thomas million john turpin was born in georgia as an adult he became something of an entrepreneur opening and managing saloon bars in both missouri and st louis these bars were substantial businesses supporting different forms of entertainment and were typically locations where pianists and early ragtime players congregated to show off their latest works turpin started to compose himself and his harlem rag is credited as the first published rag by an africanamerican in 1897 though it was composed in 1892 in between his various business ventures he continued to compose rags on an intermittent basis including the following harlem rag a ragtime nightmare st louis rag the buffalo rag siwash an indian rag  unpublished panam rag fred s stone 18731912fred s stone frederick st clair stone was born in canada and his family moved across to detroit and became u s citizens when fred was a boy fred and his older brothers charles and william were musicians and played various brass instruments in various bands in the detroit area fred started composing at the age of 18 and published several marches waltzes and other dances his first ragtime success was ma ragtime baby which was originally published in 1898 as a piano instrumental and then quickly republished as a song with lyrics provide by his brother charles it would appear that detroit was a centre for new music long before it was called motown and fred was active playing conducting and arranging for local bands while continuing to publish ragtime pieces including bosn rag in 1899 sue in 1902 belle of the philippines in 1903 and belinda in 1905 stone was also an active participant in the black musicians union in detroit but he died in 1912 in an unfortunate accident

belinda george botsford 18741949george botsford was another american composer who helped to pioneer ragtime with his first publication being the katy flyer cake walk in 1899 he was born in south dakota and grew up in iowa where he received a formal musical education and gained experience as a performer he published both ragtime and nonragtime works with his most famous piece being the black and white rag which he published in 1908 although this work was popular in many decades it became wellknown in the uk when it was used as the theme tune to the snooker television programme pot black another popular work was the grizzly bear rag which became a song when irving berlin added lyrics to it using animal names for music and songs was popular at the time and this is when the turkey trot and fox trot originated botsford moved to new york and worked in tin pan alley as a successful bandleader and arranger black and white rag sailing down the chesapeake bay chatterbox rag grizzly bear

then scott joplin is known as the king of ragtime though in both cases these labels were part of their own publicity certainly scott joplin is the bestknown of all ragtime composers he had the 19th century equivalent of a chart hit with his sheet music for the maple leaf rag and published many more hits after that he was the most ambitious ragtime composer who wanted ragtime to be viewed as equal to classical music he wove ragtime into a number of serious musical forms including his opera treemonisha but that failed to live up to his expectations long after his death it was also joplins music which spearheaded a revival of interest in ragtime during the 1970s due mainly to the entertainer being used as the theme music for the movie the sting on mfiles there is a dedicated scott

rag the cascades ferdinand jelly roll morton 18901941ferdinand mortons early musical development was similar to many early ragtime composers he started working from age 14 as a pianist in a brothel where he adopted the knickname jelly roll he began touring initially as a pianist playing his own compositions and then later formed and toured with jazz groups such as the red hot peppers his early music is closely related to ragtime but he was one of several musicians who developed ragtime music in new directions and helped to build the foundations of early jazz although many of his piano compositions date from around 1905 onwards he initially didnt publish his music to prevent it being played by other performers his first music publications date from 1915 and he left both piano rolls and early recordings of his playing among his compositions are new orleans blues mamanita frogimore rag king porter stomp jelly roll blues wolverine blues kansas city stomp mr jelly roll morton was one of several composers who claimed to have composed the tiger rag or hold that tiger which became a standard for jazz bands irving berlin 18881989irving berlin was an american composer and songwriter of jewish russian origin he was certainly not a true ragtime composer like scott joplin but he incorporated the syncopation of ragtime into popular song to become one of americas best known composers his first big hit in 1911 even mentioned ragtime  it was of course alexanders ragtime band in a way he softened the strict form of ragtime to create accessible and popular song forms often performed as a dance which caught the public appeal at a time when recorded music was becoming more common there is some controversy about the melody in alexanders ragtime band scott joplin felt that berlin had taken the idea from a real slow drag a song from his opera tremonisha he showed berlin the score but berlin went ahead and published his song anyway and then joplin revised his real slow drag so that people would not accuse him of stealing from berlin nevertheless though he wasnt a ragtime composer berlin kept the idea of ragtime in the public consciousness and alexanders ragtime band became a musical in 1938 and the song was also used in the musical theres no business like show business in 1954 ragtime era infographics an infographic is available which illustrates the ragtime era

wall biographical note although my piano teacher tended to disapprove of anything nonclassical as a boy i discovered and enjoyed various nonclassical forms of music one of those discoveries was a sheet music book of ragtime which included the black and white rag and other items this was before the ragtime revival triggered by the sting so i feel as though i discovered ragtime before everyone else there is something about that era which is so appealing fortunes and reputations where there for the taking and the music was so informal and inclusive everyone with a piano could join in of course ive tried writing my own ragtime music and heres a piece on soundcloud which i wrote back in 1999 called ragtime for bedtime the sheet music is available on score exchange author jim paterson
