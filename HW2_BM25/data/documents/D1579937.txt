age 65 retirement the german precedent germany became the first nation in the world to adopt an oldage social insurance program in 1889 designed by germanys chancellor otto von bismarck the idea was first put forward at bismarcks behest in 1881 by germanys emperor william the first in a groundbreaking letter to the german parliament william wrote    those who are disabled from work by age and invalidity have a wellgrounded claim to care from the state one persistent myth about the german program is that it adopted age 65 as the standard retirement age because that was bismarcks age in fact germany initially set age 70 as the retirement age and bismarck himself was 74 at the time and it was not until 27 years later in 1916 that the age was lowered to 65 by that time bismarck had been dead for 18 years otto von bismarck the origins of the retirement age in social security by the time america moved to social insurance in 1935 the german system was using age 65 as its retirement age but this was not the major influence on the committee on economic security ces when it proposed age 65 as the retirement age under social security this decision was not based on any philosophical principle or european precedent it was in fact primarily pragmatic and stemmed from two sources one was a general observation about prevailing retirement ages in the few private pension systems in existence at the time and more importantly the 30 state oldage pension systems then in operation roughly half of the state pension systems used age 65 as the retirement age and half used age 70 the new federal railroad retirement system passed by congress earlier in 1934 also used age 65 as its retirement age taking all this into account the ces planners made a rough judgment that age 65 was probably more reasonable than age 70 this judgment was then confirmed by the actuarial studies the studies showed that using age 65 produced a manageable system that could easily be made selfsustaining with only modest levels of payroll taxation so these two factors a kind of pragmatic judgment about prevailing retirement standards and the favorable actuarial outcome of using age 65 combined to be the real basis on which age 65 was chosen as the age for retirement under social security with all due respect to chancellor bismarck he had nothing to do with it
