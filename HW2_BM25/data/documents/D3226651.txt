what is cloud computing cloud computing allows businesses to access shared resources and applications through an internet connection the services and applications are usually offered on a pay per use model this means that users pay only for what they consume and are not burdened with the responsibility and overheads required to manage the servers and applications onsite this makes cloud computing a highly attractive offering for a business looking to reduce costs whilst increasing functionality and mobility there are many variants of cloud computing including software as a service storage as a service infrastructure as a service platform as a service security as a service database as a service what is fibre optic fibre optic is the fastest and latest broadband connection available it is a group of transparent fibres typically made of glass allowing a higher speed of data transfer over a larger distance than the traditional wired infrastructure fibre optic connections are bonded together by splicing and suffer minimal electromagnetic interference making them an ideal medium to carry voice and data transmissions what is a virtual private network vpn virtual private networking allows a business to securely connect multiple branch offices and remote sites connecting branch offices together allows businesses to share applications and information through highly secure and encrypted tunnels across the globe what is failover failover provides redundancy to businesses requiring optimal uptime automated failover ensures that in the event of a network connectivity failure the appropriate systems and servers automatically switch to the alternate medium ensuring business continuity what is fax over ip foip fo ip fax over internet protocol is the transformation of a fax call into a digital packet which is sent through the internet as opposed to the traditional analogue pstn public switched telephony network the fax transmission is then delivered as either a standard fax call to a fax machinemultifunction printer or digitally via email what is broadband broadband is a signalling method used to carry a wide band of frequencies when the bandwidth is broader more information can be carried on a channel broadband is ideal for carrying large volumes of data streaming video gaming and carrying voice traffic traditional dialup connections are very slow and block a phone line whilst connected whereas broadband is always on with no need to reconnect once logged off broadband is available through various mediums including fibre optic wireless digital subscriber lines dsl and even satellite what is voice over ip voip vo ip voice over internet protocol is the transformation of voice calls into digital packets which are sent through the internet as packets of data as opposed to the traditional analogue pstn public switched telephony network the digital packets are then decoded by a carrier grade switch back into a voice stream and delivered through the appropriate network provider to the end user how can cloud computing benefit my business cloud computing is the answer for a company looking for innovative ways to optimise and reduce costs without introducing security threats and risk software as a service saa s allows a business to access economies of scale achieved through shared infrastructure sme organisations can now utilise technologies that were historically too expensive to deploy at a fraction of the cost including hosted business email online file storage and automated cloud backups cloud computing affords companies the opportunity to eliminate the need for onsite infrastructure therefore decreasing operating and management overheads
