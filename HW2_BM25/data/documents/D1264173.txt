astronomical and night are indicated by the color bands from yellow to gray the transitions to and from daylight saving time are indicated by the dst labels humidity we base the humidity comfort level on the dew point as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin thereby cooling the body lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid unlike temperature which typically varies significantly between night and day dew point tends to change more slowly so while the temperature may drop at night a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night the chance that a given day will be muggy in reno is essentially constant during march remaining around 0 throughout humidity comfort levels in march the percentage of time spent at various humidity comfort levels

year round based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from january 1 1980 to december 31 2016 temperature and dew point there are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in reno for each station the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and reno according to the international standard atmosphere and by the relative change present in the merra2 satelliteera reanalysis between the two locations the estimated value at reno is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between reno and a given station the stations contributing to this reconstruction are renotahoe international airport 79 6 kilometers southeast reno stead airport 17 16 kilometers north and truckee tahoe airport 43 36 kilometers southwest other data all data relating to the suns position eg sunrise and sunset are computed using astronomical formulas from the book astronomical tables of the sun moon and planets by jean meeus all other weather data including cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction and solar flux come from nasas merra2 modernera retrospective analysis this reanalysis combines a variety of widearea measurements in a stateoftheart global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50kilometer grid land use data comes from the global land cover share database published by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations elevation data comes from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm published by nasas jet propulsion laboratory names locations and time zones of places

data is prone to errors outages and other defects we assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site we draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the merra2 modelbased reconstructions for a number of important data series while having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness these reconstructions 1 are based on computer models that may have modelbased errors 2 are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates and 3 have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas especially small islands we further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader
