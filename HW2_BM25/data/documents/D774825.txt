from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search the zspread zsprd zerovolatility spread or yield curve spread of a mortgagebacked security mbs is the parallel shift or spread over the zerocoupon treasury yield curve required for discounting a predetermined cash flow schedule to arrive at its present market price the zspread is also widely used in the credit default swap cds market as a measure of credit spread that is relatively insensitive to the particulars of specific corporate or government bonds since the zspread uses the entire yield curve to value the individual cash flows of a bond it provides a more realistic valuation than an interpolated yield spread based on a single point of the curve such as the bonds final maturity date or weightedaverage life however the zspread does not incorporate variability in cash flows so a fuller valuation of an interestrate dependent security often requires the more realistic and more complicated optionadjusted spread contents  hide 1 definition2 example3 benchmark for cds basis4 see also5 references definition  editfor mortgagebacked securities a projected prepayment rate tends to be stated for example the psa assumption for a particular mbs might equate a particular group of mortgages to an 8year amortizing bond with 6 mortality per annum this gives a single series of nominal cash flows as if the mbs were a riskless bond if these payments are discounted to net present value npv with a riskless zerocoupon treasury yield curve the sum of their values will tend to overestimate the market price of the mbs this difference arises because the mbs market price incorporates additional factors such as liquidity and credit risk and embedded option cost the zspread of a bond is the number of basis points bp or 001 that one needs to add to the treasury yield curve or technically to treasury forward rates  so that the npv of the bond cash flows using the adjusted yield curve equals the market price of the bond including accrued interest  the spread is calculated iteratively example  editassume that on 712008 a bond has three future cash flows 5 on 712009 5 on 712010 105 on 712011 the corresponding zerocoupon treasury rates  compounded semiannually are 45 for 712009 47 for 712010 50 for 712011 the bonds accrued interest is 0 the zspread is 50 bp then the price p of this bond on 712008 is given by p9850where for simplicity the calculation has ignored the slight difference between parallel shifts of spot rates and forward rates benchmark for cds basis  editthe zspread is widely used as the cash benchmark for calculating the cds basis the cds basis is commonly the cds fee minus the zspread for a fixedrate cash bond of the same issuer and maturity for instance if a corporations 10year cds is trading at 200 bp and the zspread for the corporations 10year cash bond is 287 bp then its 10year cds basis is â€“87 bp see also  editispread optionadjusted spread references  editfrank j fabozzi the handbook of fixed income securities 7th edition mc grawhill 2005  hidev t e bond market bond debenture fixed income types of bonds by issuer agency bond corporate bond senior debt subordinated debt distressed debt emerging market debt government bond municipal bond types of bonds by payout accrual bond auction rate security callable bond commercial paper contingent convertible bond convertible bond exchangeable bond extendible bond fixed rate bond floating rate note highyield debt inflationindexed bond inverse floating rate note perpetual bond puttable bond reverse convertible securities zerocoupon bond bond valuation clean price convexity coupon credit spread current yield dirty price duration ispread mortgage yield nominal yield optionadjusted spread riskfree bond weightedaverage life yield curve yield spread yield to maturity zspread securitized products assetbacked security collateralized debt obligation collateralized mortgage obligation commercial mortgagebacked security mortgagebacked security bond options callable bond convertible bond embedded option exchangeable bond extendible bond puttable bond institutions commercial mortgage securities association cmsa international capital market association icmasecurities industry and financial markets association sifmacategories bonds finance fixed income analysis
