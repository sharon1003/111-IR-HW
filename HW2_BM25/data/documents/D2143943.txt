climate produces a characteristic climax association of plants and animals the term biome usually refers to terrestrial habitats on land in north america there are about six major biomes aquatic ecosystems such as the ocean are often subdivided into different zones such as the intertidal pelagic benthic photic and aphotic zones plant community an assemblage or association of certain dominant indicator species occupying a given region in california the desert biome consists of several different plant communities such as the creosote bush scrub shadscale scrub sagebrush scrub joshua tree woodland and pinyonjuniper woodland the local chaparral and coastal sage scrub plant communities surrounding palomar college are condidered part of an arid desert biome some general biology textbooks have added a seventh biome called the shrubland biome to encompass these brushy habitats chaparral a plant community composed of dense impenetrable shrubby vegetation adapted to a mediterranean climate with winterwet and summerdry seasons the plant community is welldeveloped in the mountains of san diego county following periodic brush fires many of the shrub species resprout from subterranean lignotubers see article about ashes to wildflowers coastal sage scrub a plant community similar to the chaparral but typically found at lower elevations generally below 2000 feet it is dominated by aromatic coastal sagebrush  artemisia californica and black sage  salvia mellifera  and is common in the hills bordering palomar college unfortunately this plant community is prime land for developers and is rapidly being replaced by housing developments in san diego county it is now 2001 considered to be an endangered threatened plant community in southern california shrubs of the coastal sage scrub are adapted to the long dry summers in several ways remaining dormant throughout the dry season they may lose 80 of their water during this time they may drop many of their brittle shriveled leaves or produce smaller leaves on secondary shoots root systems are generally shallow because the plants are inactive much of the time it is relatively easy to clear away desiccated shrubs with a heavy hoe during the summer drought season compared with wellanchored shrubs of true chaparral the oily resinous leaves also help to conserve vital moisture but increase their flammability the dominant shrubs are fire adapted with seeds that readily germinate after fire this also includes numerous species of post burn wildflowers that bloom in profusion following the winter and spring rains unlike scattered laurel sumac  malosma laurina and lemonade berry  rhus integrifolia  the dominant semiwoody shrubs mostly artemisia salvia  eriogonum lack lignotubers and rely on seeds for regeneration after fire these shrubs are vulnerable to excessive or poorlytimed fires particularly when competing with naturalized grasses and other weedy species the common vine throughout the coastal sage scrub called wild cucumber  marah macrocarpus sprouts soon after fires from a large subterranean caudex under ideal natural conditions complete recovery of coastal sage scrub after a fire is about 15 to 20 years ecosystem all of the organisms in a natural community or biome plus all of the associated environmental factors with which they interact the term ecosystem could actually be applied to any of the terrestrial biomes or plant communities for example the tundra biome could also be referred to as tundra ecosystem the chaparral plant community could also be referred to as the chaparral ecosystem the term ecosystem is wellsuited for aquatic communities such as ponds lakes streams and even the ocean in fact oceanography is the study of the ocean ecosystem including ocean topsoil and atmosphere the earth is a large complex ecosystem called the biosphere however in terms of the vast universe it is but a mere dot a selfcontained spaceship in which gasses and waste are recycled may also be thought of as an ecosystem biosphere earth ecosystem the zone of atmosphere land and water at the surface of the earth occupied by living things in grave danger by the effects of humans including overpopulation pollution and exploitation environment the sum total of physical and biotic factors that surround an organism or population of organisms ecology the study of the interrelationships between plants and animals and their environment the term environment includes the sum total of physical and biotic conditions and influences that surround an organism or population of organisms1 tundra biome alpine tundra in the rocky mountains of colorado evergreen trees cannot survive the harsh winters of tundra with severe iceladen winds frozen soil permafrost and intense uv radiation this biome dominated by thickrooted perennials and prostrate shrubs2 coniferous forest biome timberline in the rocky mountains of colorado showing the striking transition ecotone between the alpine tundra and coniferous forest biomes engelmann spruce at timberline become dwarfed and windswept by the iceladen winds the zone of timberline trees is called krummholz a german word meaning crooked wood trees cannot survive in the frozen soil permafrost of the tundra instead this region is dominated by thickrooted perennials and prostrate deciduous shrubs the coniferous forest biome includes many different forest communities left the red fir forest in the sierra nevada of california is dominated by the red fir  abies magnifica var magnifica  right the western slopes of the sierra nevada also include forests of white fir  abies concolor and giant sequoia  sequoiadendron giganteum 3 prairie biome vast herds of bison once grazed the north american prairie from the rocky mountains to the mississippi river by the end of the 1800s these magnificent animals were pushed to the brink of extinction by buffalo hunters today they survive in preserves such as the national bison range in montana during the glacial periods rich topsoils from northern latitudes were deposited here perennial grasses are welladapted to this arid region with hot dry summers hard sunbaked soils and periodic grassland fires4 deciduous forest biome sassafras  sassafras albidum is a beautiful tree native to the deciduous forest biome of the eastern united states it is readily identified by its large threelobed leaves sassafras oil is obtained from the roots and is used in carbonated beverages teas medicines and perfumes5 desert biome the north american desert biome includes several different vegetation types or plant communities left a saguaro woodland  carnegiea gigantea in the sonoran desert of southern arizona right a joshua tree woodland  yucca brevifolia in the mojave desert of california these plant communities are dominated by drought resistant trees and shrubs and numerous species of cacti with spinecovered succulent stems containing water storage tissue shadscale scrub a california plant community dominated by lowgrowing species of saltbush including atriplex confertifolia and a hymenelytra this vegetation type is sometimes called a c4 community because some of the dominant members exhibit c4 photosynthesis plants with c4 photosynthesis are photosynthetically efficient even during the hot summer months when many c3 species become dormant see c4 photosynthesis in the purslane family stem adaptations of the cactus family cactaceae6 tropical rain forest biome the tropical rain forest contains tall trees draped with epiphytes and vines in the left photo a large sea heart vine  entada gigas connects the limbs of two adjacent trees in costa rica this vine is known as escalera de mono or monkey ladder and actual forms arboreal thoroughfares for monkeys high in the rain forest canopy along the edge of the forest where there is abundant sunlight the sea heart vines completely cover their support trees center the right photo shows how the rain forest is rapidly being cut down to provide more agricultural land unfortunately the soil is poor and only supports crops for a few years the aerial roots of strangler figs are a conspicuous element of tropical rain forests left ficus citrifolia in the u s virgin islands island of st john right ficus cotinifolia in the yucatan peninsula of mexico in both photographs the host tree has been shaded out and killed by the strangler fig7 urban sprawl aerial view of san diego on the approach to the international airport lindbergh field this dense mass of congested buildings and concrete is a good example of an urbanized human community during the last three decades of the 20th century numerous grassy hillsides in coastal san diego county were converted into high density housing tracts some of these grassland habitats on thick clay soils contained an abundance of rare and endangered wildflowers red arrow such as the striking chocolate lily  fritillaria biflora  see some beautiful southern
