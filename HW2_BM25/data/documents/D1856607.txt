november 6 2015 1016 am adele’s 25probably isn’t going to sell as many copies as21 and it doesn’t matter by lauretta charlton follow laurettaland share tweet share email photo jason merrittgetty images last month adele finally revealed that her new album 25 will be released on november 20 nearly five years after 21 broke all sorts of sales records well more like smashed them 21 was the first album since thriller to hold the top spot on billboard ’s yearend album chart for two consecutive years it has sold over 30 million copies globally and is the only album in the last decade to earn a diamond certification — meaning over 10 million u s copies sold — in less than two years after 240 weeks it still regularly outsells much newer releases like ariana grande’s my everything for comparison taylor swifts 1989 presumably the secondbestselling album of the 2010s so far has sold roughly half as many copies in the u s in under five years and in an age when physicalalbum sales drop every year 21 is one of the bestselling albums of all time related stories adele’s new song ‘hello’ is finally here in ‘hello’ adele can’t be bothered with modern technology this means of course that the sales of 25 will be a big part of the narrative around the record already the projections “are absolutely insane ” and “ the only suspense about 25 right now is over just how big it will be ” can adele  save the record industry  which is depending on 25 to boost fourthquarter sales she’s off to a good start with both new and old metrics the first single “hello” debuted at no 1 on the billboard hot 100 and setthe singleday u s record for downloads and streams in one week and over 1 million sales for the album in its first week are “ a lock ” “ the expectations are incredibly high” says keith caulfield codirector of charts at billboard “it’s doing so well based on preorders that people are asking themselves ‘okay how big can this album possibly get’”25 is going to sell millions of copies but it’s unlikely to match the sales of 21 — because almost nobody has ever been able to top that kind of success if the sales even come close it won’t be for years — the slow burn after a bigstar moment is what makes sales feats like 21 even possible in this age adele herself seems to be aware of this “it’s a writeoff to expect anything close” she told bbc radio 1 dj nick grimshaw last week it was phenomenal what happened but it was a phenomenon “only a handful of albums have been able to do what 21 did” caulfield said “if you compare them then it becomes the story of ‘oh it didn’t do what 21 did’ and therefore someone might see that as a failure”it wouldn’t be the first time something like this has happened the list of albums that have been deemed failures or “relative flops” for not living up to their predecessors’ megasales is long — and the pressure suffered by artists trying to match themselves is intense alanis morissette’s jagged little pill sold 15 million copies in the u s but morissette suffered anxiety attacks after backlash from fans and media the followup the hypnotic supposed former infatuation junkie sold less than a fifth of that and despite its platinum status is still considered a “ disappointment ” fleetwood mac famously took 13 months andspent 1 million plus unknown cocaine bills to record tusk the followup to the 20 millionselling rumors the brilliant but defiantly weird album hit no 4 in the u sand sold “just” 2 million copies bruce springsteen seemed to deliberately follow the diamondcertified born in the u s a with an introspective album tunnel of love that could never hope to be as big even with its paltry 3 million in sales it’s remembered as the album that paled in comparison  more recently lady gaga’s artpop was plagued by scurrilous rumors of poor sales before it was even released the ultimate flop right sure especially if you’re measuring it against the massive success of 2011’s born this way even michael jackson couldn’t avoid this trap thriller has sold over 65 million copies worldwide the king of pop himself said that if the followup bad didn’t match that same level of success it would be a failure and that it needed to be “ as perfect as humanly possible ” he was so consumed by the process that he wrote over 60 songs and considered releasing 33 of them as a triple album until quincy jones talked him out of it jackson angled for an unprecedented 100 million in sales bad sold nowhere near that number and to this day has only sold approximately half as many copies as thriller but that’s still good enough to make it one of the bestselling records of all time the salesexpectations game can overshadow the actual music which is why it’s best not to think of records like thriller and 21 as normal albums at all they’re more like cultural events — or phenomena as adele put it — that are powered by multiple charttopping singles jewel’s 12 millionselling pieces of you had three consistent sales hootie  the blowfish’s cracked rear view sold 16 million but took five years to go diamond  and masscultural moments that help sustain the public’s interest  thriller ’s iconic bigbudget 13minute music video more than doubled album sales even though it was the seventh and final single adele ’s appearance at the 2012 grammys a year after 21 came out increased sales by 207 percent the boxoffice success of alan parker’s animated film and laser light shows that continue to this day helped pink floyd’s the wall  in other words there’s an element of luck a catching of cultural lightning in a bottle to selling this many records of course none of this means its impossible for 25 to do as well as 21 — after all at a time when both album sales and singles sales were going down 21 kept going up — it would just be very rare think of it this way acdc only has one back in black 22 million and bruce springsteen only has one born in the u s a 15 million subsequent albums often bolster the sales of these classics but they rarely — if ever — outdo them a few exceptions do come to mind chris molanphy the popchart columnist for slate points out “whitney houston for example her debut album sold something like 14 million copies in america and then the bodyguard soundtrack yet another example of an event album that tapped into the zeitgeist at the right time sold a similar number so she came back it’s possible when you have a massive hit to repeat that success” ditto eminem both the marshall mathers lp and the eminem show sold over 10 million copies adele herself seems pretty grounded about the pressure recently telling rolling stone that she doesn’t follow what’s on the charts or in popular culture if she’s been cracking up with anxiety over expectations for 25 we’ve yet to hear about it maybe the rest of us could take a cue from her and remember the sales of 25 do not determine its success or failure the music does
