science  mathematics chemistry does a saturated solution contain precipitate equilibrium i guess i dont know what a saturated solution is very well but does it have precipitate in them i think they dosince the dissolved ions in the solution have to be at equilibrium with the undissolved thats precipitate but on my chem lab intro which i didnt write it it reads that ksp show more follow 3 answers answers relevance rating newest oldest best answer when discussing ksp there must be dissolved solute in equilibrium with the solid phase the solution is saturated when a solution is saturated the solid phase is in equilibirum with the dissolved solute so the answer to your question is yes there will be undissociated solid present in a saturated solution for example a sparingly soluble salt in contact with water maintains an equilibrium between the solid and its ions in simple cases where there are no common ions or competing equilibria the ion concentrations depend only on the equilibrium constant for the particular salt when we talk about solubility equilibria we always write the equilibrium with the solid on the left for example ba io32 s  ba2 aq  2 io3 aq we could write the equilibrium constant for this reaction as keq  ba2  io32  ba io32  the equilibrium constant expression for an insoluble salt is written following the same rules as for any other equilibrium because so very little of it dissolves the number of moles of solid barium iodate per liter of water is the same at the start of the reaction as at equilibrium since ba io32  is a constant it has no effect on the equilibrium and can be incorporated into the equilibrium constant for the reaction the equilibrium constant is called the solubility product ksp ksp  ba2  io32 the above example comes from httpwwwchemicoolcomdefinitionsolu  follow up  but the bottom line is this in order to have an equilibrium based on the solubility of an insoluble compound ksp there must be present both the dissolved compound and undissolved compound it is impossible to have an equilibrium without both species presentpisgahchemist · 9 years ago0 0 comment generally speaking a saturated solution is one that cannot dissolve any more solute into the solvent now consider this scenario you make a saturated solution of glucose at 25°c you ensure that it is saturated because there is a little undissolved excess glucose at the bottom of the container now you very carefully withdraw a volume of the saturated solution and transfer it to another container if the temperature is maintained at 25°c all is well but imagine that the temperature ingreases to 28°c do you still have a saturated solution no because the solubility of the glucose is higher at 28°c than at 25°c conversely should the temperature drop to 22°c the glucose solution becomes oversaturated and the excess glucose will precipitate out of solution so the safe course of action is to make a solution of sufficiently high concentration that there is always a little undissolved solute at the bottom of the container if any small chamges in temperature do occur up or down the solution will always be saturated and you are sure of this by seeing the undissolved excess solute at the bottom of the container as far ksp is concerned this is always quoted at a specific temperature usually 25°c ksp refers of course to very sparingly soluble substances such as ag cl but what i have said above in reference to glucose applies equally well to ag cl when you have to determine the ksp experimentally you have a saturated solution with the very small amount of ag cl in solution and some undissolved ag cl in the container you ensure that the saturtaed solution is thoroughly mixed and the precipitate of ag cl has all settled out and then you carefully remove the saturated solution above the precipitate for analysis if there is no precipitate visible at the bottom of the container you cannot be sure that the solution is saturated trevor h · 9 years ago0 0 comment no in order to have any type of solution saturated or unsaturated the solvent must be soluble if the solvent is not soluble it is a precipitate a saturated solution is a solution that is so full of solvent that it cannot dissolve any more solvent precipitates such as barium sulfate cannot dissolve in water because the polarity of water molecules is not strong enough to dissociate the barium sulfate into barium and sulfate ions spencer · 9 years ago1 1 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these best home security system find email marketing software online education an option how does cloud computing work
