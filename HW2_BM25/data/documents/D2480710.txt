science  mathematics physics what is the radiation frequency of the sunat what frequency does the sun radiate energy thanks 4 ure time follow 1 answer answers best answer the sun radiates energy at a distribution of frequencies otherwise you wouldnt see a white color when you look at the sun and it would appear one monochromatic color such as red yellow green or blue observe this picture httpwwwandorcomimagelibloresint the smooth curve is the theoretical black body radiation curve of a black body at the suns temperature of 5800 kelvin the data plot discusses the actual emissions measured from the sun you notice by observing the peak of the graph that the color of maximum emission has wavelength of about 500 nm actually there is a law called weins law which relates black body temperature to brightest wavelength lambdamaxt  2898106 nanometerskelvin solving this we also end up with lambdamax  500 nm to what frequency does 500 nm correspond use the relation between frequency and wavelength which is lambdaf  speed of light this results in 600 terahertz which is the frequency of green light this is no coincidence that green light at the center of our visible light rainbow and is also the maximum frequency of the suns emissions our eyes evolved to see the colors most abundant on earth due to the sun because those were the important colors for humans to see in order to survive had we evolved on a planet next to the star proxima centauri which appears red to us green light would have a frequency of 310 terahertz which is infrared as earth humans see it had we evolved on a planet next to the star rigel which appears blue to us green light would have a frequency of 114 petahertzgintable Â· 8 years ago1 0 comment askers rating maybe you would like to learn more about one of these looking for a new chandelier need a home security safe look for an accident attorney need a small business loan
