since i had everything else off for rebuilding i decided to rebuild my trimtilt cylinders as well they tended to leak down when they were hot so i figured they needed new seals the kit cost 25 one for each cylinder i ordered them from my local bombardieromc dealer the first step is to relieve the pressure in the trim system i ran the tilt all the way up or to the point where the rods are fully extended i have a cobra drive so i have a relief valve on the side of the trim pump i turned that all the way out until it caught on the cclip once thats done i carefully removed both trim lines from each cylinder and let them drain into a pan they drained for a while after that was done i removed the cylinders from the gimbal housing by removing the nut from one side of the pivot shaft and pulled the shaft out once both cylinders were free i emptied them into a pan by running the piston in and out a few times messy stuff next i used a spanner wrench and removed the service cap from the end of the cylinder and pulled the whole piston and rod assembly out of the cylinder i popped the plastic limiter off the shaft and set it aside the next step is the hardest  removing the cap on the shaft the only advice i can give you is to plan on heating the cap with a propane torch it loosens the thread locker used to hold it on and makes removal much easier the softjaws i bought for my vice worked ok for this but they were still a pain it took two people and lots of swearing to get them off but they do come off once the cap was off i pulled the service cap off the end and replaced the outside oring inner oring and the scraper gasket that part was really easy next i removed the two split bearings and single oring from the piston and replaced those with new ones from the kit be careful how the split bearings are placed  they cant overlap too much or be crooked when they go back into the bore another note  make sure the split bearings have the split located in different areas of the piston once theyre reinstalled this helps to make sure wear is even and theres no direct path for oil to escape next i snapped the limiter back onto the cylinder oiled the service cap oring and seal and slid it back onto the shaft stuck the assembly in a vice with softjaws and reinstalled the cap after coating the shaft threads with lots of thread locker i used a wrench on the opposite side of the shaft where the piston cushion sits for leverage once that was finished i cut up a pop can as a guide for the piston and its split bearings they like to pop off if theyre not being held in place i stuck the pop canpiston guide into the cylinder bore oiled it all up and slid the piston assembly with limiter snapped on the shaft  dont forget guess how i know into the bore i made sure before giving it a bump to get everything in there that the bearings and oring hadnt moved out of position once that was done i used the spanner wrench to reinstall the service cap and then reinstalled the trim cylinders in all it took less than 2 hours to do both a very easy job on to the next step buffing fiberglass
