one of the most common questions we receive is will the bidet fit my toilet our initial thought is yes it probably will bidet toilet seats were designed with a universal design in order to fit as many toilets as possible however some toilet manufacturers want unique toilets and this can cause issues to arise that being said the majority of our bidets will fit 98 of the toilets on the market weve included specifications for each seat in case you have any doubt and hopefully in this article we can erase any further questions or concerns round toilet vs elongated toilet the first step in purchasing a bidet toilet seat is determining if your toilet is round or elongated it can be a bit confusing so we hope these steps help clear up any confusion first the elongated toilet will be oval shaped like an egg where as a round toilet is close to being a perfect circle however it still may be difficult to tell which toilet you have without having another toilet to compare with so the next step is to measure your toilet length measure from the bolt holes at the rear of the toilet bowl to the front edge of the toilet a general rule of thumb is if the length is less than 18 it is a round toilet and if its greater than 18 it is an elongated toilet please see the image below which contains the most common toilet dimensions two piece toilets if you have a two piece toilet then theres a 99 chance any bidet we carry will fit your toilet we havent come across a two piece toilet yet that would not accommodate one of our bidets one piece toilets the good news is that almost all one piece toilets are compatible with our bidets there are a small handful of toilets that may have some issues however toilets that have a curved tank or curves that slope towards the front of the toilet called french curves may have a difficult time fitting the bidet toilet seat in some cases bio bidet and infinity both have bidets which have wider back ends on some toilets that have curves these bidets may not fit the toilet if you have a 175 clearance see image below in between the mounting holes on your toilet and the back of the toilet all the way across the fixture then bio bidet and infinity will fit your toilet if there is some curve and there isnt enough clearance our other brand may suit your needs better though bidets from blooming brondell and clean sense can all fit toilets with some curve blooming is the most compatible toilet seat we carry and will fit almost every toilet on the market with a few exceptions kohler san raphael the san raphel by kohler is a popular design with some unique curves to it both a curved tank and french curves on the side mean there arent many bidets that fit this model in fact there is only one bidet we recommend the blooming nb1063 all other bidets simply wont fit properly if you own the san raphael or are in the market to purchase one the blooming bidet will be your best bet kohler san rialto this toilet model is similar to the san raphael but it has a shorter toilet seat length which makes it even more difficult for a bidet to fit technically the brondell swash 1000 can work on this toilet but the seat will have a 12 overhang on the base and that isnt aesthetically pleasing compact elongated the compact elongated toilet was designed to give customers an elongated seat but compacted into a round sized toilet the idea behind this new design is to save space in smaller bathrooms the issue with these toilets is that with the shortened design an elongated seat is going to hang over the edge of the front of the toilet by approximately 1 once again this is functional but it is not aesthetically pleasing the only other option is to use a round bidet toilet seat the purpose of the compact elongated is to have more room and adding a round bidet toilet seat defeats the purpose of this design the upside is that the bidet will align nicely with the compact elongated toilet in the end it is up to the user do you want the comfort of an elongated toilet with a bidet that hangs over the edge of the toilet or do you want a round bidet seat on your elongated toilet if you want to be 100 certain the bidet of your choice fits your toilet please take a picture of your toilet with measurements and email it to us at supportbidetorg we love to help
