what is the purpose of potassium in the human bodyby gail morris aug 14 2017potassium is an important mineral to the body and plays roles at both the cellular and electrical level in fact it is also considered an electrolyte because it carries a tiny electrical charge potassium is found in red blood cells muscles and bones food sources include many fruits and vegetables such as spinach parsley broccoli tomatoes citrus fruits bananas apples avocados and raisins video of the day error loading player flash plugin failed to load muscle contraction potassium and sodium work together to regulate the water and acidbase balance in the blood and tissues it also works by creating a sodiumpotassium pump that helps generate muscle contractions including regulating heartbeat according to periodic paralysis news desk because potassium crosses the cell membrane more readily than sodium it initiates an exchange that releases electrical energy and activates nerve impulses causing muscle contraction blood pressure potassium also causes a reaction in the blood vessels according to research published in the american journal of physiology regulatory integrative and comparative physiology research led by f j haddy determined that infusions of potassium would cause an increase in blood flow that resulted from the dilation of the arteries and relaxation of smooth muscles the research found that dietary supplementation with potassium could lower blood pressure this appeared to reduce the need for antihypertensive medications in individuals who were salt sensitive hypertensive although further research is required the researchers theorize that potassium supplementation could help reduce other complications such as stroke epilepsy the sodium and potassium balance in the body is sensitive according to dr lawrence wilson medical doctor and nutritional consultant an imbalance in this ratio can contribute to the development of seizures this imbalance can trigger excessive tissue breakdown at the neurological level and a correction can help to produce an improvement in epileptic seizures enzyme production there are a limited number of enzymes that require the use of potassium for production and activity according to the linus pauling institute at oregon state university for instance the use of adenosine triphosphate in the production of energy requires the presence of both sodium and potassium potassium is also needed for the activation of an important enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism pyruvate kinase bone health your body works on a fragile acidbase balance to maintain that acidbase balance based on your dietary intake your body may pull calcium from the bones according to lead researcher frances tylavsky from the department of preventative medicine at the university of tennessee this discovery led researchers to understand the importance that potassium plays in reducing the amount of calcium pulled from the bones to maintain the correct acidbase balance when the body can use potassium the role that potassium plays is based in a complex interaction between concentrations of potassium sodium and calcium and phosphorus within the bones and the interstitial fluid surrounding the bone lose weight feel greatchange your life with my plate by live strong  comgoalgender ageweight heightget my calorie goalyou might also likelow potassium  headaches what are the symptoms of potassium deficiency foods containing potassium citrate normal level of magnesium what role does potassium play in muscle contraction the potassium in avocados potassium in bananas and watermelons potassium  migraines does low potassium cause ekgs to change what fruits or vegetables are high in potassium besides bananas what substances are electrolytes foods rich in potassium  magnesium what are the benefits of potassium gluconate supplements high levels of potassium and rash on forearms and shins potassium chloride  heart attacks list of foods that are rich in magnesium potassium  calcium electrolyte imbalance signs eating disorders and low potassium can regular vigorous exercise lead to high potassium levels foods rich in fiber  potassium
