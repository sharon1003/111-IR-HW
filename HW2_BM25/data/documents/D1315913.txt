women represents the first published incidence of increased libido and hypersexuality associated with donepezil• physicians should be aware of the possibility of this side effect which was distressing to the elderly patients in the presented cases• a possible neurochemical mechanism of action of cholinesterase inhibitors leading to increased sexual arousal is presented abstract can donepezil affect the sexual response in the elderly population donezepil an acetylcholine inhibitor is commonly used in neuropsychiatry for the treatment of cognitive decline and dementia this report addresses two elderly female patients who had an increase in their libido and experienced hypersexuality after starting donepezil treatment potential explanations for this previously unreported association are discussed introduction donepezil aricept is a centrally active selective piperidine acetylcholinesterase ach e inhibitor with no effect on butyrylcholinesterase bu ch e its action on ach e inhibition is reversible 1 the drug is given orally in the dose of 5–10 mg od donepezil exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and reaches its peak plasma level within 3–4 hours after ingestion of the drug it is metabolized in the liver via cytochrome p450 cyp and is preferentially excreted by the kidneys the halflife of donepezil is 60 hours but can extend up to 100 hours in elderly subjects donepezil is relatively well tolerated predominant adverse effects are nausea vomiting diarrhea muscle cramps insomnia fatigue and anorexia neurological side effects include dizziness vertigo ataxia restlessness paresthesia tremor seizures drowsiness extrapyramidal symptoms and abnormal crying 2 the causes of these signs are unclear although they are usually attributed to the drug’s direct cholinergic effects a few cases of behavioral changes have been reported with donepezil 35 they include but are not limited to delirium delusions irritability aggression nervousness paranoia and abnormal dreams there is no report on the effect of donepezil on sexuality this report describes two cases of increased libido and hypersexuality experienced by female patients 10 days after starting donepezil treatment targeting their cognitive symptoms case 1 mrs nmrs n an 81yearold righthanded woman complained of cognitive changes that had been occurring over the last 3 years symptoms involved forgetfulness of names and dates of events as well as wordfinding difficulties these symptoms later progressed to difficulty following conversations and balancing her checkbook she also had a history of depression and anxiety treated with fluoxetine she stopped taking fluoxetine a few months later as she believed it exacerbated her cognitive symptoms later she was placed on a lower dose of the drug without much success it was then stopped her workup lead to the diagnosis of mild mixed dementia she was placed on donepezil 5 mg qod which was later increased to 5 mgday her other medications included warfarin sodium crystalline diltiazem alendronate sodium levothyroxine simvastatin and a multivitamin she noticed an increase in her sexual libido 1 week after beginning the regular dose of donepezil 5 mgday she described the feeling as overwhelming she described obsessive sexual thoughts and the urge to have sex many times during the day she felt very embarrassed and asked to stop donepezil an attempt to decrease the donepezil dose to alleviate the symptoms while continuing the medication was unsuccessful she stopped taking donepezil and her symptoms abated a few days later at 6month followup she noted that she had no recurrence of these symptoms since she stopped taking the drug case 2 mrs mmrs m is a 72yearold right handed woman who had once had a motor vehicle accident subsequent to her accident she had complained of shortterm memory loss and wordfinding difficulties she was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment of the amnestic type in addition she suffered from depression and was on citalopram 20 mgday when she started donepezil 5 mg qod which was increased to 5 mgday mrs m became restless had pressured speech and complained of increased libido and obsessive sexual thoughts 1 week after she started donepezil a hypomanic state was diagnosed and her citalopram was tapered off and stopped her agitation and pressured speech abated but she continued to complain of the same sexual distressing thoughts leading to frequent masturbation these thoughts and actions were intolerable to her she stopped taking donepezil the symptoms of sexual hyperactivation increased libido and compulsive masturbation abated a few days later at a 3month followup she was found to be moderately depressed but no other complaints were made she was treated with bupropion a year later the depression was in remission with no recurrence of the unwanted sexual behaviors discussion donepezil is considered to be an essential drug in the treatment of dementia its action is due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition and the increase of acetylcholine available to neurons donepezil’s affect on sexuality has not been described one may advance that it is due to the direct cholinergic effect on sexual end organ as the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons and their neurotransmitter acetylcholine are stimulatory to the genitourinary system this stimulation leads to bladder contraction and increases sexual arousal causing vasodilatation of blood vessels and an increase in blood flow to the sexual organs in addition acetylcholine as a central neurotransmitter is involved in sexual arousal along with nitrous oxide this type of arousal follows the stage of libido activation and prepares the genitalia for penetration and intercourse the message of arousal starts in the brain and is relayed in the spinal cord to sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers vascular tissue and genitalia previous reports by kawashima and yamada 3noted delirium and increased diurnal and nocturnal activation after the use of donepezil in addition wengel and colleagues 4 described behavioral complications associated with donepezil while another report described violent behavior associated with donepezil 5it is worth noting that both women presented in these cases had a history of depression and were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris in case 2 competition for cyp with the addition of donepezil may have triggered a hypomanic state with hypersexuality gregariousness and disinhibition by raising ssrilevels while the rest of the hypomanic symptoms abated when the patient stopped the ssri the hypersexuality did not abate until she stopped donepezil the two women were very disturbed by their behaviors and found it to be distressing and unacceptable decreasing the dose did not make any difference and the behavior abated only when the medication was completely stopped no subsequent sexual problems were noted at followup visits conclusion two cases of donepezil treatment associated with side effects of increase libido and hypersexuality were presented because of the high frequency use of donepezil and the special elderly population it targets physicians should be cognizant of this possible side effect along with or in the absence of major mental status changes in addition when donepezil is added to other agents pharmacokinetics and drug interaction must be considered further research in this area is needed ppreferences1 stahl s essential psychopharmacology neuroscientific basis and practical applications2nd
