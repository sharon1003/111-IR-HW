overheated melted or broken convertersany malfunction causing an unusually high level of hc or co in conjunction with high levels of o2 to enter the converter will dramatically elevate its temperature potential causes for high hc readings may include misfires afr cylinder imbalance excessive engine or vehicle load  fuel delivery system or fuel quality  sluggish worn out o2 sensors  excessive backpressure  low compression poor spark or weak ignition note temperatures in excess of 1600ยบ f may damage catalyst without visible signs of melting coated  oilfouled substratecatalyst poisoning occurs when the converter is exposed to emissions containing substances that coat the working surfaces enveloping the catalyst to the point it cannot contact  and treat  the exhaust potential causes for coated or fouled substrate may include excessive carbon buildup in exhaust internal coolant leaks head  intake gasketuse of nonconvertersafe gasket sealants excessive oil consumption burning oilimproper fuels or additives e85 dieselstructural damagethe primary cause of structural damage is road debris striking the converter normally some evidence of impact is visible on the converter shield other conditions that may cause structural damage corrosion thermal shock metal fatigue stress fractures stripped o2 sensor threads flex pipe failure airgap pipe failure
