drugs  diseases  neurology cerebral venous thrombosis updated jan 13 2018author w alvin mc elveen md chief editor helmi l lutsep md more print background thrombosis of the venous channels in the brain is an uncommon cause of cerebral infarction relative to arterial disease but it is an important consideration because of its potential morbidity see prognosis knowledge of the anatomy of the venous system is essential in evaluating patients with cerebral venous thrombosis cvt since symptoms associated with the condition are related to the area of thrombosis for example cerebral infarction may occur with cortical vein or sagittal sinus thrombosis secondary to tissue congestion with obstruction see presentation lateral sinus thrombosis may be associated with headache and a pseudotumor cerebri–like picture extension into the jugular bulb may cause jugular foramen syndrome while cranial nerve palsies may be seen in cavernous sinus thrombosis as a compressive phenomenon cerebral hemorrhage also may be a presenting feature in patients with venous sinus thrombosis see presentation imaging procedures have led to easier recognition of venous sinus thrombosis see the images below offering the opportunity for early therapeutic measures see workup left lateral sinus thrombosis demonstrated on magnetic resonance venography mrv this 42yearold woman presented with sudden onset of headache physical examination revealed no neurologic abnormalities view media gallery axial view of magnetic resonance mr venogram demonstrating lack of flow in transverse sinus view media gallery the following guidelines for cvt have been provided by the american heart association and the american stroke association  1 in patients with suspected cvt routine blood studies consisting of a complete blood count chemistry panel prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time should be performed screening for potential prothrombotic conditions that may predispose a person to cvt eg use of contraceptives underlying inflammatory disease infectious process is recommended in the initial clinical assessment testing for prothrombotic conditions including protein c protein s or antithrombin deficiency antiphospholipid syndrome prothrombin g20210a mutation and factor v leiden can be beneficial for the management of patients with cvt testing for protein c protein s and antithrombin deficiency is generally indicated 24 weeks after completion of anticoagulation there is a very limited value of testing in the acute setting or in patients taking warfarin in patients with provoked cvt associated with a transient risk factor vitamin k antagonists may be continued for 36 months with a target international normalized ratio of 2030 in patients with unprovoked cvt vitamin k antagonists may be continued for 612 months with a target international normalized ratio of 2030 for patients with recurrent cvt venous thromboembolism vte after cvt or first cvt with severe thrombophilia ie homozygous prothrombin g20210a homozygous factor v leiden deficiencies of protein c protein s or antithrombin combined thrombophilia defects or antiphospholipid syndrome indefinite anticoagulation may be considered with a target international normalized ratio of 2030 for women with cvt during pregnancy lowmolecularweight heparin lmwh in full anticoagulant doses should be continued throughout pregnancy and lmwh or vitamin k antagonist with a target international normalized ratio of 2030 should be continued for ≥6 weeks postpartum for a total minimum duration of therapy of 6 months it is reasonable to advise women with a history of cvt that future pregnancy is not contraindicated further investigations regarding the underlying cause and a formal consultation with a hematologist or maternal fetal medicine specialist are reasonable it is reasonable to treat acute cvt during pregnancy with fulldose lmwh rather than unfractionated heparin for women with a history of cvt prophylaxis with lmwh during future pregnancies and the postpartum period is reasonable etiology many causative conditions have been described in cerebral venous thrombosis cvt these may be seen alone or in combination for example a prothrombin gene mutation in association with oral contraceptive use raises the odds ratio for developing cvt sinusitis infection may occur by extension from the paranasal sinuses these cases also may be associated with subdural empyema bacterial meningitis as a coexistent condition should be considered in these cases frontal sinuses are the most common source of infection with spread through the emissary veins between the posterior sinus mucosa and the meninges rarely sphenoid sinusitis may be associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis multiple organisms are to be considered staphylococcus aureus being the most common in chronic infections gramnegative organisms and fungi such as aspergillus species may be found trauma and surgery trauma may also be an etiologic event cerebral sinus thrombosis easily may be overlooked in cases of minor head trauma neurosurgical procedures such as dural taps and infusions into the internal jugular vein have been implicated as well hypercoagulable states many medical conditions have been associated with cvt for example hypercoagulable states associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome protein s and c deficiencies antithrombin iii deficiency lupus anticoagulant and the leiden factor v mutation may result in cvt antibodies against the fibrinolytic receptor annexin a2 titer 3 standard deviations are significantly associated with cvt  2 pregnancy also is associated with a hypercoagulable tendency malignancies may be associated with hypercoagulable states as well and therefore may be risk factors intracranial hypotension isolated cortical venous thrombosis has been associated with intracranial hypotension syndrome but only rarely in a study schievink and maya found that cvt was present in only 3 21 out of 141 patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension  3lumbar puncture a few cases of cvt have been reported after lumbar puncture lp suggesting a causal association in a study by canhao et al lp induced a sustained decrease in mean blood flow velocity bfv in the straight sinus ss suggesting that the decrease in venous blood flow is a possible mechanism contributing to the occurrence of cvt in the study the investigators used transcranial doppler ultrasonography to register the mean bfv of the ss before during and after lp lp induced a decrease of 47 in mean bfv in the ss with the mean decrease being significant immediately at the end 30 min after and more than 6 hours after lp  4medications several medications are reported to increase the risk of cvt including the following oral contraceptives  including the thirdgeneration formulations corticosteroids epsilonaminocaproic acid thalidomide tamoxifen erythropoietin phytoestrogens lasparaginase heparin  heparin therapy has been reported to produce thrombotic thrombocytopenia with associated venous sinus thrombosis additional disease risk factors other diseases that have been described as risk factors for cvt include the following inflammatory bowel diseases such as crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are described as risk factors for venous thrombosis  5 corticosteroids used in treatment of these conditions may play a causative role pregnancy and puerperium are important considerations in women of childbearing age hematologic conditions including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura sickle cell disease and polycythemia are to be considered collagenvascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus wegener granulomatosis and behçet syndrome have been reported to be associated with cvthyperhomocysteinemia is a strong and independent risk factor for cvt being present in 2743 of patients with cvt but in only 810 of the general population whether treatment with folate pyridoxine andor cobalamin reduces the risk of cvt is unclear nephrotic syndrome dehydration spontaneous intracranial hypotension high altitude hepatic cirrhosis sarcoidosis epidemiology international occurrence the incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis cvt is difficult to determine but generally it is believed to be an uncommon cause of stroke with the reported ratio of venous to arterial strokes being 1625 in 1973 towbin reported cvt in 9 of 182 autopsies  6 while in 1995 daif reported a frequency in saudi arabia of 7 cases per 100000 hospital patients  7however with the advent of newer imaging techniques the reported incidence of cvt is likely to increase as less severe cases are found sex and agerelated demographics cvt is believed to be more common in women than in men in a series of 110 cases ameri and bousser found a femaletomale ratio of 1291  8in 1992 ameri and bousser reported a uniform age distribution in men with cvt while 61 of women with cvt were aged 2035 years  8 this difference may be related to pregnancy or the use of oral contraceptives  9prognosis smith demonstrated the efficacy of anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapy in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis cvt in his study he compared outcomes of patients who were treated with heparin and local infusion of urokinase 12 patients with those of patients who received no treatment 21 patients  10 the results appear in the table below table patients with cerebral venous thrombosis treated with heparin and local infusion of urokinase vs nontreated group open table in a new

mass effect is the major cause of death in cvt in cvt patients with large parenchymal lesions causing herniation decompressive surgery has been lifesaving and often results in good functional outcome even in patients with severe clinical conditions  11mortality in untreated cases of venous thrombosis has been reported to range from 13848 this high mortality rate may be a reflection of clinical severity at entrance into the study between 25 and 30 of patients have full recovery in a portuguese study that prospectively analyzed 91 patients with cvt over a mean 1year followup interval the majority of patients experienced complete recovery  12 of the patients analyzed 7 died in the acute phase 1 died during the one year followup 82 recovered completely and 1 were dependent 59 developed thrombotic events during the followup 10 had seizures 11 complained of severe headaches and 1 patient experienced severe visual loss in 2003 buccino et al found a good overall outcome in their reinvestigation of a series of 34 patients with confirmed cvt  13 however 10 patients 30 had episodic headaches 3 patients 88 had seizures 4 patients 117 had pyramidal signs and 2 59 had visual
