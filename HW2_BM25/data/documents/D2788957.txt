from the frills pick your fuel source recommended 15 recipes for outdoor dining using propane tanks is convenient and always having a spare tank around eliminates having to leave the bbq to make a propane run but natural gas is another fuel option itll cost you less in the long run but youll have to run a dedicated line from your home to the grill and cheaper grills under 300 arent usually built to accommodate this option you can outfit your propane grill for 100 or less with a natural gas conversion kit but keep in mind that the grill you choose will otherwise take one fuel source and not the other15 recipes for outdoor dining photos of the day photos of the day 0505how will you use your grill ok we wise guy we know youre going to cook food on this thing but have you stopped to consider how much food and of what type a good rule of thumb is that your grill should hold enough food to prepare a meal for as many people as you regularly cook for if thats two a small grilling surface will do but if you love to entertain then surface size matters — and the bigger the better whats more not all grills are equipped with the capability to say cook via rotisserie grill size the doubleedged sword now lets suppose that youve decided on a large gas grill in some ways thats a wise decision because smaller grills tend to be less stable though not necessarily less safe and easier to steal for starters but that said you dont want to buy the shiny new grill get it home and discover that it doesnt fit on your deck so take some measurements of where you want to set up your bbq hub — especially if you live in an apartment or condo — to make sure youve got the size issue settled when it comes to gas grills especially less expensive ones wider isnt automatically better its just wider the great btu debate while in my case btu could stand for burgers that are undercooked its actually shorthand for british thermal unit this measurement reflects a grills gas usage and heating potential its not quite like horsepower on a car though  more btus dont guarantee faster preheating or better cooking  but there are some magic numbers to look for for a standard gas grill look for about 80 to 100 btus per square inch and 60 to 80 for an infrared grill like the charbroil truinfrared commercial 2burner gas grill  21520 with instore pickup a low by 54  which uses radiant heat once again this supposes that the grill you buy is efficient and well made the efficiency enigma solved for grills it doesnt mean squat if your setup cranks out the btus but lacks the efficiency to let the heat do its job this efficiency boils down to the grills build quality the best grills whether expensive or thrifty will use stainless steel or cast aluminum throughout lid seals will fit tight and the grill grates and lid will have enough heft to stand up to heat and keep the btus in whats more a good grill will have  small vents to let a controlled amount of air flow through the grill holding in heat so it heats up quickly to a high temperature flimsy grills on the other hand have lids and grates that simply feel light and may have poor welds and construction necessary vs extraneous featuresgrill frills are easy to fall for side burners warmer racks and rotisseries might get lots of use but do you really need a smoker box or lights that let you cook at night we suggest making a checklist of the options you want and crosscheck it with grills available in your price range to narrow down your choices generally the more features you want the more youre likely to spend the charbroil 5burner propane gas grill balances the features youll want a temperature gauge 900 square inches of total cooking area four wheels 40000 btu main burners with the features you really like 15000 btu sear burner and 10000 btu side burner for a price you can afford 199  with instore pickup a low by 58  consider upkeep and maintenance did you know that the average mass market grill needs new parts every 14 months the most common burner elements will go though theyre not too hard or expensive to replace if youre the slightest bit handy but a poorly made lid or frame will cause you headaches that can only be relieved by junking your cheap grill and jonesing a hot dog from your neighbor with the weber gas grills will definitely last longer and be more hygienic if you scrub them down and clean them after each use something as basic as a grill cover will protect your investment from the elements and a solid warranty is your best protection against heartbreak at the height of grilling season as for a sweet spot in terms of price consider spending about 300 to 500 though you can find quality grills for under 250 its also wise to read the reviews for models from reputable
