they named teleworld which was later renamed to ti vo inc though they originally intended to create a home network device it was redesigned as a device that records digitized video onto a hard disk they began the first public trials of the ti vo device and service in late 1998 in the san francisco bay area after exhibiting at the consumer electronics show in january 1999 mike ramsay announced to the company that the first version of the ti vo digital video recorder would ship in q1 the last day of which is 31 march despite an estimated four to five months of work remaining to complete the device because 31 march 1999 was a blue moon the engineering staff codenamed this first version of the ti vo dvr blue moon 2the original ti vo dvr digitized and compressed analog video from any source antenna cable or direct broadcast satellite ti vo also integrates its dvr service into the settop boxes of satellite and cable providers in late 2000 philips electronics introduced the dsr6000 the first direc tv receiver with an integrated ti vo dvr this new device nicknamed the direc ti vo stored digital signals sent from direc tv directly onto a hard disk in early 2000 ti vo partnered with electronics manufacturer thomson multimedia now technicolor sa and broadcaster british sky broadcasting to deliver the ti vo service in the uk market this partnership resulted in the thomson pvr10uk a standalone receiver released in october 2000 that was based on the original reference design used in the united states by both philips and sony ti vo ended uk unit sales in january 2003 though it continued to sell subscriptions and supply guide data to existing subscribed units until june 2011 ti vo branded products returned to the uk during 2010 under an exclusive partnership with cable television provider virgin media 3ti vo was launched in australia in july 2008 by hybrid television services a company owned by australias seven media group and new zealands tvnz ti vo also launched a special 2009 christmas ti vo dvr that has a 320gb hard drive and comes with the hnp free  clarification needed 4 ti vo australia also launched blockbuster on demand and as of early december launched a novel service called caspa on demand 5 ti vo also went on sale in new zealand on 6 november 2009 6janet jackson s super bowl halftime show incident set a record for being the most watched recorded and replayed moment in ti vo history the baring of one of jacksons breasts at the end of her duet with justin timberlake which caused a flood of outraged phone calls to cbs was replayed a record number of times by ti vo users a company representative stated the audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it the audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram  7 in november 2017 ti vo appointed enrique rodriguez as new president and ceo 8ti vo digital video recorder  editmain article ti vo digital video recorders front view of a ti vo series2 5xxgeneration unit a ti vo dvr serves a function similar to that of a videocassette recorder vcr in that both allow a television viewer to record programming for viewing at a later time unlike a videocassette recorder which uses removable magnetic tape cartridges a ti vo dvr stores television programs on an internal hard drive that can only be removed by disassembling the device a ti vo dvr also automatically records programs which the user is likely to be interested in ti vo dvrs also implement a patented feature which ti vo calls trick play allowing the viewer to pause live television and rewind and replay up to a halfhour of recently viewed television more recent ti vo dvrs can be connected to a computer local area network allowing the ti vo device to download information and even video programs music and movies from the internet functions  editti vo polls its network receiving program information including description regular and guest actors directors genres whether programs are new or repeats and whether broadcast is in high definition hd information is updated daily from tribune media services users can select individual programs to record or a season pass to record an entire season or more there are options to record first run only first run and repeats or all episodes an episode is considered first run if aired within two weeks of that episodes initial air date when users requests for multiple programs are conflicting the lower priority program in the season pass manager is either not recorded or clipped where times overlap the lower priority program will be recorded if it is aired later ti vo dvrs with two tuners record the top two priority programs ti vo pioneered recording programs based on household viewing habits  citation needed this is called ti vo suggestions users can rate programs from three thumbs up to three thumbs down ti vo user ratings are combined to create a recommendation based on what ti vo users with similar viewing habits watch for example if one user likes american idol americas got talent and dancing with the stars then another ti vo user who watched just american idol might get a recommendation for the other two shows a limited amount of space is available to store programs when the space is full the oldest programs are deleted to make space for the newer ones programs that users flag to not be deleted are kept and ti vo suggestions are always lowest priority the recording capacity of a ti vo hd dvr can be expanded with an external hard drive which can add 65 additional hours of hd recording space or up to 600 hours of standard definition video recording capacity when not recording specific user requests the current channel is recorded for up to 30 minutes dualtuner models record two channels this allows users to rewind or pause anything that has been shown in the last thirty minutes — useful when viewing is interrupted shows already in progress can be entirely recorded if less than 30 minutes have been shown unlike vcrs ti vo can record and play at the same time a program can be watched from the beginning even if its in the middle of being recorded which is something that vcrs cannot do some users take advantage of this by waiting 10 to 15 minutes after a program starts or is replayed from a recording so that they can fast forward through commercials in this way by the end of the recording viewers are caught up with live television unlike most dvrs ti vo dvrs are easily connected to home networks 9 allowing users to schedule recordings on ti vos website via ti vo central online transfer recordings between ti vo units multiroom viewing mrv or tofrom a home computer ti vo to go transfers play music and view photos over the network and access thirdparty applications written for ti vos home media engine hme api ti vo has added a number of broadband features including integration with amazon video on demand jamancom 10 and netflix watch instantly 11 offering users access to thousands of movie titles and television shows right from the comfort of their couch additionally broadband connected to ti vo boxes can access digital photos from picasa web albums or photobucket another popular feature is access to rhapsody music through ti vo allowing users to listen to virtually any song from their living room ti vo also teamed up with one true media to give subscribers a private channel for sharing photos and video with family and friends they can also access weather traffic fandango movie listings including ticket purchases and music through live365 in the summer of 2008 ti vo announced the availability of you tube videos on ti vo on 7 june 2006 ti vo began offering ti vo cast a broadband download service which initially offered content from places such as rocketboom or the new york times now there are over 70 tivo cast channels available for ti vo subscribers ti vo is expanding media convergence in january 2005 ti vo to go a feature allowing transfer of recorded shows from ti vo boxes to pcs was added ti vo partnered with sonic in the release of my dvd 61 software for editing and converting ti vo to go files in january 2007 ti vo to go was extended to the macintosh with toast titanium 8 roxio software for assembly and burning digital media on cd and dvd media in august 2005 ti vo rolled out ti vo desktop allowing moving mpeg2 video files from pcs to ti vo for playback by dvr as of june 5 2013 ti vo stopped distributing the free version of ti vo desktop for pc in favor of selling ti vo desktop plus 12 users who previously downloaded the free version of ti vo desktop can continue to use the software without paying a fee for the plus edition parental features ti vo kid zone later removed in the premiere and roamio devices was designed to give parents greater control over what their children see on television this feature allows parents to choose which shows their children can watch and record it also helps kids discover new shows through recommendations from leading national childrens organizations ti vo kid zone provides a customized now playing list for children that displays only preapproved shows keeping television as safe as possible subscription service  editthe information that a ti vo dvr downloads regarding television schedules as well as software updates and any other relevant information is available through a monthly service subscription in the united states a different model applies in australia where the ti vo media device is bought for a oneoff fee without further subscription costs lifetime subscription there are multiple types of product lifetime service for satelliteenabled ti vo dvrs the lifetime subscription remains as long as the account is active and does not follow a specific piece of hardware this satellite lifetime subscription cannot be transferred to another person toshiba and pioneer ti vo dvd recording equipped units include a basic lifetime subscription which is very similar to full lifetime except only three days of the program guide are viewable and search and internet capabilities are not available or at least limited all units except satellite but including dvd units can have product lifetime subscription to the ti vo service which covers the life of the ti vo dvr not the life of the subscriber the product lifetime subscription accompanies the ti vo dvr in case of ownershiptransfer ti vo makes no warranties or representations as to the expected lifetime of the ti vo dvr aside from the manufacturers limited warranty in the past ti vo has offered multiple trade up programs where you could transfer the product lifetime subscription from an old unit to a newer model with a fee a ti vo can be used without a serviceagreement but it will act more like a vcr in that you can only perform manual recordings and the ti vo cant be connected to the ti vo service for local time program guide data software updates etc or ti vo will shut down the recording function service availability  editthe ti vo service is available in the united states united kingdom canada mexico australia spain and taiwan at present over the years since its initial release in the united states ti vo series1 and series2 dvrs have also been modified by end users to work in australia brazil canada new zealand the netherlands and south africa ti vo went on sale in new zealand in the first week of november 2009 6the ti vo service is coming to an end in australia on 31 october 2017 and therefore there will be no electronic programming guide and ti vo recording features after 31 october 2017 thus making all tivo machines in australia virtually useless 13united kingdom  editthe ti vo service was launched in the united kingdom in the autumn of 2000 it sold only 35000 units over the next 18 months thomson makers of the only uk ti vo box abandoned it in early 2002 after bsky b launched its sky integrated settop decoder and dvr which dominated the market for dvrs in homes subscribing to bsky bs paidfor satellite television service many manufacturers including thomson 14 15 have launched integrated decoder boxesdvrs in the uk for other digital platforms including free satellite terrestrial cable and iptv a technical issue caused ti vo suggestions to stop recording for s1 uk ti vo customers in late september 2008 but this was fixed in late january 2009 16since december 2010 uk ti vo units that were not already on an active monthly subscription or lifetime subscription could no longer be reactivated bsky b who were operating the support for ti vo no longer had full access to the ti vo systems to activate accounts the ti vo s1 subscription service was maintained for both lifetime and monthly subscriptions until 1 june 2011 17 a community project known as alt epg was established in march 2011 with the aim of providing a replacement for the discontinued subscription service this project now provides programme guide data and software upgrades for s1 ti vos 18on 24 november 2009 cable television provider virgin media entered into a strategic partnership with ti vo 3 under the mutually exclusive agreement ti vo developed a converged television and broadband interactive interface to power virgin medias next generation high definition set top boxes ti vo will become the exclusive provider of middleware and user interface software for virgin medias next generation set top boxes virgin media will be the exclusive distributor of ti vo services and technology in the united kingdom virgin media released its first ti vo cobranded product in december 2010 19 on 17 march 2011 virgin media enabled access to a third tuner 20as of 12 february 2015 virgin media has two million ti vo customers 50 of their television customers 21hardware anatomy  editmain article ti vo dvrs the ti vo peanut remote the ti vo dvr was designed by ti vo inc which currently provides the hardware design and linux based ti vo software and operates a subscription service without which most models of ti vo will not operate ti vo units have been manufactured by various oems including philips sony cisco hughes pioneer toshiba and humax which license the software from ti vo inc to date there have been six series of ti vo units produced ti vo dvrs are based on power pc series1 or mips series2 processors connected to mpeg2 encoderdecoder chips and highcapacity ideata hard drives series1 ti vo units used one or two drives of 13–60 gb current series2 units have drives of 40–250 gb in size ti vo has also partnered with western digital to create an external hard drive the my dvr expander for ti vo hd and series3 boxes it plugs into the ti vo box using an e sata interface it expands the highdefinition boxes by up to 67 hours of hd and around 300 hours of standard programming other ti vo users have found many ways to expand ti vo storage although these methods are not supported by ti vo and may void the warranty some recent models manufactured by toshiba pioneer and humax under license from ti vo contain dvdr  rw drives the models can transfer recordings from the builtin hard drive to dvd video compliant disc playable in most modern dvd systems all standalone ti vo dvrs have coax rfin and an internal cableready tuner as well as analog video input — compositerca and svideo for use with an external cable box or satellite receiver the ti vo unit can use a serial cable or infrared blasters to control the external receiver they have coaxrf compositerca and svideo output and the dvd systems also have component out audio is rca stereo and the dvd systems also have digital optical out until 2006 standalone ti vo systems could only record one channel at a time though a dualtuner series2dt s2dt box was introduced in april 2006 the s2dt has two internal cableready tuners and it supports a single external cable box or satellite receiver the s2dt is therefore capable of recording two analog cable channels one analog and one digital cable channel or one analog cable and one satellite channel at a time with the correct programming sources note however that the s2dt unlike earlier units cannot record from an antenna this is due to an fcc mandate that all devices sold after march 2007 with an ntsc tuner must also contain an atsc tuner ti vo therefore had to choose between adding atsc support or removing ntsc support with the s2dt they opted to remove ntsc the series3 supports ntsc and atsc along with digital cable channels with cable cards the series2 dvrs also have usb ports currently used only to support network wired ethernet and wi fi adapters 22 the early series2 units models starting with 110130140 have usb11 hardware while all other systems have usb20 there have been four major generations of series2 units the ti vobranded 1xx and 2xx generations were solid greyblack the main difference was the upgrade from usb 11 to the much faster usb 20 the 5xx generation was a new design the chassis is silver with a white oval in the faceplate the white oval is backlit leading to these units being called nightlight boxes the 5xx generation was designed to reduce costs and this also caused a noticeable drop in performance in the system menus as well as a large performance drop in network transfers the 5xx generation also introduced changes in the boot prom that make them unmodifiable without extensive wiring changes the 6xx generation resembles the previous 5xx model except that it has a black oval the 6xx is a new design and the only model available today is the s2dt with dual tuners and a builtin 10100base t ethernet port as well the 6xx is the best performing series2 to date outperforming even the old leader the 2xx and far better than the lowest performing 5xx some ti vo systems are integrated with direc tv receivers these direc ti vo recorders record the incoming satellite mpeg2 digital stream directly to hard disk without conversion because of this and the fact that they have two tuners direc ti vos are able to record two programs at once in addition the lack of digital conversion allows recorded video to be of the same quality as live video direc ti vos have no mpeg encoder chip and can only record direc tv streams however direc tv has disabled the networking capabilities on their systems meaning direc ti vo does not offer such features as multiroom viewing or ti vo to go only the standalone systems can be networked without additional unsupported hacking direc ti vo units hr10250 can record hdtv to a 250 gb hard drive both from the direc tv stream and overtheair via a standard uhf  or vhf capable antenna they have two virtual tuners each consisting of a direc tv tuner paired with an atsc overtheair tuner and like the original direc ti vo can record two programs at once further the program guide is integrated between overtheair and direc tv so that all programs can be recorded and viewed in the same manner in 2005 direc tv stopped marketing recorders powered by ti vo and focused on its own dvr line developed by its business units direc tv continues to support the existing base of direc tv recorders powered by ti vo on 8 july 2006 direc tv announced an upgrade to version 63 on all remaining hr10250 direc ti vo receivers the first major upgrade since this unit was released this upgrade includes features like program grouping folders a much faster onscreen guide and new sorting features in september 2008 direc tv and ti vo announced that they have extended their current agreement which includes the development marketing and distribution of a new hd directv dvr featuring the ti vo service as well as the extension of mutual intellectual property arrangements since the discontinued hughes electronics direct tv dvr with ti vo model hr10250 all newer ti vo units have been fully hdtv capable other ti vo models will only record analog standard definition television ntsc or pal  secam  the series3 ti vo hd and ti vo hd xl dvrs and the series4 ti vo premiere and ti vo premiere xl dvrs are capable of recording hdtv both from antenna over the air and cable unencrypted qam tuner or encrypted with a cable card in addition to normal standard definition television from the same sources unlike the hr10250 neither the series3 nor series4 units can record from the direc tv service conversely the hr10250 cannot record from digital cable other ti vo models may be connected to a high definition television hdtv but are not capable of recording hdtv signals although they may be connected to a cable hdtv settop box and record the downconverted outputs in 2008 some cable companies started to deploy switched digital video sdv technology which initially was incompatible with the series3 and ti vo hd units ti vo inc worked with cable operators on a tuningadapter with usb connection to the ti vo to enable sdv some msos now offer these adapters for free to their customers with ti vo dvrs drive expansion  editti vo has partnered with western digital to create an external hard drive the my dvr expander e sata edition for ti vo hd and series3 systems the external drive plugs into the ti vo box using an e sata interface the first version of the e sata drive shipped was a 500 gb drive that shipped in june 2008 in june 2009 the 1 tb version of the drive began shipping the 1 tb version expands the ti vo hd and series3 systems capacity by up to 140 hours of hd content or 1200 hours of standard programming ti vo was not designed to have an external drive disconnected once it has been added because data for each recording is spread across both the internal and external disk drives as a result it is not possible to disconnect the external drive without deleting content recorded after the external drive was added if disconnected any recordings made will not be usable on either the internal or external drives however the external drive may be removed along with content without losing settings various capacities of external drives have been shipped since the product was initially released there were reports of product reliability issues 23 and a brief period of unavailability 24the western digital 1 tb and 500 gb my dvr expander e sata edition and my dvr expander usb edition drives have been discontinued and replaced with the western digital my book av dvr expander 1 tb drive this drive has received a facelift from the previous generation which now sports a glossy finish and a tiny white led power indicator along with a push button power switch in the back the biggest change is that this drive now includes both e sata and usb in one device this device is direct tv dish network ti vo moxi pace and scientific atlanta cisco certified press release seagate has come out with their own dvr expander drive called the seagate go flex dvr which comes in a 1 tb and 2 tb capacity 25 ti vo has not approved the seagate product for use with ti vo dvrs and they will not currently function with any ti vo products 26hacking  editusers have installed additional or larger hard drives in their ti vo boxes to increase their recording capacity others have designed and built ethernet cards 27 a web interface  ti vo web  and figured out how to extract insert and transfer video among their ti vo boxes other hacks include adding time to the start and end of recording intelligently 28 and sending daily emails of the ti vos activity ti vo still uses the same encoding however for the media files saved as  ti vo files these are mpeg files encoded with the users media access key mak however coders have written programs such as tivodecode and tivodecode manager to strip the mak from the file allowing the user to watch or send the recordings to friends ti vo in the cloud  editon january 4 2018 ti vo announced its nextgen platform a catchall product for providers like cable companies its available for multiple tv devices including not only linux and android tvbased settop boxes and traditional dvrs but also dvrfree streaming devices like apple tv and amazons fire tv as well as phones tablets and pcs the platform allows providers to take advantage of ti vos user interface voice control personalization and recommendations ti vo expects its user interface could provide an advantage over competitors such as netflix hulu and amazon video in a world where cordcutting is increasingly popular 29competitors and market share  editthe examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the united states and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject you may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or create a new article as appropriate may 2013  learn how and when to remove this template messagewhile its former main competitor in the united states replay tv had adopted a commercialskip feature ti vo decided to avoid automatic implementation fearing such a move might provoke backlash from the television industry replay tv was sued over this feature as well as the ability to share shows over the internet and these lawsuits contributed to the bankruptcy of sonicblue 30 its owner at the time its new owner dnna dropped both features in the final replay tv model the 5500 after demonstrating the web tv capability at the same 1999 ces with ti vo and replay tv demonstrating their products dish then named dish network a few months later added dvr functionality to their dish player 7100 and later its 7200 with its echostar unit producing the hardware while microsoft provided the software that included web tv the same software microsoft would later use for its ultimate tv dvr for direc tv the ti vo replay tv and dish player 7100 represent very first dvrs that were in development at the same time and were released to market at about the same time sonicblue the owners of replay tv would file for bankruptcy after being sued for its ability to automatically skip commercials and other features that were thought to violate copyrights echostar dish would eventually sue microsoft in 2001 for failing to support the software in dish player 7100 and 7200 with dish ending their relationship with microsoft and cease offering the dish player 71007200 to its subscribers and instead produce their own inhouse dvr and direc tv would eventually drop microsofts ultimate tv and keep direc ti vo as its only dvr offering for quite some time other distributors competing dvr sets in the united states include comcast and verizon although both distribute thirdparty hardware from manufacturers such as motorola and the former scientific atlanta unit of cisco systems with this functionality builtin verizon uses boxes fitted for fi os allowing highspeed internet access and other features however ti vo is compatible with the fi os tv service because when the tv programming arrives at the home via fi os fiber to the home network it is converted to cable labs specification qam channels exactly as those used by cable tv companies att is an iptv service that is incompatible with the ti vo despite having gained 234000 subscribers in the last quarter of 2011 31 as of january 2012 ti vo had only approximately 23 million subscribers in the united states this is down from a peak of 436 million in january 2006 32 as of january 31 2016 ti vo reported 68 million subscribers 33issues  editprivacy concerns  editti vo collects detailed usage data from units via broadband internet as units are downloading schedule data they transmit household viewing habits to ti vo inc collected information includes a log of everything watched time and channel and remote keypresses such as fast forwarding through or replaying content 34 many users were surprised when ti vo released data on how many users rewatched the exposure of janet jacksons breast during the 2004 super bowl 35 ti vo records usage data for their own research and they also sell it to other corporations such as advertisers 36 nielsen and ti vo have also previously collaborated to track viewing habits this data is sold to advertising agencies as a way of documenting the number of viewers watching specific commercials to their corporate clients 37ti vo has three levels of data collection by default the user is in optout status where all usage data is aggregated by zip code and individual viewing habits are not tracked certain optional features and promotions require the user to opt in and individual information is then collected for targeted show suggestions or advertising users can request that ti vo block the collection of anonymous viewing information and diagnostic information from their ti vo dvr 38litigation  editti vo holds several patents that have been asserted against cable tv operators and competing dvr box makers current discussion of ti vos litigation activity and impacts to ti vos business appear on various websites 39opposition by content providers  editcontent flagging  editin september 2005 a ti vo software upgrade added the ability for broadcasters to flag programs to be deleted after a certain date some customers had recordings deleted or could not use their flagged recordings transfer to a computer or burn to dvd as they could with unflagged material the initial showing of this for random shows was a bug in the software 40 it later was enabled on payperview and videoondemand content popup advertisements  editduring early 2005 ti vo began test marketing popup advertisements to select subscribers to explore it as an alternative source of revenue 41 the idea was that as users fastforward through certain commercials of ti vo advertisers they would also see a static image ad more suitable and effective than the broken video stream 42 43at its announcement the concept of extra advertisements drew heavy criticism from subscribers some lifetime subscribers were upset that they had already paid for a service based upon their previous adfree experience while others argued that they had purchased the service for the specific purpose of dodging advertisements in 2007 ti vo made changes to its popup ad system to show popup ads only if the user fastforwards through a commercial that has a corresponding popup ad 44 45gnu general public license and tivoization  editmain articles hardware restrictions and tivoization in 2006 free software foundation fsf decided to combat ti vos technical system of blocking users from running modified software this behavior which fsf dubs  tivoization  was tackled by creating a new version of the gnu general public license gpl v3 prohibiting this activity 46 the operating system kernel included in the ti vo is distributed under the terms of the gpl and the fsfs goal is to ensure that all recipients of software licensed under the new gpl are not restricted by hardware constraints on the modification of distributed software this new license provision was acknowledged by ti vo in its april 2007 sec filing we may be unable to incorporate future enhancements to the gnulinux operating system into our software which could adversely affect our business 47 regardless the linux kernel has not been changed to use gpl v3
