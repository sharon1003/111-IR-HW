monitor monitor patients for increased growth or potential malignant changes of preexisting nevi any preexisting malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with somatropin discontinue somatotropin if there is evidence of recurrent activity evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea in children with praderwilli syndrome before initiation of treatment discontinue treatment if these signs occur rule out pituitary or brain tumors as cause of h gh deficiency before initiating treatment discontinue if evidence of tumorigenesis fluid retention ie edema arthralgia carpal tunnel syndrome – especially in adults may occur frequently reduce dose as necessary if patient is hypersensitive to diluent reconstitute with swi vials onlycartridges must be reconstituted with supplied diluent glucocorticoid therapy may attenuate growth promoting effects of somatropin in children carefully adjust glucocorticoid therapy to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth closely monitor other hormonal replacement treatments in patients with hypopituitarism during somatropin treatment pancreatitis reported rarely in children and adults with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults published literature indicates that girls who have turner syndrome may be at greater risk than other somatropintreated children consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain monitor blood glucose in patients with other risk factors for glucose intolerance during therapy and

during somatropin therapy not shown to increase occurrence of scoliosis as with all therapeutic proteins there is potential for immunogenicity consider risks and benefits of starting somatropin in patients with short stature as they have increased risk of developing malignancies an increased risk of a second neoplasm reported in patients treated with somatotropins after first neoplasm intracranial tumors in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to head for first neoplasm were the most common of these second neoplasms in adult cancer survivors risk of occurrence unknown given the limited data available patients under growth hormone therapy should be carefully monitored for progression or recurrence of the tumor patients with turner syndrome should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders when somatropin is administered sc at same site over long period of time tissue atrophy may result may avoid by rotating injection site hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen undiagnoseduntreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin in particular growth response in children monitor thyroid function periodically increased mortality reported among patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma or those with acute respiratory failure benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against potential risk discontinue therapy if patient has acute critical illness secondary carcinoma in childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brainhead for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent ghd and were treated with somatropin an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported intracranial tumors in particular meningiomas were the most common of these second neoplasms monitor all patients with history of ghd secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor patients with endocrine disorders including growth hormone deficiency may have an increased incidence of slipped capital femoral epiphysis evaluate any child who develops a limp or complains of hip or knee pain during somatropin therapy serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and prompt medical attention should be sought if allergic reaction occurs patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency s may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels andor unmasking of central secondary hypothyroidism in addition patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment monitor bone age periodically during somatropin administration especially in patients who are pubertal andor receiving concomitant thyroid hormone replacement therapy epiphyseal maturation may progress rapidly zorbtive if moderate fluid retention arthralgia treat symptomatically or reduce dose by 50discontinue up to 5 days if severe toxicity then restart at 50 dose permanently discontinue if severe toxicity recurs or does not disappear within 5 days next pregnancy  lactation pregnancy there are no available data in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risks in animal reproduction studies no fetal harm reported with subcutaneous administration of somatropin during period of organogenesis in rats and rabbits at doses of approximately up to 5 and 10 times respectively the recommended human dose of 01 mgkgday estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages for indicated population are unknown lactation there are no data on presence of somatropin in human milk limited published literature reports no adverse effects on breastfed infants with maternal administration of somatropin no decrease in milk production or change in milk
