quickly as steaks dont overcook or they will be really tough and youll be heartbroken but to get to the heart of the matter if its really an adult beef heart its too tough and chewy to cook quickly braising is my preferred method and the one closest to my heart this is one of those things can cook all day and will eventually become incredibly tender  tasting like a slightly unusual and hearty pot roast you can also stuff them and then either braise or roast them  again low and slow heat is the most heartfriendly if you roast it also be sure there is enough moisture in the stuffing ie leave a soft spot in your heart or else it can dry out during a long bake you can also roast it in a dutch oven or something when you open up your heart after cooking a dry stuffing will just leave you with a heavy heart a final option is to use it as stew meat it will take longer to cook than most stew meats so you might want to simmer for a while first before adding vegetables then cook until the flavors come together and your hearts content once when i had leftovers after making a stuffed heart i was just going eat it but then i had a change of heart i chopped up the tender meat and added it to chili it probably was about 13 of the overall meat in the chili along with some diced chuck chunks and some ground beef it came out incredibly good there was a deep earthy flavor that really worked well i served it to a number of friends without explaining the dish and they didnt notice anything unusual i didnt have the heart to tell them in fact a number of people said it was some of the best chili they had tasted which was really heartwarming to hear take heart there are lots of ways to cook it any slowcooking method or recipe you might use for a tough cut of beef will probably work  just follow your heart i am actually serious about all of these methods  but okay truly sorry about the puns from the bottom of myshare improve this answeranswered jan 8 13 at 1821athanasius194k 6 61 1062i

into cubes in a frying pan put some olive oil slice an onion or two then place the heart after being a little brown add some lemon juice let them boil for 10 min then pour in hte serving dish upon serving you could add some sumac spiceshare improve this answeranswered jan 8 13 at 1239zeina1100 2 11 21add a commentup vote2down vote one of my favourite dishes as a kid was stuffed lambs hearts but these were tender enough to be roasted and the fat in the stuffing helped to cook the heart hearts are hard tightly packed muscle with very little fat to help cook them pig calf and lamb hearts are tender enough to be cooked with a stuffing which includes some form of fat but ox and cow beef hearts are simply too tough to cook that way and need to be treated as a tough cut of meat and braised until tendershare improve this answeranswered jan 8 13 at 1303spiceyokooko2298 1 8 19add a comment your answer sign up or log in sign up using google sign up using facebook sign up using email and
