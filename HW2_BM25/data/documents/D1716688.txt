what is a foundation quarter horse thats a darn good question and one that we are asked routinely the answer is simple a foundation quarter horse is a real quarter horse first we need to review some history the quarter horse breed was originated in colonial virginia in the early 1600’s early breeders bred for a “quarter type” horse regardless of breeding pedigree they crossed thoroughbreds arabs barbs light drafts together to achieve this goal these quarter type horses were short coupled kind eyed had strong feet and bones broad chested very powerful in the hind end and typically stood between 14 and 15 hands tall and weighed about 1200 pounds they recrossed these types of horses to achieve this “quarter type horse” what they discovered was that had a horse that was multipurpose for most every imaginable task they used these “quarter type” horses for every imaginable purpose whether for farming logging hooked to a buggy or under saddle working cattle then on sundays after church they would race these fine horses for a jug or a wager many a fortune was made and lost since open spaces in the new world was limited the main street of colonial williamsburg virginia was very popular it was originally a 14 mile from end to end hence the name quarter type in colonial times it was also popular to call these horses quarter pathers since often they were raced in the wooded areas that had only paths cleared through them for the next 200 plus years this practice of breeding continued but by now “quarter types” were bred to other “quarter type horses” with the occasional introduction of an outside stallion displaying “quarter type” characteristics typically a thoroughbred the early breeders did an excellent job of preserving this particularly american breed and their attributes by the 1840’s and we have a tremendous amount of people settling into western frontier america know in history as the great western expansion naturally the settlers took their horses and their breeding practices with them these fine horses were used for every imaginable task and were integral in the taming of the west throughout the civil war these quarter horses were used as cavalry mounts for both confederate and union forces they were prized for their steady performance and reliability under fire in the late 1800’s some prominent breeders of these “quarter type” horses decided to form quarter horse breeders association these breeders where typically from the big ranches in texas oklahoma wyoming arizona montana colorado new mexico and california which is why the quarter horse breed is so closely identified with the west this association stayed intact until the end of the first world war many thousands of these horses were shipped to the cavalry units fighting in the european theater of war after the war interest in the association dwindled membership eventually declined and the association folded a few decades later in 1940 interested quarter horse breeders picked up the mantel again and formed the american quarter horse association with its headquarters in amarillo texas the association has remained intact ever since and is the world’s largest horse breed registry these aqha founding breeders defined particular breed characteristics of the quarter horse that had been tradition since colonial virginia in the 1600’s these horses were fondly referred to as “bulldogs” “billys” or “steel dusts” and were considered the standards of the breed unfortunately over time many quarter horses breeders didn’t adhere to the standards set forth by the founders of the aqha to make a long story short sometime back in the 1960’s certain influential quarter horse breeders decided to reintroduce thoroughbred horses into the established quarter horse breed their motives were simply for profit whereas they raced these quarter horsethoroughbred crosses and won many races over time the basic characteristics of the quarter horse were lost to a large degree because now the horses were taller leaner and simply did not possess the characteristics that the quarter horse breed was originated in the first place so how does a quarter horse – thoroughbred cross get to be a quarter horse the answer is quite simple first the offspring of a registered quarter horse and a registered thoroughbred is then registered with the appendix registry of the american quarter horse association secondly this appendix offspring is eligible to compete in a variety of sanctioned quarter horse performance events or a speed index see aqha rule 423 once the offspring accumulates enough points or achieves a speed index of 80 then it is eligible for induction into the regular quarter horse registry via formal application see aqha rule 203 of further importance is that once the horse is approved then all their offspring automatically are eligible for full registry as well over time it wouldn’t be difficult to actually breed the quarter horse out of the breed therefore most modern quarter horses don’t look and act like the original quarter horse was intended it is sad that in a few short decades what took nearly 400 years to produce has been largely undone so how did they get away with this that answer is also simple since quarter horses were originally bred as a “quarter type” and it is well documented that many thoroughbreds were introduced into the quarter horse breed what many modern breeders neglected to include was “quarter type” characteristics of these thoroughbreds when breeding them to registered quarter horses in effect there is a loophole in the aqha rulebook which was and is exploited for the sake of speed motivated by greed therefore today we have two types of registered quarter horses and they look quite different from one another you have the “modern quarter horse” with a thin neck small head lean body thin legs small feet often 16 to 17 hands tall and a not always agreeable disposition whose pedigree had a disproportionate percentage of thoroughbred in it then we have the “real quarter horse foundation quarter horse” that looks exactly the way a “quarter type” horse is supposed to look like and has all the physical and mental characteristics that were originally intended yes there is thoroughbred blood in all foundation quarter horses…in that there is no dispute but it only takes a simple visual inspection of the two breeds to know that a thoroughbred doesn’t look like nor is a “real” quarter horse that’s as simple as saying that a greyhound dog and a german shepherd dog don’t look the same we are not saying that thoroughbred horses are undesirable but that they are simply not quarter horses as intended thoroughbreds where bred to race over long distances up to four miles and quarter horses were bred to be multitasking work horses that were raced for short distances period many people have the misconception that all registered quarter horses are bred true please know that many registered modern quarter horses are half threequarters and even seveneights thoroughbred cursory research into their pedigrees will show that as fact we hope that we have been able to clear that up a bit now back to the original question… what is a foundation quarter horse it’s a real quarter horse exactly what the founders of the american quarter horse association had intended and not a horse that looks like and acts like a thoroughbred the simplest measure to determine if a quarter horse is a foundation quarter horse is to examine the extended pedigree thoroughbreds that were introduced after 1940 should be considered in evaluating the percentage of quarter horse its that simple fortunately only a handful of foundation breeders in the united states that have been able to preserve the “real” quarter horses and maintain the integrity of the breed with the pedigrees to prove it we are proud to be one of them frankly there is some debate over what a real quarter horse is this is our version and we are sticking to it we must preface this by stating that we arent pretending to know anything about politics within the horse industry other than the fact that there is too much of it to sum it all up the foundation quarter horse is a horse that can trace its ancestry to the original bloodlines of the sires and dams that formed the origins of the quarter horse breed that look and act that way period the rest is purely semantics if you treasure our wonderful american heritage value a good horse that is reliable steady and good natured then youve come to the right place
