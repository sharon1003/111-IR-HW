dogs on a regular basis to ensure that they haven’t been infested with these parasites once infected different dogs may show different symptoms and these symptoms are not the same that are seen in humans some dogs may have constant severe lameness from inflammation while others may have acute lameness that only lasts for a few days but recurs every few days or even weeks later lameness may not always occur in the same limbs either and can be interchangeable over time another one of the serious symptoms of lyme disease in dogs is that kidney problems may develop this can progress into what is called glomerulonephritis where the kidneys themselves become inflamed and lead to the overall dysfunctions of the kidneys’ glomeruli this serves as the blood filter so toxins and other harmful substances that would have normally been removed from the blood are free to roam which can lead to secondary problems this can further progress to complete kidney failure and your dog may suffer

blood as well as the source of the fluid retention in the joints because the symptoms of lyme disease are very similar to common arthritis it can be difficult to obtain a direct diagnosis but the
