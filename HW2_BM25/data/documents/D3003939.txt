how to burnout with automaticimrollin69 02122002 1108 pmwzup yall i have a 90 honda accord dx and its automatic my question is how do ppl burnout with their car staying still im not talkin bout putting it on neutural and raising the rpms and puttin it on drive im talkin bout burnin out without movin the car help would be appreciated thanx alot smoker2 finger smoker2fastr than u 02122002 1143 pmin the chevelle if i want to do a burnout standing still i just bring the car to a complete stop mash the gas and let the tires fry if your motor is not powerful enough to do it like that youre gonna need to put your left foot on the brake and right foot on the gas bring the rpms up let the brake go and then mash the gas personally i dont find standing still burnouts impressive at all it doesnt take much to start it and once you start the tires spinning you can do it as long as you want until the tires blow or shred my personal favorite to do is to do a hard launch getting an inch or two of sunlight under the front tires nailing the gas and laying rubber in 100 ft strips fun stuff as long as ya arent stupid and get caught laying long strips of rubber while moving foreward takes more power and control blackbird01 02132002 0730 ami do it the same either come to a stop or i can often times do it even from a roll ive gotten the backend of my car to kick out from a 45mph punch follow fastrs comments and you should be okaybluevette74 02132002 0903 amim assuming that your accord isnt powerful enough to a burnout without pressing the brake you need to press the brake until your tires start to spin and then let off the brake and you should have an allright burn out but why would you want to do a burnout the playa pres 02132002 0140 pmsince your accord is fwd hold the ebrake and mash the gas its that simple ljason l 02132002 0314 pmwell i could do standstill burnouts in my rental corolla all day and i bet your accord has just as much power as a corolla so heres how i do it hold the ebrake hold the brake with one foot and press the gas with the other when u can feel the pressure built up on the wheels release the brake and floor it all u guys are too used to rwd burnouts  d okay i got a puzzler for yall how the hell do i do a burnout in my car i can drop the clutch at redline and i leave 4 1 foot long blackmarks then i goimrollin69 02132002 0315 pmok i wanna thank u all for the replies the playa pres i did exactly what u said and i was burnin out for like 20 mins on my street lol its all fucked up out there thanx alot for the help  d smoka firebird 02132002 0325 pmidelaysionl you could just crank it up to 40 or so yank the ebrake and do a 180 jturn and while your whipin around nail it youd have enough backwards momentum sp to really smoke em i would assume or you could do like 20 in reverse put in the clutch bring it to like 5000 or so rpms and drop the clutch im sure youd somke em pretty good that wait too you would also break shit pretty good that way so you probibly dont want to do it  dljason l 02132002 0329 pmoriginally posted by firebird idelaysionl you could just crank it up to 40 or so yank the ebrake and do a 180 jturn and

that sounds too easy devil can anyone verify this i have seen the fwd fuse so i know it is there but i havent pulled it for fear of breaking a couple differentials firebird 02132002 0405 pmi dont know about 4wd for shit so im no help if you really want to find out id say you should take it out if you really want toconfused and just drive it around if its rwd only it should drive a little different i would think if you want to do a burnout with it id say try it in bleach or water or something slippery just incase so you dont break anything personally id just leave it alonevinzul 10212004 0703 pmi think stick to somethng slippery to burn out in a car with out that much power or ya just break somethingpre98zetec 10212004 0729 pmthis thread is 2 years old ljason l 10212004 0743 pmahhh me 2
