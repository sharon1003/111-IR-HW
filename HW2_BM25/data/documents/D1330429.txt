intended it to be for children he did read it to his children though – wade aug 28 16 at 2217i read the hobbit when i was in second grade and its actually what started me down a long road of being an anti social bookworm that said i also read it last year 26 years old and it was still quite enjoyable – sidney apr 7 17 at 1426he did however say he regretted writing was that the word i think so but unable to check now and probably not any time soon it or considering it as a book for children in one of the letters at the very least but it seems that this was after the fact and as noted by wade he did read to his children the question is was it meant to be a book for children or did it just happen to be that in reality also did he regret it if he made it for children but its a light read really and if 5 year olds read harry potter – pryftan yesterdaypryftan yes he did realise after the fact that it was more suited for children and got quite upset i think its indeed in one of his letters this is partly why he tried to make lord of the rings much darker – wade 23 hours agoadd a comment7 answers active oldest votesup vote43down voteaccepted when tolkien began writing the hobbit in 1930 his children were 13 10 6 and 1 and he finished it two years later so if the story that he wrote it for his own children is true then presumably he hoped his two oldest children would enjoy it according to wikipedia in a 1955 letter to w h auden tolkien recollects that he began work on the hobbit one day early in the 1930s when he was marking school certificate papers he found a blank page suddenly inspired he wrote the words in a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit by late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends including c s lewis and a student of tolkiens named elaine griffiths in 1936 when griffiths was visited in oxford by susan dagnall a staff member of the publisher george allen  unwin she is reported to have either lent dagnall the book or suggested she borrow it from tolkien in any event miss dagnall was impressed by it and showed the book to stanley unwin who then asked his 10yearold son rayner to review it rayners favourable comments settled allen  unwins decision to publish tolkiens book so a contemporary 10 year old was able to enjoy the book if youre trying to ascertain whether your child would be able to enjoy it you should probably consider whether he knows a high enough percentage of the vocabulary to really understand it the story of the hobbit is not especially complicated  its the language that is difficult as i recall studies have shown that as long as children know approximately 85 of the vocabulary in a book they will have no difficulty filling in the rest from context though i have long since sold back that psych textbook and i cant seem to find a statistic online share improve this answeredited may 24 15 at 103wad cheber39k 28 379 534answered dec 22 11 at 431abcooper3070 17 233i read it at 12

dad read it to me over a series of nights when i was 5 or 6 and reportedly i enjoyed it i say reportedly because my own memories of this are vague although i do remember being terrified by the spiders in mirkwood – plutor dec 22 11 at 15201i read at 8 or 9 as did most of my friends my younger siblings read or had it read to them by the time they were 10 one of my brothers had the entire lord of the rings trilogy finished by 10 so as long as the child is a good reader they can enjoy it – the fallen jun 26 12 at 17132my six year old loved it we did read it together and took turns with the reading so she could ask questions if she needed to along the way  but she got far more than i expected her to and even picked up references to some of the myths and legends she has studied for history –

much more lotresque language and slowed her way down – zipquincy mar 25 13 at 1706show 2 more commentsup vote6down vote at what reading level should a child be to understand and enjoy the hobbit the lore states that the hobbit was written as a story by tolkien for his children but it is unclear if he intended them to read it themselves or be read to in any event the hobbit is not too challenging in terms of writing and there is enough action and adventure with little in the way of dry dusty passages which can appear in lotr id say that any child who has read books like the narnia series would be able to move onto the hobbit even if a child doesnt understand all of the words children by the age of 10 can easily learn mostly from context and as long as there is a willing parent nearby to help with the rest then there should be no problem the various adventures and action sequences are wellspaced to keep moderate attention spans occupied too for the record  i was 910 when i first read the hobbit id already read the narnia books at 7 and 8 and i read the lord of the rings almost right after although that took me a couple of months or so the librarian aid it was for 12 years oldshare

for his children and lot r was also for his children and was therefore 34 years more adult as his children were growing up however it is probably valid to argue that the children of an oxford english professor might have a slightly higher reading ability than average so i would say it was written for well read and educated 1012 year olds  i think he was looking at his older children initially as to what age it should be read at today i would say that any young teen or preteen should be able to give it a go depending on their personal reading maturity much under this and they may not have the understanding  of the ideas not just the words  to really appreciate and enjoy itshare improve this answeranswered dec 22 11 at 1143schroedingers cat6713 2 22 39add a commentup vote4down vote while it appears your question about tolkiens intentions for the book itself seem to have been answered i thought i would address the reading level aspect of the book reading level is determined by vocabulary and sentence structure complexity and actually does not generally consider the content itself at all the lexile framework score for the hobbit is 1000 which puts it at a reading level more diffficult and higher than most of the harry potter books hunger games and many other childrens and young adult fiction using the same reading level scoring system this is partially because some of the vocabulary is not current with our modern usage of the words so the reading level expectation has probably gone up simply because of changes in the way we speak even in the notquite 100 years since tolkien was working on the story using an ar score which stands for accelerated reader and is a different system for measuring reading challenge level it is considered a level 7 which puts it at the same level as door in the wall and bridge to terabithia rl scoring reading level which is the older measure for reading challenge says it should be read at about ninth or tenth grade having said all that since none of those measures truly consider content i think they are all a bit off the story in my opinion and based on the experience of many as well as tales of tolkiens intentions himself is that the book is written for a younger audience than any reading level score comes up with therefore my suggestion is to read it together and enjoy it kids will often understand a much greater amount of a story when it is read to them than when they have to read it by themselves it is a bonding experience for the both of you helps kids fall in love with books as it is an awesome story and the hobbit is lighthearted enough that your average 2nd or 3rd grader would probably enjoy it very much if heshe didnt have to read it alone if you have an advanced reader take turns reading your child can read some but youll be there to help and youll be there for your turn to give your child a break i am currently reading the book for a second time with my seven year old we read it to her when she was five as well and she remembers it well admittedly she has an awesome vocabulary for a kid her age but has absolutely no problem engaging in discourse about what has happened in the story she still isnt keen on reading it out loud to others our babysitter joined us for last nights family read and she wouldnt take a turn reading aloud but she loves the story and is always excited to read on and even said its still exciting and fun when it was pointed out that she already knew the end so have funshare improve this answeredited may 24 15 at 050wad cheber39k 28 379 534answered dec 12 13 at 1403balanced mama5532 4 28 62this is an interesting perspective as you mention the reading level expectation has probably gone up due to the shift in modern vocabulary is there any information regarding what the estimated reading level expectation was at the time it was published – phantom42 dec 12 13 at 1440phantom42 i dont know however i too heard he had his children in mind when writing it and i believe unwins son was about ten when he read it recollections from watching a special feature about the publishing of the books and an interview with unwin on the matter – balanced mama dec 12 13 at 2005as another comparison wind in the willows with its talking animals and youthful adventures is measured at a lexile of 1140 when looking at an unabridged version  no book by ray bradbury aldous huxley or frank herbert are ranked as higher than that though hg wells and orwell both have a couple that come in range clearly reading level may be a good way to measure how challenging vocabulary and sentence structure will be but not appropriateness of subject matter for the age group at hand – balanced mama dec 15 13 at 506add a commentup vote3down vote i read it the first time
