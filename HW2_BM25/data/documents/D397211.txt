lupron  leuprorelin acetate abbott laboratorieslupron ® injection leuprolide acetaterx only descriptionleuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone gn rh or lhrh the analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone the chemical name is 5oxolprolyllhistidylltryptophyllserylltyrosyldleucyllleucyllarginylnethyllprolinamide acetate salt with the following structural formula lupron injection is a sterile aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous injection it is available in a 28 m l multipledose vial containing leuprolide acetate 5 mgm l sodium chloride usp 63 mgm l for tonicity adjustment benzyl alcohol nf as a preservative 9 mgm l and water for injection usp the p h may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide nf andor acetic acid nf clinical pharmacologyleuprolide acetate an lhrh agonist acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion when given continuously and in therapeutic doses animal and human studies indicate that following an initial stimulation of gonadotropins chronic administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis this effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors prostatic tumors in noble and dunning male rats and dmbainduced mammary tumors in female rats as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs in humans subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone lh and follicle stimulating hormone fsh leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males and estrone and estradiol in premenopausal females however continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of lh and fsh in males testosterone is reduced to castrate levels in premenopausal females estrogens are reduced to postmenopausal levels these decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally pharmacokinetics absorption bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration distribution the mean steadystate volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 l in vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43 to 49 metabolism in healthy male volunteers a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 76 lh with a terminal elimination halflife of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model in rats and dogs administration of 14 clabeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides a pentapeptide metabolite i tripeptides metabolites ii and iii and a dipeptide metabolite iv these fragments may be further catabolized the major metabolite mi plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6 of the peak parent drug concentration one week after dosing mean plasma mi concentrations were approximately 20 of mean leuprolide concentrations excretion following administration of lupron depot 375 mg to 3 patients less than 5 of the dose was recovered as parent and mi metabolite in the urine special populations the pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients has not been determined drug interactions no pharmacokineticbased drugdrug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate however because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome p450 enzymes as noted in specific studies and the drug is only about 46 bound to plasma proteins drug interactions would not be expected to occur clinical studiesin a controlled study comparing lupron 1 mgday given subcutaneously to des diethylstilbestrol 3 mgday the survival rate for the two groups was comparable after two years of treatment the objective response to treatment was also similar for the two groups indications and usagelupron injection leuprolide acetate is indicated in the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer contraindicationslupron injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to gn rh gn rh agonist analogs or any of the excipients in lupron injection reports of anaphylactic reactions to gn rh agonist analogs have been reported in the medical literature lupron is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant while receiving the drug lupron may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman therefore the possibility exists that spontaneous abortion may occur if the drug is administered during pregnancy if this drug is administered during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking any formulation of lupron the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus warningsinitially lupron like other lhrh agonists causes increases in serum levels of testosterone transient worsening of symptoms or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of lupron treatment a small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain which can be managed symptomatically as with other lhrh agonists isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically before starting treatment with lupron pregnancy must be excluded see contraindications section periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostatespecific antigen psa levels is recommended especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved it should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology it is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions precautionspatients with metastatic vertebral lesions andor with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy see warnings and adverse reactions sections patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol an ingredient of the drugs vehicle may present symptoms of hypersensitivity usually local in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving gn rh agonists hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes monitor blood glucose andor glycosylated hemoglobin hb a1c periodically in patients receiving a gn rh agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes increased risk of developing myocardial infarction sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of gn rh agonists in men the risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer patients receiving a gn rh agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice information for patients see information for patients which appears after the reference section laboratory tests response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostatespecific antigen psa in the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued drug interactions see clinical pharmacology pharmacokinetics section druglaboratory test interactions administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitarygonadal system normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility twoyear carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rats and mice in rats a doserelated increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses 06 to 4 mgkg there was a significant but not doserelated increase of pancreatic isletcell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males highest incidence in the low dose group in mice no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mgkg for two years patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mgday and for two years with doses as high as 20 mgday without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems these studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential clinical and pharmacologic studies in adults ≥ 18 years with leuprolide acetate and similar analogs have shown full reversibility of fertility suppression when the drug is discontinued after continuous administration for periods of up to 24 weeks however no clinical studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate to assess the reversibility of fertility suppression pregnancy teratogenic effects pregnancy category x see contraindications and warnings sectionswhen administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 000024 00024 and 0024 mgkg 1600 to 16 the human dose to rabbits lupron produced a doserelated increase in major fetal abnormalities similar studies in rats failed to demonstrate an increase in major fetal malformations throughout gestation there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of lupron in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats the effects on fetal mortality are expected consequences of the alterations in hormonal levels brought about by this drug nursing mothers it is not known whether leuprolide acetate is excreted in human milk lupron should not be used by nursing mothers pediatric use see labeling for lupron injection for pediatric use for the safety and effectiveness in children with central precocious puberty geriatric use in the clinical trials for lupron injection the majority 69 of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age therefore the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics efficacy and safety of lupron in this population adverse reactionsclinical trials in the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment this transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms usually manifested by an increase in bone pain see warnings section in a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases andor urinary obstruction which if aggravated may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction in a comparative trial of lupron injection leuprolide acetate versus des in 5 or more of the patients receiving either drug the following

physician with any questions you may have or for information about lupron injection leuprolide acetate and its use what is lupron lupron injection leuprolide acetate is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone gn rh or lhrh a hormone which occurs naturally in your body normally your body releases small amounts of lhrh and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones however when you inject lupron injection leuprolide acetate the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes lupron must be injected because like insulin which is injected by diabetics lupron is inactive when taken by mouth if you were to discontinue the drug for any reason your body would begin making testosterone again directions for using lupronwash hands thoroughly with soap and water if using a new bottle for the first time flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use lupron check the liquid in the container if it is not clear or has particles in it do not use it exchange it at your pharmacy for another container remove outer wrapping from one syringe pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 02 m l or 20 unit mark take cover off needle push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the lupron bottle push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid slowly pull back on the plunger until the syringe fills to the 02 m l or 20 unit mark toward the end of a twoweek period the amount of lupron left in the bottle will be small take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down check for air bubbles in the syringe if you see any push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 02 m l or 20 unit mark do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles to protect your skin inject each daily dose at a different body spot choose an injection spot cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe hold the syringe in one hand hold the skin taut or pull up a little flesh with the other hand as you were instructed holding the syringe as you would a pencil thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90° angle push the plunger to administer the injection hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone never leave syringes needles or drugs where children can reach them some special adviceyou may experience hot flashes when using lupron injection leuprolide acetate during the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain increased difficulty in urinating and less commonly but most importantly you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms in any of these events discuss the symptoms with your doctor like other treatment options lupron may cause impotence notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning lupron treatment you may experience some irritation at the injection site such as burning itching or swelling these reactions are usually mild and go away if they do not tell your doctor if you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like lupron you should not use this drug do not stop taking your injections because you feel better you need an injection every day to make sure lupron keeps working for you if you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with lupron lowdose insulin syringes should be utilized when the drug level gets low take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle this will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses tell your pharmacist when you will need lupron so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it store below 77°f 25°c do not store near a radiator or other very warm place do not freeze protect from light store vial in carton until use do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up keep this and all other

testosterone and estradiol are reduced to prepubertal levels in males and females respectively reduction of gonadotropins will allow for normal physical and psychological growth and development natural maturation occurs when gonadotropins return to pubertal levels following discontinuation of leuprolide acetate the following physiologic effects have been noted with the chronic administration

organs will return to a prepubertal state menses menses if present will cease indications and usagelupron injection is indicated in the treatment of children with central precocious puberty children should be selected using the following criteria clinical diagnosis of cpp idiopathic or neurogenic with onset of secondary sexual characteristics earlier than 8 years in females and 9 years in males clinical diagnosis should be confirmed prior to initiation of therapy confirmation of diagnosis by a pubertal response to a gn rh stimulation test the sensitivity and methodology of this assay must be

and decreased fetal weights in rats and rabbits see precautions pregnancy teratogenic effects section the effects on fetal mortality are expected consequences of the alterations in hormonal levels brought about by this drug therefore the possibility exists that spontaneous abortion may occur if the drug is administered during pregnancy if this drug is administered during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking any formulation of lupron the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus warningsduring the early phase of therapy gonadotropins and sex steroids rise above baseline because of the natural stimulatory effect of the drug therefore an increase in clinical signs and symptoms may be observed see clinical pharmacology section noncompliance with drug regimen or inadequate dosing may result in inadequate control of the pubertal process the consequences of poor control include the return of pubertal signs such as menses breast development and testicular growth the longterm consequences of inadequate control of gonadal steroid secretion are unknown but may include a further compromise of adult stature precautionspatients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol an ingredient of the vehicle of lupron injection may present symptoms of hypersensitivity usually local in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site information for parents prior to starting therapy with lupron injection the parent or guardian must be aware of the importance of continuous therapy adherence to daily drug administration schedules must be accepted if therapy is to be successful irregular dosing could restart the maturation process during the first 2 months of therapy a female may experience menses or spotting if bleeding continues beyond the second month notify the physician any irritation at the injection site should be reported to the physician immediately if the child has experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like lupron this drug should not be used report any unusual signs or symptoms to the physician like continued pubertal changes substantial mood swings or behavioral changes laboratory tests response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored 12 months after the start of therapy with a gn rh stimulation test and sex steroid levels measurement of bone age for advancement should be done

progression of the condition is noted either clinically andor by laboratory parameters the first dose found to result in adequate downregulation can probably be maintained for the duration of therapy in most children however there are insufficient data to guide dosage adjustment as patients move into higher weight categories after beginning therapy at very young ages and low dosages it is recommended that adequate downregulation be verified in such patients whose weight has increased significantly while on therapy as with other drugs administered by injection the injection site should be varied periodically discontinuation of lupron injection should be considered before age 11 for females and age 12 for males the recommended starting dose is 50 mcgkgday administered as a single subcutaneous injection if total downregulation is not achieved the dose should be titrated upward by 10 mcgkgday this dose will be considered the maintenance dose follow the pictorial directions on
