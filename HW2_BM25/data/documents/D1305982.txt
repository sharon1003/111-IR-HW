what is emv chip card technology emv definitionemv® is a global standard for credit and debit payment cards based on chip card technology taking its name from the card schemes europay master card and visa  the original card schemes that developed it the standard covers the processing of credit and debit card payments using a card that contains a microprocessor chip chip and pin definition these transactions are often referred to as chip and pin because pin entry is required to verify the customer is the genuine cardholder this is a simplification since the emv specifications include other cardholder verification methods as well emv vs magnetic stripe transactions unlike magnetic stripe transactions where typically only the cards track 2 data containing the card number and expiry date is processed every chip card transaction contain dozens of pieces of information to be exchanged between the card the terminal and the acquiring bank or processors host this requires the terminal to perform many stages of complex processing including cryptographic authentication to successfully complete a transaction this means that adding support for emv to existing payment applications can be a daunting task for more information on the main processing steps required in an emv transaction please review this diagram showing a typical emv transaction flow emv in the usaif you are looking to migrate to emv in the usa please take a look at our more detailed emv page dedicated to u s emv migration emv in numbers emvco published its latest emv deployment figures in june 2016 in 2015 358 of all chip cardpresent transactions  both contact and contactless  used emv chip technology this is up from 32 compared to 2014 there are now over 48 billion emv payment cards in circulation which is an increase of 14 billion in 2014 in the united states at the end of 2014 only 012 of transactions were emv chipbased however this is expected to rapidly increase as the u s undergoes emv migration the emv transition started to accelerate in 2015 and is continuing apace in the first half of 2016 emv testing before an emv capable solution can be deployed there are many emvco mandated tests that need to be passed to validate that an emv implementation conforms to the emv standard as the emv specifications evolve and are regularly updated this can become a major job in itself  another reason why many businesses who require an emv chip  pin or chip  signature solution opt to license a purpose built off the shelf emv software kerne l rather than develop their own in house emv glossary to understand more about some of the terminology used in emv weve compiled a useful glossary of terms a guide to emv level 2 contactless card scheme defines their own requirements for contactless cards that comply with that scheme’s specifications please take a look at our more detailed world of contactless emv insights about emvco emvco is jointly owned by american express discover jcb master card union pay and visa it manages maintains and enhances the emv specifications to ensure global interoperability of chip cards with acceptance devices such as point of sale terminals and atms all our emv kernels are emvco compliant and we are proud to have achieved a 100 first time pass rate
