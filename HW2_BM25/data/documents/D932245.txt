hnsindie z is for o zgur click here for a list of other azers throughout april i invited 26 authorswho had been selected as editors choice by the historical novel society indie reviews to help me out with the 2016 az blog challenge except to be a little different interviewed their leading characters today is the last character and is f r om  hh  hello i believe you exist in ozgur’s novel – what is the title of the book and would you like to introduce yourself  who you are what you do etc my name is coya i am still learning how to read but my friend jan has told me the book is called the wrath of brotherhood i would like to read it so i can understand these strange events more but i only encountered english for the first time a few years ago when the englishmen came in their ships to take jamaica away from the spanish i grew up in the jungles and mountains of what the spanish call new granada my people fled the fall of the incas and the dominance of spain to the west many generations ago but the spanish found us at last and destroyed my village among others i was thirteen years old but i survived in the wild and made my way to the outskirts of cartagena the families in our village all had excellent sight at night and this helped me to escape and make a living thieving from the spanish i hate that i must do this but i have little mercy for the spaniards whose language i had to learn to survive i was overjoyed when after stowing away aboard a tall ship bound for santiago de la vega i finally witnessed a spanish defeat by the wonderful english people when they took the port and renamed it cagway or port royal when i met captain roy toppings he saw my abilities in a way i had never considered and he invited me to join his crew as a scout hh  where and when are you are you a real historical person or did your author create you i dont understand the european calendars much but it is may of the year 1660 i know this because the sailors of port royal never cease talking about when someone named charles‒seemingly the second one though ive met others named charles here‒will come to england to rule at the beginning of next month at least it was the beginning of may when we left port royal in jamaica since then i have spent much time in curaçao and along the coast of new granada what you call south america from caracas to coro i and my village were created from nothing by the author i am saddened that my village which i felt such grief for losing never truly existed hh in a few brief sentences what is the novel you feature in about the motivation for many of us seems to be revenge‒especially for captain roy toppings and for me but it seems to me now that both of us are mistaken in some part of our revenge his will lead him to a bad place if the spanish invasion we became involved with is any kind of omen but now i feel mine is perhaps satisfied hh  i ‘met’ my pirate jesamiah acorne on a beach in dorset england  how did your author meet up with you my creator had a need in this world for many different views and experiences among his crew mine was a unique view to him and a unique set of skills and yet the other brethren of the coast are my brothers because we are all aboard the constance to reach beyond mere survival in a world being strangled by spaniards hh  tell me about one or two of the other characters who feature with you  husband wife family who are some of the nice characters and who is the nastiest one there is my friend the surgeon named jan he understands my situation somehow though he has never shared my experiences of course captain roy toppings who saved me from my life alone in the wild i feel much gratitude and respect for him but i worry about him also ajuban his first mate shares much in common with me because he was a slave owned by spaniards before roy freed him i dont know about nasty characters all spanish are my enemiesbut there was the dutch merchant captain marius gilbertsen no one has anything good to say of him and i feel i have not seen him for the last time and there is major manuel benito he is now our prisoner and he has worked against us but for some reason i also respect him and i do not know how to feel about that my crewmate daniel he looks at me in a way that i do not like at all he is the only crewmate i do not feel i would mourn hh  what is your favourite scene in the book there are many i remember with joy however as unpleasant as it was to participate in i am very proud of the part i played in the final battle i was in the hold of an enemy ship and all my information came from what i could hear i had a vital task to perform and i succeeded now that i think on it that was the true moment when my vengeance was granted hh  what is your least favourite maybe a frightening or sad moment that your author wrote before the scene i just told you about i didnt know it at the time but it was revealed why my friend jan was really part of our crew he should have no need for the wage‒he was a skilled city surgeon when william read his notes back to me and i learned jans true reason i was deeply saddened and i didnt want him to read any more hh  what are you most proud of about your author he made me think about all the things that happened in my life i had always thought about what had happened to me in one way thought of spaniards in one way thought of my future in one way he made me really see things differently and i can feel that it is much better medicine for me than the last seventeen years in the wild alone with my thoughts capn ozgur sahin hh  has your author written other books about you if not about other characters he has just finished writing the first version of another book with me in it but i dont yet know what it will be called i am almost afraid to read it i have many worries about jan and about the spaniards but most of all i have worries about roy i think he is in a bad place now and i dont want it to get any worse hh  how do you feel about your author going off with someone else i think if he can do for other characters what he has done for me can improve their lives the same way it will be good for us all i have had enough good fortune to worry over these things hh  as a character if you could travel to a time and place different to your own fictional setting where and when would you go i am still exploring the wonders and terrors of this place i cannot imagine how to answer such a large question i would like to see how my ancestors truly lived and i would like to one day see the museums in spain where i hear the relics of my people are once again revered by scholars but i would love to see the future one day when men have mastered the underworld and the middle world of men and begin to explore the sky and the world of the gods and i would like to see magic as my parents once told me of‒just once before i die thank you that was really interesting now where can readers of this az blog challenge
