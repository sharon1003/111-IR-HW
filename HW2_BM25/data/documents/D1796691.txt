los angeles market watch—in case you didn’t notice saturday marked president barack obama’s 2000th day in the oval office and so it’s fitting to measure the stock market’s performance during his tenure with that of recent administrations obama was sworn in amid extreme financial turmoil in january 2009 roughly six weeks before the stock markets hit bottom in the depths of the great recession pretty much the only direction for stocks to go was up how far up though more important how do gains under obama compare with those under other presidents who made it to 2000 days answer he’s in the top half of the eight presidents since the great depression whose time in office lasted that long that can always change of course and there’s considerable debate over whether he—or any president for that matter—can influence the stock market or whether white house incumbents are just along for the ride“i wouldn’t be looking to give the administration a lot of credit for the stock market’s performance” said sam stovall managing director of u s equity strategy at sp capital iq he noted however that stocks generally do better under democrats than republicans particularly when stocks start out low as of right now obama ranks third behind top finisher bill clinton and runnerup franklin roosevelt in terms of stock gains according to our calculations after obama in order it’s ronald reagan dwight eisenhower harry truman george w bush and richard nixon yes nixon barely made it into the club he resigned 2027 days into his presidency amid the watergate scandal there are a few surprises in the data first obama not only finished ahead of reagan thought by many to be the architect of one of the greatest economic recoveries of the 20th century but as of friday’s trading session the last before obama’s 2000th day he was well ahead of reagan major stock indexes have averaged gains of more than 142 under obama while they were up 88 at this same point in the reagan years pan the economic lens out though and the gap closes you’ll see stock gains averaged just under 113 by the time reagan had completed his full eight years or 2922 days in office that’s still short of the market’s current advance under obama but all it would take is a cumulative drop of roughly 94 in the three indexes over the next 2 12 years and obama could fall below that mark by the time his second term ends which is within the realm of possibility note that the dow jones industrial average djia 090 thrived during reagan’s last 2 ½ years despite the 1987 crash and ended up gaining more than 130 in all well ahead of obama’s current 105 gain on the other hand the nasdaq composite index comp 036 has flourished under obama it’s up 190 thus far compared with 94 for reagan’s two full terms for now the president seems to be basking in that glory obama pointed out in a speech on thursday that americans are doing better by “almost every measure”democrats over republicans 41another surprise also sure to rankle the right is that the average stockmarket gain under four postdepression democrats through each one’s 2000th day in office has outpaced the average gain of the four republicans in the era by a factor of nearly 4 to 1 democratic gains have averaged 133 while republican market advances have had a mean of 33 stovall noted that the pattern follows historic precedent when there’s a split congress democratic presidents see four times the gains that republicans do as well as when democratic administrations do battle with a unified republican congress markets however do better under republicans when they control the white house and both houses of congress than democrats do when in the same catbird seat before embarking further a word about market watch’s methodology we averaged the changes in the dow nasdaq and sp 500 spx 055 for the first 2000 days for four of the eight post—great depression presidents who made it that far reagan clinton george w bush and obama for eisenhower and nixon only dow and sp data were available and for roosevelt and truman it was just the dow starting with a jan 20 date for inauguration day the 2000th page on the office daily calendar turned for six of the presidents halfway through their sixth year on july 12 the dates were different for roosevelt who was first sworn in back when inauguration day was march 4 and truman who assumed power when roosevelt died shortly into his fourth term in april 1945 we didn’t limit our examination to 2000day presidents we also looked at stock gains under all chief executives since f d r in that study obama would remain in the top three even if stocks were flat for the rest of his term and he would climb to second behind clinton if they grew at their current pace if they drop of course it’s anyone’s guess where the obama presidency ends up in investing history a few caveats economists have done similar examinations that probably are more scientific than market watch’s one potential flaw is that we didn’t take dividends or inflation into account the percentage gains are based solely on nominal numbers available we figure that we’re looking at percentage gains during that 5 ½year window where inflation largely remained a constant through that period feel free to poke holes in that logic morgan housel senior analyst at motley fool wasn’t afraid to do so“including dividends is not only fair but essential as over time they represent a large chunk of the market’s overall returns” housel said he pointed out that gerald ford would top the sp list when dividend returns are entered into the mix those dividends were strong enough to keep him there even when you factor in the crippling inflation of the day his immediate successor jimmy carter falls down housel’s list mostly because inflation severely hampered returns and led to his loss after one term to reagan still obama does well by housel’s measure finishing second to ford among presidents in the postdepression era one spot ahead of clinton that’s due mostly to extremely low inflation during obama’s term further our time range is limited since the modern economy and government’s role in it took shape during and after the great depression we decided to examine gains or losses dating back only to the roosevelt administration the relatively small sampling of 2000day presidents also may skew the data a broader look at all 13 chief executives from f d r to obama offers a more impressive view of the current president but it also closes the gap between democrats and republicans on overall stock performance by including all seven democrats in this category it drops their party’s average gain to 109 while the addition of two more republicans brings that group of six’s average up to 46“i don’t think we have a big enough sample size” housel said he said other databases over a longer time frame still would show a slight advantage for democrats but the gap is minimal yet democrats seem to generally be doing better than republicans in the modern era while the gains have been meager at times all seven democrats have presided over stock gains two republican administrations—that of the scandalplagued nixon and the crashriddled george w bush—posted the only losses one thing to note is that no 2 roosevelt and no 3 obama came to power when stocks were in or near a trough in f d r’s case his predecessor republican herbert hoover presided over a spectacular crash in stocks that led to the great depression for obama the george w bush years laid the groundwork for a big upward swing when a number of banks failed and the markets tumbled late in that presidency starting from scratch“it would have been a good time to start for any president” said allan drazen professor of economics at the university of maryland “given the large drop it’s not surprising that obama does well”by far though the most impressive stockmarket gains were made in the clinton era when the stock market far outgained the market during any other administration leaping nearly 244 all three stock indexes more than tripled while the nasdaq nearly quadrupled amid the dotcom boom“how much of clinton’s overthemoon performance was due to his ability to have pretty good policy and how much was his ability to not mess things up” drazen asked he theorized that because clinton was up against an uncooperative congress deficits came down and thus halo effect emerged over the stock market republicans aim to put obama in a similar situation after the midterm elections this fall so when all is said and done how will stocks have fared under obama as leaves office in january 2017 if growth remains on its current pace average gains for the three indexes should more than triple to 208 putting obama in second place behind clinton that’s a big if though another prospective surprise it could do better some economists who follow presidents and stock markets theorize that the third year of a fouryear term usually is productive for investors as the government is trying to push through programs that appeal to the public and help boost the economy the idea is to prepare for the fourth year when elections take place and incumbents either are trying to get reelected or set the table for their party’s nominee the third year of obama’s second term starts in january so under that theory stocks could rise at an even faster pace and if drazen is correct that could be amplified if republicans seize control of both chambers of congress peter cohan a management consultant and professor at babson college in wellesley mass said there still is room for growth in stocks if pricetoearnings ratios are any indication “the pe ratios arent at speculative levels” he said “even though the market has gone up so much it’s not in bubble territory”cohan said pe ratios now stand at 19 or 20 at the height of the dotcom bubble they were 40 during the 2007 housing bubble ratios had climbed to 60 others aren’t so sure that obama will follow the typical thirdyear path for one the third year of his first term 2011 didn’t bring a remarkable bonanza for stocks the markets were largely flat that year since then stocks have been on a tear and many are predicting they’re due for a fall and as this term’s third year approaches many of the things presidents try to do in preparation for the next election such as keeping inflation down don’t really apply to obama the federal reserve in fact is looking to finally raise interest rates after so many down years and given obama’s rancorous relationship with republicans in congress any attempts he might make to stimulate the economy could be met with stiff resistance“i think there’s a fairly good presumption of even if he wanted to do that he couldn’t” said drazen more from market watch why every investor should be terrified by the slide in home depot stock delta flight scare is a
