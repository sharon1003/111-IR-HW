memory  the brain introduction parts of the brain neurons  synapses parts of the brainthe human brain is hugely interconnected but three major components can be identified the cerebrum the cerebellum and the brain stem the brainstem which includes the medulla the pons and the midbrain controls breathing digestion heart rate and other autonomic processes as well as connecting the brain with the spinal cord and the rest of the body the cerebellum plays an important role in balance motor control but is also involved in some cognitive functions such as attention language emotional functions such as regulating fear and pleasure responses and in the processing of procedural memories the cerebrum or forebrain  which makes up 75 of the brain by volume and 85 by weight is divided by a large groove known as the longitudinal fissure into two distinct hemispheres the left and right hemispheres left and right refer to the owners point of view not an outside viewers are linked by a large bundle of nerve fibres called the corpus callosum and also by other smaller connections called commissures most of the important elements of the cerebrum are split into symmetrical pairs in the left and right hemispheres thus we often speak of the temporal lobes hippocampi etc in the plural although this website generally follows the convention of speaking of the temporal lobe hippocampus etc in the singular which should therefore be taken to mean both sides within both hemispheres the two hemispheres look similar but are slightly different in structure and perform different functions the right hemisphere generally controls the left side of the body and vice versa although popular notions that logic creativity etc are restricted to the left or right hemispheres are largely simplistic and unfounded lobes of the cerebral cortex picture from wikipedia httpenwikipediaorgwikihumanbrainthe cerebrum is covered by a sheet of neural tissue known as the cerebral cortex or neocortex  which envelops other brain organs such as the thalamus which evolved to help relay information from the brain stem and spinal cord to the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus and pituitary gland which control visceral functions body temperature and behavioural responses such as feeding drinking sexual response aggression and pleasure the cerebral cortex itself is only 2  4 mm thick and contains six distinct but interconnected layers it is intricately grooved and folded into the familiar convoluted pattern of folds or gyri allowing a large surface area typically almost 2m 2 to fit within the confines of the skull consequently more than twothirds of the cerebral cortex is buried in the grooves or sulci about 90 of all the brain’s neurons are located in the cerebral cortex mainly in the grey matter which makes up the surface regions of the cerebral cortex while the inner white matter consists mainly of myelinated axons over 170000 km of them as many as five times that number of glial cells exist to support the active nerve cells the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory attention perceptual awareness thought language and consciousness it is divided into four main regions or lobes which cover both hemispheres the frontal lobe involved in conscious thought and higher mental functions such as decisionmaking particularly in that part of the frontal lobe known as the prefrontal cortex and plays an important part in processing shortterm memories and retaining longer term memories which are not taskbased the parietal lobe involved in integrating sensory information from the various senses and in the manipulation of objects in determining spatial sense and navigation the temporal lobe involved with the senses of smell and sound the processing of semantics in both speech and vision including the processing of complex stimuli like faces and scenes and plays a key role in the formation of longterm memory  and the occipital lobe mainly involved with the sense of sight the limbic system and basal ganglia picture from how stuff works httppeoplehowstuffworkscom swearinghtmprintablethe medial temporal lobe the inner part of the temporal lobe near the divide between the left and right hemispheres in particular is thought to be involved in declarative and episodic memory deep inside the medial temporal lobe is the region of the brain known as the limbic system which includes the hippocampus the amygdala the cingulate gyrus the thalamus the hypothalamus the epithalamus the mammillary body and other organs many of which are of particular relevance to the processing of memory the hippocampus for example is essential for memory function particularly the transference from short to longterm memory and control of spatial memory and behaviour the hippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain capable actually growing new neurons although this ability is impaired by stressrelated glucocorticoids the amygdala also performs a primary role in the processing and memory of emotional reactions and social and sexual behaviour as well as regulating the sense of smell another subcortical systems inside the cerebral cortex which is essential to memory function is the basal ganglia system particularly the striatum or neostriatum which is important in the formation and retrieval of procedural memory back to top of page home  contact  search
