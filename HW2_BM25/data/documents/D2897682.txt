the monument valley team has created a dream of a vr game aaron souppouris aaron is social092115 comments12shares its a tough act to follow selling over 2 million copies of a game in a single year thats the task that ustwo the british developer behind the awardwinning monument valley was facing as it started work on its latest effort lands end a virtual reality adventure game created exclusively for samsungs gear vr headset going from building a game for mobile to one that will only run on a specific accessory for a handful of samsung phones is a bold move and as the studios lead designer and technical director explain it wasnt even their initial plan due for release on october 30th lands end is a firstperson game that plays out like an oldschool pointandclick adventure something like myst except with no actual pointing or clicking maybe lookandstare adventure is a more apt title for the genre as its presented here you move your head to look around a scene and navigate from point to point by fixing your gaze on small white indicators you just focus on a point for a second or so and then you start moving your browser does not currently recognize any of the

through the demo he explained that while the game was still being prototyped as a nonvr title the studio tried out the gear vr headset and was impressed by the step change it represented over the thencurrent oculus rift development kit going from something that felt like this clunky bit of technology on your head to having a relatively light wellfitting goodtracking lowlatency headset  it was exciting to see that following the initial reaction the team decided to spend some time trying vr stuff and things grew from there every few minutes youll come across a puzzle which will require you to levitate blocks or join dots — again using nothing but head movements and indicators — to advance the two levels we played offered a relaxing almost purifying experience we explored the pastelhued dreamlike locales at our own pace took in the scenery and solved the gentle puzzles without great difficulty the experience leaves a feeling like somehow youve been to this world before even though you know you havent a false memory perhaps evoked by the common spirit shared between lands end and monument valley as in its predecessor the complexity of the puzzles does increase with each level but never to the point where it becomes too taxing despite the similarity in tone though lands end feels fresh and new its not a sequel or something derivative of ustwos past success figuring out how to enable movement in vr without inducing nausea took months helping maintain this relaxed soothing experience was the fact that even after 30 minutes or so lands end didnt provoke even a hint of nausea its something many complain about with vr figuring out exactly how the movement should work apparently took months early concepts saw you sat on the shoulders of a giant telling it where to go said pashley but it quickly became apparent that gamers felt sick when they werent in full control of the motion the end result of ustwos experimentation is a controlled slow game the fact that movement is pretty much in a straight line and at a deliberate speed is good for nausea pashley continued but the fact that you focus on a point first youre paying attention and your mind is focused in that direction really helps as well the comparisons to monument valley are inevitable as is the fact that when you try you can find analogs between the two the team has grown with its success from eight up to the 11 creatives who work from ustwos office in the heart of londons east end but the key names involved in its first game remain while pashley led programming on monument valley it was ken wong lead designer at the studio whose concept drawings first inspired what was then betterknown as a design agency to risk close to 1 million by developing monument valley and its wong leading the design on lands end we thought we were building monument valley for hipsters we thought we were building monument valley for hipsters wong explained but it wasnt long after release that the studio realized its wider impact everyone i meet thats played it tells me oh i played it with my niece or oh i showed it to my dad and he doesnt even like computer games and still got into it that made making that game so rewarding  to know that were getting through to people that dont like games at this point pashley interjects it felt like a validation of our approach he said that if we try to make something the best we can and the best designed for the platform its on then people will like it and itll end up being worth it wong agreed adding that even though lands end is a singleplayer experience that aspect of sharing is something that wed really like to have again both pashley and wong like everyone else involved in the game must know that even a perfect gear vr game will not get close to monument valley s multimilliondollar success although we dont know the total number of samsung headsets out there its surely nowhere near a million let alone two but ustwo still has lofty ambitions we hope that itll be the thing that people use to show off gear vr said wong that if people have tried the gear vr theyve tried lands end  in some ways the desire for lands end to be a defining moment in the evolution of vr is even more ambitious than just selling a few million copies wong talked dreamily of early adopters and vr enthusiasts taking their headsets to cafes picnics or bars and excitedly sharing ustwos creation with their friends its a nice thought and given monument valley s success not an impossible one so lands end is a singleplayer game then but one thats meant for sharing its short even by mobile standards with roughly an hours worth of gameplay in total ustwo envisions players taking in the game over a few sessions  i think only me and my girlfriend have played it all in one sitting said wong its not really intended for that  were totally aiming for a very casual audience anyone that could possibly be interested in vr come check out lands end  if you have a gear vr you should check it out its out on october 30th for an undisclosed price but wed happily pay a few dollars just for the two stages there are five in total weve played through its impossible to say if ustwo has achieved its goal and made not just a vr game but an early ambassador for the notyetunderstood mobile vr space but its definitely made a good vr game and one that feels polished and accessible to the point that you could probably hand it to an aging relative and theyd still have a blast images ustwo in this article lands end mobilepostcross monument valley

hand” add special tags while they are approving videos so that parents can filter out or select new settings feature this way if i don’t want my son to see any video with fighting eg power rangers in it i can just choose “no fighting” no “witches” or “zombies” there’s a lot of content that are still good for kids but that many parents wouldn’t want their kids to see at their age maybe also have an option in report button to suggest a parental control keyword on the videos incase if you have “no fighting” but a video still showed up that contains fighting  or simply just block that one video the filter feature will be good to block all those videos you don’t want showing up for your kids that will be one of the best and useful features in the app retired at 24 the life of a pro call of duty
