drug at lowest effective dose for shortest possible time assess riskbenefit ratio for the motherinfant pair give proper advice to mother about drug safety for better compliancegolden rules of drug use during breast feeding drug therapy rarely is a reason to stop breast feeding  if a drug is unsafe allow breast feeding only after four or five elimination half lives t12 of the drug  monitor baby for adverse reactions in first trimester is when we want to hold back on medications because that is when most of the nervous system is developing  in the first 12 weeks if the drug is unsafe then we have to have the mother to stop breast feeding if giving a med that is contraindicated  the mother has to come up with formula for 4 or 5 half lives or pump to get breast milk before the drug is administered fda pregnancy category a  safe  controlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester and there is no evidence of a risk in late trimesters possibility of fetal harm appears remote an example replacement dose of thyroid hormones fda pregnancy category b animal studies showed no harm to fetus and there are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women or animal studies have shown an adverse effect but adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus fda pregnancy category c either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus teratogenic or embryocidal or other and there are no controlled studies in women or studies in women and animals are not available drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to fetus we dont what it doing in humans or in animals fda pregnancy category d there is positive evidence of human fetal risk but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk if the drug is needed in a lifethreatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective cut off fda pregnancy category x completely contrainidicated even if there is a benefit  it is extremely dangerous most have a black box warning studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience or both and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant examples are thalidomide retinoids etc accutaneâ€”will absolutely cause clef palatefactors determining placental drug transfer and toxicity in fetus most drugs can cross placenta and expose developing embryo and fetus question is whether or not f the effect is substantial factors affecting placental drug transfer and toxicity are physiochemical properties of drug chemical qualities amount of drug stage of pregnancy at the time of exposure to the drug preembryonic embryonic and fetal stagethe major issue duration of exposure to a drug physiochemical properties of a drug lipid solubility high lipid solubility  high concentration in placenta thiopental crosses placenta almost immediately and can produce sedation or apnea in the newborn high ionization low concentration in placenta highly ionized drugs such as succinylcholine cross placenta slowly ex biaphentohol use to induce anesthesia  the infant would get a big dose  so if you give this to a mother for a csection the baby might be born not breathing on its own physiochemical properties of a drug molecular weight mw 250  500 daltons cross placenta easily mw 500  1000 daltons cross placenta with difficulty mw  1000 daltons cannot cross placenta heparin insulin the larger the drug the better they arephysiochemical properties of a drug placental transporters many drug transporters have been identified in placenta pglycoprotein mdr1 gene pumps back drugs vinblastine doxorubicin into maternal circulation bcrp transporter pumped back glyburide but not all hypoglycemics drug metabolism by placenta placenta contains some drug metabolizing enzymes hydroxylation  demethylationeffects of pregnancy volume of distribution increased body water and fat increases the volume of distribution of drugs increased loading dose required total body water goes up and blood volume goes up so have to give a little bit more medication to get the same effect for a pregnant woman effects of pregnancy protein binding plasma albumin level decreases in pregnancy allowing an increased unbound level of drugs effects of pregnancy metabolism increased progesterone causes more cyp450 enzyme induction leading to increased hepatic drug metabolism progesterone needed to maintain pregnancy but when level gets high in pregnancy it will super induce cp450 and drugs will get metab faster effects of pregnancy excretion increased renal blood flow and gfr results in a markedly increased elimination of lactam antibiotics aminoglycosides digoxin lithium phenytoin effects of drug on pregnancy fetus and neonate pharmacodynamic 1 increased sensitivity of mother tissue altered effects of drugs on reproductive tissue breast uterus such as the increased effect of oxytocin on uterine muscle pregnancy induced diabetes mellitus  worry about controlling blood glucose decreased sensitivity of the insulin receptors so easier for pregnant woman to be hyperglycemic sensitivity of oxytocin receptor goes way up have in increase of effect 2 in some cases treatment of the fetus can be achieved by giving drug to the mother flecainide used for fetal tachycardia corticosteroids to stimulate lung maturity 3 for a few drugs we have predictable adverse effects in the fetus female fetuses exposed to diethylstilbestrol have increased risk for adenocarcinoma of the vagina after puberty teratogen an agent drug chemical or infectious disease that interferes with the normal growth and development of the fetus can be chemical infectious disease or outside energy souce lost of things considered teratogens and things that need to be modified when dosing the patient teratogenic mechanisms are poorly understood and are often multifactorial drugs may produce teratogenic effects by drugs may produce teratogenic effects by 1 direct effect on maternal tissues with secondary or indirect effects on fetal tissues 2 interfere with passage of oxygen or nutrients through placenta 3 direct actions on the processes of differentiation in developing tissues 4 causing deficiency of some essential substance sulfonamides interfering with folic acid and increasing risk of neural tube defects drug therapy during lactation drugs that pass minimally into milk acid drugs highly protein bound drugs low lipid solubility drug weakly basic drug with low plasma protein binding and highly lipophilic will achieve higher concentrations in milk one thing to think about and to ask if the woman if there is any chance they are pregnant or if they are breastfeeding acid drugs with low lipid solubility dont pass in the milk very well factors determining drug concentrations in milk p ka of drug fraction of drug that is ionized at a given p h basic drugs are ionized at an acidic p h and trapped in milk acidic drugs are ionized at a higher p h trapped in maternal plasma look to see if it will be trapped in milk or not protein binding highly protein bound means less transfer to milk lipophilicity highly lipophilic drugs transfer easily to milk molecular weight of drug high mw means less drug in milk insulin heparin do not enter breast milk nursing time of baby in relation to drug use and metabolism short acting med and the mother is going to us e it  treat mother and then wait to breast feed the child and then can pump milk after that and discard milk to plasma concentration mp ratio for most drugs the mp ratio is 1 in general drugs with higher mp ratios 5 are considered unsafe until extensively studied in the fetus estimating risk to an infant if the mp ratio of a drug is known the amount dose  d of a drug ingested by an infant via breast milk can be calculated by dinfant  cpmat x mp x vmax cpmat  average maternal plasma concentration vmax  volume of milk assumed to be 150ml for most drugs without significant toxicity in adults an exposure amount less than 10 of the weight adjusted maternal dose is acceptable methods of decreasing toxicity in nursing select drugs that are safe in adults nurse immediately before taking the drug make sure that three or four hours transpire before the next feeding avoid feeding when the drug reaches its peak concentration in milk and plasma use drugs with a short half life instruct patient to monitor adverse effects in the infant common drugs excreted in breast milk most antibiotics taken by nursing mothers can be detected in breast milk tetracycline concentrations in breast milk are usually 70 of maternal serum concentrations and thus present a risk of permanent tooth staining in the infant isoniazid rapidly reaches equilibrium between breast milk and maternal blood pyridoxine deficiency may occur in the infant if the mother is not given pyridoxine supplements inh for tb treatment and profalyaxisis most sedatives and hypnotics enters breast milk in amounts sufficient to produce a pharmacologic effect in infants drugs generally regarded as safe during lactation ace inhibitors antihistamines benzodiazepines lactum antibiotics calcium channel blockers nsaids except piroxicam phenothiazines tricyclic antidepressaants acyclovir aminosalicylic acid carbamazepine clarithromycin codeine digoxin erythromycin famotidine heparin insulin mebendazole methyldopa metoprolol morphine acetaminophen phenytoin prednisone propranolol trimethoprim valproic acid warfarin can use almost any meds in breast feeding some drugs cant be used in pregnancy but can be used while breast feeding choose the med that wont cross over into the milk you will develop a set of drugs that you will use but the only time you wont use them if someone is allergic drugs contraindicated during breast feeding amphetamine bromocriptine heroin lithium crosses very esily into breast milk phencyclidine cocaine cyclosporine ergotamine marijuana drugs that may suppress lactation androgens clomiphene citrate mao inhibitors ergot derivatives bromocriptine thiazide diuretics levodopa highdose pyridoxine marijuana difficult to estimate the effect of marijuana alone polydrug use variation in amount smoked differences in strength of cigarettes social factors no definite proof of malformations may be associated with growth retardation any smoking cause uterine growth retardation may be associated with abnormal neurological development inconsistent finding may be associated with prematurity very doubtful effects more likely to occur with heavier use this is pregnancy category d because we dont really know the effect cocaine and amphetamines lower birth weight smaller head size smaller brain shorter length greater risk of intrauterine growth retardation iugr and genitourinary and cardiac defects really substantial effects the fetus will have a smaller brain lower scores on neonatal and childhood developmental exams increased risk for sids sids rate at least 20 higher increased risk for cerebral hemorrhage decreases blood flow to uterus decreases fetal oxygenation and intestinal blood flow lower scores in neurodevelopment infancy and aggressive behavior beginning at 8 yrs of age noted have control issues they dont et frontal lobe control as they get older there was some effect in the development of cnsopiates increased incidence of low birth weight iugr prematurity 24 fold higher risk for sids longterm developmental abnormalities lower scores on iq  language tests even when placed in foster homes  withdrawal symptoms are the main risk 4080  abnormal sleep pattern irritability seizures fever sweating tachypnea sneezing excessive sucking poor feeding loose stools vomiting symptoms may occur much later and last longer 230 days with methadone biggest issue is withdrawal and very significant in a child  seizures etc they have more impact associations include an increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases in the newborn hyperbilirubinemia and poor social situation true for all drugs of abuse mother is more like to have a std and pass to the child in the birth canal when looking at the kids long term they tend to have lower cognitive function because of the chronic opiate suppression benzodiazepines milk levels of benzodiazepines are not excessive but sedation has been reported on occasion in breastfed infants if a sedative required shorter halflife drugs such as lorazepam and midazolam are preferred long term exposure not recommended metformin 1 malformation rate in the general population taking metformin all pregnancy diabetics 7 among disease matched cohorts p001 pregnant diabetics who have comorbidities this proves that we cant rely on the low risk potential protective effect possibly because of improvement in insulin resistance and in androgen status type 2 diabetics who get pregnant  they have been taking metformin not knowing there were pregnant not a huge elevation of malformations if you match diseases other than dm the risk rises they need to stop their oral hypoglycemic and need to be stared on insulin macrolides erythromycin erythromycin is a category b drug erythromycin base and succinate forms are considered safe for use during pregnancy estolate is associated with a 10 to 15 incidence of reversible hepatotoxicity in mothers during the second half of pregnancy macrolides azithromycin category b safe in pregnancy  for ppl who allergic to pcnmacrolides clarithromycin category c has been shown to cause teratogenic effects in animals but its effects in humans are unknown used in pregnant females and nothing has shown adverse effects but animal data show some possible effects aminoglycosides only gentamycin is listed in category c the other agents eg tobramycin amikacin streptomycin kanamycin are category d these agents should be avoided during pregnancy eighth cranial nerve damage in children deafness lactation compatible with breastfeeding not absorbed through gi tract can be used in breastfeeding bc they wont be absorbed tetracyclines tetracyclines are in category d they are known teratogens tetracycline can deposit in growing bones and decrease bone formation these agents can also cause a yellowbrown discoloration of teeth hypoplasia and enamel defects lethal fatty liver degeneration and pancreatitis have been reported in pregnant women taking large doses of tetracycline readily pass into breast milk not recommended fluoroquinolones fluoroquinolones are in category c they cause arthropathy joint effusions fissures erosions and impair cartilage development in several animal models but not demonstrated in humans they are not recommended for use in pregnancy thery are times when this is the only thing that will work worry about cartilage formation and bone formations metronidazole metronidazole listed as category b its safety during pregnancy is controversial  it is recommended that the drug not be given during the first trimester unless it is absolutely necessary  use of this drug during the second and third trimesters is still being debated use during lactation controversial  excreted into breast milk in relatively large amounts  exposing a growing a developing baby to large doses  but we dont know the effect concern expressed with respect to possible mutagenic effects no reports of adverse effects in nursing infants if taken in single large dose breastfeeding may be temporarily withheld for 12 to 24 hours chloramphenicol chloramphenicol category c it is not safe during pregnancy because of aplastic anemia graybaby syndrome vasomotor collapse hypothermia cyanosis and an ashengray color use all the way up to delivery treating the mother for infection and she deliver the child bt the child liver was not mature enough to metab the drug this syndrome is due to inadequate routes of elimination of unconjugated chloramphenicol in immature infants safety in lactation is not clear currently rated as possibly unsafe the babys liver still may not be strong enough trimethoprim and sulfonamides trimethoprim is in category c  trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole tmpsmx is not recommended sulfonamides are category b sulfa drugs can be used when necessary during the first second trimesters but should be avoided near the end of gestation third trimester because of the increased risk of kernicterus in the infant  kernicterus is thought to occur when the sulfonamide competes with bilirubin for albumin binding thus causing hyperbilirubinemia the free bilirubin diffuses into the central nervous system  the placenta can clear unconjugated bilirubin but once the infant is born it has no mature elimination mechanism in addition infants with glucose6phosphate deficiency g6pd can develop hemolytic anemia if the mother takes sulfonamides late in pregnancy both compounds interfere with folic acid metabolism in general  early preg sulfonamide by istelf may be okay but after the first trimester it should not be used by itself bc the risk of delivery septra and bactrin  combo  is not indication bc it interrupts folic acid in two different places nitrofurantoin nitrofurantoin is often an alternative to tmpsmx for the prophylaxis and treatment of lower urinary tract infections during pregnancy nitrofurantoin is a categoryb agent reports support the safety of nitrofurantoin use during pregnancy nitrofurantoin can induce acute hemolytic anemia in patients with g6pd deficiency or with glutathionedeficient red blood cells so the manufacturer cautions the use of nitrofurantoin in pregnant women at term and in infants less than 1 month of age penicillins category b in pregnancy  cross the placenta easily and rapidly  concentrations equal maternal levels betalactamase inhibitors eg sulbactam  clavulanate have not been reported to cause direct fetal toxicity although they can cause a positive direct coombs test beta lactamase inhibitors posilbe coombs test caused by augmentin  happens at low rate antibody antigen complex is picked up by erythrocytes and reagent binds and get hemolysis lactation crosses in low concentrations compatible with breastfeeding cephalosporins category b in pregnancy cross the placenta during pregnancy some reports of increased anomalies with specific cephalosporins cefaclor cephalexin cephradrine primarily cardiac and oral cleft defects be careful in treating pregnant folks okay in breast feeding lactation excreted into breast milk in low concentrations considered compatible with breastfeeding aztreonam pregnancy category b likely safe in pregnancy little human data lactation  compatible per american academy of pediatrics clindamycin pregnancy category b commonly used lactation  compatible per american academy of pediatrics  penetrates well in bone so good for bone infections osteomylitis down side is that it kills off beneficial anerobes in gi tract casue gi symptoms  flora in infant who is breastfeeding may be killed off as well antivirals acyclovir famciclovir valacyclovir pregnancy category b acyclovir and valacyclovir readily cross the placenta can be used for hsv treatment and suppression lactation acyclovir and valacyclovir are compatible with breastfeeding famciclovir should be avoided due to incomplete data antiretroviralsnrti abacavir didanosine ddi emtricitabine ftc pregnancy categories cbb  maternal benefit usually outweighs fetal risk  cross the placenta limited data with each do not show increased risk of anomalies didanosine has been associated with severe lactic acidosis w or wo pancreatitis drops viral load  okay in pregnancy because the maternal effect outweighs the risk  antiretroviralsnrti lamuvidine 3tc stavudine d4t pregnancy category c  maternal benefit usually outweighs fetal risk  cross the placenta by simple diffusion data with lamivudine show no increased risk of anomalies stavudine has been associated with severe lactic acidosis w or wo pancreatitis  all nrtis have been possibly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction postnatally   need to make sure the dose is correct based on weight  some will have metabolic issues after the baby is born antiretroviralsnrti tenofivir zalcitabine ddc zidovudine azt pregnancy category bcc  maternal benefit usually outweighs fetal risk  cross the placenta by simple diffusion limited data with zalcitabine do not show increased risk of anomalies zidovudine is commonly used but may cause neonatal anemia limited data with tenofivir show low risk of teratogenicity antiretroviralsnnrti delavirdine efavirenz nevirapine pregnancy category c  maternal benefit usually outweighs fetal risk  likely cross into fetus nevirapine readily delavirdine has possible ventriculoseptal defect vsd risk but limited human data are available efavirenz is associated with anomalies in monkeys limited human data possible neural tube defects nevirapine can cause hepatotoxicity and rash nevirapine can be used as a single dose in labor to prevent hiv transmission protease inhibitors pregnancy category bc  maternal benefit usually outweighs fetal risk  likely cross the placenta all pis can cause hyperglycemia atazanavir can cause hyperbilirubinemia indinavir can cause nephrolithiasis antiretroviralsfusion inhibitor enfuvirtide pregnancy category b  maternal benefit usually outweighs fetal risk  very large molecule 4492 daltons likely does not cross placenta animal data does not show risk no human data available hold during first trimester if possible probably not incorporating viruses in fetal cells but not much data other than animal data if you have to use them then do  but stay away from using in first trimester antifungalsazoles fluconazoleketoconazole pregnancy categories cc fluconazole  400mgday seems to be associated with craniofacial abnormalities ketoconazole can impair testosterone and cortisol synthesis secreted in breast milk fluconazole is given to neonates probably safe in breastfeeding ok per the aap ketoconazole is also compatible with breastfeeding per the aap risk there in high doses but low doses the risk is low a drop in cortisol formation and testosterone and estrogen formation but have to weigh the risk s and depends on the time being given in breastfeeding both are okay just during pregnancy there is an issue echinocandins and polyenes caspofungin amphotericin b  echinocandins are pregnancy category c  no human data with caspofungin animal data suggests some risk lactation  no human data but probably compatible  amphotericin b  pregnancy category b compatible lipid complexes also compatible lactation  no data available considered compatible giant molecule so doesnt cross placenta and doesnt get into breast milk  so systemic fungal infection  this is the drug of choice triptans 5ht1 agonists pregnancy category c limited human data exists sumatriptan has been associated with vsds in several cases no data available in humans for almotriptan eletriptan frovatriptan or zolmitriptan limited human data exists with sumatriptan naratriptan and rizatriptan although animal data indicates moderate risks pregnancy registry available for exposures they are not well studied lactation cross into breastmilk and may concentrate no reports of human lactation problems ergots dihydroergotamine ergotamine  pregnancy category x  oxytocic properties could cause iugr by vascular disruption or increased uterine tone early exposure appears safe not teratogens chronic exposure is contraindicated wont get adequate amount of nutrients and oxygen uterine contractions and the placenta can detach  what do you do with a pregnant woman with migraine have to give narcotics  lactationcontraindicated questions to ask are there alternative therapies can treatment wait until postpartum is the disease worse than the therapy what does the available literature say is this drug used in neonates how old is the infant what is the duration of therapy what are the pharmacokinetics of the agent what is the riskbenefit for the mother does this medicine cause problems in g6pd deficiency can we use something else big key question is the disease as bad as the pregnancy as far as outcome better to suffer for a few days rather than suffer adverse effects from med is the drug used in infants if so then may be okay to use during pregnancy considerations in breastfeeding withhold or delay therapy if possible use a drug with poor penetration into milk use an alternate route of administration avoid nursing at peak drug concentrations give drug before infants longest sleep pump and dump milk discontinue breastfeeding take a look at epocrates and it will tell when peak blood level is for a drug so can find out how much time you have to feed and then stop feeding a for a certain time period before drug is out of system may need to recheck pregnancy weight every few months chantix is associated with psych effects most people wont use it a pregnant person usually used nicotine gun or patch to try to stop smoking while pregnant caffeine moderation would be mostly 2 times a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon just remember when it speeds up heart rate and blood pressure it is doing the same thing to the baby
