email print why are field tests necessaryf share tweet the field tests referred to as confined field trials in many countries with golden rice serve multiple purposes for our breeders they provide the opportunity to evaluate the agronomic potential of varieties containing the golden rice trait in the open environment and to select the best performing lines for advancement in the breeding program confined field trials are also necessary to collect the agronomic and ecological data required to complete the environmental safety assessment of the golden rice event gr2e this assessment focuses on plant morphological characteristics that could signal any increased tendency to weediness persistence or invasiveness these could include for example any changes inseed dissemination seed dormancytime to germination or germination rates time to maturity disease andor pest resistance or abiotic stress tolerance additionally confined field trials provide material for other regulatory studies as part of the safety characterization of golden rice it is necessary to measure concentrations of the newly expressed proteins in the grain to estimate likely dietary exposure and confined field trials permit the production of sufficient quantities of grain and straw to conduct nutrient compositional analyses to date field tests with the golden rice gr2e event have been conducted at four locations in the philippines over two growing seasons by the philippine rice research institute department of agriculture phil rice and irri in bangladesh the bangladesh rice research institute brri successfully completed one confined field trial in 2016 with additional trials ongoing in 2017 agronomic and ecological data collected from field tests in countries of intended golden rice cultivation will be subject to review by the relevant competent national authorities in each country following authorization for unconfined environmental release ie propagationcultivation authorization gr2e golden rice can be used like any other cultivar in rice breeding programs without additional biosafety review new rice varieties containing the gr2e trait will still be subject to all the normal requirements for variety registration or national listing within the countries of intended release just like any other conventionally bred new rice variety
