how to rig with lead core line larry myhre journal editor apr 29 2007  …subscribe for 33¢  day trolling with lead core line is a very effective technique for walleyes when they are too deep to reach with other methods rigging correctly will increase your chances of success staff photo by larry myhretrolling crankbaits on lead core line is one of the most effective ways of putting a limit of walleyes in the boat on some waters the lead core approach was popularized several years ago by professional walleye fishermen competing in tournaments on the great lakes here huge schools of walleyes roamed immense areas suspended about 30 feet down and out of reach of the deepest diving crankbaits the schools were found with electronics and the lures were sent down behind lead core line the results were phenomenal and it wasnt long before this method was adapted to walleye lakes throughout the upper midwest it is a deadly method any time walleyes are suspended over deep water or when sitting on the bottom in main lake basins 25 to 40 feet down the down side is that most of the sport of the walleyes fight is taken away by the large amounts of heavy line behind the boat and the large flexible rods needed to make the system work the lake in our area that sees the most lead core use would be francis case one of the big missouri river reservoirs about 130 miles west of sioux city it is the local walleye fishermens premier destination along the whole missouri river system and those pulling lead core primarily do so to catch walleyes suspended in flooded tree tops throughout the summer and fall period lead core also sees use on big spirit lake when walleye scatter along the lakes basin in the summertime rigging with lead core for the first time can be a little intimidating and there hasnt been a lot written about it recently which is why im writing about it now hopefully this will be a primer to get you started right lets look at the line first lead core line consists of a thread of lead over which a dacron line is formed it comes in many pound tests there are only two diameters of lead used in all lines the smaller diameter is used in the lighter lines and the heaver is inserted in 18pound test and greater the pound test of the line is determined by the dacron not the lead i think most fishermen use 18pound a lot also use 27 the advantage to the lighter line is the smaller diameter so the line has less tendency to rise in the water column while trolling the 27 has greater breaking strength so if you are snagging up on trees you can use a heavier leader and maybe save some crankbaits it will not however run as deep as the lighter line given the same speed of the boat lead core is marked by different colors on the dacron every 30 feet say red brown blue yellow etc its marked this way so you can count the number of colors you have in the water and have an idea of how deep your lines are so you can return to that same depth after catching a fish line counter reels arent really needed for lead core but a lot of guys use them anyway to really fine tune presentations there are two ways of rigging your reels with lead core i began fishing with lead core using segments this is simply using three or four colors of lead core with a leader and heavy monofilament backing to fill the reel spool this is the way to go if you want to spread your lines using side planers because they are attached to the mono backing depending on your planers you may have to cut back to three colors because the weight of the line can sink many boards or cause them to run too deeply most of the time i dont use the side planers i just put the rods in holders at the back and on each side of the boat and troll with two lines the other way is to spool 100 yards 10 colors onto a small saltwater reel and not use any backing at all i think most walleye anglers use this system just how deep your lead core line will run will depend upon your speed the slower the speed the deeper the lines will run at normal walleye trolling speeds you can figure about 6 feet of depth for each color with segmented lines let out more mono backing to run deeper four colors of segmented line will easily run 30 feet deep or more this speed thing is something to remember while you are trolling if you go over a shallower hump just increase your speed a bit to run the lines shallower over the hump leaders naturally should be of a lighter pound test than your lead core if you snag you want the leader to break not your main line on 18pound lead core i use 14pound test monofilament you can also use a super line such as fire line and the new crystal color should work great length of leader is a matter of personal choice if you believe the lead core will spook walleyes in clear water use a longer leader if the water is not clear you can use a shorter leader in some rivers guys shorten the leader to about the length of the rod others routinely use leaders twice the length of their rod in the clear waters of francis case i run leaders of 30 feet the easiest way to attach a leader to lead core or backing to lead core is to use two uni knots back to back if you dont know how to tie one type in uni knot in yahoo search and youll find it some anglers use a small swivel which will slip through the guides and the level wind device on the reel but i think the knots are a better way to go before you tie a knot in lead core push back the dacron and grab the lead pushing the dacron back about six inches snip off the lead and pull the dacron back dont include the lead in your knot attach a small snap to the other end of the leader next lets look at the rods there are special graphites designed for lead core line most are graphiteglass composites and are not expensive most of my lead core fishing is actually done with downrigger rods they are long eightandonehalf feet and their actions are soft which is an important aspect of a downrigger rod you will need two rods ideally the reels should be large capacity level wind casting reels lead core is bulky so you will need the space to store the line just how big your reel must be depends on whether you are going to troll segmented lead core or if the reel will be filled with lead core only be sure to set the drag very light if you snag and you will the line should be able to pull off the reel when you hook a fish increase the drag a bit just remember to back it off again when you reset when you catch a fish on lead core do not set the hook or pump the rod while landing the fish just pick up the rod and reel slowly and steadily a lot of fish are lost because of the hooks tearing out there is no give in lead core a soft rod will save a lot of fish there are ill admit a lot more fun ways to fish for walleye however in certain situations nothing beats the lead core approach its another system that should be in your walleye bag of tricks larry myhre is editor of the
