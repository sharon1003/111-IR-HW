28 dec 2016a guide to mapping fire hydrants in the ukby brian prangle  posted in map improvements observations participate  12in the west midlands our fire hydrant signs are generally placed on lamp posts the black h on a yellow background i believe to be a uk standard the upper number is the diameter of the underlying water main in mm the lower number is the distance in feet to the fire hydrant from the sign with the arrow showing the direction to the actual hydrant there is also a reference number at the foot of the sign so having spotted the sign the actual fire hydrant has to be found the signs can get swivelled on the lamposts through maintenance interventions or general neglect and the arrows point in the wrong directionto complicate matters further there are some fire hydrants that do not have a sign and some older variants of the signs these older signs tend to be attached to buildings or walls and i have no idea what the numbers refer to so you have to on the lookout on the ground as well as spotting yellow h signs fire hydrant covers generally have fh on them to identify them although some older ones can have just h only whether the older style ones are still operational i don’t know but they get mapped anyway and of course it’s always good to see public organisations collaborating successfully with each otherthe basic tag is emergencyfirehydrant with more details on the osm wiki why the sudden interest in fire hydrants in the uk they’ve languished as an item that gets mapped at our last mappamercia pub meeting andy mabbett regaled us with his saga of trying to get west midlands fire service to release the locations of fire hydrants under freedom of information legislation the full saga can be found here wmfs refused to release the information on the grounds of national security viz “publishing information about water networks and other parts of the critical national infrastructure could expose vulnerabilities in the network and pose a serious risk to public health either through non availability of water resource or contamination of supplies there does not have to be any evidence that this is being planned but it is a possibility given the current threat level in the united kingdom”an appeal by andy against wmfs to the firsttier information rights tribunal mainly on the grounds that other fire services in the uk had already released their information on fire hydrants was rejected the judges agreed with the information commissioner’s office ico assessment“the ico concluded that the withholding of the information was reasonably necessary for national security and a listing of hydrants and their locations would assist in the planning of an attack by poisoning on water supply infrastructure by identifying access points such an attack on the infrastructure would be in the domain of national security while hydrants are visible a comprehensive list of the precise location of every hydrant would place in the public domain more information than is available through hydrants being visible wmfs supplied a list of attacks and attempted attacks on water supplies the ico considered that such an attack was plausible”there is a method for contaminating the water supply known as backflow contamination which is considered to be reasonably easy according to an excellent paper here which quotes extensively from us military and homeland security sources fire hydrants are one possible source to generate backflow my limited understanding of water networks is that backflow is a general problem for the water supply industry which can mitigate the effects with backflow prevention devices just how extensive and successful this mitigation is in the uk and thus how safe we are from backflow attacks will remain a commercial mystery as our water supply is in the hands of private companies who are under no obligation to reveal such information  i have another story about water networks and open information which will be the subject of a later bloggiven the cult of secrecy that exists at all levels of official britain it also seems unlikely there will be any disclosure of the risk levels of such an attack vector so that we might make up our own minds based on the data we will have to make do with the assurances of “those that know best” the public’s role seems to be limited primarily to that of potential or actual victims this issue does raise some interesting ethical challenges for open street map as it seems to be sending us back several centuries when accurate maps were regarded as military secrets or to the days of the cold war when our national mapping agency the ordnance survey would obligingly leave blank spaces on their maps at the sites of military installations would a map of fire hydrants in the west midlands be construed as offence under ss5758 of the terrorism act 2000 collecting possessing or making a record of information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism should we be standing up for opendata one of the founding principles of open street map or protecting supposedly national security what is the position in other jurisdictions where there are more draconian restrictions about identifying and mapping military installations and “national critical infrastructure” are mappers more circumspect there what’s the legal postion is the osmf liable for prosecution or just the contributing mapper or both should osmf comply with a demand to remove information on the grounds of national security or to refrain from collecting it in the first instance according to taginfo there are only 1786 fire hydrants mapped in the uk of which there are now about 300 in the west midlands prior to my interest being piqued by this sorry tale there were only about 5 fire hydrants mapped in the west midlands judging by the density of fire hydrants i’ve discovered so far there are probably thousands in the west midlands so i seriously doubt whether we’ll ever crowdsource the location of all of them or even many more than we have already nonetheless it’s been an education in another aspect of urban infrastructure i wasn’t really aware of and a confirmation of the patrician “you don’t need to know about that” attitude of much of british officialdom all of the images are my own and are published here as public domain

toohttpschrisosmblogspotcouk201205firehydrantlocationsareconfidentialhtml rob jnjanuary 2 2017  reply brian you are mixing metric and imperial here’s a quote from wikipedia explaining the numbers“the two numbers indicate the diameter of the water main top number and the distance from the sign lower number modern signs show these measurements in millimetres and metres whereas older signs use inches and feet because the orders of magnitude are so different 6 inches versus 150 mm there is no ambiguity whichever measuring system is used”brian january 5 2017 i thought about this but the distance from the sign to the actual hydrant doesn’t seem to be in metres i estimated it in feet but it does seem more sensible for it all to be metric steve hill march 11 2018 watch this old school programme stop look and listen link below on the fire service and you will hear that the old premetric fire hydrant signs told you the number of paces to the fire hydrant nearby httpsyoutubea1an0yyl y7kweekly

this mapping effort was prompted by …ed loach january 5 2017  reply i’ve toyed with the idea of mapping fire hydrants in the past but couldn’t work out where best to place the node for hydrants in the road when the osm way only represents the centreline i see since i last looked the wiki mentions a firehydrantpositionlaneparkinglotsidewalkgreen optional tag which might or might not be relevant but the wiki proposal and documentation that mention it are incredibly lacking in detail about its intended usage gjune 27 2017  reply just so you are aware and probably are anyway the fire brigade have a detailed electronic mapping system showing hydrants and reservoirs etc martin dale october 5 2017  reply for my sins i have to produce fire prevention plans for my clients to submit to the environment agency part of the information i have to send is the location of nearby fire hydrants for two years now i’ve been able to get information from the relevant fire service today i get “after discussions with the water companies we are unable to pass on this information and are advised that anyone requesting such information should contact the water company through their enquiry process” i’ve mailed severn trent – so far no reply martin dale october 5 2017  reply ps i have a collection of fire hydrant locations from previous work if anyone wants to map them brian january 20 2018 hi martin if your data is unencumbered by any licence restrictions that prevents its use in osm then we’d love to have itruss jones october 16 2017  reply hi martin we are in the same position as you the ea insist on hydrant flow rates and we can’t supply them – from the fs or st try uk fire hydrant regs bs750 – but there doesn’t seem to be a laid down minimum flow rate for a hydrant the hydrant needs to be capable of 2000lm but the main does not    let us know if you crack this cheers russ leave a reply comment name  email will not be published website recent posts conflation  validation osm conflator
