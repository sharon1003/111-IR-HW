how long do you have after a nail puncture to get a tetanus shot posted 8 years ago in rant  short url comments72 hours if you have had a tetanus shot within the last 5 years you should still get the puncture wound looked at i’m no doctor or nurse practitioner but i googled that question last night and found no solid answer however i did find out the answer in the er last night so i’m posting about it today our good friends a  m are moving in to their new house this weekend so they asked mark to help move their couch to the street last night we agree and head over well they’re not ready to go and we have to take all this other crap out to the curb to make room in the apartment to move the couch out my husband and our friend a throw all this wooden furniture over a  m’s staircase — its a second floor apartment with a fire escape staircase up it while the guys attempt to get the couch out the front door i’m stuck outside because the couch is stuck in the front door and won’t budge i decide to pick up all the crap they threw off the top of the stairs because i’m stuck outside anyways well i was feeling lazy and i didn’t feel like picking up all these heavy wood pieces that were just getting thrown away so i decided to just drag them down to the curb i’m dragging everything and it’s going fine and then all of a sudden i drag this huge top to a wooden coffee table straight into my leg the nail pops right in and then i move and i can feel it pop out straight puncture wound now i have blood dripping down my leg  the couch is still stuck in the doorway i crawl over the couch through the doorway to pour hydrogen peroxide straight into my leg well they don’t have hydrogen peroxide because they’re moving i walk home and stick like 8 qtips soaked in hydrogen peroxide in my leg i don’t think anyone else should do that i do not recommend and i do not think it’s a puncture wound best practice do not do the qtip thing just rinse with water  go see a doctor less than 10 minutes later mark walks in the front door and tells me that they couldn’t get the f’ing couch out of the apartment they need a  m’s neighbor to be home  open her door so they can slide it in there and turn it to then get it down the stairs because it’s late at night we go to the er and i get my tetanus shot after the mandatory 35 hour er wait after the shot the doctor says to me “did you know you can wait up to 72 hours after a puncture wound to get a tetanus shot” and i’m like “wtf of course not otherwise i wouldnt f’ing be here ” obviously i said all that in my head and not aloud so today… my right arm hurts so much from this tetanus shot i wince every time i move my mouse and i’m just dreading the text that’s coming later tonight from a  m asking for us to come back and help move that couch outside the moral of the story is to 1 stay uptodate on your tetanus shots 2 know that you have 72 hours after a puncture wound to get a tetanus shot 3 keep hydrogen peroxide out while moving and 4 get the tetanus shot in your nondominant arm because it hurts like a bitch« twitter weekly updates for 20100725twitter weekly updates for 20100801 »leave a reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website
