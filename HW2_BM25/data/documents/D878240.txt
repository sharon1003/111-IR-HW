below normal levels 1 this may result in a variety of symptoms including clumsiness trouble talking confusion loss of consciousness seizures or death 1 a feeling of hunger sweating shakiness and weakness may also be present 1 symptoms typically come on quickly 1the most common cause of hypoglycemia is medications used to treat diabetes mellitus such as insulin and sulfonylureas 2 3 risk is greater in diabetics who have eaten less than usual exercised more than usual or have drunk alcohol 1 other causes of hypoglycemia include kidney failure certain tumors such as insulinoma liver disease hypothyroidism starvation inborn error of metabolism severe infections reactive hypoglycemia and a number of drugs including alcohol 1 3 low blood sugar may occur in otherwise healthy babies

determining the cause include insulin and c peptide levels in the blood 3 hyperglycemia high blood sugar is the opposite condition among people with diabetes prevention is by matching the foods eaten with the amount of exercise and the medications used 1 when people feel their blood sugar is low testing with a glucose monitor is recommended 1 some people have few initial symptoms of low blood sugar and frequent routine testing in this group is recommended 1 treatment of hypoglycemia is by eating foods high in simple sugars or taking dextrose 1 if a person is not able to take food by mouth an injection of glucagon may help 1 the treatment of hypoglycemia unrelated to diabetes includes treating the underlying problem as well and a healthy diet 1 the term hypoglycemia is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to idiopathic postprandial syndrome a controversial condition with similar symptoms that occur following eating but with normal blood sugar levels 6 7contents  hide 1 signs

vision flashes of light in the field of vision automatic behavior also known as automatism difficulty speaking slurred speech ataxia incoordination sometimes mistaken for drunkenness focal or general motor deficit paralysis hemiparesis headache stupor coma abnormal breathing generalized or focal seizures not all of the above manifestations occur in every case of hypoglycemia there is no consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms if symptoms even occur specific manifestations may also vary by age by severity of the hypoglycemia and the speed of the decline in young children vomiting can sometimes accompany morning hypoglycemia with ketosis in older children and adults moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble mania mental illness drug intoxication or drunkenness in the elderly hypoglycemia can produce focal stroke like effects or a hardtodefine malaise the symptoms of a single person may be similar from episode to episode but are not necessarily so and may be influenced by the speed at which glucose levels are dropping as well as previous incidents in newborns hypoglycemia can produce irritability jitters myoclonic jerks cyanosis respiratory distress apneic episodes sweating hypothermia somnolence hypotonia refusal to feed and seizures or spells hypoglycemia can resemble asphyxia hypocalcemia sepsis or heart failure in both young and old patients the brain may habituate to low glucose levels with a reduction of noticeable symptoms despite neuroglycopenic impairment in insulindependent diabetic patients this phenomenon is termed hypoglycemia unawareness and is a significant clinical problem when improved glycemic control is attempted another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in type i glycogenosis when chronic hypoglycemia before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute hypoglycemia after treatment is underway hypoglycemic symptoms can also occur when one is sleeping examples of symptoms during sleep can include damp bed sheets or clothes from perspiration having nightmares or the act of crying out can be a sign of hypoglycemia once the individual is awake they may feel tired irritable or confused and these may be signs of hypoglycemia as well 8in nearly all cases hypoglycemia that is severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged untreated unconsciousness interference with breathing severe concurrent disease or some other type of vulnerability nevertheless brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below 36 m m 65 mgd l hormonal defense mechanisms  adrenaline and glucagon are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level about 55 mgd l 30 m m for most people producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and dysphoria 9 1589 obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below 40 mgd l 22 m m and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below 65 in the morning without apparent effects since the brain effects of hypoglycemia termed neuroglycopenia determine whether a given low glucose is a problem for that person most doctors use the term hypoglycemia only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects determining the presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward as hypoglycemic symptoms and effects are vague and can be produced by other conditions people with recurrently low glucose levels can lose their threshold symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic impairment can occur without much warning and many measurement methods especially glucose meters are imprecise at low levels it may take longer to recover from severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness or seizure even after restoration of normal blood glucose when a person has not been unconscious failure of carbohydrate to reverse the symptoms in 10–15 minutes increases the likelihood that hypoglycemia was not the cause of the symptoms when severe hypoglycemia has persisted in a hospitalized person the amount of glucose required to maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels becomes an important clue to the underlying etiology glucose requirements above 10 mgkgminute in infants or 6 mgkgminute in children and adults are strong evidence for hyperinsulinism in this context this is referred to as the glucose infusion rate gir finally the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia a rise of blood glucose by more than 30 mgd l 170 mmoll suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia longterm effects  editsignificant hypoglycemia appears to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease 10causes  editsee also list of causes of hypoglycemia the most common cause of hypoglycemia is medications used to treat diabetes mellitus such as insulin sulfonylureas and biguanides 2 3 risk is greater in diabetics who have eaten less than usual exercised more than usual or drunk alcohol 1 other causes of hypoglycemia include kidney failure certain tumors liver disease hypothyroidism starvation inborn errors of metabolism severe infections reactive hypoglycemia and a number of drugs including alcohol 1 3 low blood sugar may occur in babies who are otherwise healthy who have not eaten for a few hours 4 inborn errors of metabolism may include the lack of an enzyme to make glycogen glycogen storage type 0 serious illness  editserious illness may result in low blood sugar 1 severe disease of nearly all major organ systems can cause hypoglycemia as a secondary problem hospitalized persons especially in intensive care units or those prevented from eating can develop hypoglycemia from a variety of circumstances related to the care of their primary disease hypoglycemia in these circumstances is often multifactorial or caused by the healthcare once identified these types of hypoglycemia are readily reversed and prevented and the underlying disease becomes the primary problem hormone deficiency  editnot enough cortisol such as in addisons disease not enough glucagon or not enough epinephrine can result in low blood sugar 1 this is a more common cause in children 1pathophysiology  editlike most animal tissues brain metabolism depends primarily on glucose for fuel in most circumstances a limited amount of glucose can be derived from glycogen stored in astrocytes but it is consumed within minutes for most practical purposes the brain is dependent on a continual supply of glucose diffusing from the blood into the interstitial tissue within the central nervous system and into the neurons themselves therefore if the amount of glucose supplied by the blood falls the brain is one of the first organs affected in most people subtle reduction of mental efficiency can be observed when the glucose falls below 65 mgd l 36 m m impairment of action and judgment usually becomes obvious below 40 mgd l 22 m m seizures may occur as the glucose falls further as blood glucose levels fall below 10 mgd l 055 m m most neurons become electrically silent and nonfunctional resulting in coma these brain effects are collectively referred to as neuroglycopenia the importance of an adequate supply of glucose to the brain is apparent from the number of nervous hormonal and metabolic responses to a falling glucose level most of these are defensive or adaptive tending to raise the blood sugar by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis or provide alternative fuels if the blood sugar level falls too low the liver converts a storage of glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream to prevent the person going into a diabetic coma for a short time brief or mild hypoglycemia produces no lasting effects on the brain though it can temporarily alter brain responses to additional hypoglycemia prolonged severe hypoglycemia can produce lasting damage of a wide range this can include impairment of cognitive function motor control or even consciousness the likelihood of permanent brain damage from any given instance of severe hypoglycemia is difficult to estimate and depends on a multitude of factors such as age recent blood and brain glucose experience concurrent problems such as hypoxia and availability of alternative fuels it has been frequently found that those type 1 diabetics found dead in bed in the morning after suspected severe hypoglycemia had some underlying coronary pathology that led to an induced fatal heart attack recently  when several of these individuals found dead in bed were wearing continuous glucose monitors cgms which provided a history of glucose levels before the fatal event in several cases the fatality was preceded by at least two hours of blood glucose levels under 40 mgd l possibly lower as cgms are not accurate at levels below 40 mgd l the individuals failed to respond to the audible alarms produced by the monitors which may have been alarming for many hours  citation neededthe vast majority of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes result in no detectable permanent harm 11diagnosis  editthe glucose level that defines hypoglycemia is variable in diabetics a level below 39 mmoll 70 mgd l is diagnostic 1 in adults without diabetes symptoms related to low blood sugar low blood sugar at the time of symptoms and improvement when blood sugar is restored to normal confirm the diagnosis 5 this is known as the whipples triad 5 otherwise a level below 28 mmoll 50 mgd l after not eating or following exercise may be used 1 in newborns a level below 22 mmoll 40 mgd l or less than 33 mmoll 60 mgd l if symptoms are present indicates hypoglycemia 4 other tests that may be useful in determining the cause include insulin and c peptide levels in the blood 3 hyperglycemia a high blood sugar is the opposite condition throughout a 24‑hour period blood plasma glucose levels are generally maintained between 4–8 mmoll 72 and 144 mgd l 12 11 although 33 or 39 mmoll 60 or 70 mgd l is commonly cited as the lower limit of normal glucose symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until 28 to 30 mmoll 50 to 54 mgd l 13in cases of recurrent hypoglycemia with severe symptoms the best method of excluding dangerous conditions is often a diagnostic fast this is usually conducted in the hospital and the duration depends on the age of the patient and response to the fast a healthy adult can usually maintain a glucose level above 50 mgd l 28 m m for 72 hours a child for 36 hours and an infant for 24 hours the purpose of the fast is to determine whether the person can maintain his or her blood glucose as long as normal and can respond to fasting with the appropriate metabolic changes at the end of the fast the insulin should be nearly undetectable and ketosis should be fully established the patients blood glucose levels are monitored and a critical specimen is obtained if the glucose falls despite its unpleasantness and expense a diagnostic fast may be the only effective way to confirm or refute a number of serious forms of hypoglycemia especially those involving excessive insulin the precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on 1 the measurement method 2 the age of the person 3 presence or absence of effects and 4 the purpose of the definition while there is no disagreement as to the normal range of blood sugar debate continues as to what degree of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation or treatment or can cause harm 14 15 16deciding whether a blood glucose in the borderline range of 45–75 mgd l 25–42 m m represents clinically problematic hypoglycemia is not always simple this leads people to use different cutoff levels of glucose in different contexts and for different purposes because of all the variations the endocrine society recommends that a diagnosis of hypoglycemia as a problem for an individual be based on the combination of a low glucose level and evidence of adverse effects 5glucose concentrations are expressed as milligrams per deciliter mgd l or mg100 m l in lebanon the united states japan portugal spain france belgium egypt saudi arabia colombia india and israel while millimoles per liter mmoll or m m are the units used in most of the rest of the world glucose concentrations expressed as mgd l can be converted to mmoll by dividing by 180 gdmol the molar mass of glucose for example a glucose concentration of 90 mgd l is 50 mmoll or 50 m m the circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis circumstances include the age of the person time of day time since last meal previous episodes nutritional status physical and mental development drugs or toxins especially insulin or other diabetes drugs diseases of other organ systems family history and response to treatment when hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly a record or diary of the spells over several months noting the circumstances of each spell time of day relation to last meal nature of last meal response to carbohydrate and so forth may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the hypoglycemia method of measurement  editblood glucose levels discussed in this article are venous plasma or serum levels measured by standard automated glucose oxidase methods used in medical laboratories for clinical purposes plasma and serum levels are similar enough to be interchangeable arterial plasma or serum levels are slightly higher than venous levels and capillary levels are typically in between 17 this difference between arterial and venous levels is small in the fasting state but is amplified and can be greater than 10 in the postprandial state 18 on the other hand whole blood glucose levels eg by fingerprick meters are about 10–15 lower than venous plasma levels 17 furthermore available fingerstick glucose meters are only warranted to be accurate to within 15 of a simultaneous laboratory value under optimal conditions  citation needed and home use in the investigation of hypoglycemia is fraught with misleading low numbers 19 20 in other words a meter glucose reading of 39 mgd l could be properly obtained from a person whose laboratory serum glucose was 53 mgd l even wider variations can occur with real world home use two other factors significantly affect glucose measurement hematocrit and delay after blood drawing the disparity between venous and whole blood concentrations is greater when the hematocrit is high as in newborn infants or adults with polycythemia 18 high neonatal hematocrits are particularly likely to confound glucose measurement by meter second unless the specimen is drawn into a fluoride tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells the measurable glucose will be gradually lowered by in vitro metabolism of the glucose at a rate of approximately 7 mgd lh or even more in the presence of leukocytosis 18 21 22 the delay that occurs when blood is drawn at a satellite site and transported to a central laboratory hours later for routine processing is a common cause of mildly low glucose levels in general chemistry panels age  editchildrens blood sugar levels are often slightly lower than adults overnight fasting glucose levels are below 70 mgd l 39 m m in 5 of healthy adults but up to 5 of children can be below 60 mgd l 33 m m in the morning fasting state 23 as the duration of fasting is extended a higher percentage of infants and children will have mildly low plasma glucose levels usually without symptoms the normal range of newborn blood sugars continues to be debated 14 15 16 it has been proposed that newborn brains are able to use alternate fuels when glucose levels are low more readily than adults experts continue to debate the significance and risk of such levels though the trend has been to recommend maintenance of glucose levels above 60–70 mgd l the first day after birth diabetic hypoglycemia represents a special case with respect to the relationship of measured glucose and hypoglycemic symptoms for several reasons first although home glucose meter readings are often misleading the probability that a low reading whether accompanied by symptoms or not represents real hypoglycemia is much higher in a person who takes insulin than in someone who does not 24 25other tests  editthe following is a brief list of hormones and metabolites which may be measured in a critical sample not all tests are checked on every patient a basic version would include insulin cortisol and electrolytes with cpeptide and drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children the value of additional specific tests depends on the most likely diagnoses for an individual patient based on the circumstances described above many of these levels change within minutes especially if glucose is given and there is no value in measuring them after the hypoglycemia is reversed others especially those lower in the list remain abnormal even after hypoglycemia is reversed and can be usefully measured even if a critical specimen is missed part of the value of the critical sample may simply be the proof that the symptoms are indeed due to hypoglycemia more often measurement of certain hormones and metabolites at the time of hypoglycemia indicates which organs and body systems are responding appropriately and which are functioning abnormally for example when the blood glucose is low hormones which raise the glucose should be rising and insulin secretion should be completely suppressed differential diagnosis  editit can also be mistaken for alcohol intoxication 26prevention  editthe most effective means of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depends on the cause the risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often but not always be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications or by more meticulous attention to blood sugar balance during unusual hours higher levels of exercise or decreasing alcohol intake many of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals or extra carbohydrates for the more severe disorders such as type 1 glycogen storage disease this may be supplied in the form of cornstarch every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion several treatments are used for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia depending on the exact form and severity some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to diazoxide or octreotide surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulinproducing tumor of the pancreas when congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications neartotal pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort but in this condition is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced hypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other postsurgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion some forms of this respond to treatment with a glucosidase inhibitor which slows starch digestion reactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance which can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates by adding morning or afternoon snacks and reducing alcohol intake idiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge many people find improvement by changing eating patterns smaller meals avoiding excessive sugar mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves reducing intake of stimulants such as caffeine or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress see the following section of this article treatment  edittreatment of some forms of hypoglycemia such as in diabetes involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the ingestion of carbohydrates determining the cause and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes however this treatment is not optimal in other forms such as reactive hypoglycemia where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking or receiving 10–20 grams of carbohydrate 27 it can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow this amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3–4 ounces 100–120 ml of orange apple or grape juice although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose alternatively about 4–5 ounces 120–150 ml of regular nondiet soda may also work as will about one slice of bread about 4 crackers or about 1 serving of most starchy foods starch is quickly digested to glucose unless the person is taking acarbose  but adding fat or protein retards digestion symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes though full recovery may take 10–20 minutes overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards a mnemonic used by the american diabetes association and others is the rule of 15 – consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15minute wait repeated if glucose remains low variable by individual sometimes 70 mgd l 28if a person is suffering such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot due to combativeness or should not due to seizures or unconsciousness be given anything by mouth medical personnel such as paramedics or inhospital personnel can establish iv access and give intravenous dextrose concentrations varying depending on age infants are given 2 mlkg dextrose 10 children are given dextrose 25 and adults are given dextrose 50 care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the iv is infiltrated sclerosis of veins and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly if iv access cannot be established the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an intramuscular injection more treatment information can be found in the article diabetic hypoglycemia if a person is suffering less severe effects and is conscious with the ability to swallow medical personal such as emtbs may administer gelatinous oral glucose one situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking acarbose since acarbose and other alphaglucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharides that can be absorbed by the body patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharidecontaining foods such as glucose tablets honey or juice to reverse hypoglycemia history  edithypoglycemia was first discovered by james collip when he was working with frederick banting on purifying insulin in 1922 collip was tasked with developing an assay to measure the activity of insulin he first injected insulin into a rabbit and then measured the reduction in blood glucose levels measuring blood glucose was a time consuming step collip observed that if he injected rabbits with a too large a dose of insulin the rabbits began convulsing went into a coma and then died this observation simplified his assay he defined one unit of insulin as the amount necessary to induce this convulsing hypoglycemic reaction in a rabbit collip later found he could save money and rabbits by injecting them with glucose once they were convulsing 29etymology  edithypoglycemia may also be spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycæmia the term means low blood sugar in greek ὑπογλυκαιμία from hypo glykys haima see also  editdiabetic hypoglycemia
