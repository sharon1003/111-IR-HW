z4 buyers guide this guide is the most detailed and accurate i have ever come across i have searched the net spoke to experts and written the definitive guide to the z4 for a potential purchaser about the car and its history great to drive fast and beautifully built the z4 was offered with a selection of strong engines and a choice of coupe or roadster body styles while there are cheaper sports cars out there none offers the range of talents available from the z4 – although porsche’s boxster is arguably a better allrounder however the bmw is more affordable to buy and run and more practical too bmw dealers are also among the best around so while you pay for the privilege of running a z4 few cars are as satisfying to own we like we don’t like dynamics high purchase costs build quality marmite styling ergonomics one of the most sensible choices in the z4 is the 22i which still gets you to 60mph in 77 seconds and yet costs less to fuel and insure than the bigger sixes it’s not exactly in the boxster camp though and in this respect the 30 is the one to have with 231bhp on tap it rockets the 1365kg z4 to 62mph in 59 seconds compared to 69 seconds for the boxster 25 the running gear for the z4 was lifted pretty much wholesale from the e46 3series and this brings both good and bad news the good news is that the m54 engines are really very reliable the only issues generally being individual components like coil packs or camshaft sensors the variable intake manifold disa system can fail a rattle from the inlet manifold sometimes signifying the plastic components have broken up you’ll generally notice a lack of topend power or lowend torque or both depending on the position in which it has failed camshaft sensors are a common failure point symptoms being a gradually worsening hesitation and an engine which takes a second or two longer to catch when warm it’s an easy diy swap but advice is to use a genuine bmw replacement as after market sensors are not well regarded the 3litre does like to use a bit of oil and it’s a common discussion point among 330ci owners too bmw’s official line is that a tolerance of 1 litre per 1000 miles is permissible and perhaps the most sensible advice we’ve heard on the subject came from a bmw independent who suggested thinking of it as being like a race engine which will use a bit of oil without there being anything wrong with it the issue is definitely worse when the cars are used on only short trips with a cold engine and in general it seems the harder you drive them the less oil they use one other issue concerning the oil system surrounds the crankcase breather valve on the underneath of the manifold this can get clogged up along with its various pipes and make the car smoke like an old montego minicab it’s straightforward and relatively inexpensive to fix but you’ll need to remove the manifold – don’t believe all those americans on forums showing you how to do it with the manifold in place we covered the job with paddock motors in our april 2011 issue the sixspeed manual the steptronic auto or the smg are the transmission options the manual is much as you’d expect although the sixspeeder can be a little notchy compared to the older fivespeed boxes and barring any odd noises you shouldn’t find anything to worry about the automatic is the usual refined zf hp19 fivespeed and although it cuts the 062mph time of the 30i down to 62 seconds it suits the car nicely and still keeps the bmw well ahead of the tiptronicequipped boxster at 76 seconds in automatic form the 30i still feels like a quick car and you won’t regret choosing it if you spend much time in traffic as for the smg it’s a tricky one the smg setup fitted to the z4 wasn’t the same system found in the m3 and is rather less desirable the speed of its shifts is impressive and when you’re pressing on it’s fine but the automatic mode leaves a lot to be desired its jerky progress soon becomes tiresome and sadly it’s not a patch on the dsg box in an audi tt the chassis of the z4 is pretty much e46 3series which in the main is good news a pull on the steering wheel when you tap the brakes gently in traffic suggests the bushes where one or both front lower wishbones bolts to the bodyshell may need replacing while any clonks at low speeds point to antiroll bar drop links a patter over broken surfaces can mean a balljoint needs replacing the z4 can also break coil springs just like the 3series but on the rear at least they’re pretty easy to change without special tools pre2004 cars could suffer with a problem which caused the electric power steering system to become stiff around the centre position when it heated up after an hour’s driving the full cure was to replace the rack but a bmw independent will know where to lubricate the column to solve it key dates 303 the z4 supersedes the z3 405 a new entrylevel model is unveiled the 20litre 106 a highpower 30litre engine arrives the 265bhp 30si also the z4m debuts with a 343bhp 32litre engine 306 a coupe edition of the z4 appears with a choice of 265bhp 30 or 343bhp 32litre petrol engines 806 a highpower 25litre engine joins the range the 218bhp 25si 308 the edition exclusive and edition sport specials arrive limited to 300 apiece and available only with the 20litre petrol engine 509 an allnew z4 coupécabriolet arrives checklist standard wheels get kerbed easily after market items are even more damageprone if the engine runs erratically it could be because the ecu needs reprogramming or an ignition coil may need to be replaced if the automatic wipers fail a new windscreen is needed oil consumption can be high so make sure the engine isn’t running on empty interior do all the controls switches and displays work properly take a several music cds with you and check operation if a boot multi player check this works as well try the radio – if steering wheel controls fitted check their function check the ac works an expensive repair – for older vehicles ask if it has been regassed recently do all the lights work get someone to stand behind and check the brake lightsrear fog light indicators etc are the carpets and seats all dry if not is there a leak does the wear on the interior reflect the mileage – high wear low mileage walk away check the foot pedal rubbers – excessive wear in comparison to recorded mileage may indicate something is wrong brand new rubbers may indicate a fastidious owner or trying to cover up high mileage check the ashtrays – is it a smokers car if the ashtray is clean ask a new ashtray can disguise the fact that its a ‘smokers’ car if you are a non smoker the smell will give it away and can impact on resale value if sat nav gps fitted check it works and the mapssoftware uptodate bmw updates are expensive look for a tamper dot in the mileage display which means the mileage shown does not correspond with the ecu key mileage recordings  bodywork ask if the vehicle has been subject of any bodywork repair – not an issue if repairs have been done properly but a negotiating point remember they do not have to tell you unless you ask is the bodywork free from dents scratches and rust check panel fit on all panels for signs of accident repair – look for over spray on hidden parts under the wheel arches on rubber trim make sure you do not check the car in the wet or the dark as you are more likely to miss problems if it’s in someone’s garage check it in the daylight squat down and look along the sides of the car to help you spot mild dents or accident damage gently pull back rubber seals around windows is the paintwork free from overspray and suspect repair signs look for signs of additional layers of paint or illmatching spray marks where an additional layer of paint has been added but the finish is not right these are signs of an accident repair or potentially covering up corrosion open the boot trunk and bonnet hood is the metal work in good condition wherever there is exposed metal you need to look for illmatching colours or buckling these can be signs of accident damage if a roadster try the roof – up and down smoothly has the roof motor been replaced does the rear demister work – look for elements that are not working complete new roof required to replace ouch… check the number plates registration plate are they original original dealers name on the bottom of the plate or replacements replacements may indicate an accident replacement engine  mechanicalswith proper servicing engines are generally troublefree poor running or a rattle from the top end of the engine could point to problems with the ‘double vanos’ variable valve timing unit there are specialists out there that can supply rebuilt units but a new one from bmw is over £1000 before you start the car open the bonnet hood and feel if the engine is warm – owners may well start and run the engine prior to your arrival to ensure it starts ok and which could potentially mask engine issues if it’s the car for you return the next day if possible and start from cold – remember it’s your money is the exhaust smokefree when the engine is warm if not there may be a problem is the coolant reservoir full of brightly coloured coolant it should not be empty or brown if not are there any leaks that need further inspection is there plenty of clean oil in the engine take filler cap off and look for signs of emulsion whiteyellow gel which may indicate head gasket problems – not a common issue on bms but worth a quick check have a good look at the engine and securing bolts – bolts with rounded heads or signs of excessive over tightening may indicate issues with servicing and repair check service history and documentation – bmw is probably best if a car under 3 years old but not essential there are some excellent independents out there note bmw will help confirm history if you provide reg number and vin check for a valid mot uk – will assist in confirming mileage if less than a year insist on a full year mot this at least will give you an uptodate check on mechanical condition link to dot mot register uk httpmotinfodirectgovuk check brakespads for wear when were they last changed when was brake fluid last changed every 2 years check the excise license tax disc details exactly match the car and number registration plates tyres – good tread left and all tyres match are they quality tyres or cheap options z4s have had coil spring failure – have any been replaced if not they may need it in the future the road springs have been known to snap at 3545k so check the car sits level and there are no rattles from the corners when driving some owners fit uprated eibach springs make sure you check the hood both condition and operation repairs or replacement are hugely expensive with even the most basic arrangement costing over £3000 at main dealer prices those with a special lining will cost considerably more water leaks have been known to finish off the hood motor – this sits in a special well which should be water tight but blocked drainage tubes can allow water to collect around the motor the part alone is over £500 and the hood needs to come off to replace it so you can imagine the labour bill if the hood is down when you go to inspect a car make sure you see it working wear in the front suspension wishbone joints and bushes will lead to vague steering and a tendency to tramline not hugely expensive to fix but consider fitting uprated replacements to protect against future problems there can be a problem with the electric steering system leading to inconsistent response or a sticky feeling there is a fix for this using the later steering ecu but unfortunately it is an integral part of the steering rack and so the whole unit has to be replaced creaking from the rear can be worn antiroll bar bushes but they are reasonably cheap to replace niggling electrical problems can occur most notably affecting the alarm and wiper mechanism the latter can lead to the wipers not parking properly or stopping altogether it may be just a linkage problem but a replacement wiper motor is around £280 from a franchised dealer misting inside the headlamp covers can be caused by poor sealing – new covers are fairly cheap if you have access to a ramp get underneath and check round for signs of damage and general condition for older cars – has it had a new battery if xenon lights fitted do they self level test drive take the car for a good drive 12 hour and at least until it has reached normal operating temperature – this may well reveal leaks etc not apparent on a short run does the car drive in a straight line when you loosen your grip on the wheel gearbox operation – smooth and precise with no gear change difficulties manualautomaticpaddles is the steering accurate and free from play or judder does the car pull away and brake easily without any noises or judder under hard breaking does the car come to a halt in a straight line or pull to the left or right warning lights should all extinguish when car is started cruise control if fitted – does it work if a manual car accelerate to about 3540mph and change into top gear – accelerate and see if the pull away is smooth or there is some engine judder not a definitive check but judder may indicate coil ignition or injector issues is the vehicle insured for you to test drive you can check if the vehicle is insured but not the full details on the mid database – httpownvehicleaskmidcomaskmidaspx accessories if there are any get them thrown in for the price of the car – don’t pay extra for them ensure fitted accessories are legal in terms of fit form and function bmw accessories are better than other after market accessories in terms of resale value – if bmw parts have been replaced does the owner have the original bmw parts if so get them thrown in for no costalloys mv2 was standard with sport models and look nice most

genuine bmw parts parts catalogue read on screen instructions for log in  enter vin  click on options at the top of the page and expand the ‘vehicle information’ tab at the top for colour and trim options general considerations ask if it’s ever been involved in an accident and get details included on any sales invoice there are several examples of secondhand vehicle sales receipt on the internet take one with you just in case the seller doesn’t have one prepared a vehicle which has been subject to proper accident repairs should not prevent purchase but know this before you make an offer hpi checks or similar for private deals are worth doing and should reveal any seriousinsurance reported accident history if you are a member of an auto club racaa or similar check with them as you may be able to get a free or reduced price vehicle check if the car has a current bmw guarantee then its transferable but if it has an after market one can that be transferred dealer purchases if buying from a dealer go through the same checks do not be fobbed off with the ‘101 point pre service check’ routine etc when was it last serviced – ask for a full service before delivery check the service book if they haven’t got it ask why if the dealer offers a warranty how much and for how long check what it covers – does it cover the roof motor yes or no accept nothing less than a straight response does it cover wheel corrosion cracks etc again straight answers many will state ‘on a case by case basis’ not acceptable ask to see the warranty terms and conditions – take them away and read them finance dealers can deal on finance rates the higher they go the more money they make – try and knock off 2 and then negotiate try and get the next service thrown in free – if you don’t ask you don’t get remember an oil service is required every 2 years irrespective of mileage so ‘a full service history’ may only be mileage based and not time based check as it could affect a warranty ask for details of the previous keeper and call them – ask what £s they pexed the vehicle for and its history just taking your time and carrying out a thorough check may save you weeksmonths of painfrustrationif in any doubt walk away – there are plenty out thereif you like it after all this offer a silly price – you never knowz4 e85e86 faq ———————–hello folks for any newbies browsing or those who may not yet know some of the little things about their cars i’ve compiled a frequently asked question section please read before posting in case your question has been asked a million times before there is also a very handy search function on the forum – most points have been discussed in detail  the z4 e85 was launched in 2002 with the first cars being delivered in early 2003 with either a 25i or 30i m54 engine with a 22i 6cyl coming later later an alpina z4 was launched with an enlarged version of the 30i you could choose a 6 speed manual 56 speed steptronic and on the 30i prefacelift an smg gearbox it was offered in se trim which was later renamed to just “i”  before the existence of the z4m the wonderfully rare alpina roadster s was launched powered by an enlarged 34litre version of bmw’s previousgeneration m3 straightsix the handbuilt motor trades ultimate power for a hearty slab of midrange torque but still packs a handy 295bhp punch in lux spec this adds nav cruise xenons and 19″ wheels  in 2006 the z4 was facelifted with new engines a 20i 25i 25si 30si and the launch of the 32i z4m the facelift model is easily recognized by revised headlamps and tail lamps these were available in se or sport trim  also new for the facelift was the e86 coupé model available in the uk with a 30si and m 32i in 2009 the e89 z4 was launched with a folding hardtop this is covered in depth in this forum here is an exhaustive list of uk specifications options  engine differences from the original brochures post pre and post facelift here’s a great post listing the types of wheel available too if you are new to this forum and have just bought a zed – please introduce yourself in the newbie forum if you are looking to buy very well looked after zeds are often for sale in the buy and sell section did you know  holding down the unlock key on the key fob will lower the roof or windows on a coupe this seems to be model dependent although it’s not clear which years don’t work here is a list of options  due to safety you cannot raise it by default but you can get your key coded with lots of other options by an independent specialist with autologic to do this  pulling the left indicator stalk towards you before exiting the car will give “follow home” headlights which turn off after a default 30 seconds  if you have a black radiostereo in your zed it will play mp3 cds if it’s grey it won’t the changeover was late 2005 – you can swap these but you will either want to swap the front from the old unit or buy more vents to make them match  the standard z4 aerial can be replaced with a smaller “stubby” from either mangowalk or an official peugeot part this can have a limited affect on radio signal  30 z4’s had a sound generator this can be retrofitted  standard z4 runflat tyres have advantages but often significantly degrade the ride many members have swapped these for falken 452’s or newer generation runflats if you do you’ll either need a spare wheel or possibly from the z4m – the m mobility kit  roadster z4s will have a space for a wind deflector between the roll hoops if this was a factory option it can be stored in the panel under the boot lid  on the roadster you should also have coat hooks inside the roll hoops move the seat forward to hang things on them  all zeds have an adaptive throttle which you can reset  pressing your dsc button briefly engages dst allowing slightly more wheel spin pressing and holding turns off all aids and is not advisable  some z4’s have optional electrically folding exterior door mirrors if yours don’t fold electrically they will fold manually but it’s not obvious – look at the crease lines carefully and you will see  if you have one of the very earliest 2003 cars most options can be retrofitted easily as the wiring looms for most optional extras eg electric seats cruise are present later cars had equipment specific wiring  cleaning your roof as most have fold marks can give good results depending on the products used common faults  here is an excellent link to all the service information bulletins sibs for the e85e86m  all z4s have a high failure rate on rear springs good news is it’s a relatively cheap replacement  you can reset your one touch window open  close if active like this  on roadsters the drains will need cleaning which if left will corrode your roof motor with substantial repair bills this apparently forms part of inspection i  inspection ii but check with your dealer this has been checked  if your roof motor has failed expect large repair bills from a dealer £1000 shipkiller has kindly documented his replacement which will make this lots cheaper as well as how to remove the roof  facelift zeds have a sealed roof motor to limit this problem  if you have an odb2 lead you can list any stored faults the definitive list is of these codes is here  all z4s have a clutch delay valve which can give the effect of “kangarooing” in 1st2nd gear this can be removed by you or an specialist  if you have an illuminated airbag light it’s likely your door airbags were disconnected without the battery being removed but there have also been occasions of failing seat occupancy sensors which cause this  failing electric windows are often due to window regulators – telltale sign is a rattly door  sticky  nonworking wipers check out this excellent thread retrofits  cruise control depending on the model year of the car is an excellent value addition on an m this is much trickier  navigation is a big job but can be done for around £500 thread is here  bluetooth is possible with oem parts and you should expect to pay about £400  there is also the retrofit of the tv module both analogue and digital  you can retrofit interior mood lighting also with leds  wind deflector retrofit  multifunction buttons can also be added to the steering wheel to control audio  bluetooth  replacing light clusters with facelift versions is tricky especially at the back as you will need a new light control module  automatic gearboxes can have steering wheel paddles added as per the postface lift audio nav  bluetooth  up to date bluetooth compatibility list  post 2007 cars have an auxilliary in for mp3 players this is an easy retrofit  for more useful ipod integration particularly if you have nav the favorite seems to be the intravee but there is also dension and the bmw unit which both have mixed reviews  there are 3 audio options in the z4 basic hifi and dsp carverlogic7 basic has 6 speakers  no amp with 8 visible grills hifi has 10 speakers with an optical amp and dsp is the carver system with 10 speakers optical amp and dsp settings you can change if you have cubby boxes behind the seats you have basic if you have dsp settings you have the dsp anything else you have the hifi option anything other than the basic hifi is incredibly difficult to upgrade carver was the original launch top hifi named after the company that designed the speakers after 2007 it became the logic7 system all have phillips speakers  several members including myself have upgraded the audio there’s a thread with good pictures here and another here  if you have a black head unit not dark grey it should play mp3 cds  your changer should too – this was from approx oct 05 if not you can swap the head unit and either buy new vents or replace the fascia to the gray one  cd changer retrofit is tricky as you have to remove lots of the rear centre console most elect for an ipod install as this is far easier  if you have nav you will have tmc a traffic info alert this will be green when not using the radio meaning it’s receiving updates it does this usually from classic fm  if you have lost your pairing code for bluetooth you can lift the carpet and find it on a label on the module  to pair bluetooth you need to press the button on the inside of the “flap” – not the steering wheel button  oem nav can have it’s firmware upgraded latest is v32 which will allow 3d perspective mode avail from about v27 in 2006 but this is hidden  perspective mode is accessed from a hidden menu if you have firmware v29or above  you can also modify an original nav dvd to add speed cameras and also audio alerts  latest nav dvd can be purchased in a swap scheme from your dealer for £99 latest is 20101 as of dec 09  how to set the clock is herem specific  the “features” of the cdv are very noticeable on the m and will often result in kangarooing in 1st2nd changes  z4ms all have a noticeable vanos noise at about 34k rpm this is completely normal  t’s fairly common to detect issues with the alignment of an m resulting in often pulling to the left  most z4ms will also need a new o2 sensor once in a while it’s fairly common to have had both replaced by about 30k  as ms have a limited slip differential you can only disengage the dsc fully by holding the switch  some early z4ms have noted grinding between 1st2nd gear which have resulted in warranty gearbox replacements  here is a report of the geometry settings for aligning a z4mcuseful websites  bmwfans info for a complete parts listing  cooper bmwparts for pricing of the above  if you’re not an owner yet parkers has a section called ‘facts and figures’ where you can click to see what was a standard spec and which items were  available options
