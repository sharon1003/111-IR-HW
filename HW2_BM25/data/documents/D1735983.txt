background  editcoauthor isaac hayes found the inspiration for soul man in the turmoil of the civil rights movement of the 1960s in july 1967 watching a television newscast of the aftermath of the 12th street riot in detroit michigan hayes noted that black residents had marked buildings that had not been destroyed during the riots – mostly africanamerican owned and operated institutions – with the word soul 2 relating this occurrence to the biblical story of the passover 3 hayes and songwriting partner david porter came up with the idea in hayess words of a story about ones struggle to rise above his present conditions its almost a tune where its kind of like boasting im a soul man its a pride thing 2sam sings the first verse with dave joining in the chorus dave sings the second verse with sam joining in the chorus sam sings the third verse with dave joining in the chorus this is followed by a brief bridge section by dave and then a coda in which both sam and dave repeat the title phrase a halfstep up before the songs fade issued on the atlanticdistributed stax label for which hayes and porter worked sam and daves soul man was the most successful stax single to date upon its

covers by the blues brothers original and alternative recordings  editduring the same session two versions of soul man were recorded and both were subsequently released the distinct difference between the two versions can be found within the first 30 seconds of the song one version opens the tune with a trilling roll  clarification needed an emphatic drum kick and a more enthusiastic sam moore singing the words comin to you whereas the other version goes straight in from the intro with no roll and the drum kick and opening lyrical line are not as enthusiastic the latter rendition is the more readily available version in all formats the former rendition on original 45rpm vinyl pressings tends to be harder to find but is the version most often played on the radio the different versions were recorded for the mono single and stereo album releases of the song personnel  editvocals by sam moore and dave prater instrumentation by booker t  the m gs and the markeys horns cover versions
