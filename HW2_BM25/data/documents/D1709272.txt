of space race family the reasons the americans were first on the moon as given by the major soviet participants why didnt the russians beat the americans in the moon race reviewing the matter with hindsight it might better be asked  how did they expect to win the matrix below shows the reasons as given by the main russian observers of the project these are vasiliy mishin the project manager for eight years after korolevs death fired in 1974nikolai kamanin commander of the cosmonauts and diarist dismissed in 1972boris chertok design leader within mishins organization for guidance and control systems who left extensive memoirs chief designer korolev who confided his concerns to chertok before his premature death the observations of key other decisionmakers as recorded by kamanin and chertok the investigation team of a plane crash usually finds several causes a chain of events and mistakes one leading to the other thence to the final disaster it was the same thing with the failure of the soviet lunar program the table is followed by a commentary systemic problems no proper organization structure to execute nonmilitary space programs mishin lack of coordination and agreement on a program between academy of sciences ministries industry no recognized authority to order all involved organizations to cooperate mishin lack of organizationauthority  500 organizations in 28 departments had to produce equipment for n1 but only nine took orders from vpkchertok without direction from above many factories refused to complete necessary components lack of soviet quality control kamanin this can only point to widespread poor quality control in the factories there is no discipline at these factories and few qualified workers the investigative commissions can cite specific reasons for each failure all they want but as far as kamanin is concerned there is a general problem in the soviet industrial system incorrect management and development practices afanasyev both the management and the development practices of the soviet space program were inferior to the americans continued use of artillery development practices many test flights instead of extensive ground test complex systems outdated soviet fiveyear plan structure  cannot change plan no one wants to deliver bad news to leadership chertok but who would want to be the bearer of such bad news no one volunteered lack of support for project no consensus within leadership to support manned spaceflight let alone mission to the moon mishin lack of comprehensive longterm space program trying to beat americans instead of orderly program leading to earth orbit infrastructure and lunar base kamanin no single direction no disciplined execution when a decision is finally made korolev ustinov and the military were not interested in lunar spaceflight andrei grechko categorically against manned space though required to foot much of the bill it was only due the political machinations of ustinov that the ministry of defence even ended up paying for this leading to started three years late mishin late start  leadership not interested after early successes then asked to beat us to moon only in 1964insufficient funding resources mishin lack of resources funds  one tenth funding of usahigher priorities for state and mishin chertok mishin had to support other higher priority military programs  the 7kok earth orbit version of the soyuz the 7kl1 circumlunar version the molniya communications satellite and the r9 and rt2 icbms pilyugin concentrating on the temp mobile icbm chelomei and yangel icbm projects more important no funds for n1 first stage test stand n11 flight tests or other requested elements of development program mishin inability to test engine assemblies prior to launch without reassembling chertok for block a first stage only single engine tests could be undertaken at kuznetsovs okb236 korolev military refused to spend any funds to build a test stand at tyuratam ustinov ministry of defence had not approved funds for development of engines which could be static tested prior to launch or to build a test stand for the first stage or for n11 rocket tests the upper stages of the n1 single launch decision required by time and funding constraints leading to�korolev leadership was only willing to fund n1 production at the rate of four per year and korolev concluded the only moon mission he could propose at such a rate was the singleshot lunar orbit rendezvous scheme selected by the americans n1  changes made to achieve higher payload� korolev n1 would have to be upgraded using the existing loxkerosene propellants no time for preferred course of developing loxlh2 upper stages kurushin commander of baikonur mishin had made a large number of changes to the n1 to increase its payload however these at the same time negatively impacted the boosters reliability�but n1 unable to achieve payload for singlelaunch lunar orbit rendezvous mission anyway chertok the usa apollo translunar injection payload was 45 metric tons the nominal payload of the n1 for the same mission which it could not really have achieved was 30 metric tons korolev korolev knew from beginning n1 could not deliver payload needed to fulfill singlelaunch mission he sold to leadership glushko the n1 could only carry air the gross liftoff mass was about that of a saturn v but the stage dry masses were 25 x 5 x 35x greater korolev only sold lunar landing mission to leadership in order to get n1 built korolev korolev and later mishin couldnt admit they had miscalculated the minimum payload mass needed  that would result in the whole project being killed they wanted to see the n1 built for a range of manned space projects to earth orbit moon and mars decision to build n1 in tyuratam korolev due to schedule constraints decision only brute force approach would work to build an enormous factory launch complex and city in the remote desert of kazakhstan personal incompetence poor leadership in government mishin stagnation in leadership  superficial and contradictory orders from leadership�korolev too could have lost his job kamanin no qualified soviet government leadership in space research ustinov and smirnov operate without rhyme or reason or plan chertok the entire record of the leadership was one of hundreds of failed decisions lack of korolevs leadership mishin death of korolev  proverbial drive determination and prestige could have pulled project off chertok n1 would have been successful if korolev had not died prematurely he would have had authority to not test until ready and to change engine vendors if needed mishins incompetence kamanin mishin appointment huge mistake cannot cope with the huge number of projects assigned he is coarse rude doesnt listen to critics weakness in sticking to unrealistic schedules of leadership lack of discipline of staff cant work with other bureaus chertok mishin unable to cope with such development work khrushchevs projectkorolev only support korolev had in the government at the time the moon project was approved was from khrushchev chertok khrushchev it seemed was to blame for such enormous unaffordable projects this in turn put ustinov in danger as khrushchevs point man for spaceleading to brezhnevs lack of interest korolev brezhnev a ukrainian backed yangel since it would put work into the ukraine mercurial support from keldysh head of the academy of sciences korolev keldysh the eminence grise  supported yangel for icbms chelomei for the ur500lk1 manned flyby and korolev for the n1l3 lunar lander keldysh was preoccupied with the sakharov issue and was working with suslov to get sakharov expelled from the academy of sciences perpetual conflict within leadership and between chief designers chertok glushko and ustinov waged a perpetual struggle against afanasyev keldysh and mishin glushko responsible for convincing keldysh and then ustinov to cancel n1l3 korolev yangel had the backing of brezhnev a ukrainian since it would put work into the ukraine korolev viewed chelomei as a fifth column working through his employee khrushchevs son to undermine and hinder everything korolev was trying to do technical approach propellant controversy use of loxkerosene propellants kamanin korolev and mishins rejection of glushkos engines and the leaderships rejection of the ur700 as an alternative glushko i opposed these propellants in the 1960s because the required schedule and technology resulted in too many independent loxkerosene engines in the n1 design by 1974 there were many years of development and the technology was in place to proceed with development of the rd170�leading to use of kuznetsov engines chertok in glushko 1961 offered  if korolev would use the packet scheme for the n1 as on the r7 glushko would develop needed 600 tf engines korolev rejected after consulting mishin led to use of kuznetsov engines  but kuznetsov was a turbine engine designer with no experience in rocket technology glushko kuznetsov engines for the n1 were rotten n1  inherently flawed design kamanin n1 may one day fly but it can never be a reliable booster due to the inherent design flaws glushko there was a fundamental error in gas dynamics in the design of the n1 overautomated approach to spacecraft design kamanin korolev keldysh mishin and feoktistov are all dedicated to automated spacecraft  overautomationdecision to abandon vostok early leading to push for early soyuz flights kamanin ustinov and smirnovs cancellation of the 18 day voskhod 3 mission even though the crews had been trained and the associated pressure on development of soyuz this resulted in soyuz being flown before it was mature resulting in the death of komarov and not to mention exhaustion due to limited staff resources demoralization due to failures mishin exhaustion demoralization due to setbacks kamanin death of korolev and gagarin both badly affected morale chertok engineers at ts kbem were tired burned out and dispirited bad luck mishin bad luck  n1 was being debugged flightbyflight would have got there failure of vasiliy kharchev and chertok to capture wernher von braun tyulin this is all chertoks fault in 1945 he should have stolen von braun from the americans true chertok replied my adventure with vasiliy kharchev didnt turn out too well this is quite a list and all the points are valid each actor has his own prejudices  naturally the engineers dont see anything wrong with their design approach or development practices but in my opinion although all of these factors played a part the overriding factor was very simple they started too late if the leadership had taken seriously kennedys challenge in 1961 and given korolev the goahead to build his original n1 according to his original plan and if korolev had the full backing of the soviet state then it would have been quite possible to beat the americans to the moon he might have even seen the first flight of the booster before his untimely death at the very top level were the fundamental systemic problems these prevented the soviet union from successfully completing a number of major projects begun in the 1960s these included virtually every largescale aerospace project attempted the moon program the supersonic transport the new generation of military aircraft and development of digital avionics the rather personal style of soviet project management which depended on the force of personality of the chief designer became inappropriate aerospace projects had grown to such a scale that no single organization could do everything and no one person could be watching everything these problems were recognized by the soviet leadership and led in the late 1970s to a drastic revisions in the structure of the soviet industry and the implementation of americanstyle project management and quality assurance techniques these were learned in part through the apollosoyuz test project which gave the soviets unprecedented access to the nuts and bolts of american technology and management styles at the next level was the total lack of support for manned space projects by the soviet military who at the same time were required to provide the bulk of the funding a similar antipathy existed within the american military one result was that no american military manned space project except a few military shuttle flights ever reached flight status in the soviet union the rocketry industry had an absolute priority to beat the us in the missile race this was seen as a matter of national survival and the civilian space program always took a back seat to the icbm programs therefore even though the moon project was authorized by the vpk militaryindustrial commission many ministries and factories not reporting to the vpk simply refused to deliver the equipment required this led to workarounds and delays home  search  browse  alphabetic index 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
