all about coccidiosis in dogs coccidiosis in dogs is caused by tiny singlecell organisms  can be especially dangerous in young puppies coccidia infection is caused by intestinal parasites but these arent worms theyre actually tiny singlecell organisms that are too small to be seen by the naked eye this disease is most dangerous to young puppies whose immune systems are weakened either by another type of illness or stress this is why coccidiosis is often seen in pups who have recently left their momma and siblings and come into a new home the stress of all the changes in their lives perhaps combined with the exposure to other bacteria parasites or infections weakens their immune systems and allows the coccidia organisms to grow flourish and make the puppy sick coccidiosis is an extremely contagious illness and it can be very severe in young puppies the information on this page will help keep your little one safe about coccidiosis there are actually several different species of coccidia which are found in dogs cats rabbits rodents and more even humans can get a form of this disease but luckily the type of coccidia your puppy might get isnt transferable to humans the most common species of coccidia in dogs are called isospora canis many dogs and puppies have these organisms in their digestive tract but that doesnt necessarily mean that theyre going to get sick theyre basically carriers for this disease but dont show any symptoms because they have strong immune systems which keep the parasites under control your pup might get sick because his immune response takes a nosedive due to stress or some other illness or he might catch coccidiosis from another infected dog or animal the oocysts the name given to the tiny immature coccidia organisms are excreted from an infected animal in his feces they then are absorbed into the soil and are hardy enough to live there for extended periods if your pup eats either the infected stools or the soil aroundunder them he gets sick himself the incubation period time between your pup being exposed to the disease and his symptoms appearing is about 2 weeks coccidiosis is most often seen in puppies who are less than 6 months old and usually within about 3 weeks of a major stressful experience or illness its less common in adults who have already built up immunity to it over time if an adult dog is infected with coccidia its often because he already has a weakened immune system due to another illness or health condition symptoms of coccidia infection in dogs the coccidiosis symptom youre most likely to notice first is repeated watery smelly diarrhea this diarrhea may be mild moderate or severe depending on what stage the disease is at and occasionally in some puppies a few episodes of mild diarrhea may be all that happens as the little guys immune system overcomes the infection but in most cases the diarrhea will get worse pretty quickly and become watery and often bloody as well lethargy loss of appetite vomiting and weight loss will follow when hes having diarrhea andor vomiting and not drinking lots of water your pup will get dehydrated quickly and this is dangerous in itself these symptoms are almost exactly the same as the symptoms of parvovirus which is another extremely contagious and dangerous often fatal illness and it can be difficult for even an experienced dog owner to tell the difference between them but all you need to know is that both these diseases are potentially fatal to your puppy and any pup who has repeated watery diarrhea with or without other serious symptoms needs to be seen by a veterinarian right awayoccasionally a coccidiosis infection can affect your pets central nervous system and symptoms such as tremors shaking or even convulsions will show up as well treating coccidiosis in dogs coccidiosis can be diagnosed by your veterinarian by examining a fecal sample from your puppy under a microscope this is called a fecal flotation early on in the infection its possible to get a negative result from a fecal sample simply because there havent been enough coccidia protozoa eggs shed as yet even at later stages a single fecal sample wont always contain oocysts so it may take a couple or even several more tests done over a period of a few days to make an accurate diagnosis its also possible for your veterinarian to make a positive diagnosis of coccidiosis by analyzing a blood sample generally the best way is to combine the fecal test results with the observation of other symptoms such as lethargy weight loss and so on to come to a conclusion once coccidiosis has been diagnosed your vet will probably prescribe a sulfabased antibiotic such as albon or tribissen these medications dont actually kill the coccidia protozoa but stop them from breeding and reproducing eventually removing all organisms over time because of the way they work these antibiotics may need to be taken for a two weeks or so to be effective and sometimes more than one course of treatment is needed albon can also sometimes initially be given by injection then followed up orally if your puppys coccidiosis is severe sometimes additional supportive veterinary care is needed and this might include iv fluids and even hospitalization for a few days note sulfa based medications arent recommended for use on dogs who are pregnant as they can cause birth defects in the puppies there are also some natural dog remedies that can help to soothe your dogs digestive tract and rebalance bacteria and reduce inflammation used in conjunction with the

giving your dog though heshe needs to have the complete picture in order to give your puppy the best possible care preventing reinfection because coccidiosis in dogs is spread through feces high standards of hygiene are very importantpicking up feces immediately keeping fliesinsects and rodents away they can also spread this disease on their feetin their bodies and cleaning all areas thoroughly are vital coccidia organisms are very hardy can survive for long periods in the soil and are difficult to kill  most household cleaners arent going to be effective cleaning at high temperatures ie steam cleaning and sterilization with boiling water is the best option for utensils and toys ie bowls chew toys etc wash bedding on the hot cycle in your washing machine with bleach for kennel areas floors concrete etc washing thoroughly with a 10 ammonia solution is the best and most effective way to keep everything sanitary you can also use a 116 solution of bleachwater whichever solution you choose wash all areas thoroughly and leave to soak in for at least 20 mins before rinsing grassy areas or soildirt can be very difficult in terms of removing all traces of coccidia protozoa the best thing to do is to soak the area with either of the above cleaning solutions however these surfaces can remain contaminated for up to 2 months or more so bear that in mind most puppies and dogs who survive this illness develop a certain amount of immunity and will usually not catch the same strain of coccidiosis again but this isnt always the case so its still important
