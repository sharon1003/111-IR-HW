show formulas the early formula of each story consisted of a crisis needing extraordinary help to resolve at the decisive moment mighty mouse came to the rescue in the early films mighty mouse would not appear until nearly three quarters through the cartoon beginning with a fight to the finish 1947 the story line usually begins with mighty mouse and pearl pureheart already in a desperate situation as though in the next chapter of a serial mighty mouse cartoons spoofed the cliffhanger serials of silent films as well as the classic operettas of stage still popular at the time the characters often sing mock opera arias  eg pearl oil can harry youre a villain  oil can harry i know it but its a lot of fun  mighty mouse sings tenor pearl soprano oil can harry bassbaritone mighty mouse is also famous for singing here i come to save the day when flying into action in several mighty mouse cartoons whenever he achieves the most impossible physical tasks the narrator exclaims first softly what a mouse  then loudly what a mouse the early mighty mouse cartoons often portray mighty mouse as a ruthless fighter one of his most frequent tactics is to fly under an enemys chin and let loose a volley of blows subduing the opponent through sheer physical punishment villains while his typical opponents are nondescript cats mighty mouse occasionally battles specific villains though most appear in only one or two films several of the earliest super mouse films having been made during world war ii  feature the cats as thinly veiled caricatures of the nazis hunting down mice and marching them into concentration camp like traps to what would otherwise be their doom the batcats alien cats with bat wings and wheels for feet appeared in two cartoons in two others between 1949 and 1950 he faces a huge dimwitted but superstrong cat named julius pinhead schlabotka voiced by dayton allen whose strength rivals mighty mouses in rare moments he confronts nonfeline adversaries such as human bad guy bad bill bunion and his horse or the automatic mouse trap a brontosaurshaped robotic monster in the green line 1944 the cats and the mice live on either side of a green dividing line down the middle of their towns main street they agree to keep the peace as long as no one crosses it an evil entity a satan cat starts the cats and mice fighting at the end mighty mouse is cheered by

lineup in this series mighty mouse has a real identity mike mouse both identities voiced by patrick pinney  and a sidekick scrappy mouse voiced by actress dana hill  the little orphan though a

a scene of chaos and terror visibly unfolding in the street outside the commercial was hastily withdrawn in the wake of the september 11 2001 attacks the character appeared in the 1999 pilot curbside 5the rights to mighty mouse are now divided as a result of the 2006 corporate split of viacom the former owner of the terrytoons franchise into two separate companies cbs operations a unit of the current cbs corporation owns the ancillary rights and trademarks to the character while paramount home entertainment cbs home entertainment holds home video rights the first official release of mighty mouse material has been announced and what is now cbs television distribution has television syndication rights the shorts are currently out of circulation failed feature film adaptation as early as 2004 paramount pictures omation animation studios and nickelodeon movies announced their intention to bring mighty mouse back to the motion picture screen with a cgi mighty mouse feature film that was tentatively scheduled to be released some time in 2013 5 however this has yet to happen criticism mighty mouse the new adventures was the subject of media controversy when one scene was interpreted as a depiction of cocaine use in the episode the littlest tramp a poor mouse girl attempts to sell flowers and is repeatedly harassed by a rich man who crushes her flowers 5 she runs out of flowers and makes new ones from sundry items she finds such as tomato slices but the man crushes these too 19 mighty mouse attempts to purchase the flowers with his chunk of cheese and to avenge the girl but she gives mighty mouse the crushed flowers and insists that others need help more than she does after successfully saving several different characters he is reminded of the girl and attempts to smell the flowers she gave him now a pink powder inhaling them in the process he then finds the man that has been harassing the girl and spanks him the girl is sympathetic to the man and he is so moved that the two are married a family in kentucky saw the episode and reportedly interpreted the scene as mighty mouse snorting cocaine the family called the american family association in tupelo mississippi the group demanded bakshi be removed from production of the series 20 bakshi and cbs denied the allegations bakshi stating the whole incident smacks of mc carthyism im not going to get into who sniffs what this is lunacy 19 to defuse the controversy bakshi agreed to cut the 35 seconds from the episode rev donald wildmon claimed that the editing was a de facto admission of cocaine use though bakshi maintained that the episode was totally innocent 5its because of fritz that theyre going after mighty mouse i grew up in brownsville in brooklyn and attended high school for industrial arts i remember teachers who quit because of mc carthyism they werent able to teach what they wanted this is the same thing mighty mouse was happy after smelling the flowers because it helped him remember the little girl who sold it to him fondly but even if youre right their accusations become part of the air we breathe thats why i cut the scene i cant have children wondering if mighty mouse is using cocaine—
