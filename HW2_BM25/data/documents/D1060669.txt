taxis from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search this article is about the behavioural response for other uses see taxi disambiguation a taxis plural taxes 1 2 3  ˈ t æ k s iː z  from ancient greek τάξις taxis meaning arrangement 4 is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food taxes are innate behavioural responses a taxis differs from a tropism turning response often growth towards or away from a stimulus in that in the case of taxis the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source 5 6 it is sometimes distinguished from a kinesis a nondirectional change in activity in response to a stimulus contents  hide 1 classification2 examples3 terminology derived from taxis direction4 see also5 references6 external links classification  edittaxes are classified based on the type of stimulus and on whether the organisms response is to move towards or away from the stimulus if the organism moves towards the stimulus the taxis is positive while if it moves away the taxis is negative for example flagellate protozoans of the genus euglena move towards a light source this reaction or behaviour is called positive phototaxis since phototaxis refers to a response to light and the organism is moving towards the stimulus many types of taxis have been identified includingaerotaxis stimulation by oxygenanemotaxis by windbarotaxis by pressurechemotaxis by chemicalsdurotaxis by stiffnesselectrotaxis or galvanotaxis by electric currentgravitaxis by gravityhydrotaxis by moisturemagnetotaxis by magnetic fieldphototaxis by lightrheotaxis by fluid flowthermotaxis by changes in temperaturethigmotaxis by physical contactdepending on the type of sensory organs present a taxis can be classified as a klinotaxis where an organism continuously samples the environment to determine the direction of a stimulus a tropotaxis where bilateral sense organs are used to determine the stimulus direction and a telotaxis where a single organ suffices to establish the orientation of stimulus examples  editaerotaxis is the response of an organism to variation in oxygen concentration and is mainly found in aerobic bacteria 7anemotaxis is the response of an organism to wind many insects show a positive anemotactic response turningflying into the wind upon exposure to an airborne stimulus cue from a food source chemotaxis is a response elicited by chemicals that is a response to a chemical concentration gradient 7 for example chemotaxis in response to a sugar gradient has been observed in motile bacteria such as e coli 8 chemotaxis also occurs in the antherozoids of liverworts ferns and mosses in response to chemicals secreted by the archegonia 7 unicellular eg protozoa or multicellular eg worms organisms are targets of chemotactic substances a concentration gradient of chemicals developed in a fluid phase guides the vectorial movement of responder cells or organisms inducers of locomotion towards increasing steps of concentrations are considered as chemoattractants while chemorepellents result moving off the chemical chemotaxis is described in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells but signalling mechanisms receptors intracellular signaling and effectors are significantly different durotaxis is the directional movement of a cell along a stiffness gradient electrotaxis or galvanotaxis is the directional movement of motile cells in response to an electric field it has been suggested that by detecting and orienting themselves toward the electric fields cells are able to direct their movement towards the damages or wounds to repair the defect it also is suggested that such a movement may contribute to directional growth of cells and tissues during development and regeneration this notion is based on the existence of measurable electric fields that naturally occur during wound healing development and regeneration and cells in cultures respond to applied electric fields by directional cell migration – electrotaxis  galvanotaxis energy taxis is the orientation of bacteria towards conditions of optimal metabolic activity by sensing the internal energetic conditions of cell therefore in contrast to chemotaxis taxis towards or away from a specific extracellular compound energy taxis responds on an intracellular stimulus eg proton motive force activity of ndh 1 and requires metabolic activity 9gravitaxis known historically as geotaxis is a response to the attraction due to gravity the planktonic larvae of the king crab lithodes aequispinus use a combination of positive phototaxis movement towards the light and negative gravitaxis upward movement 10 both positive and negative gravitaxes are found in a variety of protozoans  eg loxodes remanella and paramecium  11magnetotaxis is strictly speaking the ability to sense a magnetic field and coordinate movement in response however the term is commonly applied to bacteria that contain magnets and are physically rotated by the force of the earths magnetic field in this case the behaviour has nothing to do with sensation and the bacteria are more accurately described as magnetic bacteria 12pharotaxis is the movement to a specific location in response to learned or conditioned stimuli or navigation by means of landmarks 13 14phonotaxis is the movement of an organism in response to sound phototaxis is the movement of an organism in response to light that is the response to variation in light intensity and direction 7 15 negative phototaxis or movement away from a light source is demonstrated in some insects such as cockroaches 7 positive phototaxis or movement towards a light source is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis many phytoflagellates eg euglena and the chloroplasts of higher plants positively phototactic moving towards a light source 7 two types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes scotophototaxis is observable as the movement of a bacterium out of the area illuminated by a microscope when entering darkness signals the cell to reverse direction and reenter the light a second type of positive phototaxis is true phototaxis which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light rheotaxis is a response to a current in a fluid positive rheotaxis is shown by fish turning to face against the current in a flowing stream this behaviour leads them to hold their position in a stream rather than being swept downstream some fish will exhibit negative rheotaxis where they will avoid currents thermotaxis is a migration along a gradient of temperature some slime molds and small nematodes can migrate along amazingly small temperature gradients of less than 01 °ccm 16 they apparently use this behaviour to move to an optimal level in soil 17 18thigmotaxis is the response of an organism to physical contact or to the proximity of a physical discontinuity in the environment eg rats preferring to swim near the edge of a water maze codling moth larvae are believed to used thigmotatic sense to locate fruits to feed on 19terminology derived from taxis direction  editthere are five types of taxis based on the movement of organisms klinotaxis occurs in organisms with receptor cells but no paired receptor organs the cells for reception are located all over the body particularly towards the anterior side the organisms detect the stimuli by turning their head sideways and compare the intensity when the intensity of stimuli is balanced equally from all sides then the organisms move in a straight line the movement of blowfly and butterfly larvae clearly demonstrates klinotaxis tropotaxis is displayed by organisms with paired receptor cells when the stimuli coming from a source are balanced equally the organisms show movement because of this animals are able to move sideways unlike klinotaxis where the organisms can move only in a straight line the movement of grayling butterflies and fish lice clearly demonstrates tropotaxis telotaxis requires paired receptors the movement occurs along the direction where the intensity of the stimuli is stronger telotaxis is clearly seen in the movement of bees when they leave their hive to look for food they balance the stimuli from the sun as well as from flowers but land on the flower whose stimulus is most intense for them menotaxis describes organisms maintenance of a constant angular orientation a clear demonstration is shown by bees returning to their hive at night and the movement of ants with respect to the sun mnemotaxis is the use of memory to follow trails that organisms have left when travelling to or from their home see also  editanimal locomotion haptotaxis mechanotaxis optomotor response tropism references  edit httpwwwthefreedictionarycomtaxis
