dietary guidelines to treat and prevent atherosclerosis atherosclerosis clinically defined as hardening of the arteries is an early form of heart disease in which plaque builds up inside the arteries and limits blood flow to major organs including the heart brain and kidneys and to the pelvis spine arms legs fingers and toes this can cause heart failure stroke and aneurisms chronic kidney disease back pain erectile dysfunction and peripheral artery disease plaque formation and symptoms the prefix “athero” originates from latin roots to signify soft gruellike deposit 1 arterial plaque consists of cholesterol fat deposits calcium and excess fluid which can block off an artery or decrease the rate of blood flow throughout the entire body when blood flow is restricted two things happen a blood clot forms—further narrowing the arteries—or a heart attack occurs in the united states a heart attack takes place every 43 seconds attributing to 15 million heart attacks each year—about half of which result in death 2chest pain shortness of breath dizziness fatigue or a tingling sensation in the hands feet and toes are all symptoms of reduced blood flow throughout the body which can be diagnosed through a series of tests including an electrocardiogram ekg stress test anklebrachial index test abi blood tests xrays echocardiography angiography computed tomography scans magnetic resonance imaging mri and positron emission tomography pet click to enlarge pathology and dietary risk factors atherosclerosis often starts in childhood 20 years before a formal diagnosis 3 vascular physiologist michael skilton ph d with the university of sydney’s boden institute of obesity nutrition exercise and eating disorders suspects it starts in utero based on the effect parents’ dietary choices have on the development of endothelial function or development of cells that line the arteries 4click to enlarge photo credit pepine am j cardiol 1998according to the american society of nutrition 97 percent of adults fall short on recommended dietary fiber intake a nutrient only found in plants with adults and teens consuming roughly half of the government’s recommended five servings of fruits and vegetables each day 56 only 13 percent of adults consume 15 to 2 cups of fruit and just 9 percent eat 2 to 3 cups of vegetables each day 7 our nation’s dietary patterns help illustrate why onethird of adults have elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure 89 and why twothirds struggle with excess weight 10 three leading risk factors for cardiovascular disease treatment the good news is that a plantbased dietary intervention is even more effective than today’s leading medications to treat and prevent heart disease thanks to a high intake of fruits vegetables whole grains nuts soy products fiber and phytochemicals and a reduced intake of saturated fats and cholesterol 1112 about half of americans even those who maintain a healthful weight still have at least one modifiable risk factor such as high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol for chronic disease 13 integrating diet and other lifestyle changes—exercise maintaining a healthful weight avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol consumption—leaves consumers with only desirable side effects and can prevent around 80 percent of all premature heart disease cases 14it’s never too late to start studies show heartattack survivors who adopt a highfiber diet reduce the risk of a recurrence by about 40 percent compared to survivors who make no dietary changes 15to fast track your diet for optimal heart health here are five guidelines to follow dietary guidelines for atherosclerosis prevention the dietary guidelines for atherosclerosis prevention will be released at the international conference on nutrition and medicine icnm for cardiovascular disease at 2 pm est on saturday aug 1 2015 the dietary guidelines are as follows1 choose plantbased foods vegetables beans whole grains and fruit 2 minimize refined grains added salt and sweeteners 3 include some nuts and seeds avoid oils 4 avoid foods containing saturated and trans fats 5  have a reliable source of vitamin b12 discussion1 choose plantbased foods vegetables beans whole grains and fruit the average adult at risk for cardiovascular disease who adopts plantbased diet coupled with weekly nutrition education classes can expect to lose 10 pounds16 reduce blood pressure by 75 mm hg 17 lower ldl cholesterol levels by 13 mgd l 18 improve blood sugar or a1c by 12 percentage points and even see gains in productivity in just five months 1920 children who struggle with obesity and follow a plantbased diet show similar results—while also improving insulin resistance highsensitivity creactive protein and myeloperoxidase emerging risk factors for inflammation and heart disease 21plantbased vegan diets also provide participants of all ages with the largest net weight loss an advantage for those—75 percent of men 67 percent of women and 31 percent of children—struggling with excess body weight 2224by centering meals around vegetables fruits whole grains and legumes individuals can expect to see a high return on their health investment as studies show this approach reduces the risk of an early death certain forms of cancer and dementia 25272 minimize refined grains added salt and sweeteners in addition to increasing consumption of plantbased foods which helps boost intake of vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e folate vitamin c calcium magnesium potassium and fiber—nutrients underconsumed in the american diet—it’s best to limit or avoid refined grains added salt and sweeteners 13refined grains refined grains are starches that have been stripped of nutrients by food processing techniques and include white rice white flour and products made from other starches you’ll find refined grains lurking in the cereal aisle and snack food section at your local grocery store opt instead for intact whole grains which include wheat berries brown rice barley oats and quinoa which provide insoluble fiber that helps remove excess cholesterol from your body sodium target sodium levels vary based on age coexisting health conditions ethnicity and gender consult with a health care provider to find an ideal target which may range from 1500 to 2300 milligrams each day 28 ninety percent of the population overconsumes sodium with an average intake of 3592 milligrams each day 29 for individuals struggling with hypertension high amounts of sodium contribute to excess fluid in the body and makes it harder for the heart to maintain optimal blood flow—increasing the risk for cardiovascular problems added sweeteners added sweeteners are added to foods as they are processed and include sugarsweetened beverages sodas candy grain and dairybased desserts sugary breakfast cereals and yogurt a diet rich in these additives increases the risk for cardiovascular disease by 38 to 50 percent based on daily consumption patterns 30swapping added sugars for fruit that’s packed with vitamin c into one’s diet offers protective benefits reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease by 15 percent and the risk of an early death by 20 percent 31 try a cup of oranges strawberries red pepper sticks pineapple cooked broccoli or brussels sprouts which provides close to 100 percent of the daily value of vitamin c for men women and children 323 include some nuts and seeds avoid oils nuts and seeds—particularly almonds walnuts pine nuts brazil nuts and flaxseeds—offer hearthealthful benefits thanks to their nutrient density they provide fiber vitamin e plant sterols larginine polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats and omega3fatty acids these vitamins nutrients and minerals team up to lower ldl cholesterol levels attack plaque formation and provide flexible support for the arterial walls reducing the likelihood of blood clots 3335use just a small amount a few times each week since nuts are a highcalorie food one to 15 ounces the size of your palm provides roughly 250 calories and is all you’ll need to reap the hearthealthful benefits 3637 try crushing a handful of nuts or seeds in your palm and use to top salads soups breakfast bowls or to add to sauces or stews with nuts and seeds it’s best to go straight to the source and skip oils their processed counterparts when oil is extracted from its original source—sunflower seeds olives walnuts etc—the fiber is removed and calories start to add up fast nullifying the health and weightloss benefits a plantbased diet has to offer 384 avoid foods containing trans and saturated fats trans fats the food and drug administration is phasing out trans fatty acids fats that remain solid at room temperature which you’ll find in margarine coffee creamers chicken wings pastries crackers chips and most packaged and prepared food items trans fats manipulate cholesterol increasing the bad ldl levels while decreasing the good hdl levels in addition to altering cholesterol ratios trans fats cause damage to cells that line arterial walls and increase inflammation a precursor for obesity heart disease cancer and stroke 39the nurse’s health study a harvard review of 166 women who developed coronary artery disease finds study participants who consumed the most trans fats an average of 36 grams per day the equivalent of a double quarterpounder with cheese with a small vanilla milkshake tripled their risk for an immediate heart attack 4041 the harvard school of public health estimates we can prevent a quarter of a million heart attacks each year simply by eliminating trans fats from our diets 42saturated fats saturated fats which you’ll find in animal products and oils pose significant hearthealth risks too for every 1 percent increase in energy from saturated fat intake ldl cholesterol concentration increases by about 2 percentage points 43 similar patterns emerge with dietary cholesterol for every 100 milligrams consumed the equivalent of half an egg total cholesterol increases by about two to 10 points 44 the leading sources of saturated fat in the american diet which often come prepackaged with dietary cholesterol are cheese pizza dairy and grainbased desserts and chicken followed by processed meats including sausage franks bacon ribs burgers and mexican mixed dishes 45 recent statistics show more than 70 percent of children and teens and more than 50 percent of u s adults exceed saturated fat recommendations 13 diets rich in saturated and trans fats cost consumers years from their life compared to counterparts who opt for healthful plantbased fare 465 supplement with vitamin b12 adults and children over the age of 14 should consume 24 mcg of vitamin b12 each day through supplements or multivitamins without added aluminum copper or iron women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should consume 26 and 28 mcg respectively 47resources for cardiovascular health download
