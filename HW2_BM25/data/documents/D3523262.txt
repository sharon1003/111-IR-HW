classifies offenses locally known as burglary any degree unlawful entry with intent to commit a larceny or felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a larceny housebreaking safecracking and all attempts at these offenses as burglary the ucr programs definition of a structure includes but is not limited to the following apartment barn cabin church condominium dwelling house factory garage house trailer or houseboat used as permanent dwellingmill office other building outbuilding public building railroad car room school stable storage facility vessel shipwarehouse additionally any house trailer or other mobile unit that is permanently fixed as an office residence or storehouse is considered a structure tents tent trailers motor homes house trailers or other mobile units that are

where lodging of transients is the main purpose can present reporting problems to law enforcement if a number of units under a single manager are burglarized and the offenses are most likely to be reported to the police by the manager rather than the individual tenants the burglary must be reported as a single offense examples are burglaries of a number of rental hotel rooms rooms in flop houses rooms in youth hostels and units in a motel if the individual living areas in a building are rented or leased to the occupants for a period of time that would preclude the tenancy from being classified as transient then the burglaries would most likely be reported separately by the occupants such burglaries must be reported as separate offenses examples of this latter type of multiple burglary would be the burglaries of a number of apartments in an apartment house of the offices of a number of commercial firms in a business building of the offices of separate professionals within one building or of a number of rooms in a college dormitory thefts from automobiles whether locked or not shoplifting from commercial establishments and thefts from telephone booths coin boxes or coinoperated machines are all classified as larcenytheft offenses if the area entered was one of open access thefts from the area would not involve an unlawful trespass and would be classified as larcenytheft a forcible entry or unlawful entry in which no theft or felony occurs but acts of vandalism malicious mischief etc are committed is not classified as a burglary provided investigation clearly established that the unlawful entry was for a purpose other than to commit a felony or theft for information about vandalism as a part ii offense see page 141 of course if the offender unlawfully entered the structure a multiple offense exists and the agency must classify the offense as a burglary larcenytheft is an element of burglary and therefore must not be reported as a separate offense if associated with the unlawful entry of a structure if a forcible or unlawful entry of a building is made to steal a motor vehicle the reporting agency must count the offense and the value of the vehicle under burglary not motor vehicle theft when a question arises as to whether a type of structure comes within the scope of the burglary definition the law enforcement officer must look to the nature of the crime and be guided by the examples set forth if a question remains the agency should contact its state ucr program direct contributors should contact the national uniform
