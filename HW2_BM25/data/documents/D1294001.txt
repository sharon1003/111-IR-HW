ガメラ is a giant flying turtlelike creature from a popular series of daikaiju eiga monster movies produced by daiei motion picture company in japan created in 1965 to rival the success of toho studios  godzilla during the kaiju boom of the midtolate 1960s gamera has gained fame and notoriety as a japanese icon in his own right in the united states gamera attained prominence during the 1970s due to the burgeoning popularity of uhf television stations featuring saturday afternoon matinee showcases like creature double feature and later in the 1990s when several of his movies were featured on the cult television program mystery science theater 3000 despite being for kids the monster action is filled with blood and gore  guiron chops up space gyaos zigra slices gamera open zedus gets his tongue

1996gamera in 1999unlike any other species of turtles gamera has the habit of walking bipedally rather than on all fours though he occasionally walks quadrupedally in his first three films gamera was capable of using his upper limbs in the same manner as godzilla as his forelegs had appendages much closer in construction to hands than feet and was capable of grappling with opponents and manipulating objects his mouth is filled with teeth unlike any living modern turtle several types of extinct prehistoric turtles were toothed however with a pair of large tusks protruding upward from his lower jaw gamera is also usually seen with very large humanlike eyes though in the showa series they were comically large and cartoonishlooking adding intelligence to his overall appearance origins in the shōwa era films gamera was a gigantic prehistoric species of tortoise who fed on flames reawakened by an accidental atomic blast in the arctic during a dogfight between us and russian fighters the film mentioned that gamera had appeared before from pictographs depicting gamera and warning of his ability of flight gameras original origins are largely unknown in the showa era as there is no indication that he was a mutation in his original film gamera was already capable of flight and breathed true flames rather than radioactive energy when he was reawakened and while it was known that he fed on flames and even radioactive materials such as plutonium much like his counterpart godzilla  no explanation for these powers was given it was also left unexplained as to why he attacked most of humanity in general yet spared the life of and indeed actively saved a young boy who became central to the original films plot this later led to him being referred to as the friend to all children in the world in future films in the heisei era films however the origin of gamera was retconned giving him a much more directly heroic themed origin a bioengineered guardian of the earth created by the lost city of atlantis with the purpose of defeating gyaos another ancient creation capable of killing all human life on earth the giant turtle is found floating adrift in the pacific encased in rock and mistaken for an atoll within the rock investigators soon discovered a large monolith explaining gameras purpose as well as dozens of orihalcummagatama which allow a psychic link between gamera and humans in the third film of the heisei era an undersea graveyard is found with many other gamera skeletons suggesting gamera was not the only member of his kind created by atlantis one character in the film refers to these skeletons as beta versions of gamera possible failures in atlantis attempts to create the final version another scene provides gamera with a link to asian folklore with a character relating a story in which a giant tortoise is considered the guardian of the north with separate rival creatures defending the east west and south  gameras continuity was rebooted again in the first and currently only film of the millennium era the film begins with gamera sacrificing himself to destroy a flock of gyaos birds sometime in the 1970s capabilities gameras shell is extremely resilient and strong missiles and other weaponry merely bounce off of it along with most of his opponents attacks there have been a few times where his shell has faltered most notably when guiron hammered at the same spot several times and began cutting through gyaos  sonic beam zigra s paralyzing beam and barugon s rainbow ray cannot penetrate gameras shell shown in the films when he withdraws into his shell to avoid the attacks gameras stomach however is softer and not as resilient and he has been cut and gouged in his stomach to the point of bleeding his blood is blue in the shōwa era series but green in the heisei and millennium era films in the shōwa series gamera fed on fire and was attracted by other heat sources such as power plants and barugon s rainbow ray attackand in his first movie he was lured to a rocket by fire  he could breathe intensely hot streams of flames from his mouth when caught in a more serious situation the heisei version on the other hand could blast off mighty plasma fireballs from his mouth usually very quickly and with varying accuracy they were highly explosive at the end of g1 gamera absorbs fire and fires a superpowered plasma fireball and in g2 he breaths in the oxygen produced by a legion plant and fires an oxygenpowered plasma fireball the heisei version could also absorb a great deal of  mana  or the living essence and energy of life on earth and release an extremely powerful stream of pure plasma and fire from an opened organic cannon in his chest in the final film of the heisei series gamera blasted his own arm off and absorbed plasma fireballs shot by iris and used his stump arm to grow back his arm in a plasma form theoretically he could do the same to other body parts as well seeing this he has the ability to manipulate fire in the unofficial film gamera 4 the truth the pyrokinetic chelonian apparently used this ability to enable himself to wield dual fire swords on each arm of course gamera also has the ability to fly generally gamera will pull his arms legs head and tail into his shell fire flames out of his arm and leg cavities and spin around like a frisbee this mode of flight had an added advantage in the later films where he would use the sharp edges of his shell to cut enemies while spinning similar to a circular saw he has a second way of flying where he only pulls his legs andor tail in fires flames from the leg cavities and flies like a jet in the heisei era films gameras arms would extend and stretch out into wings similar to the flippers of a sea turtle while in flight giving him added aerodynamics and control the heisei films gave gamera one more additional weapon a pair of sharp spikes protruding from his elbows in his first heisei era appearance these spikes were hidden during the majority of the film extending only when needed in battle in later appearances they were permanently extended when seriously or gravely injured gamera can enter a comalike state in order to heal this often fools his opponents into thinking that he is dead this ability has been used in almost every gamera film gameras only major weakness is cold the monster barugon was able to achieve success against gamera using his freezing spray and scientists nearly defeated gamera during his first appearance using special freezing bombs this weakness was only shown in gameras earliest films and has not been explored since profiles showa gamera classification giant turtle age 8000 years old withers height 60 meters total length unknown shell diameter

gameras plastron the covering on his stomach opens and the energy is expelled outward it is said it can only be used once during gameras lifetime whether this is because of the strain on his body or

made his first appearance in 1965s gamera which was also the only gamera film to be in blackandwhite this film also was the last giant monster movie to be in black and white subsequent films usually directed by noriaki yuasa and written by nisan takahashi quickly became a big hit with children who loved watching gamera fight monsters barugon gyaos viras guiron jiger and zigra a seventh sequel was slated for a 1972 release tentatively titled gamera vs garasharp gross mismanagement of daiei however put the company into bankruptcy and the gamera films were forced to cease production after daiei was purchased by tokuma shoten in 1974 the new management wanted to do a new gamera film in 1980 so gamera super monster was produced the majority of the film used stock footage with limited new scenes of gamera flying and acted as a recap of gameras history however yuasa and takahashi felt that they had done all they could with the monster so they respectfully killed off gamera at the end of the film through the years on both sides of the pacific fans of gamera or godzilla have debated which monster is better the latter would generally be considered the victor in that godzilla was considered to have higher standards than gamera who was just a monster for kids the giant turtle thus often became the object of ridicule especially on the american tv series mystery science theater 3000 which lampoons bmovies and featured five of the original seven gamera films during their third season it should be noted though that the series also featured and mocked two godzilla films a year before heisei history this era began with gamera guardian of the universe during the course of the first film three gyaos are discovered on a remote island the japanese government discovers that they are all female and decides that since they are the last of their kind they should be captured and studied so a trap is set for them meanwhile a search has been assembled for a moving atoll in the pacific they find it staying still and searching the surface finding many small gems made of an unknown metal they also discover a stone sticking up out of the center of it and they attempt to dig it out they manage to take pictures and collect some of the strange gems but the stone crumbles and the atoll takes off towards japan at high speeds it ends up that the atoll is actually an ancient guardian of earth made by the atlanteans called gamera he attacks the gyaos killing two but one escapes it feasts on the other newly born gyaos and grows to gameralike proportions the two battle and gamera manages to defeat it blowing its head off with his breath heading back to the seas in gamera 2 advent of legion earth was attacked by a swarm of extraterrestrial insectlike creatures known as legion  the second gamera from gamera 4 truth in between gamera 2 advent of legion and gamera 3 awakening of irys there was a dark horse comic series that showed more battles that gamera waged in gamera 3 awakening of irys gamera had to face hordes of gyaos and the ultimate gyaos called irys there was also an unofficial fan film named gamera 4 truth  gamera in gamera the brave in gamera the brave gamera returns to his shōwa era roots but with a modern twist in the film gamera is first seen defending japan back in the 1970s from the gyaos but sacrifices himself to destroy them by selfdestructing mystery science theater 3000 appearances gamera was a frequent whipping boy on the third season of mystery science theater 3000 where five of the shōwa era films were mocked 1 the only

plans godzilla and gamera face off many fans have wondered if gamera and godzilla may appear in a film together perhaps similar to king kong vs godzilla  but daiei motion picture company and toho studios have no plans for a teamup however in 2004 a rumor was posted on henshinonline that a godzillagamera film would happen yet neither studio has made plans for it gamera was according to an inetrview with simon strange considered for godzilla unleashed it is apparent that this idea was not accepted but it may hint that gamera could show up in the next atari and pipeworks game comic books
