various forums that seems to remain unresolved on one point when is eyerelief too much i have very little experience with scoped rifles or maybe i wouldnt have to ask this i shoot competition with irons and hobby around with milsurps if a scope claims an eyerelief of 4 to 45 what happens if it is mounted three inches from where your eye lines up when the gun is held in a natural position does this make it hard to pick up the image if so is it a little difficult but insignificant or pretty darned annoying my problem is that ive about decided on a leupold vxi or fx1 to mount on a remington model five zastava charles daly etc based on the sleek form and compact dimensions of the leupold but it has the longest eyerelief listed of any of the scopes i have compared it to and i think the model five may be just compact enough that im not going to be able to mount the scope 4 ahead of my eye should i reconsider my choice of one of the leupolds and look further for a pleasing scope with

rifles use something around 4 inches a few to 5 the scout scopes are 2 or 3 time further out some of the better scope offer some flexibility with this window most variable scopes also vary the eye relief less as you dial up the power some of the new nikon monarchs claim to have a fixed eye relief over the range of the scope a nice feature about the time you get pick up one of this nifty half moon scars in your eyebrow you begin to appreciate good proper eye relief on a rimfire this is not an issue you do want to mount the scope with eye relief in the proper eye relief range when you pull up the rifle for expediency the best picture possible and to avoid the infamous half moon scar leupold makes some very nice rimfire scopes you should look at before putting your money down i like leupolds but there are other good ones out there my 2 cents worth for the evening good shooting and god promised men that good and obedient wives would be found in all corners of the earth then he

say their eye releif is say 4 inchesyou actually have about an inch either side of that they are not as criticall as say a schmidt and bender where if you are a little too far forward or in back ofyou lose everything but you give up some of the fine resolution in doing that i would say get the leupold and be happy 2919737  032809re eyerelief  how much is too much  re huntz mule deer campfire oracle joined jul 2001 posts 43494 banana belt montana one principle of scope optics is the longer the eye relief the more flexible it is while 4 of eye relief may be optimum in a certain scope you wil also be able to place your eye 35 or 45 behind the scope and easily pick up the entire field of view or close to it with 3 of eye relief there is much less flexbility the downside is that longer eye relief results in a smaller field of view everything else being equal this is why a scout scope has a very tiny field of view magnification of course also has an effect on fov as does the diameter of the ocular rear lens john gunwriters as you know arent as informed as their readers are and if it wasnt for the readers there would be no need for writersshrapnel may 20152921059  032909re eyerelief  how much is too much  re gun reader eremicus campfire kahuna joined mar 2001 posts 18881 placervillecausaif you put your eye three inches from the ocular of a rifle scope with a 455 inch eye relief you will see nothing your eye has to fall inside whats known as the eye box of that scope to see the image eye box refers to the leeway fore and aft you have in placing your head on the rifle stock one of the most important things in choosing a scope is the question as to how well you can position it so that you place your head inside the scopes eye box ive learned for instance that i can use only about 45 inches or eye relief with my build  long neck and the dimensions of the stocks on my rifle i do insist however in using such scopes the dead minimum that i will use is about 35 inches even then it must have lots of leeway in head position or ill look for something else while this may sound like alot of trouble ive found that it is well worth it especially if you ever need to shoot in a hurry at a fast moving animal it is also important if you shoot from different positions and hunt in a wide range of temperatures alpha2922683  032909re eyerelief  how much is too much  re eremicus
