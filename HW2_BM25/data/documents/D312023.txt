2606 427 2421maricopa county has a long history of being a republican party stronghold while the city of phoenix leans towards the democratic party along with some other small areas within the county the rest of the county tends to vote heavily republican every republican presidential candidate has carried maricopa county since 1948 this includes the 1964 presidential run of native son barry goldwater who would not have even carried his own state had it not been for a 21000vote margin in maricopa county it is currently the largest county in the country to vote republican since 1964 democrats have only kept the margin to single digits four times–in 1992 1996 and 2016 despite its apparent political leanings maricopa county voted against proposition 107 in the 2006 election this referendum designed to ban gay marriage and restrict domestic partner benefits was rejected by a 516–484 margin within the county and statewide by a similar margin two years later however a majority of county residents voted to pass the ultimately successful state constitutional amendment banning samesex marriage the county board of supervisors consists of five members chosen by popular vote within their own districts currently the board consists of four republicans each representing districts in the more affluent or conservative districts of the county and one democrat representing the largest district 22 each member serves a fouryear term with no term limits unlike cities and towns in arizona counties are politically and legally subordinate to the state and do not have charters of their own the board of supervisors acts in the capacity of executive authority for the county within the statutes and powers prescribed by arizona state law the state legislature devotes considerable time to local matters with limited discretion granted to the board of supervisors on minor ordinance and revenue collection issues chair of the board is held by one member for a period of one year and is selected by the board members themselves through public hearing the election of the county sheriff county attorney county assessor county treasurer superintendent of schools county recorder constables justices of the peace clerk of the superior court and retention of superior court judges are also determined by popular vote the countys dominant political figure for over two decades from 1993 to 2017 was sheriff joe arpaio who had dubbed himself americas toughest sheriff and gained national notoriety for his flamboyant and often controversial practices and policies 23as maricopa
