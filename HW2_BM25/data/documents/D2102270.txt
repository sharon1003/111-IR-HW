jr c 1973 courtesy of artist gary flanagan in 1964 when the british invasion was in progress and american rockers were tough to find on the u s pop charts johnny rivers was one of the first to regain a foothold his first top 10 record came right in the midst of beatlemania his formula was much the same as the british style vintage american rock n roll and rb played with a verve and simplicity that gave his music a contemporary edge over the next four years his funky gogo rock gave him a steady stream of top 10 records his first 1 record came when against the advice of the record company he abruptly switched gears and began cutting ballads the southern tone in much of rivers music was authentic john henry ramistella was born november 7 1942 in new york city when he was about five his father wound up out of work the ramistellas moved to baton rouge louisiana where an uncle head of the louisiana state university art department got johns dad work painting houses and antiquing furniture johns first musical inspiration was his father my dad and uncle used to get together and play these old italian folk songs on mandolin and guitar as john started playing he listened to rb on the latenight radio megawatt stations like wlac in nashville however rb was a way of life in baton rouge when i went to baton rouge junior high fats domino jimmy reed and guys like that used to play at our dances rivers says by junior high he was sitting in with various local bands including one led by dick holler who later wrote abraham martin and john hollers guitarist was the stillunknown jimmy clanton holler rivers says introduced me to a lot of rb artists and opened up a whole new world for me johnny formed his own band the spades in 1956 we played all fats tunes little richard larry williams bobby bland rivers says we became the hot little band around baton rouge then elvis presley and jerry lee lewis hit so i took on a little touch of rockabilly johnny and the spades toured louisiana texas mississippi arkansas and alabama his first recording hey little girl was released by the natchez mississippibased suede label and sold well on the spades touring circuit in 1957 john flew to new york during a school vacation and stayed with an aunt there he wanted to meet alan freed and he did it was like a scene out of an alan freed movie rivers says he was at wins in columbus circle i stood in front of the radio station it was freezing cold and he came up with jack hooke who was his manager i said my names johnny ramistella im from baton rouge louisiana and i have a band i play and write and id like you to hear my music alan gave me his card and said we have an office down at the brill building on broadway why dont you come down tomorrow afternoon i went down and jack hooke was there and i played four or five songs hooke called george goldner owner of gone and end records whose office was also in the brill legendary songwriter otis blackwell author of dont be cruel and great balls of fire arranged johns debut single baby come back bw long long walk freed also gave johnny a new name i was sitting around with jack and alan and they were gettin ready to release the record john remembers alan said your name you need to come up with something a little more musical we were talkin about where i grew up on the mississippi river and somehow rivers came out of that that was the first time i used that name baby come back was released in march 1958 his new york contacts also led to releases like your first and last love on the dee dee label issued that august and youre the one on the guyden label released in march 1959 none were hits back in baton rouge rivers began touring as a solo act with innovative southern comedian brother dave gardner at a show in birmingham alabama he met hank williams widow audrey who brought him to nashville around 1959 and got him a contract with cub a subsidiary of mgm records he cut two singles for cub backed by some of nashvilles best session players floyd kramer buddy harman bob moore and hank garland who became a close friend johnny also hung out with roger miller then a promising songwriter at tree music rogers publishing company rivers credits his uncanny gift of finding good songs and writers to his new york and nashville experiences i learned that the song was everything from hangin out at the brill building and in nashville around tree music he says i used to cut demos for hill and arrange songs when i was in new york guys like otis blackwell would come in with a new tune and theyd get me to do the elvis presley sound and cut demos for them 25 bucks a demo around 1960 as johnny alternated between nashville and baton rouge merle kilgore then a deejay at kwkh in shreveport got him a spot on the louisiana hayride he also introduced him to shreveport guitar legend james burton home on vacation from working with ricky nelson in california burton took a tape of johnnys song ill make believe back to california within a month he called to tell johnny that rick would record it the song wound up on nelsons 1960 imperial lp more songs by ricky rivers flew to l a met rick and the band and relocated to l a around 1961 i was thinking of producing records he says i was starting to give up on the artist idea id kicked around for so long i was starting to look in other areas then i met a producer named nick venet and wound up doing some stuff for capitol the 1962 capitol sides including a cover version of lefty frizzells country hit long black veil didnt sell but rivers contacts gained him work as a writer and producer rivers returned to the stage in 1963 almost by accident he was a regular customer at bill gazzaris club on la cienega blvd in l a for some time hangin out in the studios bein a musician i was always up late so i wound up goin by there quite a bit rivers says it was a little italian restaurant that usually stayed open until four in the morning when the clubs closed at two everyone that was still hungry would go get some good food he had a jazz trio there one night johnny found gazzari forlorn because his house band was leaving bill said youre a musician cant you come in and help us out for a few nights until i can find somebody i said i play funky rocknroll i dont think thats what you want in here he begged me please come in and play your stuff until i find another jazz group johnny devised a formula trini lopez had been playing over at pjs doin this slap rhythm thing i said i can do that kind of stuff i didnt have a band so i called eddie rubin a jazz drummer he wasnt gigging at the time so he and eddie went into gazzaris together‹just guitar and drums‹and played what we thought was going to be a three or fourday gig to everyones surprise huge crowds gathered to hear johnny and rubin play rock and rb hits gazzaris profits soared and when rivers was ready to leave gazzari offered him more money and let him hire a bassist joe osborn just starting to become an l a studio legend joined rivers and rubin rivers also met two men at gazzaris who would play major roles in his career lou adler who became his producer and elmer valentine who was opening an l a version of the paris whisky a gogo club on the sunset strip valentine offered rivers a years contract to appear at the new club on january 15 1964 he opened three days later the beatles i want to hold your hand entered the charts the whisky was a smash from opening night rivers says i brought my following from gazzaris rivers and his famous red gibson es335 guitar symbolized the strips new youthoriented atmosphere they werent at the whisky long when he and adler thought of cutting a live album another l a club owner loaned rivers and adler money to hire wally heiders remote recording unit we recorded this album two nights in a row and took it to every record company in town none of them wanted it johnny recalls liberty records executive bob skaff liked the tape and convinced reluctant liberty president al bennett to release it on imperial records bennett had purchased imperial from founder lew chudd and ran it as a small semiindependent label to release rivers recordings he and adler formed dunhill productions with bobby roberts an exmember of the dunhills a tap dancing group that inspired the name and pierre cossette now producer of the grammy awards show this eventually evolved into dunhill records home to l a rock legends the mamas  the papas the grass roots and steppenwolf adler and company were disappointed that the album would appear on what they considered a secondary label but not johnny when they said imperial records i just jumped up and went yeah yeah because i grew up with nothing but imperial records bobby mitchell fats domino and ricky nelson and i thought what a cool label both rivers and adler came to see imperials smallness as a plus it gave lou and me the autonomy to pick our own singles and work closely with the promotion men and marketing people rivers says i think that had a lot to do with why we had so much success because we had a real good handle on it start of page
