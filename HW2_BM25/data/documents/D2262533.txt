mint marks to avoid paying a high price for a low value coin at the outset i suggest an excellent reference for photographs the official red book a guide book of united states coins available on e bay in bookstores or in almost any coin or hobby shop allow me to state that i do not sell this coin guide lest the reader surmise that i am attempting to profit from this article quite the opposite is true i wish for you to profit or at least not get taken whenever shopping for this coin concentrate first on the 1979 specimen keep in mind that it must be from a proof set as these coins are the ones with the different types of s mint marks not the coins in circulation or those found in mint sets this is true of the 1981 specimen too as we all know proof sets were made in san francisco during this period so these coins will have the distinctive s mint mark mm just to the left of the portraits collar as you face the coin unless you have very keen eyesight obtain magnification 7x is sufficient to inspect the mm what do you see if it appears to be a glob of metal vaguely resembling an s your coin is a type 1 or as they are sometimes called filled s dollars but what if the mm actually looks like an s eureka you have a type 2 or clear s dollar which sells for quite a bit more price of course is determined by supply demand let us now consider the 1980 specimen all mint marks to date on this coin are of the clear s found on the 1979 type 2 dollar if you notice a different design in your searching you will perhaps have discovered a major findthe 1981 proof seems to be the most confusing and also the one which causes buyers to make most of their purchasing mistakes you now are familiar with the clear s mm found on the 1979s type 2 and the 1980s dollars on the 1981 it becomes the type 1 mint mark so what is scarce on the 1979 is now commonplace on the 1981 and 1980 both mint marks are clear on the 1981 dollar so to better understand the difference between the type 1 and type 2 mint marks imagine that you are standing on an oversized dollar and straddling the s the top of the type 1 the one we are familiar with is rounded and smooth in texture and its top and bottom ends or serifs are rounded and rather nondescript no goldmine here however the type 2 is noticeably different once you know what to notice first the top of the s is not rounded but somewhat flat and its texture is grainy and has the same frosty appearance as the portrait second the tips or serifs are distended and look similar to a swollen big toe if your feet look like mine as though the designer had some metal left over and just tacked it on to either end the top serif is the more distended of the two and will serve as a good pick up point pup when attempting to discern the types of mint marks once you can discern the differences in the mint marks on anthony dollars please know that the distinction also applies to the other denominations in the affected sets though their respective price differences are not as magnified so now when someone attempts to sell you a 1981 proof type 2 sba at a high high price advertising it only as a clear s you will know that he either doesnt know the difference or is betting that you dont or both if you were formerly beguiled by others deception or ignorance you no longer will be because you now have knowledge a caveat if you are buying sight unseen be especially leery of sellers who have a no return policy even if you think you are getting a great deal otherwise you could be stuck paying too much for that type 1 which you thought was the type 2 note ive included a photo of the type 2 mint mark which due to ebay constraints is not a really closeup shot tagsmint marksproof setsdollarsmint mark typesgaboycarl based in united states
