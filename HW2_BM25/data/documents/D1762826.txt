major autonomic domains including cardiovagal adrenergic and sudomotor the severity and distribution of dysautonomia is quantitated using composite autonomic severity scores cite this article copy citation novak p quantitative autonomic testing j vis exp 53 e2502 doi1037912502 2011 translate text to abstract disorders associated with dysfunction of autonomic nervous system are quite common yet frequently unrecognized quantitative autonomic testing can be invaluable tool for evaluation of these disorders both in clinic and research there are number of autonomic tests however only few were validated clinically or are quantitative here fully quantitative and clinically validated protocol for testing of autonomic functions is presented as a bare minimum the clinical autonomic laboratory should have a tilt table ecg monitor continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitor respiratory monitor and a mean for evaluation of sudomotor domain the software for recording and evaluation of autonomic tests is critical for correct evaluation of data the presented protocol evaluates 3 major autonomic domains cardiovagal adrenergic and sudomotor the tests include deep breathing valsalva maneuver headup tilt and quantitative sudomotor axon test qsart the severity and distribution of dysautonomia is quantitated using composite autonomic severity scores cass detailed protocol is provided highlighting essential aspects of testing with emphasis on proper data acquisition obtaining the relevant parameters and unbiased evaluation of autonomic signals the normative data and cass algorithm for interpretation of results are provided as well protocol1 equipment data acquisition and processing of autonomic signals as a bare minimum the clinical autonomic laboratory has to have motorized tilt table ecg noninvasive beattobeat blood pressure monitor respiratory monitor and a mean to evaluate sudomotor functions recommended equipment is listed at table 9 the data acquisition and analyzing software is a critical to be able to run the lab effectively unfortunately the commercially suitable software has some restrictions and most of the autonomic laboratories wrote their own acquisition or analyzing software in house robust r wave detection and detection of corresponding systolicdiastolic values in blood pressure eventually in blood flow is of paramount importance at university of massachusetts we use adinstrumentbased recording system  figures 14 table 9 that is easy to program and provides many mathematical functions in real time the protocol use in the paper is based on methodology developed primary by dr p low and his team 1 this paper assumes that the reader knows how to correctly place ecg electrodes setup of the continuous blood pressure monitor and how to record the data details of the electrodesensor placement and recommended standards for data acquisition are at reference 42 deep breathing deep breathing tests cardiac parasympathetic functions because the heart responses to deep breathing are mediated by the vagal nerve the test is also referred to as cardiovagal testing deep breathing evaluates changes in the instant heart rate that is provoked by “deep” breathing at 6 breathsmin the test is performed in supine position the test starts with a rest period that gives patient time to relax we usually record one minute baseline before proceeding with the deep breathing test obtain the baseline for one minute instruct subject to relax instruct subject to inhale for 5 seconds and exhale for 5 seconds this 10 second respiratory cycle should be repeated 6 times patient should breathe continuously and regularly respirator movement should resemble a wave sudden inhalationsexhalations or holding the breath should be avoided care should be taken not to hyperventilate preferentially breathing should be done through nostrils with closed mouth and the end tidal co 2 should be monitored to rule out hyperventilation calculate the respiratory sinus arrhythmia rsa rsa amplitude is defined as the difference between the end of expiration and end of inspiration in heart rate typically 6 respiratory cycles are identified  figure 5 and the respective rsa amplitudes are averaged normative values normative data are at table 1 interpretation of results deep breathing test measures cardiovagal functions both deep breathing and valsalva maneuver are needed for grading of cardiovagal functions valsalva maneuver and grading of cardiovagal impairment is described below3 valsalva maneuver valsalva maneuver evaluates 1 sympathetic adrenergic functions using the blood pressure responses  and 2 cardiovagal parasympathetic functions using the heart rate responses valsalva maneuver consists of forced expiration against the resistance with the expiratory pressure during strain at 40 mm hg for 15 seconds mouthpiece assembly the easy way to measure the expiratory pressure is to connect the pressure gauge to the 510 ml plastic syringe and to blow inside the syringe or any similar mouthpiece there should be a small air leak in the tubing to prevent closing of the glottis technique valsalva maneuver is usually performed in supine position if valsalva maneuver shows a squarebox response and no heart failure is suspected the table can be turned up 30 degree that can change the valsalva maneuever to more common four phase pattern let the subject practice at least one valsalva maneuver for short time seconds until the subject is comfortable with the procedure wait approximately 1 minute to allow the subject to be relaxed instruct the subject to “take deep breath and blow into the syringe keep the pressure 40 mm hg for 15 seconds” the subject should see the expiratory pressure as he can adjust the strain give the subject feedback how many seconds left if the pressure is suboptimal instruct subject to correct the pressure or repeat the valsalva maneuver wait 3 minutes repeat valsalva maneuver twice total 3 times select the most representative maneuver for evaluation obtain the following parameters from valsalva maneuver  figure 9 and figure 11  valsalva ratio maximal drop of the mean blood pressure during phase 2 the peak of the mean blood pressure at the end of late phase 2 recovery overshoot phase 4 maximal pulse pressure drop during phase 2pressure recovery time normative values normative values are at table 2 and table 3 interpretation of results valsalva maneuver evaluates both adrenergic and cardiovagal functions grading of adrenergic impairment requires both valsalva maneuver and tilt test grading of cardiovagal impairment requires both deep breathing and valsalva ratio4 tilt testing the test stimulates the autonomic nervous system with orthostatic stress by passive movement from a supine position to an upright tilt in a controlled laboratory setting technique ensure proper placement of the blood pressure sensor ideal blood pressure has well defined dicrotic notch and there is no drift of the baseline get the baseline blood pressure from the brachial artery acquire the 510 minutes baseline tilt patient up the tilt should be done at 70 degree the transition from supine to tilt position should smooth and of duration 510 seconds obtain the blood pressure from a brachial artery every minute observe subject for the presence of any discomfort chest pain shortness of breath dizziness lightheadedness syncope be prepared to terminate the tilt of any serious event occurs during the tilt based on clinical judgment typical duration of the tilt should be 10 minutes the tilt can be continued if no obvious abnormalities are detected but a clinical history is strongly suggestive of dysautonomia or blood pressure instability tilt the patient back normative values the normal responses in heart rate during the tilt is heart rate increment within 10  30 beats per minute at the same time the maximal heart rate should be less than 120 beats per minute normal responses in the blood pressure during the tilt is drop of the systolic blood pressure less than 30 mm hg or drop of the mean blood pressure less than 20 mm hg interpretation of results tilt tests predominantly evaluates adrenergic functions grading of adrenergic impairment requires results from both valsalva maneuver and tilt test and is described in section 65 sudomotor testing qsartquantitative sudomotor axon reflex test qsart evaluates the postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic functions most commonly used devices is the qsweat made by wr medical electronic there are 2 types of responses spontaneous and evoked typically larger capsules sampling area 506 cm 2 volume 3614 cm 3  are used for spontaneous responses and smaller capsules sampling area 07871 cm 2 volume 01229 cm 3 for evoked responses in the following all applies for the smaller capsule for the stimulation typical settings are current 2 m a 5 minutesassemble the capsules according to the manufacturer recommendation  figure 20  clean the recording sites vigorously with the alcohol recording sites are1 the medial forearm 75  distance from the ulnar epicondile to the pisiform bone 2 the proximal leg

figure 21  fill the capsules with 10 acetylcholine diluted in sterile water not normal saline  start sweat recording and verify on the qsweat machine that no leak is present in the case of the leak fix the capsule placement place the ground for stimulation about 5 cm next to the capsule wait until the baseline sweat is flat below 100 nanolitersminute and all channels give similar baseline sweat output difference  15  figure 2223  start stimulation at current 2 m a for 5 minutes turn on the marker  figure 24  record another 5 minute of the sweat total 10 minutes turn on the marker obtain the latencies and volumes at each site  figure 25normative values normative values are at table 4 interpretation of results grading of sudomotor impairment is below6 grading of autonomic impairment using the composite autonomic severity score casscass score provides unbiased and full quantification of the autonomic functions in cardiovagal adrenergic and sudomotor domain total score has a direct clinical meaning since it ranks the generalized dysautonomia as mild moderate and severe i removed some of ambiguities in the original definition of cass  3 the cass has the following subscores 1 cardiovagal  table 5   2 adrenergic  table 6  and 3 sudomotor  table 7  for calculation of cardiovagal score both deep breathing and valsalva ratio are required adrenergic score requires both valsalva maneuver and tilt test results sudomotor score can be calculated from qsart results or from the thermoregulator sweat test tst not described at this paper since the autonomic testing evaluates global autonomic functions the results are interpreted in term of generalized autonomic failure gaf results are referred to as normal cass total score  0 or abnormal the abnormalities ranges from mild gaf total cass score 13 to moderate total cass score 46 or severe total cass score 710 mild gaf with score 1 is usually of unclear or limited clinical significance the score higher than 1 is usually clinically significant and usually indicate the presence of autonomic neuropathy7 representative results examples of data acquisitions are at figure 14 all recorded signal should be clearly visible from a distance to a technician enabling the correct any recordings problems immediately both raw data and corresponding systolicdiastolicmean values should be available in real time  figure 1  the data acquisition system should provide a great amount of flexibility in the setting of the screen for example it should be easy to change the time scale  figure 2 or to choose between raw data

pressure during 10 minutes of tilt test mild orthostatic hypotension associated with mild adrenergic impairment is seen at figure 17  note also prominent fluctuations in both blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery that can be associated with adrenergic impairment severe adrenergic impairment can results in a progressive fall of the blood pressure as is seen in figure

particular pitfalls of each step of testing is discussed below equipment data acquisition and processing of autonomic signals there are number of pitfalls related primarily to data quality inadequate cleaning of skin can lead to excessive noise in ecg signal that can render detection of r wave difficult improper placement of the blood pressure sensor my give false high or low values transcranial doppler signal of high quality can be difficult to get in elderly patients due small bone window software for data processing may not be robust enough to distinguish artifacts at the blood pressure for example in parkinson patients with tremor deep breathing anxiety and abnormal respiratory pattern can affect the results of deep breathing subject should be well relaxed during the testing a good marker of anxiety is the heart rate profile if subject is anxious the heart rate can be elevated before starting deep breathing test make sure that the heart rate is not trending up or down if this happened wait until the mean heart rate remains flat the resting respiratory pattern should be normal eg there should be no hyperventilation as measured by end tidal co 2 or tachypnea respiratory rate is above 11 per minute the deep breathing test has limited usefulness in certain cardiac dysrythmia for example in atrial fibrillation or when the heart rate is controlled by pacemaker because the vagal nerve modulation of the heart will be override by either the heartgenerated rhythm or by a pacemaker basic knowledge of cardiac rhythm abnormalities is recommended improper detection of r waves due artifacts will obviously cause errors in results this can happened if the r waves are too small to be reliably detected or if the ecg background is noisy for example due poor skin contact valsalva maneuver valsalva maneuver requires considerable cooperation from the subjects many elderly or frail patients cannot perform the valsalva maneuver correctly most common reason is weakness of the mouth muscles that results in air leak during the respiratory strain in this case it is effective to gentle seal the air leak around the tube with fingers 6 evaluation of adrenergic functions cannot be done in a squarewave variant of valsalva maneuver  figure 10  this response is rare but can be seen in healthy subjects or in patients with congestive heart failure tilt testing number of medication can affect the tilt test rendering interpretation of the test difficult it is not always practical to discontinue medication before testing it may be difficult to obtain good quality recordings in movement disorders patients for example in parkinson patients with tremor sudomotor testing qsartincomplete removal of oily surface or too much skin irritation can affect sweat output leaks if the capsule is not watertight or pain due too much tight capsule commonly used medication has anticholinergic effect that interferes with the sweat test in many cases is in impractical to discontinue these medications rendering interpretation of results difficult grading of autonomic impairment using the composite autonomic severity score cass generation of cass score is quite cumbersome because it involves multiple comparisons in both absolute and percent values unfortunately there is no commercial software that enables to calculate the score automatically at umass we use proprietary
