helena rubinstein1870 – 1965by sara alpern my life for beauty helena rubinstein’s autobiography was published in 1966 a year after her death in the introduction her son roy titus called his mother’s life and work “so inseparable that a book dealing with one aspect without the other would seem incomplete” thus the first half recounts “my life” and the second half “for beauty” includes advice for achieving beautiful skin hair nails and so on the title is poignant and very appropriate in addition to her son’s assessment that rubinstein’s life and work were “inseparable” the title also lends credence to the theory that she gave her life for beauty late in life she expressed numerous doubts about the wisdom of her absorption in her career in beauty blaming this involvement for painful costs in her personal life helena rubinstein was born to jewish parents in crakow poland on december 25 1870 her father horace a not very successful wholesale food broker was very strict the beautiful
