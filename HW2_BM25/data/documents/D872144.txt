sedan trim lines the average savings for the 2018 honda civic sedan lx cvt is 439 below the msrp our msrp includes the destination fee why does the true car manufacturers suggested retail price msrp not match the msrp found on most other websites we think most sites dont truly care about price and believe that not disclosing destination fees or shipping charges upfront creates confusion over hidden fees when at the dealership why else would many car manufacturer or leading research websites not include destination fee charges in the display of the msrp until youve indicated that you want to buy that car for us its simple because the destination charge is always found on the window sticker of a new car and is a fee that generally is not negotiable true car includes the value in the calculation of the msrp wherever it is shown as a total the destination fee for the 2018 honda civic sedan is at least 890 and can vary by region available manufacturer incentives bonus cash and

suckdavid » oh » 2016 honda civic purchased january 2016  verified this has been the most disappointing vehicle to own i have ever had in 25 years of driving the electronics simply suck i have had all sorts of problems with the vehicle false maintenance minders for an oil change false brake and other important item failure warnings for no reason no audio sound at all fixed more than once now loud popping noises that could easily ruin my speakers false brake warnings with my brakes slamming without my control and without anything in front of me impossible to reproduce  just give it a couple of months and itll happen again just disappointing i dont let people ride with me i dont trust the car with others lives read more updated on september 25 2016please redesign your seatsathena » wv » 2016 honda civic purchased june 2016  verified i certainly enjoy my new honda civic even though it is maybe more car than i need technology wise i wanted a trustworthy car to take me in to retirement and my other civic was a roadrunning machine but eight years old the fuel economy is superior to my previous civic and i do appreciate that it is also has better pickup with the turbo which is helpful for back road and interstate driving this purchase was a smart one for me i know i can depend on the brand and have had good interactions with hagerstown honda in terms of improvements here are a few suggestions 1 the interior fabric at the doors in the door handle area seems inferior to my 08 civic it is thin and smudges way too easily for a new car and has a dull appearance already 2 the drivers seat is not comfortable for me even though i am not heavy or tall the power seat should be available with the turbo regardless of the seat fabric i did not want the additional cost of the leather but a car as special as the turbo should have a power seat included since this model is not bottom of the line the seat needs to sit higher and flatter with the back rest less curved honda seats are a detraction for me 3 the heatingcooling controls are not helpful in their current position i would rather have the radio controls there it is awkward to scroll the sound on the screen or on the steering wheel often i am turning the steering and the controls are upside down also having to touch the screen to adjust the sound distracts from safe driving and the same is true to adjust the climate controls on the screen 4 the amfm radio reception is inferior to xm although i enjoyed the free service the first few months i do not believe in having to pay for radio therefore i did not renew the service it truly is rather expensive when i listen to broadcast the stations are not as clear as my previous civic radio this of course is rather disappointing 5 the handling seems a little loose with so much extra power  6 last i dont like having to turn on the engine if i have to roll up windows or close the sun roof i certainly appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on my new car the civic is a tremendous car read more updated on august 20 2016the led headlights and taillights are awesomedaniel » ca » 2016 honda civic purchased january 2016  verified the infotainment system is one of the worst ive ever used if hassle free music playing is something required consider other car brands as ive stated the infotainment system is very bad i am looking forward to purchasing a us typer but if it has the same infotainment system andor the softwarehardware hasnt been updated i will no long buy hondas as my vehicle of choice of preferred vehicle ive purchased 4 new honda in 10 years because they were reliable and trusted but the latest honda civic had tarnished that reputation read more updated on march 27 2016im really learning to love the storagearm restdaniel » tx » 2016 honda civic purchased november 2015  verified i love my new civic i have specific issues that bring down my overall scores the front driver seat is not fitted well i find myself having to angle my body just right to avoid the wing under my left leg from pinching the back of my thigh the engineers for the steering wheel adjustments dont seem to have communicated with the instrument panel designers because when i have my steering wheel in the most comfortable spot allowing the best front view of the road i cant see the speed im going or the economy led indicator bar the front passenger window fails to lower at times i have to press various window up and down buttons to kick it into gear indicative of poor wiring or electronic circuit the radio handsfree ac system is a mess the autoac should default to internal aircycling  i hate flipping it to auto and getting a whiff of the diesel in front of me or skunks i rarely use it now not having a touch screen on the display is a nuisance especially with the current button controls and selections lacking intuitiveness the steering wheel buttons are better but ive declined or hung up on numerous calls  is it too much to color code the button that hangs up red and the one to answer green the symbols alone are not clear the fact you have to program each number into your system even though you are plugging your i phone in via usb or bluetooth is annoying why cant it access your contacts and decipher the pronunciation of the contacts like siri plastic door handles really negate the classy feeling of this car all other physical elements are there then you reach for the handle and it feels cheap i will not be surprised if one of them breaks over the next few years the floor mats in front being fastened to the carpet seemed like a good idea but in actuality they seem to promote pulling at the carpet and raising it up in those locations fastening to a metal plate under the carpet would probably make more sense something to avoid pulling up the carpet these all seem like oversights that i did not see on my 2005 civic except the plastic handles  but the car itself the bones of it the engine and handling are all so great that i can excuse the poor design and implementation of the above items im really learning to love the storage  arm rest i find the sliding design and removable cup holder to be rather genius it has allowed many configurations to suit my needs including oversized cups and the ability to have a small tissue box hidden in the arm rest this is a love of mine i appreciate trying to fit so many options into a standard model of car but feel like concentrating on doing some of the big ones right would be more important id choose a better handsfree setup and use experience over autoac for instance if you cant implement it in the 100 quality honda way implement what you can perfect instead read more updated on august 20 2016i drive a lot for work and leisure and i love the color and interior leather finishdiana » nj » 2016 honda civic purchased january 2016  verified the old adage is never buy the beta version i love my honda civic completely redesigned model year but there were annoying connectivity problems at first still the performance appearance and reliability of this vehicle plus its stylish and smart appearance made it a perfect choice for me i drive a lot for work and leisure and i love the color and interior leather finish sales experience was great although i wish now that i had bought instead of leased  i wont make that mistake 5 years from now  i am a faithful honda owner for over 40 years and my loyalty has been justified by the excellence of all the vehicles i hve owned the last one went 14 years  read more updated on september 16 2016the leather is greatjodi » mn » 2016 honda civic purchased june 2016  verified i am not a huge fan of the black stripe of the gray cloth interior i think its hard to clean the floor mats because it holds on to more hair and other debris and yes i do use a professional grade vacuum for cars i would prefer if the interior side panels and middle console was all leather and not made of cloth on the ex in general i liked the cloth used in the 2014 honda crv ex a lot more than this type of cloth theres something soft and durable about the type in the crv the cloth in my civic doesnt feel and look as nice the dash where the ip is is also hard to keep clean and seems clunky i wish it was more refined and less plasticy looking i really expected a lot more from my sound system for an ext i think the sound is average and i feel like im listening to music in a base model there are some things you could get rid of in order to make room for improving the sound system i am not sure what at this point but im sure after reading a gazillion results from your customers you can find things people in general could not care less about or are less crazy about i didnt care about having the internet connection thing in my car i dont care as much on the voice commands for how awesome the civic is you should be able to cruise in it and have fun with the music blasting and bumping somewhat please change this because listening to the music is one of the most important things you do in the car besides driving it overall the interior design is great the materials used for the most part are great it doesnt scuff up as easily and i like the placement of everything the silvery color accents are nice and its nice that not everything is a black color i love gray whatever you guys use to build the exterior black paneling around the door side windows drives me nuts it seems like i barely touch it and it has marks or prints on it or its discolored after i clean my car i have to take a soft towel and buff it out a little in case it doesnt look clean call me crazy but i love my cars and i take care of them i spent most of this box filling out negatives but i do want you to know i love this years civic and im only trying to help make it meet 100 across the board  i would say its the best car ive ever owned my experience with honda has been with a 2003 honda civic ex 2dr 2011 honda civic ex 2014 honda crv ex and this baby 2016 honda civic ext my bf bought the touring the leather is great the sound is just fine the honda sensing is super amazing i am a wee bit jealous just thought id
