no contract phone on planjapzlapeno feb 28 2012 1220 amif i buy a phone listed as a no contract verizon cell phone on a site like amazoncom would i be able to activate that phone on my current family share plan on my existing line my verizon says im eligible for upgrade sometime later but does that mean i cant activate a new device to replace my current one until im actually eligible for an upgrade when i go through verizons site looking at getting a phone at retail price it says something under the button to add to cart about a fee for breaking contract or something im not exactly sure how the 2yr contracts work in relation to hardware i thought they were just for the services being provided or does adding a more advanced device constitute changing the services enough to require a new contract therefore breaching the current contract i didnt think about it at first but decided to try to look it up just in case and the only discussion i found on a similar subject seemed to indicate that there would be an issue in adding a device like that but that was for a prepaid phone and im not sure if thats the same as no contract phone im looking at getting a 4g lte phone which i know i need to get a sim card for to upgrade from my current nonsmartphone so i figure this might actually be an issue i should look into before dropping hundreds of dollars on a phone i might not be able to use without possibly spending another few hundred dollars in penalty fees im sorry for being kinda wordy22535 views tags plan  phone
