what is myth by mary magoulick first published 2004 revised 2015what other scholars say about myths especially as connected to heroismpatterns in heroic myths and talesmythology linksmyth refers to colorful stories that tell about the origins of humans and the cosmos attitudes towards myth vary greatly some regard it as a source of spiritual growth while others see only falsehood some see in myth the distinct character of particular cultures while others see universal patterns some regard myth as contemporary and alive while others think of it as ancient andor dead gregory schrempp indiana university see the mythology studies program at indiana universitydefining myth characteristics of myth scholarship as myth native american myths conceptual frameworks sacred narrative structuralism feminism and myth background on mythology generic fluidity functionalism myths and literature  womendefining mythfrom the greek mythos  myth means story or word mythology is the study of myth as stories or narratives  myths articulate how characters undergo or enact an ordered sequence of events the term myth has come to refer to a certain genre or category of stories that share characteristics that make this genre distinctly different from other genres of oral narratives such as legends and folktales many definitions of myth repeat similar general aspects of the genre and may be summarized thus myths are symbolic tales of the distant past often primordial times that concern cosmogony and cosmology the origin and nature of the universe may be connected to belief systems or rituals and may serve to direct social action and values the classic definition of myth from folklore studies finds clearest delineation in william bascom’s article “the forms of folklore prose narratives” where myths are defined astales believed as true usually sacred set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world and with extrahuman inhuman or heroic character s such myths often described as “cosmogonic” or “origin” myths function to provide order or cosmology based on “cosmic” from the greek kosmos meaning order leeming 1990 3 13 bascom 1965 cosmology’s concern with the order of the universe finds narrative symbolic expression in myths which thus often help establish important values or aspects of a culture’s worldview for many people myths remain valueladen discourse that explain much about human nature there are a number of general conceptual frameworks involved in definitions of myth including these myths are cosmogonic narratives connected with the foundation or origin of the universe and key beings within that universe though often specifically in terms of a particular culture or region given the connection to origins the setting is typically primordial the beginning of time and characters are protohuman or deific myths also often have cosmogonic overtones even when not fully cosmogonic for instance dealing with origins of important elements of the culture food medicine ceremonies etc myths are narratives of a sacred nature often connected with some ritual myths are often foundational or key narratives associated with religions these narratives are believed to be true from within the associated faith system though sometimes that truth is understood to be metaphorical rather than literal within any given culture there may be sacred and secular myths coexisting myths are narratives formative or reflective of social order or values within a culture eg functionalism  myths are narratives representative of a particular epistemology or way of understanding nature and organizing thought for example structuralism recognizes paired bundles of opposites or dualities  like light and dark as central to myths mythic narratives often involve heroic characters possibly protohumans super humans or gods who mediate inherent troubling dualities reconcile us to our realities or establish the patterns for life as we know it myths are narratives that are counterfactual in featuring actors and actions that confound the conventions of routine experience mc dowell 80 some background on mythology the study of myththere have been many other functions and implications attributed to myth they are often highly valued or disputed stories that still intrigue us even though many of us do not recognize them as a living genre in our culture as mc dowells definition 6 above indicates myths often involve extraordinary characters or episodes that seem impossible in our world but the extraordinary feats and traits of mythic protagonists are possible only because they attach to a primary and formative period in the growth and development of civilization 80 thus their various aspects or dimensions are best considered as organically intertwined mc dowell 80 in fact the contemporary connotation of myth as a falsehood often understood as being in opposition to science probably stems from recognition of this attribute of myth 6 in isolation myths also seem in opposition to science because they are not testable which is the case at least for origin myths because of their primordial setting  if events described are from a different earlier world then of course they would not be repeatable or logical in our world both myths and science offer explanations of the cosmos a key difference is that information about the universe presented in myths is not testable whereas science is designed to be tested repeatedly science also depends on cumulative frequently updated knowledge whereas myth is based on passed down stories and beliefs myths may change over time particularly after contact with other cultures but they do not change and adapt to new periods and technological developments in the same way science does myths may be enacted through rituals and believed in absolutely but they usually do not have physical effects in the real world as in leading to new technology for building cars or providing medical treatment people may believe they are cured through faith and they may find important valueladen sentiments in myths but these real world results are neither empirical nor usually repeatable two standard criteria for science although science differs from myth in offering actual testable control over the environment and producing real repeatable results in the world science is not completely divorced from myth many scientific theories are presented or understood in narrative form which often end up sounding remarkably mythic as scholars like stephen jay gould and gregory schrempp have discussed see scholarship as myth section below myths were considered by victorian scholars as survivals of previous times perhaps decayed or reflective of primitive ancestors who took them literally some saw them as evidence for social evolutionary theories of the 19th century these victorians scholars like e b tylor believed that humans in all cultures progress through stages of evolution from savagery to barbarism and finally to civilization this final most advanced stage was of course best represented by the men victorians writing the theories such theories no longer seem reasonable we have not for instance progressed beyond brutality murder war and grave injustices just because we have more advanced technology in fact we use our technology partly to more efficiently kills other humans we also recognize the complexity thoughtfulness and beauty of many other cultures we may once have considered inferior to our own based on over a century of ethnology anthropological fieldwork and research in psychology genetics and other disciplines scholars now accept that humans from all eras and parts of the world have equal intellectual capacity and potential we understand as well today that our own theories may seem as foolish to our descendants as their conceptions of the universe sometimes seem to us see scholarship as myth section below our ancestors understood metaphor as well as we this does not mean our ancestors lived exactly as we do or that we conceive of the world in identical ways but myths serve us better as means of understanding our ancestors if we accept their capacity for complex intellectual and artistic expression theories allow us to do our work as scholars though our best efforts come with selfawareness of the theories and methods we employ as scholars we now understand and discuss traditional myths and other such texts as emergent and intricately connected to performance situations or context the more we can understand of the context of a myth the culture it came from the individual who told it when and for what purpose the audience who received it etc the better chance we have of offering an accurate interpretation of course the further back in time one goes the harder it becomes to study context nonetheless the greater the attempt to understand context one makes the better ones potential to interpret myths becomes and even if we cant fully understand another cultures myths that does not mean those myths are insignificant useless or primitive a very offensive term these days in cultural studies myths as explanations of the cosmos and how to live are parallel to science in many ways yet because of their differences from science they often appear insignificant whimsical useless or primitive to contemporary people many people lament the decline of myths because they promise moral guidance and comfort that helps enrich life for these reasons many people remain interested in myths and seek to revive or revere them additionally myths continue to intrigue us because of their rich symbolic metaphorical and narrative appeal some people believe classical music movies and even novels have filled the places myths used to occupy culturally in our postmodern world many people believe myths exist in new combined or revived forms one of the functions of all art is to reconcile us to paradox another is to suggest fundamental patterns of life and the universe even if they are no longer associated with religious rituals belief systems or primordial moments of creation myths of heroic characters who mediate the troubling paradoxes of life will always compel us and can i believe still be found in our culture characteristics of myths given the cautions above about how much the definition of myth has been debated and written about take the following characteristics of myth in the spirit in which they are intended general guidelines gleaned from what many people have noticed as often being true of myths remember these characteristics are neither absolute nor allencompasing1 a story that is or was considered a true explanation of the natural world and how it came to be2 characters are often nonhuman – eg gods goddesses supernatural beings first people3 setting is a previous protoworld somewhat like this one but also different4 plot may involve interplay between worlds this world and previous or original world5 depicts events that bend or break natural laws reflective of connection to previous world6 cosmogonicmetaphysical explanation of universe formative of worldview7 functional “charter for social action” – conveys how to live assumptions values core meanings of individuals families communities8 evokes the presence of mystery the unknown has a “sacred” tinge9 reflective and formative of basic structures dualities lightdark goodbad beingnothingness rawcooked etc that we must reconcile dualities often mediated by characters in myths10 common theme language helps order the world cosmos thus includes many lists names etc11 metaphoric narrative considerationexplanation of “ontology” study of being myths seek to answer “why are we here” “who are we” “what is our purpose” etc – life’s fundamental questions12 sometimes the narrative aspect of a significant ritual core narrative of most important religious practices of society fundamentally connected to belief system sometimes the source of ritualsdo myths have to be sacred definitions of myth are gleaned from over a century of collection and classification of tales beginning with the grimm brothers who believed “divinities form the core of all mythology” 188283 xvixvii myths are distinguished from other commonly collected narratives such as folktales and legends myths were defined as stories of ancient times believed to be true malinowski added that they must be sacred and discussed how they serve society as a charter for action many great social theorists from the 19th and early 20th centuries  freud frazer muller jung etc used myths usually collected by others as evidence of their universal truths – their a priori theories see “scholarship as myth” section below many fieldworkers like lévistrauss franz boas and his students and dell hymes used deductive methods in analyzing myths more recent scholars like william hansen argue that the sacred element of myths is a recent attachment to definitions perhaps beginning with the grimms and then solidified by malinowski but in his studies of ancient greek myths hansen notes that not all myths had a sacred element they were not necessarily connected to religious beliefs but were often secular stories while myths do not have to have a sacred element they do appear to share a worldforming or worldviewforming function generic fluidity the fact that scholars discuss various possible definitions of myth demonstrates the vitality and importance of this genre genres are categorizations imposed by scholars seeking ways of classifying and analyzing material they study as folklorist richard bauman explains ofall genres of stories they share certain characteristics of “form function or effect content orientation to the world and the cosmos truth value tone social distribution manner or contexts of use and so on” bauman 1991 genres are extremely useful but all good scholars realize that they are fluid and often messy guides rather than absolute neat and fixed realities realizing the fluidity of narrative forms stretches throughout the history of folklore scholarship and into the present day contemporary performance theorist richard bauman writes “when genres are conceptualized as openended flexible and manipulable sets of discursive conventions and expectation    both traditional blended forms    as well as emergent generic syntheses become more comprehensible” 1991 58 from the perspective of performance theory distinctions between generic forms and their meaning and function should remain fluid dynamic to be discovered bauman echoes others like franz boas one of folklore’s founding fathers in the u s who also recognizes the variability of generic form and content of genre when he analyzes myths of the northwest coast indians “it would seem that mythological worlds have been built up only to be shattered again and that new worlds were built from the fragments” 189818 scholarship as myth in his book on myth magical arrows gregory schrempp analyzes literature which is “highly mythically tinged” in his discussion of the greek philosopher zeno’s oblique use of a story of achilles to illuminate his philosophy “the invocation of myth or at least of an ‘epic’ that is highly mythically tinged ought perhaps not be regarded dismissively as a mere appeal to dramatic effect while the invocation of achilles and by implication the world of heroes may not be strictly necessary for an exposition of zeno’s technical arguments against the possibility of motion it may be necessary for some larger intellectual purpose” 1992 25 schrempp shows that zeno and lévistrauss both distinguish myth from scientific forms of discourse yet both use myths in their own scientific discourse in a sense they create their own myths even while they think they are rising above it schrempp’s work leads one to consider the prevalence of myths in our culture historically and today myths seem to offer us symbolic resources we need to communicate as schrempp notes “even the grandest paradigms of western social science are at base often folk notions recast within the rhetoric and style of ‘science’” 1992 38 although the prevalence of mythological details in our discourse keys us to its importance we typically insist upon distinguishing ways of thinking about the world and today we think of myth as lesser than science the general public persistently uses the word “myth” as something untrue and  or unworthy of serious consideration the greek word mythos or “story” suggests potential untruth but the perceived unworthiness of stories stems from a scientific rational perspective in juxtaposition to other ways of thinking and expression yet the persistence of myths throughout our culture reveals their worth as schrempp’s discussion of lévistrauss and zeno suggests scholarly views of myths sometimes themselves approach mythical status early scholars in myth theory created myths to paint pictures of early human life and conceptions of the universe discussions of myth became myths–origin stories that influence how we understand people and the world ie our worldview functionalism branislaw malinowski is considered a functionalist because he insisted that myths serve as charters for social action many other myth scholars also discuss this aspect of myths anthropologist and folklorist paul radin considers myth distinctive because of its function and implications as determined by certain individual society members the mythmakers then explain symbolically how to live as radin notes “a myth is always explanatory the explanatory theme often is so completely dominant that everything else becomes subordinated to it   ” 370 myths serve to explain and encourage worldview and good action within society many other theorists of myth concur that it has a functional dimension strucutralism structuralist claude lévistrauss expresses similar sentiments about myth’s functions when he postulates that myths serve to mediate conflicting or dualistic elements of society and life lévistrauss recognizes “a basic antinomy pertaining to the nature of myth” and to human nature 1974 85 this antinomy provides a structure of myths which help classify them and help one to scientifically decipher their meaning according to lévistrauss antinomy or contradiction is often evident in the form of dualities such as good and bad night and day etc which lévistrauss emphasizes appear in “bundles” in myths 1958 87 looked at as whole structures myths reveal a typical pattern “mythical thought always works from the awareness of oppositions towards their progressive mediation” 1958 99 the symbolic mediation in myths offers inspiration for culture and culture members to heal flourish or accept their reality lévistrauss draws upon the image of one who weaves together bits and pieces of culture in the image of the bricoleur he also draws upon sewing imagery in discussing the function and method of the bricoleur more rapid crossreferences together with an increase in the number of points of view and angles of approach have made it possible to consolidate into a whole what might at first have seemed to be a loose and precarious assemblage of odds and ends all dissimilar in form texture and color careful stitching and darning systematically applied to reinforce weak spots has finally produced a homogeneous fabric clear in outline and harmonious in its blend of shades fragments which at first seemed disparate once they found their appropriate place and the correct relationship to their neighbors come together to form a coherent picture in this picture the tiniest details however gratuitous bizarre and even absurd they may have seemed at the beginning acquire both meaning and function 1971 562as myth gives meaning and purpose to even the most seemingly disparate and fragmented elements of culture so it affirms life processes of change and refashioning native american myths two other scholars of native american mythology paul radin and claude lévistrauss also recognize the variability of definitions of myth anticipate much subsequent scholarship on myth and remain fundamentally insightful in analyzing myth many key scholars in native american mythology focus on twin myths as the classic examples most “common” in lévistrauss’ terms most “basic” in radin’s terms of myths in north america twin myths are very common and popular throughout the american indian world paul radin who worked among native americans in the midwest recognizes myth as a fluid narrative form in his article “the basic myth of the north american indians” he says “folktale myth and legend flow into each other continually and continuously” 368 radin emphasizes that the “form and content” of myths “is not fixed” which would be impossible because of a continuous barrage of new influences and priorities 370 the flexibility of the genre in radin’s definition better accounts for the real stories that he and other fieldworkers typically encountered he states “it can in fact be said that every generation strives to ‘rewrite’ its folktales” 370 you can find traditional twin myths in virtually any collection of native american myths contemporary native american writer louise erdrich’s novel the antelope wife also fits the twin myth pattern demonstrating the continuing vitality of myth her contemporary myth offers symbolism direction for contemporary native americans whose culture is currently experiencing a rebirth or renewal of culture erdrich highlights this twin myth theme in her opening image of primordial female twins sewing the pattern of the world in beads like bricoleurs spinners and spiders they affirm that mixing cultures like mixing patterns in other creative endeavors need not be a source of concern but is instead is the source of life itself recognizing and reading the antelope wife as a myth reveals many messages and meanings that might otherwise remain obscure the characters symbols and events of the antelope wife reflect lives concerns and dichotomies experienced or perceived by many native americans today who struggle to integrate various cultural components and heritages into a coherent and livable identity erdrich’s fictional shift into the twin and animal  human idioms bring this novel into the level of mythic discourse the only discourse that reaches the level of reorganization of the cosmos and culture that she wants to convey myths works particularly well for critical moments in cultural history because they deal with notions of cosmology and worldview symbolizing the fundamental reshaping of human relationships feminism and myth many feminists latch hopefully onto motifs in ancient myths that seem to indicate a possible past in which women had more agency perhaps even a central role in society these socalled matriarchal myths give women hope that they need not be condemned to permanent status as second class citizens for such was not always the case for instance some people interpret the overthrow of female deities in some myths as evidence of a time in which people worshipped goddesses or at least considered female deities the equals of male deities some people also interpret prehistoric statuettes of apparently pregnant women as evidence that women must have occupied a more important role in those societies  otherwise why would artists devote so much time to sculpting them the thinking goes in her book the myth of matriarchal prehistory why an invented past wont give women a future cynthia eller reveals the wishful thinking inherent in such popular thinking about a matriarchal past she notes that even feminists today believe that our prehistory was an idyllic time where men and women coexisted harmoniously while worshipping goddesses who revealed connections to nature and fundamental life processes this wished for glorious past revealed in remnants and tantalizing traces of recorded historic myths and histories was overthrown by the patriarchy when a malecentered society and male gods replaced the matriarchy according to this way of understanding prehistory in her careful examination of what little evidence we have of how our ancestors might have lived in prehistoric times eller clarifies that in fact we cannot and do not know enough to make such conclusions what myths like those of perspephonedemeter and the amazons for instance do reveal is a pattern of male dominance within an established patriarchy in those myths the women end up tamed and domesticated this is not proof that there once was a preferred matriarchy but rather that any attempts at independence could be dealt with by the contemporary society eller writes prehistoric human societies may have been different from all those that came after them but any such assertion runs into three perhaps insurmountable obstacles first there is no evidence that they were second there is no reason to expect that they would be at least not when we are talking about the past thirty to forty thousand years of homo sapiens sapiens as feminist matriarchalists typically are and third if they were utterly different and universally so we need a compelling explanation of why things changed so drastically 181 this myth of a matriarchal past appeals to women today who are struggling to gain rights and build a better society having a prehistoric model seems promising as recapturing a past pattern seems likelier to many women than creating a new one instead of clinging to this imagined past as a model on which to build a future eller counsels realizing our potential as humans to create new patterns for how to live and interact if there are no inherent barriers to womens equality then the future of women does not rest on biological destiny or historical precedent but rather on moral choice what we must be and what we have been will of course have an effect on our gender relations but ultimately these cannot and should not dictate what we want to be if we are certain that we want to get rid of sexism we do not need a mythical time of womens past greatness to get on with the effort toward ending it 188 while we may not be able to definitely interpret or recreate our past we can use our imagination to try to shape the future as many women writers are doing today often consciously including mythic tendencies or motifs in their works to make them function similarly to how myths have always functioned  helping to shape or reshape our worldviews myths and literature and womenmore and more writers today craft mythlike narratives that feature female heroes and world affirming mythic stories for instance native american poet and novelist louise erdrich has twin heroes in her mythnovel the antelope wife chinese american writer maxine hong kingston revives the myth of fa mulan in the woman warrior  and toni morrison has mythic tendencies in some of her work like paradise  such works often involves feminist dimensions echoing lévistrauss’ image of the bricoleur feminist myth scholar marta weigle agrees that perhaps the most important function of myth is its worldcreating worldaffirming aspects she distinguishes malecentered myths that often serve as charters for male dominance in society from femalecentered myths that typically affirm and create the world itself weigle 1982 weigle employs images of spinning and weaving in her analysis of the world creating life affirming functions of myth marta weigle explains that myths are needed in times of identity crisis “significant psychic transformation – whether an important decision critical insight creative task schizophrenic break or change in consciousness – is heralded and expressed by cosmogonic myths and motifs in dreams and various verbal and visual creations” 1989 10 only apparent incompatibility needs myth to resolve or make sense of social dilemmas weigle also notes the paucity of female creators deities and heroines in many of our traditional stories “quite simply such female creator deities are rare” 1983 45 she also laments the rarity of female heros as evident in the awkwardness of terms for them “‘creatoress’ ‘creatrix’ and ‘culture heroine’ are awkward and almost meaningless designations reflecting the relatively weaker roles women play in creation transformation and origin myths – when they appear at all in such narratives about ordering the world” 1983 53 as weigle notes “culture heroes whether human or animal female or male bring or bring about valuable objects teachings and natural changes which make possible human society and survival” 1983 53 it is thus very exciting to find so many strong women hero figures and revisioned myths in the work of contemporary women writers particularly in women writers of color erdichs novel offers one such hopeful example though the ancient real and mythical worlds of the ojibwe may have been “shattered” or “cracked apart” as louise erdrich puts it in the antelope wife by european and american invasions and assimilation contemporary ojibwe people build new worlds from those fragments as erdrich builds her myth  novel representing this process her novel includes obvious fragments from the mythic traditions of her culture while offering images for how to successfully mediate such impulses build or incorporate a comprehensive and meaningful worldview and thrive as native americans in today’s world clear mythic tendencies within the novel direct the reader to consider it in terms of scholarship on myth mythology theories are typically applied to oral forms erdrich’s novel encourages us to notice that such fluidity of form as has been noticed in oral genres also applies to written genres her novel works as a myth it offers images and symbols of the rebirth of culture that maintain traditions while suggesting how to live and think about being native today the antelope wife symbolizes the revitalization of ojibwe culture erdrich’s innovative myth is a resource for and a representation of her community which serves a contemporary audience well by offering characters and symbols appropriate to the times drawn from her own experiences inspiration and creative resources and maintaining traditional images and messages she thus realizes a folkloristic principle of dynamic convergence between individual willed creativity and communal resources erdrich’s work may be considered a traditional story or myth given a dynamic and fluid folkloristic view of tradition see my other work including my ph d dissertation— coming to life 2000—for further discussion of all of these issues lévistrauss radin boas weigle and others stress that mythic thought as highly symbolic offers rich resources for making sense of the world affirming worldview and confirming human nature bibliography works cited and suggested readingsbascom william a
