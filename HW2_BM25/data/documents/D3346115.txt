gandalf isnt lazy hes preparing for his next hunt although gandalf the cat probably spends most of his time dozing your champion napper can turn on the speed when he needs to his body is designed to make him not only an excellent climber and jumper but a fast runner as well built for speed if gandalf needs to chase down prey that moves quickly or to get away from a dog thats barreling after him his limber spine and powerful back legs allow him to sprint a lot faster than you might think a domestic cat can run up to 30 mph in a short spurt when he walks he moves both left legs then both right legs when he breaks into a gallop both of his back legs move in front of his front legs launching him airborne for a moment midstride this technique combined with his flexible spine makes him a superb runner power nap although you might think gandalf is lazy because of his propensity to hit the snooze button all that sleep is what allows him to run so fast hell nap for long periods conserving his energy for the hunt cats are built to hunt and take down prey which takes a lot of energy a long nap allows him to have a reserve of energy to tap when he needs to run at full speed sprinter gandalf might be able to move quickly but only for so long hes more of a sprinter than a distance runner hell be able to maintain top speed for about a minute before he has to stop for a breather the fastest land animal on earth is a cat  the cheetah the cheetah can run about 65 mph but after about 20 seconds he has to stop for a break crazy time to get his food gandalf needs only stroll to his dish so he doesnt need to stretch his running muscles very often yet even a kitten whos never been taught to hunt will still have an instinctual desire to chase this is why gandalf is so eager to chase that wriggling string you taunt him with if its been a while since gandalf has gone for a run he might start chasing some invisible target throughout the house if you have more than one cat theyre likely to run at full speed after one another up and down a long hallway your cat might seem a little crazy when he barrels across you on the couch but its perfectly normal for him to keep his running skills up to speed references animal planet hunting bbc nature cheetah why does my cat do that catherine davidson photo credits jupiterimagesphotoscomgetty images more mustclicks why do dogs get hyper with squeaks nail bed infection in dogs why does my dog move so much when hes sleeping cat food bowls to prevent fast eating how to prevent a cat from swatting its paw at me do parakeets still fly if they get their wings clipped how to keep cats happy inside the house do old english sheepdogs get along with cats
