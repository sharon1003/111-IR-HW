2013 88110physician assistant job outlook and prospects as the population ages more and more people require additional care from physicians and other advanced health care professionals but there isn’t enough physicians out there to meet this surge in demand  many healthcare institutions look for other ways to fill this gap and hence they turn their attention to qualified physician “substitutes” such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners the bureau of labor statistics states that there will be a growth of 38 or 33300 jobs between 2012 and 2022 there are four very notable reasons why this can be expected an increase in the general population due to an potential rise in immigrants an increase in the general population due to a gradual gain in life expectancy an increase in the elderly population as the baby boomers near their retirement age the rising cost of hiring a physician making the position of physician assistants more desirable factors affecting the salary of a physician assistant there are only 88110 individuals currently employed as physician assistants throughout the united states according to the may 2013 bureau of labor statistics earning a mean annual salary of 94350 geographic location experience and industry can all influence this salary producing a significant range of yearly wages for these medical professionals experience individuals just entering the field can expect to make a yearly salary beginning at 62000 whereas those at the top of the field are making 130000 and more greater years of experience will almost always result in a higher salary as a physician assistant therefore while most physician assistants begin work in physician’s offices or in general medical and surgical hospitals it is those in specialized fields that are collecting significantly more money these specialties include emergency medicine internal medicine pediatric medicine and surgical medicine among others industry like many other healthcare industries those that require specialized skills are those that have the highest payout the top paying industry for physician assistants are in specialty hospitals not including psychiatric and substance abuse locations earning an annual yearly wage of 100060 or more other prominent wellpaying industries include home health care services office administrative services employment services and outpatient care centers of course these industries employ the smallest numbers of professionals indicating that the unique skillsets required for these positions make physician assistants in higher demand resulting in higher pay location smaller coastal states are those that typically represent the top paying locations for physician assistants and also represent areas in which there are fewer physician assistants employed because smaller states are likely to have a significant number of medical centers in need of these professionals but also have smaller populations physician assistants are likely to be in higher demand the metropolitan areas that represent the highest earning locations are those in which employment numbers are the lowest in fact none of the top ten highestearning metropolitan areas have over 200 employees within them this is especially true for smaller metropolitan areas within large states with high levels of employment as there are likely to be less people but a standard level of demand for physician assistants top paying nonmetropolitan areas are found in smaller coastal states such as west virginia maine and delaware these areas employ less than 300 physicians assistants each suggesting again that specialized industries and lower number of employments leads to higher annual wages you may also like physician assistant job description medical
