cases due to allergies 2 conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes 1the most common infectious causes are viral followed by bacterial 2 the viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a common cold 1 viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people 1 allergies to pollen or animal hair is also a common cause 2 diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms 1 occasionally a sample of the discharge is sent for culture 1prevention is partly by handwashing 1 treatment depends on the underlying cause 1 in the majority of viral cases there is no specific treatment 2 most cases due to a bacterial infection will also resolve without treatment however antibiotics can shorten the illness 1 2 those who wear contact lens and those with either gonorrhea or chlamydia as the cause should be treated 2 allergic cases can be treated with antihistamine or mast cell inhibitor drops 2about 3 to 6 million people get conjunctivitis each year in the united states 1 2 in adults

the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis however the pupils should be normally reactive and the visual acuity normal viral  editconjunctivitis due to a viral infection resulting in some bleeding viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract a common cold or a sore throat its symptoms include excessive watering and itching the infection usually begins with one eye but may spread easily to the other viral conjunctivitis shows a fine diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva which is easily mistaken for the ciliary infection of iris  iritis  but there are usually corroborative signs on microscopy particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva and sometimes a punctate keratitis allergic  editan eye with allergic conjunctivitis showing conjunctival edema allergic conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva due to allergy 4 allergens differ among patients symptoms consist of redness mainly due to vasodilation of the peripheral small blood vessels  swelling of the conjunctiva itching and increased lacrimation production of tears  if this is combined with rhinitis the condition is termed allergic rhinoconjunctivitis the symptoms are due to release of histamine and other active substances by mast cells which stimulate dilation of blood vessels irritate nerve endings and increase secretion of tears bacterial  editan eye with bacterial conjunctivitis bacterial conjunctivitis causes the rapid onset of conjunctival redness swelling of the eyelid and mucopurulent discharge typically symptoms develop first in one eye but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days bacterial conjunctivitis due to common pyogenic pusproducing bacteria causes marked grittinessirritation and a stringy opaque greyish or yellowish mucopurulent discharge that may cause the lids to stick together especially after sleep severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur the gritty andor scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough for patients to insist they must have a foreign body in the eye the more acute pyogenic infections can be painful  citation needed common bacteria responsible for nonacute bacterial conjunctivitis are staphylococci streptococci 5haemophilus sp less commonly chlamydia trachomatis is involved 6typical membranous conjunctivitis bacteria such as chlamydia trachomatis or moraxella can cause a non exudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva pseudomembranes consist of a combination of inflammatory cells and exudates and are loosely adherent to the conjunctiva while true membranes are more tightly adherent and cannot be easily peeled away cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with neisseria gonorrhoeae β hemolytic streptococci and c diphtheriae corynebacterium diphtheriae causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of nonimmunized children 7chemical  editchemical eye injury is due to either an acidic or alkali substance getting in the eye 8 alkalis are typically worse than acidic burns 9 mild burns will produce conjunctivitis while more severe burns may cause the cornea to turn white 9 litmus paper is an easy way to rule out the diagnosis by verifying that the p h is within the normal range of 70—72 8 large volumes of irrigation is the treatment of choice and should continue until the p h is 6—8 9 local anaesthetic eye drops can be used to decrease the pain 9irritant or toxic conjunctivitis show primarily marked redness if due to splash injury it is often present in only the lower conjunctival sac with some chemicals above all with caustic alkalis such as sodium hydroxide there may be necrosis of the conjunctiva with a deceptively white eye due to vascular closure followed by sloughing of the dead epithelium this is likely to be associated with slitlamp evidence of anterior uveitis other  editan eye with chlamydial conjunctivitis inclusion conjunctivitis of the newborn icn is a conjunctivitis that may be caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis and may lead to acute purulent conjunctivitis 10 however it is usually selfhealing 10conjunctivitis is identified by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva except in obvious pyogenic or toxicchemical conjunctivitis a slit lamp biomicroscope is needed to have any confidence in the diagnosis examination of the tarsal conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than the bulbar conjunctiva causes  editconjunctivitis when caused by an infection is most commonly caused by a viral infection 11 bacterial infections allergies other irritants and dryness are also common causes both bacterial and viral infections are contagious and passed from person to person but can also spread through contaminated objects or water viral

treatment with acyclovir acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two enteroviruses enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus a24 these were first identified in an outbreak in ghana in 1969 and have spread worldwide since then causing several epidemics 13bacterial  editthe most common causes of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are staphylococcus aureus streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae 12 though very rare hyperacute cases are usually caused by neisseria gonorrhoeae or n meningitidis chronic cases of bacterial conjunctivitis are those lasting longer than 3 weeks and are typically caused by staphylococcus aureus moraxella lacunata or gramnegative enteric flora allergic  editconjunctivitis may also be caused by allergens such

18diagnosis  editcultures are not often taken or needed as most cases resolve either with time or typical antibiotics swabs for bacterial culture are necessary if the history and signs suggest bacterial conjunctivitis but there is no response to topical antibiotics viral culture may be appropriate in epidemic case clusters a patch test is used to identify the causative allergen in the case where conjunctivitis is caused by allergy 19conjunctival scrapes for cytology can be useful in detecting chlamydial and fungal infections allergy and dysplasia but are rarely done because of the cost and the general lack of laboratory staff experienced in handling ocular specimens conjunctival incisional biopsy is occasionally done when granulomatous diseases  eg sarcoidosis or dysplasia are suspected classification  editclassification can be either by cause or by extent of the inflamed area causes  editallergic conjunctivitis caused by allergens such as pollen perfumes cosmetics smoke 14 dust mites balsam of peru used in food and drink for flavoring in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties 15 and eye drops 16 a patch test

with a red eye such as infectious keratitis angleclosure glaucoma or iritis these conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist signs of such conditions include decreased vision significantly increased sensitivity to light inability to keep eye open a pupil that does not respond to light or a severe headache with nausea 21 fluctuating blurring is common due to tearing and mucoid discharge mild photophobia is common however if any of these symptoms are prominent it is important to consider other diseases such as glaucoma uveitis keratitis and even meningitis or

23 as it is less expensive it is being more commonly used for this purpose globally 23management  editconjunctivitis resolves in 65 of cases without treatment within two to five days the prescription of antibiotics is not necessary in most cases 24viral  editviral conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own and does not require any specific treatment 11 antihistamines eg diphenhydramine or mast cell stabilizers eg cromolyn may be used to help with the symptoms 11 povidone iodine has been suggested as a treatment but as of 2008 evidence to support it was poor 25allergic  editfor the allergic

without treatment 11 topical antibiotics may be needed only if no improvement is observed after three days 26 no serious effects were noted either with or without treatment 27 as they do speed healing in bacterial conjunctivitis their use may be considered 27in those who wear contact lenses are immunocompromised have disease which is thought to be due to chlamydia or gonorrhea have a fair bit of pain or who have lots of discharge antibiotics are recommended 11 gonorrhea or chlamydia infections require both oral and topical antibiotics 11when appropriate the choice of antibiotic varies differing based on the cause if known or the likely cause of the conjunctivitis fluoroquinolones sodium sulfacetamide or trimethoprimpolymyxin may be used typically for 7–10 days 12 cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin as long as the strain is sensitive to penicillin when investigated as a treatment povidoneiodine ophthalmic solution has also been observed to have some effectiveness against bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis with a possible role suggested in locations where topical antibiotics are unavailable or costly 28chemical  editconjunctivitis due to chemicals is treated via irrigation with ringers lactate or saline solution chemical injuries particularly alkali burns are medical emergencies as they can lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage people with chemically induced conjunctivitis should not touch their eyes regardless of whether or not their hands are clean as they run the risk of spreading the
