in ataris early days one of the atari coinop techs and his rather odd friend worked many late nights on a new arcade game called breakout while working on this new video game and playing other arcade games all through the night these two friends were busy on the side designing and building from borrowed atari parts a personal computer system they approached nolan bushnell and joe keenan with their new creation to see if it would be a product that atari would sell and support at the time atari was concentrating on getting its new home version of pong out the door and all resources were tied up with no spare capital to devote to such a costly and risky product nolan bushnell referred the two budding entrepreneurs to some venture capitalists to finance their new product who was this former atari employee none other then the i ceo of apple  steve jobs who was his rather odd friend steve the woz wozniak and their creation was the apple computer in the summer of 1977 the team that had finished the atari vcs was now hard at work on ways to make the stella chip more capable and to give the atari vcs more features like the ability to display characters on the screen have possibly some kind of keyboard and better graphics atari had been owned by warner communications since its sale in 1976 by its original cofounder nolan bushnell for 28 million by 1978 atari was run by raymond kassar making computer systems was the next logical step for the company however the home computers never actually started out as home computers in the beginning they were supposed to be a better video game system and as the designs evolved  more memory better graphics dma io systems keyboard and a design that would have actually had a built in monitor the game systems turned into full blown computers well that is to say at least one design  colleen was a full blown computer candy her little sister was still in debate as to whether she should be just a game only system with no io port and no keyboard or to have them just before the deadline approached for atari to show off its new systems for the winter ces in january of 1979 the decision was made  candy would be an entry level computer upon reflection one could wonder if this was ataris worst decision after all the idea of a better stella  atari vcs was the whole reason for the work started in 1977 to have a replacement for the atari vcs when its expected end of life would be reached around 1980 the candy couldve been the replacement for the atari vcs in 1980 in a case with no keyboard and no sio port and wouldve been ataris next game system applications and serious programs couldve been for the atari 800 while the atari 400 wouldve gotten a different name  perhaps it wouldve been the atari advanced game system or something similar it wouldve gotten all of the games written for it imagine a 1979 release of space invaders on it instead of the atari 2600 or pac man on it instead of the atari 2600 educational games wouldve been far better for parents buying a game console for their kids intellivision wouldve never stood a chance against ataris new super game console released in 1979 and by 1980 the atari vcs couldve started to be phased out so looking back this may have been ataris biggest mistake of them all and may have been what turned atari onto the path of its demise by 1984 back to ataris 400800 computer release  ataris hcd home computer division engineers  designers had designed the worlds first truly consumer based personal computers to use custom ics to handle graphics sound and communication ataris first two computers were called the atari 400 and atari 800 personal computer systems these computers had a large assortment of intelligent peripherals which communicated through a custom bus called the sio serial io which compared to today standards is a rather simplistic version of the usb universal serial bus in fact the usb and the atari sio have a lot more in common then many would think one of ataris original computer engineers joe decuir who created the atari sio bus is also one of the team of engineers at microsoft to help design and holds patents on the usb the atari 400800 line was cancelled in 1982 to be replaced by a new sleek hightech looking computer called the atari 1200xl the computer had an slightly incompatible os no external expansion bus and little enhancements over the original 400800 line and due to these shortcomings the sales of the atari 800 computer increased while people rushed to buy them before supplies ran out the 1200xl was discontinued only 6 months later and quickly replaced by the atari 600800xl line of computers in the fall of 1983 these computers fixed many of the 1200xls shortcomings and had a parallel bus interface for external expansion options several other computers were planned with voice synthesizers builtin modems and built in disk drives but were never officially sold in the works in 1983 atari had several new highend computers including one called the 1600xl project shakti which would be a dual processor system with 6502 and 80186 for ibm compatibility another system called sierra with a highend audiovideo chipset based on the mc68000 processor but never got out of the design process yet another project in the works was another system called gaza which also used a highend chipset and mc68000 processor was demonstrated to the warner board but canned because they didnt want atari competing in the business market these systems would never make it past prototyping as atari would be sold in 1984 on july 2 1984 ataris consumer electronics division and its home computer division were sold to tramel technologies limited and the company was renamed atari corporation leonard tramiel adds our name tramiel was constantly being mispronounced as trameal and my dad hoped that the other spelling would get people to say tramell it rhymes with done well it didnt work the atari xl line of computers was cancelled with its last version  the 800xlf released in europe in august of 1984 and in 1985 a new line of computers to replace the xl line called the atari 65xe and 130xe computers were introduced the original internal name of the 65xe was the 900xlf atari also introduced an all new line of computers called the atari st line these new computers would use the motorola 68000 processor come with 512k of memory use 35 disk drives rgb monitors and a graphics user environment based on cpm 68k and digital research gem originally the processor for this new line of computers was to be the national 32016 however its speed and its availability was in doubt so the mc68000 was chosen amazing the tramiels were able to go from shiraz shijis concept from may 1984 to a working demonstration system at the january 1985 winter ces a mere 5 months by june of 1985 developers and user groups received advanced release units and by september 1985 the first atari 520st computers began to show up on retail shelves atari would over the course of 8 years improve upon its st line of computers with such lines as the mega st ste mega ste tt030 and falcon030 line of computers atari also introduced a laptop called the stacy and had in the works an under 5 lb laptop called the stbook as its replacement a pen based touch tablet version of the st called the stpad or stylus had been shown in prototype form but was never sold atari introduced an assortment of peripherals from disk drives to very low cost and feature rich laser printers for its line of st computers taking a step back i n 1987 atari introduced a line of ibm compatible computer systems starting with its atari pc1 which was an allinone ibm xt compatible computer with built in disk drive built in serial parallel keyboard mouse and video ports video could be configured for cga hercules ega and other settings an internal bus port on the motherboard allowed for an expansion card to use the atari mega st megafile hard disk system atari also introduced other pc compatible systems as well as a 386sx laptop and also an ibm xt palmtop computer the size of a vhs video tape the atari falcon030 was atari last computer system to be produced all company resources were directed towards the creation and completion of ataris 64bit interactive multimedia system called the atari jaguar 64 which was sold in 1993 back to top
