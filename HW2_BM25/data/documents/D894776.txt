politics cuckoldry getty images what’s behind the ‘cuckservative’ slur nsfwmatt k lewis senior contributor1154 am 07232015erick erickson recently stumbled across the term “cuckservative ” it’s a word that has been popping up on twitter a lot lately but this was the first time i’d seen someone of any consequence reference it but the definition erickson tweeted doesn’t really do it justice — as it elides the truly sleazy implications of the term the goal is to obviously combine the words cuckolded with conservative a cuckold of course is a legitimate word for the husband of an adulterous wife — but that doesn’t really do justice to what they’re suggesting here either the people who throw this term around are most likely referencing a type of pornography whereby a usually white man is “humiliated” or ironically thrilled by being forced to watch his wife having sex with another usually black man i’m not going to link to this but feel free to google it so what does this have to do with conservatism or politics by supporting immigration reform criminal justice reform etc a white conservative is therefore surrendering his honor and masculinity and it won’t be long before his women folk are compromised as well a cuckservative is therefore a race traitor the suggestion is that whites should only support policies that help whites the goal is to stir up fear among whites — and to encourage more tribalism and polarization i bring this up because i suppose it’s possible that some conservatives might embrace this term without fully understanding the racial and sexual implications to some it might be seen as an innocent jab — like calling someone a “squish” or a “rino” but as erickson correctly observes “remember if you hear the term ‘cuckservative’ it is a slur against christian voters coined by whitesupremacists”tags cuckservative show comments
