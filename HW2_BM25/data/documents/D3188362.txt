whitman’s grand poem is in its way an american epic beginning in medias res —in the middle of the poet’s life—itloosely follows a quest pattern “missing me one place search another”he tells his reader “i stop somewhere waiting for you” in itscatalogues of american life and its constant search for the boundariesof the self “song of myself” has much in common with classical epic this epic sense of purpose though is coupled with an almost keatsian valorizationof repose and passive perception since for whitman the birthplace ofpoetry is in the self the best way to learn about poetry is torelax and watch the workings of one’s own mind while “song of myself” is crammed with significant detailthere are three key episodes that must be examined the first ofthese is found in the sixth section of the poem a child asks thenarrator “ what is the grass ” and the narratoris forced to explore his own use of symbolism and his inabilityto break things down to essential principles the bunches of grassin the child’s hands become a symbol of the regeneration in nature but they also signify a common material that links disparate peopleall over the united states together grass the ultimate symbolof democracy grows everywhere in the wake of the civil war thegrass reminds whitman of graves grass feeds on the bodies of thedead everyone must die eventually and so the natural roots ofdemocracy are therefore in mortality whether due to natural causesor to the bloodshed of internecine warfare while whitman normallyrevels in this kind of symbolic indeterminacy here it troubles hima bit “i wish i could translate the hints” he says suggestingthat the boundary between encompassing everything and saying nothingis easily crossed the second episode is more optimistic the famous “twentyninthbather” can be found in the eleventh section of the poem in thissection a woman watches twentyeight young men bathing in the ocean she fantasizes about joining them unseen and describes their seminudebodies in some detail the invisible twentyninth bather offersa model of being much like that of emerson’s “transparent eyeball”to truly experience the world one must be fully in it and of ityet distinct enough from it to have some perspective and invisibleso as not to interfere with it unduly this paradoxical set of conditionsdescribes perfectly the poetic stance whitman tries to assume thelavish eroticism of this section reinforces this idea sexual contactallows two people to become one yet not one—it offers a moment oftranscendence as the female spectator introduced in the beginningof the section fades away and whitman’s voice takes over the eroticismbecomes homoeroticism again this is not so much the expressionof a sexual preference as it is the longing for communion with every livingbeing and a connection that makes use of both the body and the soul although whitman is certainly using the homoerotic sincerely andin other ways too particularly for shock value having worked through some of the conditions of perceptionand creation whitman arrives in the third key episode at a momentwhere speech becomes necessary in the twentyfifth section he notesthat “speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measureitself  it provokes me forever it says sarcastically  waltyou contain enough why don’t you let it out then ” havingalready established that he can have a sympathetic experience whenhe encounters others “i do not ask the wounded person how he feelsi myself become the wounded person” he must find a way to retransmitthat experience without falsifying or diminishing it resistingeasy answers he later vows he “will never translate himself atall” instead he takes a philosophically more rigorous stance “whatis known i strip away” again whitman’s position is similar to thatof emerson who says of himself “i am the unsettler” whitmanhowever is a poet and he must reassemble after unsettling hemust “let it out then” having catalogued a continent and encompassedits multitudes he finally decides “i too am not a bit tamed itoo am untranslatable  i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofsof the world” “song of myself” thus ends with a sound—a yawp—thatcould be described as either pre or postlinguistic lacking anyof the normal communicative properties of language whitman’s yawpis the release of the “kosmos” within him a sound at the borderlinebetween saying everything and saying nothing more than anythingthe yawp is an invitation to the next walt whitman to read intothe yawp to have a sympathetic experience to absorb it as partof a new multitude16k views · view upvoters
