tamu massif largest volcano on earth discovered beneath pacific ocean sep 9 2013 by enrico de lazaro « previous  next »oceanographers led by dr william sager from the university of houston have discovered what they say is the biggest single volcano yet documented on our planet3d map of the tamu massif formation iodp the volcano named tamu massif after texas am university is believed to be about 145 million years old it became inactive within a few million years after it was formed the top of tamu massif lies about 6500 feet 1981 m below the ocean surface while much of its base is believed to be in waters that are almost 4 miles 64 km deep dr sager and his colleagues from japan uk and the united states examined a large underwater area in the northwest pacific known as the shatsky rise located about 1000 miles east of japan they had found that the plateau contained three enormous mounds“we got tired of referring to them as the one on the left the one on the right and the big one” said dr sager who with colleagues reported the discovery in the journal nature geoscience map of the tamu massif formation grey area lower right shows the footprint of martian olympus mons at the same scale william w sager et al“we knew it was big but we had no idea it was one large volcano our final calculations have determined it is about 120000 square miles in area or about the size of the state of new mexico making it by far the largest ever discovered on earth it rivals in size some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system such as olympus mons on mars”olympus mons the largest volcano on mars is so big that it can be seen with many common backyard telescopes the largest active volcano on earth is mauna loa in hawaii which has erupted off and on for the past 700000 years but it is about 2000 square miles in size a tiny fraction of tamu massif“what is unusual about the volcano is its slope – it’s not high but very wide so the flank slopes are very gradual in fact if you were standing on its flank you would have trouble telling which way is downhill we know that it is a single immense volcano constructed from massive lava flows that emanated from the center of the volcano to form a broad shieldlike shape” dr sager said seismicreflection profile along line ab on the map see upper image william w sager et al“its shape is different from any other submarine volcano found on earth and it’s very possible it can give us some clues about how massive volcanoes can form an immense amount of magma came from the center and this magma had to have come from the earth’s mantle so this is important information for geologists trying to understand how the earth’s interior works” he concludedbibliographic information william w sager et al an immense shield volcano within the shatsky rise oceanic plateau northwest pacific ocean nature geoscience published online september 05 2013 doi 101038ngeo1934published in geography geophysics tagged as pacific ocean tamu massif volcano follow you might like researchers develop firstever 3d numerical model of melting snowflake scientists find ‘smoke rings’ in earth’s oceans zealandia researchers return from expedition to earth’s seventh continent researchers solve millenniaold mystery of ‘bright nights’geoscientists finally solve mystery of hawaiian volcanoes meet zealandia earth’s new continent pangea breakup cooled earth’s mantle thinned crust share this page
