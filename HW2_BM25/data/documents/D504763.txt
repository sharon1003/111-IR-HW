he didnt want anyone outside of his own bloodline to rule spain this pivotal point greatly disrupted the political stability of both spain and its colonies cities throughout spain and its colonies in america each formed governing bodies primarily consisting of local elites these ruling local elites were called juntas and their underlying principle in taking power over their communities was that in absence of the king fernando vii their sovereignty devolved temporarily back to the community the juntas swore loyalty to the captive fernando vii and each ruled different and diverse parts of the colony most of fernandos subjects were loyal to him in 1808 but after he was restored to the spanish crown in 1814 his policy of restoring absolute power alienated both the juntas and his subjects he

later the spanish monarchy was defeated definitively at the battle of ayacucho after independence the conflicts of interests that faced different sectors of creole peruvian society and the particular

americana of 1865 general francisco de miranda already a hero to the french prussians english and americans had garnered a series of successes against the spanish between 1808 and 1812 he had effectively negated their access to all the ports on the caribbean thus preventing them from receiving reinforcements and supplies and was essentially conducting moppingup operations throughout the country at that point he convinced simon bolivar to join the struggle and put him in charge of the fort at puerto cabello this was all at once a supply and arms depot a strategic port and the central holding facility for spanish prisoners through what amounts to a gross dereliction of duty simon bolivar neglected to enforce the customary security dispositions before departing to a social event during the night there was an uprising of the spanish prisoners and they managed to subdue the independentist garrison and gain control of the supplies the arms and ammunition and the port the loyalist forces progressively regained control of the country and eventually monteverdes successes forced the newly formed congress of the republic to ask of miranda that he sign a capitulation at la victoria in aragua on july 12 1812 thus ending the first phase of the revolutionary war after the capitulation of 1812 simón bolívar turned over francisco de miranda to the spanish authorities secured a safe passage for himself and his closest officers and fled to new granada he later returned with a new army while the war had entered a tremendously violent phase after much of the local aristocracy had abandoned the cause of independence blacks and mulattoes carried on the struggle elites reacted with open distrust and opposition to the efforts of these common people bolívars forces invaded venezuela from new granada in 1813 waging a campaign with a ferocity captured perfectly by their motto of  war to the death  bolívars forces defeated domingo monteverdes spanish army in a series of battles taking caracas on august 6 1813 and besieging monteverde at puerto cabello in september 1813 battle of carabobo with loyalists displaying the same passion and violence the rebels achieved only shortlived victories the army led by the loyalist josé tomás boves demonstrated the key military role that the llaneros came to play in the regions struggle turning the tide against independence these highly mobile ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed bolívar out of his home country once more in 1814 heavily reinforced spanish forces in venezuela lost a series of battles to bolívars forces but then decisively defeated bolivar at la puerta on june 15 took caracas on july 16 and again defeated his army at aragua on august 18 at a cost of 2000 spanish casualties out of 10000 soldiers as well as most of the 3000 in the rebel army bolívar and other leaders then returned to new granada later that year the largest expeditionary force ever sent by spain to america arrived under the command of pablo morillo this force effectively replaced the improvised llanero units who were disbanded by morillo bolívar and other republican leaders returned to venezuela in december 1816 leading a largely unsuccessful insurrection against spain from 1816 to 1818 from bases in the llanos and ciudad bolívar in the orinoco river area in 1819 bolívar successfully invaded new granada and returned to venezuela in april 1821 leading a large army of 7000 at carabobo on june 24 his forces decisively defeated spanish and colonial forces winning venezuelan independence although
