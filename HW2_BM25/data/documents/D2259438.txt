what is an antibody  immunoglobulin antibodies also referred to as immunoglobulins are glycoproteins naturally produced in response to invading foreign particles antigens such as microorganisms and viruses as such they play a critical role in the immune system’s defense against infection and disease antigens recognized and bound by antibodies can be proteins such as receptors expressed on cancer cells sugars on bacterial and viral cell surfaces hormones chemical compounds or nucleic acid structures the region of an antigen that interacts with an antibody is called the epitope normally an animal’s immune system will generate a large group of antibodies that recognize several epitopes of a particular antigen each antibody is secreted by a different antibodyproducing plasma cell and may be specific for a different epitope since the antibodies found in serum are collectively produced by many plasma cells clones they are described as polyclonal while this is an advantage for fighting infections in nature the heterogeneity of polyclonal antibodies limits their use as research tools a major breakthrough in the development of antibodies for research applications was the development of a technique for producing monoclonal antibodies in 1975 by köhler and milstein 1 the technique involves removing b cells plasma cell precursors from the spleen of an animal that has been challenged with an antigen and subsequently fusing with an immortal myeloma tumor cell line this results in a singlecell hybrid known as a hybridoma the b cells confer antibody production capability while the myeloma cells enable hybridomas to divide indefinitely and grow well in culture hybridomas secrete only one antibody type effectively ensuring a longterm supply of antibodies selective for a single epitope which are also known as monoclonals what is the structure of an antibody many of the key structural features of antibodies can be highlighted using immunoglobulin g ig g as a model since ig g is the most abundant antibody in serum the classical representation of an antibody is as a yshaped molecule composed of four polypeptide subunits with two identical heavy and light chains figure 1 the nterminus of each heavy chain associates with one of the light chains to create two antigenbinding domains these are the arms of the “y” shape and are termed fragment antigen binding fab domains the ctermini of the two heavy chains combine to form the fragment crystallization fc domain which represents the tail of the “y” the fc domain is important for the antibody’s interaction with effector cells such as macrophages and for activation of the complement cascade the four polypeptide chains are held together by covalent disulfide bridges and noncovalent bonds figure 1 schematic structure of an ig g molecule sequence analysis of various light chains has revealed two distinct regions figure 2 a highly variable nterminal region vl and a constant cterminal region cl similar studies on heavy chains have shown that they are also comprised of variable and constant regions vh and ch respectively however ig g heavy chains contain one variable region found at the nterminus and three constant regions figure 2 unsurprisingly the variable regions of both chains localize to the fab domains providing the structural basis for the antigen and epitopeselectivity of antibodies figure 2 light and heavy chain structure light chains are approximately 220 amino acids in length and can be divided into two equal variable and constant regions heavy chains are about 440 amino acids in length and are subdivided into four 110 amino acid segments  one variable region and three constant regions the sequence heterogeneity within the variable regions is not random but occurs at three short 530 amino acids in length segments within each chain called the hypervariable regions since the residues in hypervariable regions form the actual binding site for the antigen they are also known as the complementarity determining regions or cdrs figure 2 recombinant antibody technology advances in the understanding of antibody structure and function bacteriophage replication and dna manipulation and mutagenesis led to the development of a method for the generation of recombinant monoclonal antibodies using phage display antibody libraries this technology addresses the limitations of the traditional hybridoma method which is known to be time consuming and expensive requiring extensive expertise as well as specialized cell culture and animal facilities in addition antigens used to generate antibodies using hybridoma technology can be toxic in animals or poorly immunogenic and thus may not elicit an immune response antibody library and phage display technology can be used to generate highly specific high affinity antibodies in vitro without reliance on the immunogenicity of the antigen or the use of animals such recombinant antibodies are suitable in research applications where traditional monoclonal antibodies are used at biorad recombinant monoclonal antibodies are generated using a unique and innovative method based on the hu man c ombinatorial a ntibody l ibrary hu cal® and our advanced cys display® method of phage display the hu cal platinum® library contains 45 billion functional human antibody specificities already prefabricated in an engineered fab format that represent 95 of the human antibody repertoire the technology can be applied to generate a customized antibody specific for just about any antigen for use in research and in vitro diagnostic applications table 1 provides a comparison between polyclonal hu cal generated recombinant and traditional monoclonal antibodies table 1 comparison of antibodies generated using alternative methods hu
