carrier strike force under the command of rear admiral kakuji kakuta comprising the carriers ryūjō and junyō plus escort ships sailed to 180 mi 160 nmi 290 km southwest of dutch harbor to launch air strikes at the united states army and united states navy facility to support a japanese offensive in the aleutians and in the central pacific at midway the japanese planned to occupy islands in the aleutians in order to extend their defensive perimeter in the north pacific to make it more difficult for the u s to attack japan from that area u s marines observing the battle from trench positions 3 june 1942shortly before dawn at 0258 given the geographic latitude and longitude admiral kakuta ordered his aircraft carriers to launch their strike which was made up of 12 a6m zero fighters 10 b5n kate highlevel bombers and 12 d3a val dive bombers which took off from the two small carriers in the freezing weather to strike at dutch harbor one b5n was lost on takeoff from ryujo the planes arrived over the harbor at 0407 and attacked the town′s radio station and oil storage tanks causing some damage many members of the 206th were awakened on 3 june by the sound of bombs and gunfire while the unit had been on alert for an attack for many days there was no specific warning of the attack before the japanese planes arrived over dutch harbor with no clear direction from headquarters gun crews from every battery quickly realized the danger ran to their guns stationed around the harbor and began to return fire in addition to their 3 in 76 mm guns 37 mm 146 in guns and 50 in 127 mm machine guns members of the unit fired their rifles and one even claimed to have hurled a wrench at a lowflying enemy plane several members reported being able to clearly see the faces of the japanese aviators as they made repeated runs over the island 4 the highest casualties on the first day occurred when bombs struck barracks 864 and 866 in fort mears killing 17 men of the 37th infantry and eight from the 151st engineers 5when all the japanese planes were recovered there were erroneous reports of enemy ships in the vicinity but search planes found no ships within the area during the search four nakajima e8n 2 dave twoseat reconnaissance planes —launched from the heavy cruisers takao and maya —encountered u s fighters searching for the departing japanese squadron barracks ship northwestern engulfed by flames in dutch harbor after the second japanese airstrike 4 june 1942the 206th ca spent much of the night of 34 june moving guns down off the mountain tops surrounding the harbor down into the city of unalaska and into harbor facilities themselves this was partially as a deception and partially to defend against an expected land invasion civilian contractors offered to help and were put to work filling sandbags to protect the new gun positions on 4 june the japanese carriers steamed to less than 100 mi 87 nmi 160 km south of dutch harbor to launch a second attack at 1600 a second airstrike of nine fighters 11 dive bombers and six level bombers took off and attacked the u s facilities at dutch harbor again less than an hour later more targets were damaged including some grounded aircraft an army barracks oil storage tanks aircraft hangar and a few merchant ships in the port when the japanese returned on 4 june the zero fighters concentrated on strafing the gun positions while their bombers destroyed the fuel tanks located at the harbor one wing of the military hospital at the base was destroyed 6 after hitting the fuel tanks the enemy divebombers and highlevel bombers concentrated on the ships in the harbor fillmore and gillis driven away from these two targets by intense antiaircraft fire they finally succeeded in destroying the station ship northwestern which because of its large size they mistakenly believed was a warship northwestern was actually a transport ship which had been beached and used as a barracks for civilian workers although in flames and badly damaged firefighters managed to save the hull its power plant was thereafter used to produce steam and electricity for the shore installations 7 8 an antiaircraft gun was blown up by a bomb and four u s navy servicemen were killed 6two japanese dive bombers and one fighter damaged by antiaircraft fire failed to return to their carriers on the way back the japanese planes encountered an air patrol of six curtiss p40 fighters over otter point a short aerial battle ensued which resulted in the loss of one japanese fighter and two level bombers four out of the six

mitsubishi a6m2 zero was damaged by ground fire and crashlanded on akutan island about 20 mi 17 nmi 32 km northeast of dutch harbor although the pilot was killed the plane was not seriously damaged this zero—known as the  akutan zero —was recovered by american forces inspected and repaired the recovery was an important technical intelligence gain for u s as it showed the strengths and weaknesses of the zero′s design 10the following day admiral kakuta received orders to break off further attacks and head for the central pacific to support the combined fleet which was retreating after being
