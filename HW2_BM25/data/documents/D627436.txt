don’t know if anyone will ever surpass his flight time” jared said ken jones didn’t necessarily set out to break records but “from a really early age i wanted to fly” he recalled as a farm kid growing up in kansas he was particularly inspired by seeing john glenn orbit the earth in the “friendship 7” spacecraft in 1962 jones learned to fly airplanes while in high school then attended embryriddle aeronautical university in daytona beach fla on a reserve officers’ training corps scholarship following graduation he headed off to army flight school where he finished first in his class and was given his choice of aircraft to fly he chose the bell ah1 cobra after spending some time in a tactical unit jones transferred to fort rucker in alabama to serve as a cobra ip that’s how he came to fly some of the first ah64a apaches when they were introduced to the u s army in 1985“they didn’t have many apache instructor pilots back then so they had to create them out of cobra instructor pilots” he explained “they were real quick ip courses at that time”jones spent a total of 12 years in the army’s active component including time flying in research and development for the ah64b a predecessor to the ah64d longbow then deciding that “maybe i’d like to stay put” he took a position with the utah national guard’s apache battalion in salt lake city attracted by both the personality of the unit and the beauty of the surrounding mountains the ah64d apache “longbow” photo courtesy of boeingat the time of his retirement jones was the aviation standardization officer for the 97th aviation troop command and the senior ah64d standardization instructor pilot for the utah national guard over the more than 23 years that jones spent with the guard he deployed four times including three deployments to afghanistan indeed 2270 of his apache flight hours — nearly a quarter of the total — were combat hours logged in afghanistan jones took part in several highprofile operations while in that country including a rescue in which he and his wingman flew five stranded special operators to safety after strapping them to the outside of their aircraft he also provided apache support for a 2012 special forces mission that rescued four kidnapped aid workers and he had a few opportunities to both fly in combat and perform battle hand overs with jared who deployed to afghanistan with him twice as jones put it “not many fathers get to be in combat or fly in combat with their sons” jared added that on the rare occasions they were actually in the same aircraft “we didn’t tell mom about it until after the fact”jared’s exposure to aviation stretches back to his childhood at fort rucker when he and his brother jason who became an air force pilot would join their father in the cobra simulator on friday nights“the boys just thought it was neat” jones recalled “after a while they could fly it a little bit by themselves”when they were older they received more formal flying lessons from jones who is also a federal aviation administration certified flight instructor according to jared his father can be demanding as an instructor but he inspires his students with his enthusiasm and his talent for teaching photo courtesy of u s army national guard“he loves to teach” jared said “he expects a lot from his students but he also sees the potential in them”he is also still eager to learn including from jared and his younger colleagues “in some cases they teach me things i don’t know said jones who is also known by the call sign “jedi” “if you have a flexible mind you can be an instructor one day and the next day the student”jones won’t be giving up learning or flying anytime soon he has already accepted a position as a helicopter emergency medical services ems pilot with air methods which has a contract with the university of utah air med program“it’s a professional pilot job so i’m excited about it” he said “of course ems guys don’t fly as much but that’s ok — i’ll
