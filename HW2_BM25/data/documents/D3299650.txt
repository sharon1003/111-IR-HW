page 3  determining the ip address what if i don’t know what ip address and subnet mask i should use a quick method is to find the ip address of your computer and then pick an ip that is within your ip addressing scheme in microsoft windows  go to the start menu and click on run type in command or cmd and press enter this will open a black window with a command prompt type in ipconfig or ipconfig all and press enter you should get something like what is shown below you will notice in our example above that the ip address scheme is 1921680x where x is a number between 1 and 254 technically 0 and 255 are valid but in most cases you don’t want to use an ip ending in 0 or 255 these are generally reserved for use by network protocols so our example computer’s ip is 192168019 our subnet mask is 2552552550 and our gateway is 19216801 if we want to pick an ip for the printer we have to remember that we can’t have duplicate ip’s so i would choose a high number like 170 because the dhcp server is typically configured to assign ip addresses starting at a low number and ending at some higher number if you have access to your dhcp server’s settings you might want to set the ending range of assignable ip addresses to something like 150 and choose your static ip addresses above that range so now we have an ip address chosen for our example printer sm means subnet mask ip 1921680170 sm 2552552550the next step is to install the jet direct card in the printer if you haven’t already then you should be able to print a configuration page to make sure the card is recognized by the printer the configuration page will tell you the jet direct card’s current ip address and subnet mask which may be set to default values and other information such as the lan hardware mac address click here for instructions on printing out a configuration page now we need to get our ip address and subnet mask entered into the jet direct card there are three common methods for entering a static ip1 through the printers control panel 2 through the jet direct’s embedded web server available on most new cards600n and newer 3 software – hp web jet admin and hp install network printer wizard both programs are free downloads from wwwhpcom install network printer wizard is a basic wizard to help you install a networked printer web jet admin is a complete enterprisewide printer management utility it is also a bit more complex than the wizard the next page of this tutorial describes entering the ip address and subnet mask prev next
