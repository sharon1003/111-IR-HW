coal—a complex natural resource an overview of of factors affecting coal quality and use in the united states by stanley p schweinfurth introductioncoal is abundant in the u s is relatively inexpensive and is an excellent source of energy and byproduct raw materials because of these factors domestic coal is the primary source of fuel for electric power plants in the u s and will continue to be well into the 21st century in addition other u s industries continue to use coal for fuel and coke production and there is a large overseas market for highquality american coal because humans have used coal for centuries much is known about it the usefulness of coal as a heat source and the myriad of byproducts that can be produced from coal are well understood the continued and increasingly largescale use of coal in the united states and in many other industrialized and developing nations has resulted in known and anticipated hazards to environmental quality and human health as a result there is still much to be learned about the harmful attributes of coal and how they may be removed modified or avoided to make coal use less harmful to humans and nature these issues of coal quality have not been examined carefully until recently some of the problems that accompany the mining and use of coal are well known acid mine drainage results when coal beds and surrounding strata containing medium to high amounts of sulfur in the form of compounds known as sulfides are disrupted by mining thereby exposing the sulfides to air and water atmospheric sulfur oxides so x  and subsequent acid deposition such as acid rain result from the burning of medium to highsulfur coal the quality of surface and ground water may be affected adversely by the disposal of the ash and sludge that result from the burning of coal and cleaning of flue gases these are some of the serious problems requiring either improved or new remedies other environmental problems are associated with emissions of carbon dioxide co 2 and nitrogen oxides no x  two of the socalled greenhouse gases these emissions are often attributed to coal use only however they also result from the burning of any fossil or biomass fuel such as wood natural gas gasoline and heating oil the greenhouse gas problem requires a broader solution than just reducing the use of coal research currently is being conducted in the u s and several other countries into the reduction and disposal of co 2 from coal combustion an excellent review of the results of this research and the prospects for coal can be found in a publication of iea coal research 1999 fluidizedbed combustion fbc of coal which is a new method for controlling sulfur emissions is gaining wide acceptance in this system finely ground coal is mixed with finely ground limestone both are fed together into a furnace in a constant stream onto a horizontally moving grate air is forced up through the grate and the entire mass is ignited at relatively low temperatures the forced air causes the ground coal and limestone to be mixed with the hot gases of combustion which in turn promotes the conversion of any so x to gypsum as the burning mass moves along on the grate according to the u s department of energy 2000 highsulfur coal may be burned in this way while simultaneously capturing up to 95 percent of the so x and most of the no x emitted reduction and disposal of co 2 emissions is the subject of current research in the u s and several other countries the clean air act amendments of 1990 public law 101549 required the u s environmental protection agency epa to conduct studies of 15 trace elements released by the burning of coal to determine if they present health hazards these 15 elements antimony arsenic beryllium cadmium chlorine chromium cobalt lead manganese mercury nickel potassium selenium thorium and uranium along with many other potentially hazardous substances released into the air by other industries are termed hazardous air pollutants haps on the basis of epidemiological studies the epa concluded that with the possible exception of mercury there is no compelling evidence to indicate that traceelement emissions from coalburning power plants cause human health problems u s environmental protection agency 1996 in december 2000 after extensive study the epa announced a finding that regulation of mercury emissions from coalfired power plants is necessary and appropriate because coalfired power plants are the largest unregulated source of manmade emissions of mercury in the u s u s environmental protection agency 2000 epa will propose regulations to limit mercury emissions in 2003 and will issue final emissions rules by 2004 meanwhile arsenic is still under study not as an emissions problem from coal combustion but for its potential role as a hazard in ground water if it is leached from coalmining waste or from fly ash in disposal sites additional coalquality research on both mercury and arsenic is being conducted at the u s geological survey usgs and elsewhere in order to 1 help identify their sources in coal and 2 help resolve any remaining potential hazards issues with regard to these two elements in 1996 the epa said that of the potential haps from coal combustion only mercury and arsenic needed additional study in 2000 epa determined that mercury emissions require regulation other problems that may arise from the use of coal are not necessarily harmful to the environment or human health but affect the use and efficiency of coalburning equipment for example certain constituents in coal may cause severe erosion and corrosion of or the buildup of mineral deposits on furnace and boiler parts these effects greatly reduce the efficiency and life expectancy of furnaces or boilers as a result costly repairs are often required thus far coal has been discussed as if it were a single homogeneous material but this is done only for convenience in this report in fact a wide variety of coal types exists depending on differing proportions and combinations of organic and inorganic mineral components sulfur and ash for example sulfur content may range from low less than 1 percent through medium 1 to 3 percent to high greater than 3 percent and ash yields may range from a low of about 3 percent to a high of 49 percent if ash yields are 50 percent or greater the substance is no longer called coal coal may produce high or low amounts of energy or contain high or low amounts of the substances that produce organic chemicals and synthetic fuels or contain higher or lower amounts of the elements that are considered to be hazardous air pollutants haps this range in properties results from coals diverse origins including the long and complex geologic histories of coal deposits the purpose of this report is to acquaint students noncoal scientists and the general public with some basic information on 1 the subject of coal quality and the reasons why it is so complex 2 methods for determining coal quality and 3 the need for continuing studies of this complex subject a discussion on the origins of coal is included in order to provide a framework for understanding coals complex nature see the section on further reading for a bibliography on coal quality and other topics such as coal mining uses for coal or health

physical support during its preparation were essential to the completion of this circular coal in the united statesa discussion of coal use in the u s and of the beneficial things that come from coal is necessary in order to provide the reader with a better understanding of the importance of coal quality and the need for continuing research on coal quality coal production and consumptioncoal use in the u s began around two thousand years ago early inhabitants of this continent probably gathered coal from outcroppings beaches and streambeds coal mining by europeanamericans began in the richmond basin of virginia between 1720 and 1750 the richmond area is known to have furnished coal during the american revolution between 1750 and 1800 coal was discovered in many parts of the northern and southern appalachian basin as the population moved westward after the american revolution coal deposits were discovered progressively in the midcontinent including texas the rocky mountains region the colorado plateau and the northern great plains the first coal in the west was found along the missouri river in 1804 by the explorers meriwether lewis and george rogers clark colliers encyclopedia 1960 in the u s coal is used to produce approximately 56 percent of the annual electricity requirement 90 ercent of the coal produced is used for this purpose after 1830 with the beginning of the railroads the real growth of the coal industry began the railroads not only used coal they also provided the means to transport coal which encouraged the growth of energyintensive industries the growth of the railroads also encouraged the expansion of the iron and steel industry which by the 1860s had abandoned charcoal in favor of coke for the reduction of iron ore to pig iron in the 1880s after the invention of electric turbines coal soon became the principle energy source for steamgenerated electricity for a much more detailed account of the early days of coal discovery and use in the u s see eavenson 1942 by 1918 industry in the u s depended almost entirely on coal during world war ii demand for coal drove coal production to record highs but shortly thereafter petroleum replaced coal as our chief source of energy for about a decade following world war ii most of the decline in coal use was due to the replacement of coalburning railroad engines with diesel engines in the 1960s coal production and consumption began to rise due to an increasing demand for electricity and has risen ever since in 1961 the u s produced 4204 million tons 1 ton2000 pounds and used 3904 million tons for domestic purposes in 1998 production was 11187 million tons and domestic use in 1999 was 10452 million tons figs 1 2 energy information administration 2000 the difference between the amounts of coal produced and used in the u s is accounted for mainly by exports revenue from coal exports helps reduce the deficit in the balance of payments the u s makes to its foreign suppliers of consumer goods in 1998 coal exports of 78 million tons earned approximately 29 billion energy information administration 1999b according to the energy information administration 2000 approximately 10991 million tons of coal were produced in 1999 slightly less than in 1998 and 10452 million tons were used domestically slightly more than in 1998 the differences in production and consumption between 1998 and 1999 were due to a reduction in exports of 20 million tons in 1999 of the total coal used domestically in 1999 90 percent 9444 million tons was used to fuel electric power plants  fig 3  which produced 56 percent of the electricity in the u s the other 10 percent was used in industrial coke and heating residential and commercial applications  fig 2  coal pricessteady improvements in the efficiency of coal mining in the u s have kept coal prices low in 1998 the average price of a ton of coal at the mine was 1767 the average price of a ton of coal delivered to electric utilities was 2564 energy information administration 2000 prices in 1986 of 2399 and 3330 per ton respectively demonstrate this trend furthermore over the last decade coal has been the least expensive of the three main fuel sources— coal natural gas and petroleum—in the u s on the basis of a common unit of heat million btu over the tenyear period coal prices averaged about 091 at the mine natural gas averaged 172 at the wellhead and crude oil averaged 270 at the domestic first point of purchase energy information administration 2000 lower prices probably encourage continued high and probably increasing levels of coal use in the u s in 1999 the energy information administration eia forecasted that by the year 2020 average coal prices would decrease further to approximately 2001 per ton delivered to electric power plants in 1998 dollars coal production is forecast by the eia  fig 2 to grow to approximately 1300 million tons by 2020 of which domestic use will account for 1279 million tons of that amount 1177 million tons will be used by electric power plants these figures indicate a rate of growth of approximately one percent per year for both coal production and power plant use other domestic uses of coal are forecast by the eia to remain about the same by 2020 energy information administration 2000 coal supplyalthough coal deposits are widely distributed throughout the u s the bulk of coal mining and consumption remained until recently in the eastern part of the country mostly in the appalachian basin this was due to the concentration of population and industry in the east coal production recently has been moving to the western states because the bulk of the remaining resources of lowsulfur coal are located in the rocky mountains and northern great plains regions the demand for lowsulfur coal is based on the clean air act amendments of 1990 which began implementation in 2000 the new regulations limit so x emissions from coalfired power plants to 12 lbs per million btu powerplant managers are finding that converting their coal supplies from medium and highsulfur coal to lowsulfur coal rather than installing fluegas desulfurization fgd systems generally is the least expensive option for achieving the required level of so x emissions u s geological survey 2000 there are reserves of lowsulfur coal remaining in the appalachian basin but most of the remaining reserves occur at depths requiring costlier underground mining methods to recover them whether or not substantially more coal is used in the future than presently coal is abundant enough in the u s to supply anticipated requirements for much of the 21st century in 1999 the national mining association nma reported that 30 of the largest coal companies in the u s have approximately 68 billion tons of coal in reserve national mining association 1999 in addition numerous small coalmining companies have reserves that are not included in the nmas report and there are additional coal deposits that could be mined when and if needed in order to estimate the abundance of coal in beds and zones that will provide the largest percentage of the nations domestic energy production for the next 50 years the usgs in cooperation with the geological surveys of the major coalproducing states arizona colorado illinois indiana kentucky maryland missouri montana new mexico north dakota ohio pennsylvania tennessee texas utah virginia west virginia and wyoming is in the midst of a basinwide reassessment of the coal resources of the u s u s geological survey 1996 2000 figure 4 shows the general distribution of coal deposits in the u s results of the assessment for the northern rocky mountains and great plains region which includes selected coal beds of the greater green river hannacarbon powder river and williston basins the colorado plateau and the northern and central appalachian basin coal regions are available in cdrom format fort union coal assessment team 1999 kirschbaum and others 2000 northern and central appalachian basin coal regions assessment team 2001 the usgs also is leading a cooperative program with some of the same states to assess the actual availability and recoverability of coal in areas smaller than basins this study takes into account the many restrictions on mining imposed by environmental and landuse regulations and by the physical constraints based on geology and mining practices eggleston and others 1990 for additional information on coal resources please see the coal resources subsection of the further reading section coal byproductscoal—that black dusty rock that evokes punishment of bad children at holiday times—is actually a very remarkable and rewarding material in addition to providing heat to generate electricity which is currently the primary use of coal a myriad of other beneficial substances are derived from coal perhaps the best known of these substances is coke which is used in the steel industry to separate iron from its ore coal is used in the production of other perhaps unexpected products such as pharmaceuticals textile dyes food and wood preservatives and other simple or highly complex chemicals see centerfold these chemicals typically are produced during the production of coke by a process called destructive distillation in this process coal is packed into a closed oxygenrestricted container retort or coke oven and then heated to a high temperature this process drives off the volatile matter in the coal the volatile matter contains the parent compounds that are used to produce the products shown in the centerfold the lack of oxygen in the retort prevents the chemicals from completely burning in the past large quantities of an impure gas containing methane and carbon monoxide called town gas or water gas were derived from coal in the u s and elsewhere water gas was used for heating and cooking but has been replaced largely by natural gas in the u s since the 1940s in other parts of the world notably in germany during world war ii and in south africa today gasoline and heating oil have been derived from coal currently research is being conducted in the u s to improve the techniques and economics of producing both gas and oil called synfuels from coal this work is sponsored by the u s department of energy and involves numerous private industrial and academic organizations u s department of energy 2000 coal is more than just a fuel source it contains complex tars oils and gases that can be broken down into many useful products such as dyes medicines solvents and drugs coal combustion products ccps consisting of fly ash bottom ash boiler slag and fluegasdesulfurization fgd material also have become important in the economy as coal burns it emits sulfur in the form of sulfur oxide fgd is the process by which a chemical such as calcium carbonate ca co 3  is injected into the fluegas stream to trap the sulfur by combining with it to produce gypsum ca so 4  gypsum is heavy and falls to the bottom of the fgd unit as sludge in a wet process or as a powder in a dry process according to the usgs kalyoncu 1999 approximately 572 million tons of fly ash 152 million tons of bottom ash 27 million tons of boiler slag and 227 million tons of fgd material were produced in 1998 the amounts of each ccp that were used in 1998 were in percent 336 313 801 and 10 respectively the rest was disposed of in landfills settling ponds or by other means coal fly ash is used mainly as an additive in concrete fly ash may also be used as structural fill as road base material in waste stabilization or in mining applications bottom ash is used mainly as road base and structural fill material as well as in concrete and as grit for snow and ice control boiler slag is used mostly in blasting grit and roofing granules fgd gypsum is used mainly in wallboard with small amounts being used in concrete and agricultural applications figure 5 shows photographs of examples of some uses for fly ash and fgd gypsum there are other perhaps less well known products that can be derived from coal for example sulfur oxides can be captured from flue gas and used to make sulfuric acid which is an important industrial raw material other valuable elements such as mercury and chlorine also can be recovered from flue gas finkelman and brown 1991 what is coal originscoal begins as peat which consists of loosely consolidated layers of various mixtures of plant and mineral matter peat accumulates in wetlands called peat swamps bogs or mires in this report the term peat swamp is used to indicate a peatforming wetland figure 6 is a photograph of the okefenokee swamp which is a modern swamp where peat is forming peat swamps are wetlands that have the appropriate conditions for peat accumulation such as abundant moisture a stable to slowly sinking land surface and protection from rapidly eroding forces such as rivers and ocean waves over millions of years burial compression by overlying inorganic sediments and the effects of heat from depth in the earth or proximity to volcanic sources cause peat to change to coal  fig 7  the resultant coal is an extremely complex mostly organic generally well bedded sedimentary rock to be classified as coal the rock must contain less than 50 percent ashforming mineral matter if it contains between 30 and 50 percent mineral matter it is classified as impure coal in the u s individual coal beds may be as thin as a few inches or rarely as thick as 200 ft and may cover areas as small as a few square yards or as large as several counties or even states for example the pittsburgh coal bed extends over all or parts of 25 counties in the area where ohio pennsylvania and west virginia join see fig 4  figure 8 shows two examples from the powder river basin in wyoming of peat deposits in relation to laterally and vertically bounding sediments deposited by rivers the deposits were subsequently buried and coverted to lignite and coal compositioncoal is composed of complex mixtures of organic and inorganic compounds the organic compounds inherited from the plants that live and die in the swamps number in the millions the approximately more than 120 inorganic compounds in coal either were introduced into the swamp from waterborne or windborne sediment or were derived from elements in the original vegetation for instance inorganic compounds containing such elements as iron and zinc are needed by plants for healthy growth after the plants decompose the inorganic compounds remain in the resulting peat some of those elements combine to form discrete minerals such as pyrite other sources of inorganic compounds used by the plants may be either the mud that coats the bottom of the swamp sediments introduced by drainage runoff dissolved elements in the swamp water windborne sand ash or dust table 1 common minerals found in coal and their elemental compositions although more then 120 different minerals have been identified in coal samples only about 33 of these occur in most coal samples of these only about 8 generally are abundant enough to be considered as

parts per million occasionally some trace elements may be concentrated in a specific coal bed which may make that bed a valuable resource for those elements such as silver zinc or germanium finkelman and brown 1991 some elements however have the potential to be hazardous for example cadmium or selenium particularly if they are concentrated in more than trace amounts although as many as 120 different minerals have been identified in coal only about 33 of them commonly are found in coal and of these only about 8 quartz kaolinite illite montmorillonite chlorite pyrite calcite and siderite are abundant enough to be considered major constituents  table 1  the organic compounds in coal are composed of the elements carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur and trace amounts of a variety of other elements although only a few elements compose the organic compounds found in coal these compounds are extremely complex and as a result they are not well understood for example an attempt to define the structure of just one organic compound in a brown coal lignite is shown in figure 10 but even this relatively simple structure is based on scientific conjecture the organic compounds in coal produce heat when coal is burned they also may be converted to synthetic fuels or may be used to produce the organic chemicals shown in the centerfold illustration the affinities of trace elements for either the organic compounds or the minerals in coal affect the quality of the coal if trace elements are organically bound then it is difficult to remove them from the coal by cleaning processes such as crushing and washing which remove mineral matter from coal before it is burned organically bound trace elements may be released only by burning or by deep chemical leaching which is both very difficult and uneconomical in contrast trace elements associated with clays or pyrite may be largely removed from the coal by cleaning processes the trace elements then may be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner or recovered and put to some other use to date however the recovered mineral matter from coal has not been used for very many purposes with a few major exceptions such as gypsum the various forms of ash and a small amount of germanium used in semiconductors coal may contain as many as 76 of the 92 naturally occurring elements of the periodic table minerals in coalthe most common minerals in coal for example illite clay pyrite quartz and calcite are made up of these most common elements in rough order of decreasing abundance oxygen aluminum silicon iron sulfur and calcium these minerals and other less common minerals usually contain the bulk of the trace elements present in coal  table 1  minerals in coal commonly occur as single crystals or clusters of crystals that are intermixed with organic matter or that fill void spaces in the coal sizes of mineral grains range from submicroscopic to a few inches some clusters of mineral grains however such as fracture fillings  fig 11 or coal balls  fig 12  may reach sizes that range from fractions of an inch up to several feet across coal balls result when mineral matter such as calcite pyrite or siderite infuses peat before it is compressed mineral grains in coal also often occur as discrete particles such as the blebs of pyrite framboids which may be identified in the photomicrographs of coal in figure 13 the more finely divided the mineral grains the higher the magnification needed to identify them figs 13 14  although much is known about the minerals in coal much remains to be learned about their occurrence abundance origin and composition for example the type of clay mineral in a coal whether montmorillonite or illite determines how a coal will react when burned montmorillonite  table 1 may or may not break down dissociate into its constituent parts when coal is burned if it does dissociate then upon cooling it may recombine with other elements or minerals to form mineral deposits on the inside surfaces of furnaces and boilers  fig 15  this process called slagging or fouling produces barriers to heat exchange in the affected equipment which can substantially reduce its efficiency and require costly repairs illite  table 1  however with its simpler composition does not cause such problems under normal furnace operating conditions where these two clay minerals and others occur their relative abundances relationships to other minerals and exact compositions are subjects for continued research in coal quality the mineral content of coal determines what kind of ash will be produced which in turn determines the design of a furnace or boiler when coal is burned most of the mineral matter and trace elements generally form ash however some minerals break down into gaseous compounds which go out the furnaces flue pyrite for example breaks down into the individual elements iron and sulfur each element then combines with oxygen to become respectively iron oxide and so x iron oxide a heavy solid becomes part of the ash and so x a gas is emitted as part of the flue gas some trace elements also dissociate from their organic or mineral hosts when coal is burned and follow separate paths most become part of the ash but a few of the more volatile elements such as mercury and selenium may be emitted in the flue gas the mineral content of coal determines what kind of ash will be produced when it is burned the fusion temperature melting point of the ash dictates the design of furnaces and boilers in general if the fusion temperature is relatively low then the molten ash is collected at the bottom of the furnace as bottom ash requiring one design however if the fusion temperature is relatively high then the part of the ash that doesnt melt easily called fly ash is blown through the furnace or boiler with the flue gas and is collected in giant filter bags or electrostatic precipitators at the bottom of the flue stack requiring a different design coals that are relatively rich in ironbearing minerals such as pyrite or siderite have low fusion temperatures while coals relatively rich in aluminumbearing minerals such as kaolinite or illite tend to have high fusion temperatures if an electric generating or heating plant is designed to burn one type of coal then it must continue to be supplied with a similar coal or undergo an extensive and costly redesign in order to adapt to a different type of coal similarly furnaces designed to use coal that produces high amounts of heat will suffer severe losses in efficiency if they must accept coal that burns with substantially less heat maceralsthe particles of organic matter in coal inherited from the remains of plant parts are called macerals many different types of macerals occur in coal a few of the more common macerals are identified in the photomicrographs of a bituminous coal from illinois  fig 13  the identification of the original plant and its parts such as bark roots spores or seeds that produced an individual coal maceral is helpful in determining coal quality these connections usually are difficult to make because the original plant material has been compressed or altered beyond recognition coal balls  fig 12 result when mineral matter such as calcite pyrite or siderite infuses peat before it is compressed coal balls often contain permineralized plant materials that have maintained their original structures because the mineral matter has prevented compression and degradation of the plants  fig 16  coal balls therefore can be used as an aid in connecting the degraded compressed plant matter of a coal bed to the original plants macerals are grouped into three main types 1 vitrinite 2 liptinite and 3 inertinite liptinite and inertinite each contain additional maceral subtypes american association of petroleum geologists 1998 however in this report just the principal maceral types will be discussed with brief referral to some of the subtypes for illustrative purposes vitrinite which is the most common maceral results from the coalification of amorphous humic plant material structureless plant remains vitrinite sometimes called pure coal is sensitive to heat and becomes denser tougher and more vitreous as it is subjected to higher heat levels either with depth in the earth or by proximity to an external heat source such as a volcano an index of vitrinite reflectance is used by coal scientists to determine the level of heat or maturity to which coals and other organic matter such as petroleum have been subjected liptinite develops from waxy or oily plant parts such as spores algae and resin the liptinite group contains several subgroups based on these original plant parts—sporinite alginite and resinite respectively liptinite macerals are more enriched in hydrogen than either vitrinite or fusinite liptiniterich coals produce larger amounts and higher grades of liquid fuel when subjected to destructive distillation than either vitrinite or fusiniterich coals some coals called boghead or cannel coals consist almost entirely of oilrich algal and plant spore material these coals tend to yield large amounts of coal oil kerosene when subjected to destructive distillation because the macerals are rich in oily material however both cannel and boghead coals are relatively rare inertinite incorporates a group of common macerals that forms from partially oxidized or burned plant cell walls fusinite or mineral charcoal is a prominent representative of this group mineral charcoal is produced when occasionally and sometimes seasonally the surface layers of a peat swamp dry out and some surface peat either slowly oxidizes or catches fire or some growing plants are partially charred the common and naturally occurring fires of the florida everglades are modern examples of this process coals can range in maceral composition from mostly vitrinite to mostly fusinite depending on the original plant matter and the degree of preservation vitriniterich coals are shiny black clean fractured conchoidally and often exhibit iridescence called peacock coal on fresh surfaces fusiniterich coals in contrast are similar to charcoal and are dull black friable and dusty for more information on macerals and vitrinite reflectance see the subsection on coal quality in the further readings section coal ranka major factor in determining coal quality is coal rank rank refers to steps in a slow natural process called coalification during which buried plant matter changes into an ever denser drier more carbon rich and harder material the major coal ranks from lowest to highest are lignite also called brown coal in some parts of the world subbituminous coal bituminous coal and anthracite each rank may be further subdivided as shown in figure 17 the rank of coal is determined by the percentage of fixed carbon moisture water volatile matter and calorific value in british thermal units btu after the sulfur and mineralmatter content have been subtracted fixed carbon is solid combustible matter left in coal after the lighter volatile hydrogenrich compounds are driven off during coalification volatile matter is slowly removed from coal during coalification but may be rapidly removed during destructive distillation volatile matter contains the raw materials from which the organic chemicals are obtained in the u s the tests to determine the amounts of the abovementioned substances and the rank of the coal are performed using standards published by astm international 2002 in general the higher the rank of a coal the more deeply it was buried and therefore the higher the temperature it was subjected to during and after burial older coals tend to be of higher rank because they are more likely to have been buried more deeply for longer periods of time than younger coals to give a sense of the effects of increasing rank the following comparison may be used lignite is soft dusty and can ignite spontaneously under the appropriate conditions whereas anthracite is quite hard clean to the touch and must reach a temperature of about 925°f before it will ignite furthermore anthracite contains about twice the calorific value of lignite about 15000 btulb and 7000 btulb respectively because lignite contains more moisture and oxygen and less fixed carbon than anthracite subbituminous and highvolatile bituminous c coals have oxygen and moisture content and calorific values that range between those of lignite and anthracite bituminous coals of higher rank have calorific values that may exceed those of anthracite  fig 17  figure 18 shows nuclearmagneticresonance  13 c nmr spectra of coals of increasing rank illustrating the changes in the organic structures as coal progresses through stages of increasing rank why is coal so complex coal is complex because of the wide variety of factors that determine the quality of coal these factors include the following 1 the plants plant remains and other organisms such as bacteria in the peat swamp 2 biological and chemical processes and the degree of preservation of the plant matter 3 the geometry and location of the swamp 4 the mineral matter that accumulated with the plant material or was introduced at some later stage and 5 coalification geologic age and history will be a recurring theme throughout this discussion figure 19 shows the times in geologic history when coal beds formed the plantscoal begins as peat which forms in swamps having favorable conditions as explained in a previous section entitled origins these swamps which are generally filled with standing or slowly moving water are ideal places for prolific plant growth when plants fall into the swamp water covers them and slows or prevents rapid decomposition slow decomposition and a quiet environment allow plant matter to accumulate and form peat the organic matter composing the peat may accumulate in place or less commonly may be carried by flowing water to accumulate elsewhere but generally nearby most coal beds were formed from plant material that accumulated in place  fig 20  coal is a complex material formed by a mix of substances and processes the substances are plant remains and mineral matter the processes arent completely understood but involve chemical and biological reactions heat burial and time plant communities flora in peat swamps may consist of many plant types or of only a few swamp flora have changed substantially through geologic time because of evolution for instance lycopsids and tree ferns  fig 21 are found in older coal beds more modern forms such as rushes water lilies mangrove and bald cypress trees shown in figure 6 may be found in younger coal beds flora of the cretaceous period  fig 22 included abundant species that contained relatively more resinous substances than those of the much earlier pennsylvanian period tertiary plants generally were woodier than those of either the pennsylvanian or the cretaceous periods in addition floral communities varied from location to location even within the same time period these changes in plant species resulted in small changes in nutrient requirements the result is that geologically younger coals may have different mineral matter compositions than older coals biological and chemical processesonce plant debris has been deposited in a peat swamp it is subjected to degradation and decomposition by microbial action oxidation and biogeochemical processes these processes are pervasive and to a large extent determine the character of any resultant coal the processes which operate on microbiological and microchemical levels are constantly changing and therefore are difficult to characterize what is known is that 1 the degradation processes are carried out by oxygen from the atmosphere and various microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi and 2 the processes are moderated by the acidity or alkalinity of the available water when the oxygen in the peat has been depleted anaerobic bacteria such as those responsible for fermentation continue the process of degradation although pervasive the process of plant decomposition is also selective in that different plant parts degrade at different rates the most resistant parts such as bark cuticle spores ligninrich wood and charcoal fusinized peat are the parts most often retained in coal as macerals when standing water covers fallen plant matter atmospheric oxidation is halted soon thereafter biochemical change slows to a virtual halt once plant matter is converted to peat and is buried further substantial changes depend more on increases in temperature and pressure than on oxidation and biochemical processes the acidity or alkalinity of peat swamp water may also control the rate and amount of change that takes place usually the more acidic the water the more plant matter is preserved because bacterial activity is reduced if their work is carried to completion bacteria and fungi produce co 2 water and ash in effect it is a slowburning process swamp geometry location and climatefrom the late paleozoic to the present two principal types of peat swamps have existed planar topogenous and domed ombrogenous  fig 23  each has unique floral characteristics that affect the quality of the resulting coal the planar peat swamp generally develops in areas of seasonal rainfall mainly in lowlying areas and depends on a high groundwater table for its continued existence the resulting peat deposit often has an undulating bottom and a flat top because it forms in lowlying areas the planar swamp is subject to periodic flooding which results in the introduction of extraneous mineral matter such as clay silt and sand this sediment brings in nutrients but may also add impurities to any resulting coal in extreme cases the sediment may bury the swamp which results in the termination of peat formation the domed peat swamp develops in areas that receive substantial rainfall during most of the year in this environment new plants grow above fallen plants which decay very slowly because the swamp like a sponge remains saturated with water this process gradually allows the top of the swamp to rise above the surrounding topography the result is a peat deposit that has a raised or domed surface the dome prevents or limits the extent of flooding of the swamp and thereby prevents the introduction of mud silt and sand except around the fringes new plants depend on dead ones for their nutrients thus depleting the earlier deposited peat of mineral matter the flora become stunted and restricted to plants that can survive in a mineralpoor acidic soil as a result domed peat tends to contain much less mineral matter than planar peat and the resulting coals are purer a peat deposit may have originated as either the planar or the domed type and then due to a change in the climate or topography or both may transform into the other type and even back again  fig 23  the resulting coal beds may be composites of the two types these conditions make determining the quality of the composite coal beds difficult the geographic location and climate of the precursor peat swamp also affect coal quality at present swamps are located in tropical temperate and cool climates near coastlines and inland beside rivers and within river deltas and in upland areas this wide variety of geographic locations and climates in which swamps develop was most likely the case at least as far back as the devonian period  fig 19  peat swamps located close to rivers or within river deltas suffer the possibility of periodic flooding and the introduction of large amounts of mineral matter swamps along coastlines while not as easily subjected to river flooding may be affected by offshore or coastal storms that wash sediment over offshore bars and beaches into the swamps behind them the added mineral matter may be disseminated in the peat may occur as layers in the peat or may cause peat formation to stop discrete layers of mineral matter in coal beds are called partings  fig 24  climate which to some extent depends on geography affects the growing season and the amount of rainfall that a swamp receives and therefore helps determine the kind of peat that will eventually form thick extensive coal beds generally are thought to have originated as large peat swamps in warm humid and tropical to subtropical regions cecil 1990 for example extensive thick some up to 50 ft peat deposits have been accumulating on the coastal areas of the islands of indonesia principally sumatra fig 7a and borneo as well as others neuzil and others 1993 those areas are in warm everwet climatic zones extensive peat deposits currently are forming in the florida everglades but the climate there is much more variable than that of borneo southern florida has periodic rainfall and extended dry periods that allow the surface peat to dry out and oxidize or even burn off resulting in a relatively thin deposit other modern peat deposits form in a wide variety of climatic conditions two additional examples are provided the vasjugankojev swamp in siberian russia which is a notoriously cold region is described by cameron and others 1989 as at an area of approximately 21000 mi 2 the largest peatland in the world however even though the region is cold the location of the swamp is low flat and wet and part of the year is conducive to adequate plant growth while the coldness of the rest of the year serves to protect much of the plant matter from decay no thickness of peat in this swamp was reported a swamp on great cranberry island maine also described by cameron and others 1989 is another example of a swamp located in a cool temperate climate this swamp formed during the recent past as sea level rose and built up a beach ridge approximately 11 to 12 ft high a lake which was formed behind the rising beach ridge slowly filled with peat as the beach rose the resultant peat deposit is relatively small less than 250 acres but it reaches thicknesses of as much as 27 ft whether either of these modern peat deposits will ever become a coal bed cannot now be determined however research on modern peat deposits wherever they are located and under whatever climatic conditions they are deposited may help in finding additional highquality coal deposits in older rocks mineral matterthe living plants in a peat swamp absorb mineral matter from 1 the soil they grow in 2 dissolved mineral matter in the water of the swamp and 3 introduced mineral matter such as waterborne or windborne sediment or volcanic ash some of the dust and ash may be dissolved in the swamp water and serve to support plant growth as described in the discussion of domed peat deposits or they may occur as disseminated grains in the peat or as discrete layers called partings  fig 24  partings may be paper thin or they may be several feet thick in the case of the planar swamp dust or ash will further dilute the organic matter composing the peat thus raising the mineralmatter content or creating partings in the case of the domed swamp however these sediments may add enough new nutrients to the swamp to prolong its life and produce a thicker peat and ultimately a thicker coal bed volcanic ash and some types of dust are rich in the nutrients required for vigorous plant growth throughout geologic time the peat swamps that were not destroyed by erosion or oxidation were buried by sediments which depending on their source affected the mineralmatter content of the resultant coal in different ways in general riverborne sediments tend to be richer in some elements such as iron whereas oceanborne sediments tend to be richer in other elements such as sulfur in many coals some of the mineral matter was introduced by epigenetic low temperature mineralization after the bed was formed  fig 11  in this process the minerals were introduced into fractures called cleat see below under coalification and along bedding planes in the coal bed as ions in moving water and were deposited when the water lost its ability to maintain the mineralforming ions in solution this could occur when the ionbearing water entered a different temperature and or chemical environment epigenetic minerals commonly include pyrite calcite siderite and kaolinite and in rare cases sphalerite and galena see table 1 for compositions of these minerals epigenetic mineralization estimated to have been introduced during the permian period into coal beds of older pennsylvanian age see fig 19  is particularly notable in coals of the midcontinent region of the u s cobb 1979 brannon and others 1997 coalificationfrom the time the peat is buried it goes through a series of chemical and physical changes called coalification which is the process that produces coals of increasing rank  fig 17  coalification is a continuing process involving increases in both temperature and pressure resulting from burial in the earth burial is a process that may happen very slowly or relatively rapidly depending on the speed and magnitude of the geologic forces operating on the region increasing temperature is considered more important than increasing pressure in promoting coalification higher temperatures eliminate moisture and volatile elements and therefore help produce coals of higher rank and higher heat calorific value higher temperatures are generally associated with deeper burial in the earth although proximity to an unusual source of heat such as a volcano could produce similar effects when increases in depth of burial or temperature no longer occur coalification slows and then ceases unless another source of higher heat affects the coal thereafter the coal will remain at the same rank even if it is raised up again either by tectonic uplift or erosion of overlying sediments or both into a region of much lower temperature or pressure once the coal is exposed to weathering oxidation however it is slowly reduced to ash coalification is a baking process in the earth under pressure as it proceeds it produces coal of increasing hardness and calorific value and results in a reduction of tar oil and gas coalification affects not only the organic matter in coal but the mineral matter as well as coalification proceeds organic matter which is relatively rich in water oxygen and hydrogen gradually loses those constituents and becomes relatively enriched in fixed carbon some of the hydrogen and carbon are converted to methane gas ch 4 in the process changes that occur to the mineral matter during coalification are less well understood during coalification clay minerals may become more refractory that is less affected by heat and chemicals and the elements in other minerals may become rearranged making them more crystalline although deeper burial and therefore higher temperatures implies greater age coals of approximately the same geologic age may exhibit a wide range in rank depending on their geologic histories for example pennsylvanian coals in the eastern u s figs 4  19 range in rank from anthracite in easternmost pennsylvania to highvolatile c bituminous coal in western illinois and iowa coals beds in what is now eastern pennsylvania were subjected to strong mountainbuilding forces during the late paleozoic when the appalachian mountains were formed during this time the beds were forced deep into the earth into zones of high heat and then were compressed into tight folds in contrast the coals to the west in what are now the states including western pennsylvania ohio indiana illinois and iowa were subjected to lesser depths of burial and little or no mountainbuilding forces during the process of coalification sets of roughly parallel closely spaced fractures cleat form in the coal cleat tend to form in two sets at right angles to one another one set the face cleat is dominant while the other set the butt cleat may be only poorly developed  fig 25  cleat are generally well developed in bituminous coals lignites and subbituminous coals both less well coalified generally exhibit only incipient cleat anthracite in eastern pennsylvania generally does not exhibit cleat because strong mountainbuilding forces welded the coal back together into solid massive beds for a thorough discussion see damberger 1991 determining the quality of coalby now it should be clear why coal is such a complex and heterogeneous material the interplay of the many factors that affect the peat and the resulting coal affects its composition but the composition is never quite static because it is subject to continuing change in the past coal was simply dug up and burned or turned into coke with little concern for its quality as long as it made a hot fire did not have too much ash or sulfur and would ship long distances without turning to dust now we know that a complete understanding of coal quality is important in order to address environmental or industrial concerns such as 1 so x and hazardous air pollutants elements such as mercury and selenium in hot flue gases 2 boiler slagging and fouling 3 the high costs of fluegas desulfurization 4 the disposal of scrubber sludge ash and co 2 5 the development of cleancoal technologies and 6 the promotion of coal as a source for synthetic oil and gas many techniques currently exist for studying coal quality some analytical techniques such as the ones used to determine coal rank moisture ash yield sulfur content and volatile matter are highly standardized coal mines electric utilities the coke industry and commercial analytical labs commonly employ these tests many of the standards for these techniques as well as the standards for precision in their use are published by astm international 2002 and are widely followed by the coal industry in the u s research scientists studying coal quality use not only the results of astmbased analyses in their work but also other generally accepted techniques that have not been standardized by the astm however once research shows that a new technique is useful and accepted by the coal industry standards may be developed for its application research is currently underway to improve the existing techniques used by coal scientists for analyzing coal to adapt some techniques used in the analysis of other materials and to develop new analytical techniques procedures approved by the astm and their purposes are given in table 2 a list of analytical techniques currently used in coalquality research at the usgs and their purposes is given in table 3 the two suites of analyses serve different purposes the results of the astm suite of analyses allow coalusing industries to directly compare coals of differing qualities which enables them to select a coal that is best suited to their needs these results also allow coal research scientists to study the geologic history of a coal bed through levels of rank and ash sulfur and moisture contents the suite of analyses used by the usgs was developed to 1 aide in the search for valuable mineral byproducts 2 develop methods to aide in determining the origins and correlations of individual coal beds and 3 analyze for the locations amounts and affinities of elements that are known to or might pose a hazard to health the results of both sets of analyses performed on a sample of bituminous coal from alabama are provided in table 4 the results of astm

v240w06y59yb11zn110zr2401 usgs ash slightly different from astm ash because of different temperatures used in ashing furnaces sampling techniquesmost analyses of coal for both standard and research purposes are conducted on carefully collected samples of whole coal coal samples are taken from a variety of places—individual coal beds in place coalmine conveyor systems trucks train cars or stockpiles—depending on the needs of the sampling and analytical programs the goal of this process is to collect a sample that will be as representative as possible of the coal bed or other source from which it is taken in order to produce reliable results from testing programs sampling must be done very carefully samples must be taken without contamination from extraneous material and location and orientation must be documented there are also a few techniques for analyzing coal beds in place geophysical logging is conducted in drill holes during exploration and mine planning programs this technique measures electrical resistivity transmissivity of sound inherent electrical properties such as selfpotential and the reaction of coal to bombardment by atomic particles such as neutrons wood and others 1983 these methods accurately identify coal beds and their boundaries and help determine whether a coal bed merits additional exploration and mining however they are only good for an approximate analysis of coal quality channel and drillhole core samples are two of the most common types of samples used for characterizing a coal bed a channel sample is taken from a freshly exposed coal bed usually in an underground or surface coal mine by cutting a 2 to 4in channel into the bed from top to bottom and collecting all the coal from the channel  fig 26  drillhole core samples  fig 27 are taken from subsurface coal beds where the coring bit does the cutting if the coal bed is divided horizontally into benches individual beds of coal separated by mineral partings or if the bed is layered by distinct types of coal then the benches or beds may be sampled separately which allows for a more detailed characterization of the individual parts the astm recently has published standards for the collection of channel and core coal samples astm international 2002 the number of channel or core samples taken depends on how well the coal bed needs to be characterized if any two samples of the same bed show considerable variation in quality between them then more samples may be taken from the area between the two initial samples however cost may be a factor in the decision to collect more samples the purpose of the analysis often determines the type of sample that is collected if the purpose is to characterize a stock of already mined coal then gross samples may be taken at regularly or randomly spaced intervals from the stockpile coal car or conveyor belt if the purpose is to examine some specific property of a coal bed then a sample of only a small part of the bed may be taken if the purpose of the sample is to study some directionally controlled characteristic such as the orientation of mineral grains the sample must be labeled to show top and bottom and in some cases compass directions for some types of analyses for example by either petrographic or scanningelectron microscope figs 11 13b 13c 14  small blocks of coal are cut out of larger samples and one side is polished and examined this technique is used when it is necessary to see the microscopic details of the types distributions and arrangements of the macerals and minerals in a coal sample when a coal sample arrives at the lab it is crushed unless it is to be examined in block form and its particles are thoroughly mixed to ensure that the sample is homogeneous the crushed sample then is divided into appropriately sized subsamples for each analytical technique to be used analysisthe primary reason for analyzing coal is to determine whether it will meet the needs of a specific application or to characterize the general quality of the coal for future reference for instance coal may be analyzed to determine how much sulfur or other element is present its form and how it is distributed if the sulfur is present in discrete pyrite grains then much of it may be cleaned out of the coal but if it is organically bound then the sulfur may be released only by burning by using a solvent or by employing a bacteriologic technique although the latter two techniques are still largely experimental if the coal has a high organic sulfur content then it may have to be mixed or blended with a coal of lower sulfur content in order to meet sulfur emissions standards or the sulfur may have to be cleaned out of the flue gas by fluegas desulfurization fgd which is an expensive procedure similarly analysis may determine whether a trace element such as arsenic may be eliminated from a coal by washing or whether it must be trapped in the flue gas finally in extreme cases analysis may determine that the coal cannot be used in general the coalmining and coalconsuming industries determine coal quality for immediate or nearterm use whereas federal and state governments analyze coal to 1 characterize large areas of unmined coal resources for future reference 2 to support policy decisions related to future coal use and 3 to supply federal and state regulatory agencies with information about the quality or special characteristics of future coal supplies such as the presence amounts and modes of occurrence of sulfur and potentially toxic trace elements figure 28 shows a coal scientist at work identifying coal macerals and coal rank in a polished sample of coal using a highpowered reflectedlight microscope coal samples may be received at the laboratory in a variety of conditions accordingly analytical results may be reported in a variety of ways depending on the condition of the samples when received and the use of the analysis some samples arrive in a fresh condition not long after sampling these may be analyzed without further processing except grinding and mixing the analytical results for these samples are reported on an asreceived basis some samples arrive dried out due to long storage transportation over long distances or mishandling the results of analyses on driedout samples are reported on a dry basis the opposite conditions may also occur if the sample arrives wet because of excess moisture in the sample that may or may not be present in the coal bed in this case the analyses may be reported on a moist basis analyses also may be reported on a mineralmatterfree or dry mineralmatterfree basis for use in calculating coal rank because rank is a function only of the maturity of the organic matter mineralmatterfree means that the amount of mineral matter in the sample has been subtracted from the total analytical results to provide only the amount that is organic dry mineralmatterfree means that the sample was received in a dry or nearly dry state or was dried out before an analysis was made an analysis on a mineralmatterfree basis also may be used for comparison with the results of an asreceived analysis of runofmine coal as it comes from the mine if there is to be further processing such as coal cleaning runofmine coal frequently contains 1 large amounts of mineral matter from partings in the coal bed 2 rocks from above and below the coal bed that are mined along with the coal 3 minerals that fill veins in the coal bed and 4 mineral matter dispersed in the coal such as pyrite grains mineral matter in runofmine coal may cause the coal to exceed the ash and sulfur limits set by contract requirements and environmental regulations a mineralmatterfree analysis may indicate whether or not it will be worthwhile to clean the coal however the need for cleaning depends on the intended use of the coal and normal cleaning practices may not bring a coal to a completely mineralfree condition most chemical analyses require the destruction of the coal sample in order to determine calorific value volatile matter and mineralmatter content destruction is achieved by burning the coal sample in a hightemperature furnace although that procedure is fine for determining the calorific value of coal it is not suitable for retention of some of its volatile inorganic elements such as mercury subjecting the sample to a process called low temperature ashing in which the sample is exposed to highfrequency radiation in a highoxygen atmosphere permits the organic matter to be driven off while preserving most of the mineral matter nevertheless some of the very volatile inorganic elements such as chlorine mercury or selenium may be lost in this process and are best measured in wholecoal samples by xray fluorescence or other techniques most microscopic and microprobe techniques require wholecoal samples because the objective is to determine the interrelations between the constituent parts of the coal organic geochemistrybecause coal is principally an organic substance organic geochemistry is an important factor in the study of the origin structure quality and utilization of coal determining the organic matter in coal is necessary for studying 1 the organic structure and the organic sulfur compounds in coal 2 modern peatforming swamps as analogues of ancient peatforming swamps 3 the potential for coal gasification and liquefaction and 4 the effects of coal mining and coal use on surface water ground water and air quality recent advances in analytical instrumentation have greatly aided organic geochemical studies of coal most coals consist of a mechanical mixture of two principal organic components 1 resinlike aliphatic organic matter of uncertain origin that is the specific plant structures have been destroyed during the coalification process and 2 benzenelike aromatic organic matter derived from wood tissues lignin using solidstate 13 c nuclearmagneticresonance nmr spectroscopy coals now are routinely classified based on their aromatic content organic geochemical studies of modern peat attempt to relate processes occurring in modern environments to those that occurred in ancient peat swamps other commonly used analytical techniques such as gas chromatographymass spectrometry the electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope are used to study the organic sulfur concentration and distribution in coals so far these studies seem to indicate that most of thesulfur in organic compounds in coal is present at the edges of the organic molecules this finding may aid the development of effective desulfurization procedures for coal containing large amounts of organically bound sulfur the energy produced and the reactivity of coal during burning is determined by its chemical and physical structure through computerassisted molecular design scientists can now construct two and threedimensional models of organic compounds in coal and determine the arrangements of the elements in various model structures organic geochemical studies of modern peat deposits attempt to relate processes occurring in modern environments to those that occurred in ancient peat swamps such studies serve as a mechanism for a better understanding of and an ability to predict coal quality by providing insight into the early stages of coal formation for example a geochemical analysis of an ombrogenous peat which is easy to sample greatly enables the ability to predict the quality of other coal deposits that originated as ombrogenous peat deposits but that are much more difficult and costly to sample mineralmatter chemistrystudies of mineral matter in coal are performed by a variety of analytical techniques the principal techniques are analytical chemistry xray spectroscopy scanningelectron microscopy petrography and mineralogical studies  table 2  two newer techniques 1 inductively coupled plasma atomicemission spectrometry icpaes and 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icpms have been applied to coal analysis with excellent results and are worth a brief description using these techniques a sample of coal ash is first decomposed with various acids and put into solution the solution is then aspirated into a flame plasma which energizes the atoms of the different elements present in the solution to generate characteristic wavelengths of radiation the spectrum produced by the radiation is then measured in a spectrometer the data from the spectrometer are fed into a computer where the results are compared to standard samples and the concentration of each element in the sample is calculated the two icp techniques simultaneously and quantitatively analyze about 50 different inorganic elements which is a large increase in the efficiency of coal analysis the astm recently has adopted icpaes and icpms techniques as industry standard methods for analyzing coals for inorganic elements astm international 2002 microscopic studies of coal petrography are used to identify the constituents in coal and how they are arranged and to provide knowledge of the maceral composition and distribution coal petrographers may assess the rank of a coal by measuring the intensity of light reflected from the vitrinite macerals in a polished surface of a coal sample the higher the reflectivity the higher the rank in some instances however petrographic study is not adequate to characterize all of the coal constituents for example if mineral matter such as pyrite exists as extremely small discrete grains or if it is located inside plant cells which are also extremely small then identification becomes difficult with an optical microscope in these cases a scanningelectron microscope is used to study minute particles of mineral material figure 14 is a photomicrograph taken with a scanningelectron microscope of plant cells in coal containing minute grains of pyrite in this case chemical and mineralogic analyses had already determined the presence of pyrite but the photomicrograph allows the pyrite to be studied in greater detail this information could be used to determine whether the coal must be ground into a powder that is fine enough to liberate such finegrained pyrite an expensive process conclusionsalthough much is known about coal quality much also remains to be learned to this end research on coal quality is being conducted in both the public and private sectors current studies encompass all aspects of the origin burial history and composition of coal in order to understand the various factors involved in determining coal quality such as how and where to find the right coal for a specific use and how to clean coal to make its use more environmentally and industrially acceptable in the past the only consideration given to coal quality was whether coal lumps held together during shipping burned easily to produce a hot fire and didnt produce too much ash today however concerns about human health the environment energy demands and the supply of certain raw materials have broadened our concept of coal quality and our need to know much more about the origins nature and effects of coal quality an extensive evaluation of coal quality must be central to coal use whatever coal is used for whether for the direct production of energy chemicals synthetic fuels or the recovery of useful minerals and whatever problems and solutions accompany that use depend on the quality of the coal additional sophisticated multidisciplinary research on coal quality is required for the future the results will help make it possible for society to continue to benefit from the good qualities of coal and to make progress in avoiding the undesirable affects of coal use in the near term the most immediate advancements related to coalquality research appear to be improvements in the efficiency of coal use including more efficient production of synthetic fuels and the development of methods to best understand and thus control the less desirable components in coal that have the potential to contribute to environmental degradation and adverse health effects in the longer term the recovery of useful substances from coal such as iron silver sulfur and zinc as well as organic chemicals gypsum and ash should be an exciting area for research related to coal quality coal quality and public healthby robert b finkelman prior to the widespread adoption of selective mining procedures and pollutioncontrol technology human health had been affected by sulfur and particulates emitted from coal combustion this section describes several examples of how organic compounds and trace elements are still affecting the health of people in europe asia and america the inorganic and in some cases organic constituents in coal may have profound effects on the health of those people burning coal in their homes or living near coal deposits coal mines or coalburning power plants trace elements such as arsenic as emitted from coalburning power plants in europe and asia have been shown to cause severe health problems water leaching of organic compounds from lignites may be the cause of a kidney disease that has taken the lives of more than 100000 people in the balkans widespread health problems may be caused by domestic coal combustion in developing countries millions of people suffer from fluorosis thousands from arsenism in the southwestern u s many members of the navajo nation are dependent on coal as their primary source of energy many navajo suffer from chronic respiratory problems that are attributed to emissions from the burning of coal in their hogans a better knowledge of coalquality parameters may help to minimize some of these health problems information on the concentrations and distributions of potentially toxic elements in coal may help us to avoid those parts of a coal deposit having undesirably high concentrations of these elements information on the modes of occurrence of these elements and the textural relations of the minerals and macerals in which they occur may help us to anticipate the behavior of the potentially toxic components during coal cleaning combustion weathering and leaching coal quality characterization therefore offers coal scientists opportunities to contribute to important societal needs such as improved public health polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahsbalkan endemic nephropathybalkan endemic nephropathy ben is a potentially fatal degenerative kidney disease common in parts of former yugoslavia bulgaria and romania an article in a popular science magazine attributed more than 100000 deaths to ben since it was recognized as a distinct disease in 1956 zimmerman 1983 intensive medical research had failed to identify the cause of ben or to explain why it occurs in clusters of villages along river valleys in the early 1990s u s geological survey usgs researchers identified a link between the occurrence of ben and the distribution of pliocene lignites which are the youngest most chemically reactive coals in the balkans region feder and others 1991 they suggested that ben is attributable to ingestion of organic compounds from well water that had been in contact with pliocene lignites ground water in the endemic villages was found to be highly concentrated in organic chemicals such as pahs they also suggested that the hydrocarbons some of which were known carcinogens were the cause of ben further evidence was found from laboratory experiments using distilled water to leach samples of pliocene lignites from yugoslavia usgs researchers extracted a suite of pahs similar to that found in the well water of the endemic villages orem and others 1999 ben also may exist in turkey and other countries turkey has extensive nearsurface deposits of pliocene lignites and many turkish villagers rely solely on well water for their drinking needs if these wells are drilled into the pliocene lignite aquifers or into aquifers in contact with the lignites ben could result from drinking the water information on the concentrations and distributions of potentially toxic elements in coal may help us to avoid those parts of a coal deposit that have undesirably high concentrations of those elements lung cancerpahs released during unvented coal combustion in homes in xuan wei county china have been cited as the primary cause for the highly elevated incidence of lung cancer there the pah levels in the homes burning smokey coal are at industrial levels resulting in a lung cancer mortality rate five times the national average of china mumford and others 1987 trace elementsconcerns have been expressed in the united states and elsewhere over the release of as be cd cl co cr f hg mn ni pb sb se and u during the burning of coal recent data from the u s environmental protection agency epa 1996 indicate that traceelement emissions from coalburning power plants that use coal with relatively low to moderate traceelement concentrations or that have efficient pollution control devices may not present a significant health risk their data indicate that the risk of cancer from trace elements inhaled by humans who live or work near power plants is less than 1 in 1 million elsewhere in the world trace elements emitted from coalburning power plants have been shown to cause severe health problems in czechoslovakia children living in the vicinity of a power plant that burned higharsenic lignite about 1000 parts per million ppm on a dry basis suffered significant hearing loss that was attributed to arsenic poisoning from the powerplant emissions bencko and symon 1977 perhaps the most widespread health problems are caused by domestic coal combustion in developing countries millions of people suffer from fluorosis and thousands suffer from arsenosis caused by coal combustion in china selenium and mercury poisoning also have been attributed to domestic coal combustion in china adsorption of fluorine by corn dried over highfluorine 200 ppm coal fires is the probable cause of extensive dental and skeletal fluorosis in southwest china the problem is compounded by the use of clay as a binder for making briquettes that clay typically is a highfluorine about 900 ppm residue from the intense leaching of the limestone substrate in guizhou province china the practice of drying chili peppers over higharsenic coal fires has led to thousands of cases of arsenic poisoning finkelman and others 1999 the contaminated chili peppers commonly are used for cooking and thus become the principal source of arsenic poisoning one coal sample from this region analyzed at the u s geological survey laboratory contained 35000 ppm arsenic on an asreceived basis chili peppers dried over the higharsenic coal fires contain more than 500 ppm arsenic fresh chili peppers contain less than 1 ppm arsenic arsenosis which results from ingestion of the chili peppers tainted with arsenic from the mineralized coal also has led to severe skin cancers in the affected population finkelman and others 1999 nearly 500 cases of human selenosis in southwest china have been attributed to the use of seleniumrich carbonaceous shales known locally as stone coal zheng 1992 the stone coals contain as much as 8390 ppm selenium the selenosis is attributed to the practice of using the combustion ash as a soil amendment this introduces large amounts of selenium to the soil and results in selenium uptake by the crops coal combustion is considered to be the largest manmade source of mercury in the environment although there are no confirmed reports that mercury from emissions directly impacts human health mercury may contribute to health problems through bioaccumulation in the food chain mercury a portion of which is derived from coal combustion is deposited in lakes and rivers and can be converted to toxic methylmercury which then accumulates and becomes enriched in fish and birds cases of mercury poisoning have been documented in people who eat contaminated fish for prolonged periods both in the united states and abroad pregnant women and subsistence fishermen are particularly vulnerable a rare occurrence of chronic thallium poisoning was reported from guizhou province china zhou and liu 1985 the source of the thallium poisoning appears to be from vegetables grown in soil developed over a mercurythallium rich mining slag most symptoms such as hair loss are typical of thallium poisoning however loss of vision in several patients was considered to be unique mineralogical analysis of coal used in the homes of the patients with visual impairment revealed abundant mercury minerals chemical analysis of a sample of coal being used in guizhou province china indicated the mercury concentration to be 55 ppm finkelman 1999 about 200 times the average mercury concentration found in u s coals summarycoal scientists and technologists are ideally positioned to help minimize health problems due to coal combustion by providing information on coal quality information on the concentrations and distributions of potentially toxic elements in coal may assist people dependent on local coal sources to avoid those areas of a coal deposit having undesirably high concentrations of toxic compounds information on the modes of occurrence of potentially toxic elements and the textural relations of the minerals and macerals in which they occur may help us to anticipate the behavior of the potentially toxic components during
