sears sumthin the matter with that  we were just asking wasnt it sold in sears similar to isnt valspar sold at lowes the real issue is using the product itself and maybe in 1967 at age 18 if i was uninformed enough to buy lucite i may have been uninformed enough to have bought it at sears back then sears was still a good place for many things i still have many craftsman tools bought in that era

posts my photos lucite interior and exterior architectural paint was originally a du pont product i remember it was heavily advertised as a diy product in the 60s and 70s the advertising slant was by using such an easy to apply and cleanup paint there would be ample time left for the homeowner to enjoy his weekend the product had its own jingle lucite turns you loose another instance in the long history of the selling out and ruination of the painting profession by paint manufaturers last edited by dosgris 08012009 at 0600 pm
