fluoride is incorrect excess fluoride strengthens the outer tooth enamel and reduces dental caries which food exchange is the best source of zinc iron and copper in regards to the concept of bioavilability meat which nutrients consumed in excess may pose a risk of kidney damage and other soft tissues such as the blood vessels calcium and vitamin dwho has the lesser need for iron as specified by the rda adult males which vitamin and mineral combination provides the best possible nutritional defense against the development of osteoporosis d and calcium which of the following is true about mineral balance in response to short term or under ingestion of a given mineral humans will adapt by excreting more or absorbing more respectively of that mineral which of the following statements discussing coppers effect on the human body is incorrect copper is needed for the absorption of calcium from the intestinal tract function of iodine used as a component in the formation of thyroid hormone function of magnesium component of over 300 enzymes function of vanadium being studied for its insulin like effect on glucose metabolism function of copper component in enzyme that catabolizes free radicals function of phosphorus major mineral in bone second only to calcium in quanity which of the following guidelines should be followed when a person decides to take supplemental minerals do not exceed the rda or ai levels avoid taking high doses of only one mineral since it may reduce the absorption of another mineral high doses of a mineral such as iron taken for medical reasons should be monitored by a physician all the abovewho has the greatest need for dietary calcium and thus the highest ai youth and adolescents age 918 years 1300 mgwhich of the following statements of trace minerals is false mercury is essential for carbohydrate metabolism excessive intake of iron can lead to a condition called hemochromatosis which is damage to which organ in the

in individuals with certain diseases and in those who have used antacid compounds for long periods of time true one symptoms of magnesium deficiency is muscle cramping which may occur because the low levels of magnesium are not able to block the stimulating effect of calcium on muscle contraction true unlike zinc which serves as a cofactor for many enzymes iron only functions as a component of heme in hemoglobin and myoglobin for oxygen transport and delivery to cells false the bioavilability of iron is so low that to replace the 15 mg of iron that is lost from the body daily 15 mg would need to be consumed true zinc is a component of enzymes that are involved in the major pathways of energy metabolism protein synthesis the growth process and wound healing true low serum ferritin levels do not necessarily reflect low iron levels in the muscles false
