branding fundamentals december 27 2013format kindle edition verified purchase taylor does a nice job covering a large amount of basic marketing strategy in a clear and concise manner the campaign examples do focus primarily on brands from the uk as taylor obviously has the most experience working in this market the book does a great job bringing to light the major issue why most marketing is poorineffective in driving purchase is because most marketing professionals tenures are too short to impact consumer memory structure this is a strong thesis illustrated with interesting real world examples would have liked to learn more inside information on how these iconic campaigns gained internal organizational alignment as a majority of marketing professionals incentives are focused on not growing the core but the cycle of new product launches and silo marketing taylor coaches against maybe he is saving that for the sequel overall would recommend for a quick primer on solid marketing

the core how to focus on your core business for brand success by david taylor is full of advise suggestions examples case histories and inspiration too many businesses dont focus on what works for them and find themselves running on empty trying to invent too many brand new things what many companies fail to do is reinvent a product that already has a proven tract record maybe update the successful product or remarket a product start a new marketing company to reintroduce a product to consumers thinking about package design how well does the public identify your product or company

stars very focused on large company selling their own branded physical products may 27 2013format hardcover vine customer review of free product  whats this this book is really focused on a large national company with their own brand of physical products most of them actually things you could buy at a supermarket the book does not deal very much specifically with a business that sells services or for a retailer that is selling other companies products its also not geared toward smaller businesses that have a more local scope also the authors experience is in the u k and that is where his examples are drawn from the principles are still valid but as an american reader many of the company examples did not come with the intuitive understanding that more familiar companies would have there was information of value to be gleaned from this book but its more narrow in breadth of focus than the title implies good to great was a book of much more value with a small 10employee business retailing others products while selling our own services read more comment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse the lunar staff vine voice50 out of 5 stars
