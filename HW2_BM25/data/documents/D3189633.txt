sinus infections they are usually found when an xray or scan is done of the sinuses symptoms are usually nonexistent but in some cases include chronic sinus infections dizziness headaches and facial pain treatment is usually unnecessary if the cyst isn’t causing a problem if there are chronic sinus issues sinus or nasal surgery may need to be performed to remove the cyst and reconstruct the area to prevent reoccurrence experiences of others“i was having severe dizzy spells that led to fainting i went to the emergency room and they said it could be fluid in my middle ear from sinus issues but this was the worst episode i had a ct scan done and they found a mucous retention cyst in my right sinus i received a referral to a neurologist the neurologist said the sinuses were not draining properly and referred me to an ent surgeon the ent said this was the cause of my dizziness it was happening when i bent over and then lifted my head back up the ent found a really bad sinus infection so he treated me with clindamycin 300 mg three times daily and a nasal steroid this didn’t help my symptoms so i was scheduled for sinus surgery a few weeks after my surgery i felt so much better i was breathing better through my nose and the dizzy spells cleared right up my ent said normally with a cyst they don’t do much of anything but if his patients have symptoms then surgery is recommended”kyle age 34“i went to the doctor for chronic migraine headaches and she ordered a ct scan of my head it showed that i had a mucous retention cyst in my maxillary sinus so my doctor referred me to an ent i was treated with antibiotics and steroids but the headaches didn’t get better i was then referred to a neurologist who said the cyst was most likely not the cause of my migraines i was hoping the antibiotics and steroids would help but the ent said the cyst was not large enough to cause any issues the neurologist ran more tests and didn’t find anything to cause the migraines i was told this is pretty common and was sent away with migraine medication i still think the cyst is causing sinus pressure and if i continue to have issues i will see a different ent for a second opinion”marie age 28
