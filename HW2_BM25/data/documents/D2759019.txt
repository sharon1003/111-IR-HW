tomosynthesis from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search tomosynthesis of a lung with chronic fibrosing pulmonary aspergillosis tomosynthesis also digital tomosynthesis is a method for performing highresolution limitedangle tomography at radiation dose levels comparable with projectional radiography it has been studied for a variety of clinical applications including vascular imaging dental imaging orthopedic imaging mammographic imaging musculoskeletal imaging and chest imaging 1contents  hide 1 history2 reconstruction3 differences from other imaging modalities4

derived from the work of ziedses des plantes who developed methods of reconstructing an arbitrary number of planes from a set of projections though this idea was displaced by the advent of computed tomography tomosynthesis later gained interest as a lowdose tomographic alternative to ct 2reconstruction  edittomosythesis reconstruction algorithms are similar to ct reconstructions in that they are based on performing an inverse radon transform due to partial data sampling with very few projections approximation algorithms have to be used filtered back projection and iterative expectationmaximization algorithms have both been used to reconstruct the data 3reconstruction algorithms for tomosynthesis are different from those of conventional ct because the conventional filtered back projection algorithm requires a complete set of data iterative algorithms based upon expectation maximization are most commonly used but are computationally intensive some manufacturers have produced practical systems using offtheshelf gpus to perform the reconstruction in a few seconds differences from other imaging modalities  editdigital tomosynthesis combines digital image capture and processing with simple tubedetector motion as used in conventional computed tomography ct however though there are some similarities to ct it is a separate technique in ct the sourcedetector makes at least a complete 180degree rotation about the subject obtaining a complete set of data from which images may be reconstructed digital tomosynthesis on the other hand only uses a limited rotation angle eg 1560 degrees with a lower number of discrete exposures eg 751 than ct this incomplete set of projections is digitally processed to yield images similar to conventional tomography with a limited depth of field because the image processing is digital a series of slices at different depths and with different thicknesses can be reconstructed from the same acquisition however since fewer projections are needed than ct to perform the reconstruction radiation exposure and cost are both reduced 4applications  editbreast  edittomosynthesis is food and drug administration fda approved for use in breast cancer screening 5 as of 2016 however it is unclear if its use in screening normal risk women is beneficial or harmful 6digital breast tomosynthesis dbt can provide a higher diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional mammography in dbt like conventional mammography compression is used to improve image quality and decreases radiation dose the laminographic imaging technique dates to the 1930s and belongs to the category of geometric or linear tomography 7because the data acquired are 85  160 micron typical resolution much higher than ct dbt is unable to offer the narrow slice widths that ct offers typically 115 mm however the higher resolution detectors permit very high inplane resolution even if the zaxis resolution is less the primary interest in dbt is in breast imaging as an extension to mammography where it offers better detection rates with little extra increase in radiation 8 9musculoskeletal imaging  edittomosynthesis has a much more limited depth of field than does ct for this reason it likely will not be able to replace ct for the evaluation of the deeper organs of the body however since bones are often near the skin multiple musculoskeletal applications of tomosynthesis have been studied most of which have mostly been used in research with limited use in everyday practice evaluation of fractures  edittomosynthesis has been compared to both radiography and ct for the evaluation of healing fractures especially in the presence of hardware in a study of patients with wrist fractures digital tomosynthesis was shown to enable detection of more fractures than radiography while simultaneously providing lower metal artifact than radiography 4evaluation of erosions in rheumatoid arthritis  edittomosythesis has been compared to radiography with ct as the standard for the detection of erosions associated with rheumatoid arthritis the radiation dose of digital tomosynthesis was very close to that of radiography however tomosynthesis showed sensitivity specificity accuracy positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 80 75 78 76 and 80 compared to radiography were 66 81 74 77 and 71 10 the slight benefit digital tomosynthesis in this application may or may not justify the slightly increased cost of the modality compared to radiography references  edit dobbins james mc
