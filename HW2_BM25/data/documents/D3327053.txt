product the contamination levels are 008–445 μgkg as aflatoxin b 1 and 008–466 μgkg as afs the liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry lc–msms analysis on contaminated samples was conducted for the confirmation of detected aflatoxins the 12 samples which showed aflatoxins by hplcfld were confirmed as aflatoxins by lc–msms previous article next article keywords aflatoxins spices immunoaffinity column hplc–fld lc–msms1 introduction aflatoxins are a group of toxic metabolites produced by species of aspergillus specifically aspergillus flavus aspergillus parasiticus and aspergillus nomius which were found worldwide in air and soil  rustom 1997  they are a significant threat to both human and animal health because they are potent carcinogens mutagens and teratogens  blesa soriano moltó  mañes 2004  aflatoxins are also classified as group 1 carcinogens by the international agency of research on cancer iarc primarily affecting liver  iarc 2002  aflatoxins commonly found are aflatoxin b 1 afb 1  b 2 afb 2  g 1 afg 1  and g 2 afg 2  afb 1 is the most potent of all aflatoxins known to date and is generally found in the highest concentration in food and animal feeds  lee wang allan  kennedy 2004  aflatoxins in various agricultural products can be contaminated when drying of agricultural commodities is delayed or moisture level exceeds critical values for the mold growth during storage of the crops especially spices are usually produced in countries with tropical climates that have high temperature humidity and rainfall  martins martins  bernardo 2001  these climatic conditions are favorable to aflatoxin contamination in recent years the natural occurrence of aflatoxins in spices has been studied by several researchers  zinedine et al 2006 romagnoli menna gruppioni  bergamini 2007 fazekas tar  kovacs 2005 martins et al 2001 aydin erkan baskaya  ciftcioglu 2007  in korea many kinds of spices are commonly used to cook various foods especially koreans prefer red pepper powder that made of red peppers which are generally dried in the sun and open air to that made of mechanical drying process so red pepper powder made of natural dried red pepper is more likely to be contaminated with aflatoxins because of insufficient drying process red pepper paste  gochujang is manufactured from red pepper powder so it is likely to be contaminated with aflatoxins aflatoxin analysis on spice is not simple because of interference of high colored materials that are coextracted with aflatoxins current analytical methods for the determination of aflatoxins include thinlayer chromatography tlc highperformance liquid chromatography hplc and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa  hu zheng zhang  he 2006  although several of these methods achieve low levels of detection in practice they consume large amount of time and solvent and require one or more cleanup steps involving liquid–liquid partition or solidphase extraction  visconti  pascale 1998  as a fast screening method elisa processes good specificity sensitivity and simplicity however it has the possibility of false positives because of crossreaction and interference in the complex matrixes  hu et al 2006 nilüfer  boyacioğlu 2002  several surveys of natural occurrence of aflatoxins were carried out using a monitoring scheme consisting of elisa for rapid screening and hplc for quantification  chun kim ok hwang  chung 2007 kim et al 2001 park kim shon  kim 2002  however these researches did not include the kinds of spice samples sample with high pigment and lipid content makes the aflatoxins analysis difficult because of serious matrix interference therefore a more selective treatment followed by specific purification is required before the analysis the immunoaffinity columns iac which contain antibodies specific to aflatoxins are efficient for the purification of aflatoxins these provide a quick and simple solution to sample cleanup and solve problems of interference that can be happened in adopting other methods in this study we applied the iac method to analyze afs in several spices using hplc with fluorescence detection coupled with immunoaffinity column cleanup step we investigated the contamination of afs in mainly consumed spices commercialized in korea and some samples which were contaminated with afs were confirmed by lc–msms2 materials and method21 sample collection a total of 88 spices and processed spice products samples were collected during the period from may to september 2006 the collected samples are made up of six different kinds of spices red pepper powder 41 samples red pepper paste  gochujang 15 curry 20 ginger products 7 black pepper 2 cinnamon powder 3 commercialized in korea these samples were randomly purchased from different markets in ten cities including gangneung wonju seoul anyang daejeon cheongju gwangju sunchang daegu busan all samples were ground to pine powder and then until the beginning of the analyses the ground samples were stored in a freezer −20 °c22 chemicals and materials the standard stock solutions of afb 1 afb 2 afg 1 and afg 2 with concentration of 3 mgkg were purchased from supelco chemical co immunoaffinity column afla test p was supplied by vicam watertown ma usa acetonitrile and methanol were hplc grade and purchased from merck darmstadt germany and trifluoroacetic acid tfa and formic acid were obtained from sigma chemical co all other inorganic chemicals and organic solvents were of reagent grade or higher23 sample preparation and immunoaffinity column cleanup samples were analyzed with hplc–fluorescence detector fld according to the annual report of korea food and drug administration  lee et al 2005  briefly described as follows each sample was ground into powder then for each powdered sample 25 g of each sample was extracted with 100 ml methanol water 7030 vv containing 1 of sodium chloride by mechanical shaker for 20 min the extract was filtered with filter paper whatman no 1 and 10 ml of filtrate was diluted into 30 ml with deionized water and mixed vigorously this mixture solution 15 ml was then passed through an immunoaffinity column at a flow rate of about 3 mlmin 1 drops washed with water 10 ml at the same flow rate and flushed with air to remove remaining water final elution was accomplished by adding acetonitrile 3 ml onto the column at the same flow rate and flushed with air the eluate was evaporated to dryness by centrifugal concentrator at 40 °c the dry residues were derivatized by adding 200 μl of tfa trifluoroacetic acid allowed to stand for 15 min at the place of protected from direct uv light and then diluted with 800 μl of acetonitrile water 2080 vv this derivatized sample was filtrated with 045 μm membrane filter then transferred into hplc vials for auto injection since aflatoxins are subject to light degradation it must needs to protect analytical work adequately from daylight therefore all the procedures were carried out in subdued light and protected from direct uv light24 analysis of aflatoxins by hplcdetermination of afb 1 afb 2 afg 1 and afg 2 levels in the derivatized samples

powder or chilli powder in turkey aydin et al 2007 reported high levels of afb 1 contamination in red pepper powder with levels of contamination up to 409 μgkg in qatar abdulkadar alali alkildi and aljedah 2004 reported that four samples out of six chilli powder were contaminated with afs in the range of 560–6928 μgkg romagnoli et al 2007 found afs contamination in hot pepper 457 incidence in the range of 057–307 μgkg in italy in curry powder and ginger products martins et al 2001 reported that curry powders were contaminated with afb 1 40 incidence in the range of 1–5 μgkg in portugal in morocco zinedine et al 2006 reported that afb 1 was found in ginger and the average contamination level was 063 μgkg as a result the incidence and levels of aflatoxins found in this study were relatively low as compared to the levels quoted in this literature the incidence of aflatoxins in food is relatively high in tropical and subtropical regions where the warm and humid weather provides optimal conditions for the growth of the molds  rustom 1997  as mentioned above most of countries which were reported high levels of aflatoxin contamination in spices have tropical and subtropical climate on the other hand korea has the temperate climate which has lower temperature and humidity than these of tropical climate therefore the fact that incidence and levels of aflatoxins found in this study were relatively low is probably due to the climate of korea which is less sensitive to afs contamination than that of other countries reported high levels of aflatoxin contamination for confirmation of aflatoxins lc–msms analysis was carried out for each aflatoxin two characteristic fragmentations of the protonated molecular ion m  h  were monitored for afb 1 the parent ion is m  z 313 the product ions were m  z 241 and m  z 269 and for afb 2 the parent ion is m  z 315 the product ions were m  z 259 and m  z 287 for afg 1 the parent ion is m  z 329 the product ions were m  z 242 and m  z 310 and for afg 2 the parent ion is m  z 331 the product ions were m  z 245 and m  z 313 the first and most abundant one was used for quantification while the second one was used as a qualifier in all mrm transitions the dwell time was 01 s fig 1 shows chromatogram of afs standard solution level of 15 μgkg the representative mass chromatogram of red pepper powder sample

image fig 2 lc–esimsms chromatograms obtained in positive ion mode of red pepper powder sample contaminated with afb 1 and afg 1 the residue limit of aflatoxin levels in spices is not established in korea but in the european union aflatoxin levels in several spices are regulated with maximum residue levels that cannot be greater than 5 μgkg for afb 1 and 10 μgkg for afs  commission regulation ec no 4722002  in the result of this study 12 samples out of 88 spices and spice products were contaminated with afs in the range of 008–466 μgkg one red pepper powder contained maximum level of 466 μgkg for afs and 445 μgkg for afb 1 these levels are lower than maximum residue levels in european union therefore it can be concluded that the contaminated levels of the samples such as red pepper powder red pepper paste curry and ginger product may not have any risk on public health however both red pepper products and other spices are likely to be contaminated with aflatoxins during processing and storage stages especially red pepper powder and red pepper paste are one of the favorite spices and consumed continuously in korea afs contamination in spices could be a serious problem even at low levels therefore the regular monitoring of these spices will be needed continuously in korea acknowledgement this work is supported by research grants from the korea food and drug administration 2006
