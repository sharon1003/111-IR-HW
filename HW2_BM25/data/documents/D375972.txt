between the consumer and the brand by immersing them in a fun and memorable experience if a brand event stirs genuine positive emotions within people then they are more likely to associate those emotions with that brand which is more effective than just showing them a facebook ad or something occasionally the line blurs between experiential marketing and a straightforward pr stunt but i’m not

teeth as well as encouraging people to think more about sensitivity and its impact on their lives‘the great sensitivity test’ was setup near london’s tower bridge consisting of three different zones

purely to the massive popularity of game of thrones or this pr stunt is debateable uk store sleepover in the uk ikea hosted a sleepover in its essex store in response to a facebook fan group called ‘i

barclaycardrichard i did debate whether or not to include that one but having read various articles and had discussions around what defines experiential marketing i think it just about fits the bill one could argue that watching the event live on tv and being part of the overall buzz and excitement around the stratos jump means it can be defined as experiential marketingover 3 years ago olivier i think you forgot pepsis  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgo9rf9gm yp mover 3 years ago gregorydavid red bull really really really really isnt experiential marketing its content marketing because it created content which is the bit that people as you point out gathered round to watch the only way that its experiential marketing if it was one very expensive way to sell red bull to felix baumgartner i hope they converted him i wouldnt say that the mountain dew example was particularly interesting innovative or successful either its just handing out samples albeit an awful lot of samplesover 3 years ago zara nethersole digital production manager at world vision im with gregory and richard i dont think you can class the stratos jump as being experiential  by that logic all of the big super bowl ads would be experiential because you watch them with the same anticipation as everyone else to see whos nailed them and who hasnt  anything that drives buzz on social media would be experiential i would define experiential as anything you can physically interact with which rules out anything that sits purely online or on tv or in a newspaper etc over 3 years ago louis hav these are some fascinating
