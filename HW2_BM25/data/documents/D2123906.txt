new “oshpd preapproved” seismicrated productsposted on september 25 2015by hooley think about something for a minute …as a specifying engineer focused on healthcare facilities or as a hospital administrator or facility engineer … are you certain that the imaging and treatment equipment installed will continue to operate flawlessly after an earthquake do you know for certain that all equipment is seismicrated what about the electrical support equipment such as transformers panel boards generators … even electrical power quality products while we can’t guarantee the seismic integrity of frontend patientfacing equipment that responsibility lies with the oem … we can give you the assurance that our power conditioning voltage regulators installed in front of critical patientcare equipment will be 100 operational after a defined seismic eventfrom approved seismic data calculations to shaketable testing the california office of statewide health planning and development “oshpd” has been leading the way for quite some time … continuing to define seismic regulations and mandates concerning hospitals and healthcare facilities in years past electrical support equipment could be installed once approved seismic calculations and anchorage documentation were provided as safetyrelated requirements have evolved … so have the certification requirements for this same electrical support equipment as a leading manufacturer of medicalgrade electrical power quality products and active in the hospital  healthcare market we’ve seen this evolution and have acknowledged the need for shaketable testing and seismicrated certificationsthe importance of “oshpd seismic preapproval” osp“oshpd” monitors the planning design and oversight of healthcare facility construction hospitals clinics etc to ensure that they are capable of providing services to the public … even after a natural disaster such as an earthquake“oshpd” currently mandates that any equipment required to withstand an earthquake and function afterwards  be approved and certified via shaketable testing to specific criteria equipment that falls under this mandate is typically life safety related … including mri  ct scanners emergency room tables as well as all electrical support equipment such as transformers panel boards and generators“oshpd seismic preapproval” osp is a program in which equipment manufacturers perform seismic testing of representative samples of a product line … and then have these products certified and preapproved as seismicrated equipment because our power conditioners and voltage regulators support mri’s ct’s and other criticalcare modalities we pursued … and secured … “oshpd seismic preapproval” certificationwe are now pleased to announce that our “sure image model 700fm” and “series 700f”products are seismicrated and “oshpd preapproved”california … and beyondgeographically the united states geological survey map below illustrates the intensity of the active seismic regions within the continental u s while not shown here alaska and hawaii are active seismic zones as well installations requiring seismicrated power conditioning products extend well beyond california and hospital facilities our “sure image model 700fm” and “series 700f” have been “oshpd” preapproved and certified via shaketable testing to a very specific set of criteria testing and data reporting were completed to standards that satisfy the international building code ibc 2015 as well as “oshpd” and california building code cbc 2013 these standards are recognized and accepted by most of the united states as well as other countries even federal and state agencies municipalities as well as commercial and industrial facilities are showing an increasing interest in and need for such robust electrical power quality productshow does all this benefit the specifying engineering community our “oshpd seismic preapproval” certification greatly reduces your time  efforts in locating and selecting power conditioning and voltage regulating equipment to be installed in earthquakeprone regions we’ve published a whitepaper to explain the details of our certification we invite you to read more about our seismicrated medicalgrade “sure image model 700fm” and our commercial  industrial “series 700f” power conditioning voltage regulatorsfeel free to drop us a line in the “comments” below … we’d love to help you specify these seismicrated power quality productsposted in company news general power quality medical power quality leave a reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name email website
