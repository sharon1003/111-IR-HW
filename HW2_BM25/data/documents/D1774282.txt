how millions of people can help solve climate change by laur fisher robert laubacher and thomas w malone on wed 15 jan 2014read later share tweet if there ever was a problem that’s hard to solve it’s climate change it’s a complex challenge requiring more expertise than any one person can possess—indepth knowledge of the physics of the upper atmosphere a firm grasp on the economics of technological innovation and a thorough understanding of the psychology of human behavior change what’s more topdown approaches that have been tried for decades—like efforts to pass national legislation and to negotiate international agreements—while important haven’t yet produced the kind of change scientists say is needed to avert climate change’s potential consequences but there’s at least one reason for optimism we now have a new—and potentially more effective—way of solving complex global challenges online crowdsourcing climate change threatens people around the world with disasters like storm surges including the one seen here caused by megastorm sandy in 2012 millions of people around the world can now work together online to achieve a common goal at a scale and with a degree of collaboration that was never before possible from wikipedia to open source software to online citizen science projects crowdsourcing has produced remarkable results in the worlds of education technology and science take the online game fold it for example in just ten days players from around the world helped produce an accurate model of a key protein found in an hivlike virus solving a problem that had stumped scientists for 15 years we believe these examples are just the beginning of what’s possible in our work at the mit center for collective intelligence we’re exploring the potential of crowdsourcing to help solve the world’s most difficult societal problems—starting with climate change to do that we’ve created the climate co lab an online platform where people from around the world collaborate on developing and evaluating proposals for what to do about global climate change all three of us are actively involved in the climate co lab anyone is allowed to contribute in the same way that fold it opened up the chemist’s laboratory the climate co lab opens up the elite conference rooms and meeting halls where climate strategies are developed today to move beyond relying solely on experts scientists and politicians to develop solutions we’ve broken down the complex issue of climate change into focused subproblems and invited a global community to tackle each of the subproblems and then put the puzzle back together again into a global strategy anyone is allowed to contribute no matter who a person is or where they come from they can contribute ideas and have them reviewed by an international community of thousands of people—including worldrenowned experts from organizations like nasa the world bank and the union of concerned scientists and leading universities like mit stanford and columbia over the past three years the climate co lab community has grown dramatically and it now has over 10000 members from more than 100 countries members include business people researchers scientists officials at nongovernmental organizations ngos policymakers students and concerned citizens as well as dozens of the world’s leading experts on climate science policy clean tech investing and more together the community has submitted and evaluated over 400 proposals on a wide variety of topics ranging from eating vegetarian diets to adapting to sea level rise to shifting public attitudes about climate change how the climate co lab works any member of the community can create a proposal or discuss support and evaluate proposals submitted by others proposals can advocate new technologies community projects marketing strategies businesses policies or any other kind of action to address climate change both individuals and teams are welcome to develop proposals and an increasing number of representatives from nonprofit organizations and businesses are submitting their ideas including the united nations development programme the e bay green team in germany and juccce a chinese nonprofit founded by a time magazine “environmental hero of the year” a key component of each proposal is how well it addresses climate change activity on the site is organized through a series of contests as people develop proposals other members of the community are invited to support them—akin to liking a page on facebook—or comment on them judges who are distinguished researchers and officials at companies government agencies and nonprofits select the most promising entries to be finalists and provide feedback on how they can be improved after the finalists’ entries are revised the community is invited to vote for the ones they find the most promising with the topranked proposals receiving popular choice awards the judges also select the judges’ choice awards the climate co lab offers a cash award to a single grand prize winner but all the popular and judges’ choice winners receive an opportunity to present their ideas to top experts and potential implementers a key component of each proposal is how well it addresses climate change for proposals at the global level the climate co lab has integrated a computer simulation model into the site to project the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed actions the model estimates how a proposal would change for example the future concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere average global temperature and sea level as well as various economic costs in making these models available to the public the climate co lab enables citizens to test firsthand how their ideas could affect physical and economic systems and then use this information to improve their proposals breaking down climate change a key principle behind the climate co lab is breaking down the large complex problem of climate change into a series of more focused subproblems as mentioned above these subproblems are defined by three key dimensions what actions will be taken to address climate change where will these actions be taken and who will take the actions the “what” dimension describes the kinds of actions that can occur including actions that directly affect the earth’s systems such as reducing carbon emissions mitigation or responding to rising sea levels adaptation and actions that affect human systems such as adopting new policies or changing behavior “where” reflects the geographical location of the action for instance china new york city or all developing countries and “who” describes the primary organization or person expected to undertake the proposed action the “who” dimension could include governments businesses and other kinds of organizations like educational institutions nonprofits and churches as well as individual citizens using these dimensions the climate co lab conducted 18 contests on a broad range of subproblems in seven major categories reshaping public attitudes reducing consumption increasing energy efficiency removing carbon from the energy supply reducing emissions from agriculture forestry and waste management adapting to climate change and geoengineering the direct manipulation of the world’s climate of course just breaking a problem into pieces isn’t enough there also needs to be some way of putting the pieces back together to solve the overall problem this is why the climate co lab will soon launch a new set of integrated contests at the national and global levels here community members will combine ideas from other contests or elsewhere to form proposals for specific countries or for the whole world in doing so members will be able piece all the different ideas together to see what their total combined effect could be activity so far in 20102011 climate co lab contests focused on what global climate treaties should be adopted and how the global economy should evolve through 2100 given the risks of climate change the winners of these contests presented their ideas in briefings to officials at the united nations in new york and the u s congress in washington d c the 20122013 contests focused on the more detailed subproblems described above some of these contests were run in conjunction with other organizations including the union of concerned scientists carbon war room and iclei–local governments for sustainability almost 400 proposals were submitted from australia canada china germany india mexico south africa and many other countries the winners presented at the crowds and climate conference at mit in november 2013 which brought together experts from environmental defense fund national audubon society the executive office of the president of the united states the city of new york general electric the new york times dbl investors and many others winning ideas included creating a more sustainable vision of the good life called the china dream for the emerging chinese middle classes preparing vietnamese cities for seasonal migrants and replacing carbonintensive diesel pumps used by small farmers in india with footoperated treadle pumps a grand prizewinning entry shows homeowners where and how much heat their houses lose the grand prize winners from the university of calgary in canada took home a 10000 award for their proposal about a project to show homeowners where their houses are wasting heat how much it’s costing them and how to fix it—all on google maps and all for free the invention helps residents improve their home energy efficiency save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a result of their climate co lab proposal the team is now working to scale up the project to cities with populations of over 1 million people a reason for optimism for the first time in history there is now a highlyaccessible democratic solutionsbased platform that allows people across the globe to collaborate on developing solutions to climate change by bringing together experts crowds and key stakeholders the climate co lab opens up the possibility that effective solutions to climate change can come not just from international conferences or labs but collectively from large numbers of people from all over the world has the project yet had an impact on climate change in many ways it’s too soon to tell the 2013 winners have been recognized by national and international news media and at the very least the climate co lab has helped many people learn more about climate change but if the project achieves its highest aspirations it will also engage a broad range of scientists policy makers businesspeople members of nonprofits and concerned citizens in helping to plan—and gain support for—better actions to address climate change than anything we would ever otherwise have done to join the community and submit
