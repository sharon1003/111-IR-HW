the ‘designer’ clothes you’re buying at outlet stores aren’t actually designer august 21 2014 by anayo awuzie you know that amazing feeling when you walk into one of your favorite brand’s outlet stores and see that glorious red sticker that reads “was 178 now 59” those of us who love bargains practically salivate at the mouth when we see those huge discounts on possibly offseason cynthia rowley or michael kors but some new reporting shows that those prices are not all that they seem what you’re buying aren’t amazingly marked down designer deals they’re actually lowerquality clothes made to look like designer deals according to a report by the brass outlet clothing never goes to a regular store and is made to go specifically to outlet stores stores like j crew and banana republic have separate factories that make cheaper quality clothes that are made specifically for the store’s outlets are retailers trying to deceive their consumers possibly however their main objective with creating cheaper clothing is to compete with fast fashion retailers like hm and zara who are currently dominating the retail market stores who sell higherquality clothing obviously can’t compete however they utilize their outlet stores to serve as their entry point into the fast fashion space another particularly deceptive side of the coin comes courtesy of stores like tj maxx and nordstrom rack sometimes they’ll have crazy amounts of certain brands at dirct cheap prices but be careful because that severely “marked down” calvin klein dress might just be the product of a tj maxx factory outlet with a calvin klein label sewn on according to the brass in this situation the brand ex calvin klein agrees to let tj maxx produce clothing with their label on it in return for a percentage usually between 520 of the wholesale price of the garment to put this in perspective in 2012 calvin klein reported that “ licensed products currently represent slightly over 50 of global retail sales ” at that time licensing alone accounted for more than 38 billion in ck sales so basically everyone is in on it except the consumer obviously if you’re a diehard outlet shopper then by all means get your outlet on but at least you’ll be a more informed and savvy shopper tags tj maxx
