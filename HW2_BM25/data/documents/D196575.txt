energy in an inductor when a electric current is flowing in an inductor there is energy stored in the magnetic field considering a pure inductor l the instantaneous power which must be supplied to initiate the current in the inductor isso the energy input to build to a final current i is given by the integral using the example of a solenoid an expression for the energy density can be obtained index inductance concepts capacitance concepts hyper physics  electricity and magnetism r nave go back
