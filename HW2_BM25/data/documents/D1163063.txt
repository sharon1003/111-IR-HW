due to a recent demand for help with home networks i have decided to write this instructable on how to troubleshoot your home network if you are not already familiar with the basics of how your network works i suggest reading my previous instructable  how your home network works  i will be providing instructions for windows xp and windows 7 if you are using vista it is very similar to windows 7 so follow those instructions if you are using windows 8 youre on your own add tip ask question comment download step 1 ultimate basics it may not seem like an important step but before you go any farther you need to check your cable connections and reboot everything your computer router modem switches etc unplug everything and plug it back in dont just sight check it i cant tell you how many times i have gone to troubleshoot a network and they just have something unplugged or didnt bother to reboot their router this is especially common with my parentsadd tip ask question comment download step 2 taking a step back the first thing you should do when troubleshooting your network is to take a step back and think about the facts you already know about the problem you are having is your computer able to connect to other networks and just not this one network if so it probably proves that there are not any hardware issues present on your computer unless you are trying to connect to a 5ghz network with a 24ghz network adapter well cover that later are other computers able to connect to this network if so then there might be a problem in your settings on the problem computer are you connected to the network but just not able to access the internet there might be a dns problem is your service unreliable it could be a lot of things but interference and dns problems are the most common in home networks add tip ask question comment download step 3 diagnosing ip addressing problems one of the first steps in troubleshooting a network connection problem is figuring out if you have a valid ip address and if it was configured automatically or manually to see all of the information about your network adapter go to command prompt and type ipconfig all and press enter first look at the option that says dhcp enabled if it says no it means that at some point a static ip address was configured which may not be the correct ip address for this network to set your ip addressing to automatic see step 6 if your network is dhcp enabled then look at your ipv4 address subnet mask and default gateway if you have another computer on the same network that works properly run an ipconfig command and see if the subnet mask and default gateway are the same on both computers the ipv4 address should be on the same subnet see below now we need to check and make sure you are on the correct subnet i will not be explaining subnetting in this instructable only the basics used in home networking assuming that your subnet mask is 2552552550 the first three octets the first three numbers separated by a decimal point called octets because each is a binary byte which is 8 bits on the ipv4 address and default gateway should be the same the last octet should not be the same also if you have another computer that works on the same network check to make sure the first three octets are the same on that computer if your address is configured automatically and it is on the correct subnet then your ip addressing is correct add tip ask question comment download step 4 diagnosing hardware issues if your computer will not connect to the network at all and it doesnt connect to other networks its a good chance that you have a hardware problem you can try checking the drivers to make sure there are no issues or updates but if it isnt a driver issue i strongly suggest just buying a new wireless nic they are cheap enough that it isnt worth fooling around with you can get one on amazon for 001 plus 499 shipping another thing to consider with hardware is that not all wireless networks are on the same frequencies wi fi a networks are 5 ghz wi fi b networks are 24 ghz wi fi g networks are 24 ghz and wi fi n uses both 24 and 5 ghz bands what this means is that if you have a 24 ghz wireless nic which is the most common it will not work on an a network if your router is an a router then you need to get a wireless nic that supports 24 and 5 ghz networks if your computer connects to other wireless networks and you have verified that you have the correct frequencies then more than likely it is not a hardware issue add tip ask question comment download step 5 diagnosing dns server problems many times when your internet has intermittent issues but you are still connected to the network or if you are connected to the network but not to the internet you have a dns server problem many times your router will have a built in dns server however the built in dns server can be spotty at best i generally recommend that if you keep your current dns server that you also add googles dns servers to your list see step 8add tip ask question comment download step 6 fixing ip addressing issues if you determined that you might have an ip addressing issue this step is for you obtaining an address automatically if you are not receiving your ip address via dhcp here is how to set your computer to use dhcp in windows 7 right click the wireless icon on your system tray click open network and sharing center on the top right of the screen click change adapter settings right click your wireless network adapter and click properties find internet protocol version 4 tcpipv4 click it and then click properties then click obtain and ip address automatically if you want to obtain your dns servers automatically you can change those as well please note that if you use open dns or another web filter that requires you to use their dns servers this could shut off the filtering or in some cases impact your ability to access the internet for more information on dns settings see step 7 in windows xp click start and go to control panel double click network connections find your network adapter and right click it click properties go to internet protocol tcpip and click properties then click obtain and ip address automatically if you want to obtain your dns servers automatically you can change those as well please note that if you use open dns or another web filter that requires you to use their dns servers this could shut off the filtering or in some cases impact your ability to access the internet for more information on dns settings see step 7 setting a static address if you are unable to obtain and ip address via dhcp you may need to set it manually if there are other computers on your network be sure and check their ip addresses to make sure you will not have an addressing conflict if they have addresses below 100 i suggest using addresses higher than 100 and visaversa in windows 7 right click the wireless icon on your system tray click open network and sharing center on the top right of the screen click change adapter settings right click your wireless network adapter and click properties find internet protocol version 4 tcpipv4 click it and then click properties then click use the following ip address and input your chosen ip address the last number should be between 1 and 254 and not your default gateway 95 of default home network settings use 2552552550 as their subnet mask enter your routers ip address as your default gateway obtain this from a working computer if possible if you are unsure of what to use for your dns server addresses use 8888 for the preferred and 8844 for the alternate in windows xp click start and go to control panel double click network connections find your network adapter and right click it click properties go to internet protocol tcpip and click properties then click use the following ip address and input your chosen ip address the last number should be between 1 and 254 and not your default gateway 95 of default home network settings use 2552552550 as their subnet mask enter your routers ip address as your default gateway obtain this from a working computer if possible if you are unsure of what to use for your dns server addresses use 8888 for the preferred and 8844 for the alternate add tip ask question comment download step 7 updating a driver if you suspect a hardware issue then you might want to update your driver if possible if there is a problem at the hardware level then this will not fix the problem but if the hardware is working and can not communicate with your computer there may be a driver issue heres how to update your driver there are a few different methods i suggest trying them in this order 1 through device manager 2 off the manufactures website 3 automated driver updater slim drivers updating your driver through device manager in windows 7 press the windows key and pausebreak together if your pause and break key are separated use the pause in the upper right you should see a link to device manager once in device manager find your wireless nic start by looking in network adapters if you do not see it there look under other devices if you see any sort of yellow exclamation point or red x then you know that there is an issue with your network adapter probably a driver issue right click it and select update driver software if it finds an update try to connect to the network updating your driver through device manager in windows xp press the windows key and pausebreak together if your pause and break key are separated use the pause go to the hardware tab select device manager once in device manager find your wireless nic start by looking in network adapters if you do not see it there look under other devices if you see any sort of yellow exclamation point or red x then you know that there is an issue with your network adapter probably a driver issue right click it and select update driver if it finds an update try to connect to the network updating your driver by finding it on your manufactures website  windows 7 and xp  if device manager cant find an update for your driver automatically try googling your nics manufacture and model to try and find a driver download for it i strongly recommend trying as hard as you can to find it from the manufacture before resorting to an automated program slim drivers if you are able to find an update from the manufacture install it then try to connect to the network using slim drivers  windows 7 and xp  download and install slim drivers from here httpwwwdriverupdatenetdownloadsslim driverssetupexe once you have it installed be sure and backup your drivers before changing anything option on the top of slim drivers then run a scan and see if it finds the drivers for you only install the driver for your wireless nic ignore as many updates as possible if you are able to find an update from slim drivers install it then try to connect to the network add tip ask question comment download step 8 fixing dns server issues if you have determined that you may have dns server issues and it never hurts to change your dns servers to google anyway in my opinion i suggest using googles dns servers please note that if you use open dns or another web filter that requires you to use their dns servers changing or adding dns servers could shut off the filtering or in some cases impact your ability to access the internet to change the dns servers in windows 7 right click the wireless network icon in your task tray and click open network and sharing center click change adapter settings find your network connection right click and select properties then click internet protocol version 4 tcpipv4 and click properties change the radio button on the bottom from obtain dns server address automatically to use the following dns server addresses then use 8888 for the preferred dns server and 8844 for the alternate dns server if you want to use googles dns servers in addition to the ones you already use type ipconfig all in command prompt then go back to the tcpipv4 properties and click advanced go to the dns tab and add the ones you are already using first then add 8888 and 8844 you will now have better chances of finding the correct ip address add tip ask question comment download step 9 conclusion i hope that this has helped you troubleshoot your home network issues please note that this is not meant to be an extensive guide to troubleshooting networks this only covers the basics if you are still having troubles please comment below with as much detail as possible and i will try and help you if necessary i can try and help direct you to a network professional in your area at least in the us that can help you with advanced problems and just for the record geek squad is not considered professional add tip ask question comment download share did you make this project share it with usi made itrecommendations

suggest for hardwired networks are cable testers you can get them for around ten dollars each there are two kinds of testers one will check a cable not plugged to a network but you have to have access to both ends the other kind tests connectivity with one end connected into the network some of the cheaper ones will give a false positive though many a time i have seen cables that look perfect but actually have problems if you have any amount of computers in your network some extra cable ends and a crimping tool are worth their weight in gold there are a lot of mswindows viruses that love to disable your networking so you can not get on line and repair the machine running the virus checker in safe without networking mode could also remedy some issues you can also restart your networking without rebooting the machine if you have admin rights and access to the system tools reboot is not an option for most professionals on wireless networks can also have issues of ssids and passphrases not in sync some routers can lock out devices with certain preset mac addresses so you have to make sure your mac address is not excluded from connecting more too it than just the speed there is another tool but a bit more expensive that can detect wifi signals for example computers near microwaves or the like could interfere with radio transmission as much as the name geek squad makes me want to laugh they do have a few good techs you get what best buy pays them last i heard it was not much per hour one question though how do you update network drivers if the network is not working in the machine rhetoricalthegeeke 5 years ago in reply to computothought reply thanks for your input some times people are able to connect using another adapter for slim drivers and also if there is an updated driver locally device manager will usually find it otherwise you need to find it off of the manufactures website which is what i recommend most i will agree geek squad has a few good techs but not many kevin d307 6 weeks ago reply very nice detailed instructions even a caveman can follow them but you need a step 10 im in it as well i didnt need this info but i will save it in case someone else in it needs it my wife loads a bunch of junk on her computer she started getting the 169 ip address i did everything in the book except for what fixed it  our isp uses googles dns i even hard coded her address but it still refuses to connect i even disabled ipipa and did all the microsoft suggestions still no luck i even did the netsh winsock reset any suggestions you wouldnt recommend to an end user thanks again for the nice article kevin d307 6 weeks ago in reply to kevin d307reply oh yes i even installed a wifi adapter it too keeps getting the 169 ipipa address mihai c44 6 weeks ago

mobile ip address john z57 7 months ago reply im thinking of upgrading to a wifi cable modem to replace the cable modem that we use today the one that i have in mind only has 2 gig ethernet connections right now we have a cable modem followed by a 4 port wifi router and behind the router an 8 port switch i run asterisk at home and have the problem that the asterisk server and the two sip devices i have giga set and linksys ata have to be connected to the router to be able to communicate when i put all the components on the switch the sip devices dont register so i am afraid that if i replace the modemrouter with the new cable modem i will run into the same problem they do get ipadresses from the router but it seems like there is some hiccup in the routingihanley 1 year ago reply
