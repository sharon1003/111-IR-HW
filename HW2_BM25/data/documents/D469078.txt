how medicare length of stay in snfs could relate to rehospitalizations march 28 2012 by alyssa gerace patient rehospitalizations from skilled nursing facilities is a costly problem the industry is working to fix especially after a study revealed accelerated cognitive decline in elderly patients after a hospitalization and a panel of experts at a recent session during nic’s 2012 skilled nursing investment forum said readmissions could be linked to length of stay in a facility across all levels of care rehospitalizations cost the medicare system 25 billion a year said mark jaeckle manager of clinical services at ge capital’s healthcare financial services adding that one in three medicare patients who are admitted to skilled nursing facilities end up being readmitted to hospitals within 30 days data trends show that patients are spending fewer days in hospitals said jaeckle at the same time he continued admission to skilled nursing facilities from hospitals has gone up and hospital readmission rates have also risen skilled nursing facility patients’ average length of stay could be a significant factor in whether or not they’re rehospitalized after transitioning to postacute care said michael jones ceo and principal of healthtique group an owneroperatormanager of senior living communities the average length of stay for medicare residents in a skilled nursing facility is 29 days but in one of jones’ facilities patients were only staying for an average of 19 days—which he later determined to be when copays for medicare advantage plans kicked in not only do shorter lengths of stay mean a facility is losing out on the revenue that can be generated by more medicare days but this can also put a resident at higher risk of hospital readmission if they’re not fully recovered he said this whole dynamic gets much more important moving forward with accountable care organizations acos and other forms of managed care said jones shorter stays leading to higher readmissions could damage a facility’s reputation both for prospective patients and for referral relationships jones said he was told that many of the patients in that particular skilled nursing facility simply could not afford the copays and that was “just the way it is”that’s not an acceptable answer said jones “it’s incumbent upon us to make it better to convince them to stay longer and get better” there may not be a hardandfast method for increasing average length of stays but it could help to have discussions with patients and their family members to tell the importance of longer stays and work out a payment plan he said having effective communications accuracy and compliance is the recipe for success jaeckle said rehospitalization rate management will be “critical” for future skilled nursing facility success he continued especially as “others—including hospital referral sources—will know your rates even if you don’t”written by alyssa gerace new in the resource center the new active adult housing there are many names for the space known as “active adult” or “55” just don’t call it “senior” take a deep dive inside this everevolving lucrative space inside the future of skilled nursing design providers who tackle key pain points to build snfs for the next generation are poised for success discover snf design trends on the short and longterm horizon inside the future of university partnerships in senior living university partnerships are revolutionizing senior living learn how innovative operators are forming these partnerships for success alyssa gerace categories medicare and medicaid senior care senior housing skilled nursing companies ge capital healthtique group get updates via email with the shn newsletter email
