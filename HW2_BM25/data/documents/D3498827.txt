stand for a lot of people think that the distress signal is an abbreviation for “save our souls” or “save our ship” but in reality save our souls and save our ship are backronyms and the letters don’t actually stand for anything in fact the signal isn’t even really supposed to be three individual letters it’s just a continuous morse code string of three dots three dashes and three dots all run together with no spaces or full stops …… since three dots form the letter s and three dashes form an “o” in international morse code though the signal came to be called an “sos” for the sake of convenience that connection has led to the letters coming into their own as a visual distress signal divorced from morse code and those in need of rescue sometimes spell them out on the ground to be
