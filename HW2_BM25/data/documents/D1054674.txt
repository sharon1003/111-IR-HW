charitable donations the basics of giving personal finance taxes charitable by hayden adams january 02 2018while it may be better to give than to receive with proper planning it’s possible to do both at the same time you may have many financial goals including giving to the causes that are most important to you consider these strategies to make the greatest impact while potentially receiving tax savings for yourself too ground rules for giving the tax aspects of charitable giving can be complex so it’s always a good idea to consult a tax professional about your giving strategy that said here are a few ground rules request a receipt if you make a donation of 250 or more to a single charity but if the donation is in cash youll need a receipt or a corroborating bank record regardless of amount get an independent appraisal for gifts of property in excess of 5000 10000 for closely held stock you wont need an appraisal for exchangetraded stocks bonds or mutual funds subtract the value of any benefits you received for your charitable contribution for example books tapes meals entertainment and so on before you deduct it itemize deductions on your tax return if you plan to deduct charitable donations if your standard deduction exceeds your charitable contributions and other deductible expenses then you likely won’t itemize you’ll help your favorite charity—which is a good reason on its own—but won’t reduce your tax bill tax treatments by type of gift the tax advantages of a charitable contribution generally depend on three factors the recipient only donations to qualified charities are deductible how you structure the gift and the type of asset you choose to give different types of charitable donations—cash stock or personal property—offer different tax advantages and drawbacks cash cash donations are simple and usually fully deductible as previously mentioned make sure you keep a receipt from the charity or a bank record such as a canceled check or statement to substantiate your cash gift no matter how small tangible personal property you can donate almost any item including old clothing household goods or vehicles gifts of used clothing and household items must be in “good” used condition or better under irs tax rules if the property doesnt relate to the charitys mission you may deduct the amount you paid for the property or the propertys current reasonable value whichever is less if property is related to the charitys mission— old clothes donated to the salvation army for example—its usually fully deductible based on its current reasonable value some charities will provide some guidance on the value but its ultimately up to you to determine the value for tax purposes ordinary income property you can donate property created by or used in a trade or business this includes inventory held for sale—or if you’re an artist or craftsperson items you created for sale this category covers property that if sold would generate ordinary income instead of longterm capital gains such as investments held for one year or less the irs limits how much you can deduct to the fair market value minus the amount of ordinary income or capital gain if you sold the asset at its fair market value but you don’t have to reduce the deduction if you include the appreciated value of the asset in your gross income on your tax return longterm capital  gain property you can usually deduct the full fair market value of appreciated longterm assets youve held for more than one year such as stocks bonds or mutual funds in addition if you contribute stocks or other investments you pay no capital gains tax donating investments—especially highly appreciated securities—instead of cash can be a very effective and taxefficient way to support a charity generally if your assets have appreciated in value it’s best not to sell securities to generate the cash you need for a donation contributing the securities directly to the charity increases the amount you contribute and increases your deduction one rule to remember here is that the deduction is limited to 30 of your adjusted gross income agi this differs from a 50 limit for donations of cash and shortterm property you can still carry forward unused deductions for five years if you’re planning a large contribution that’s close to or exceeds these agi limits first talk with a tax professional if you’re holding securities with a loss it’s usually better to sell first that way you can take the capital loss for tax purposes then donate the cash in most cases though donating appreciated securities can be a costeffective way to benefit the charities of your choice heres an example to help you decide if donating appreciated investments is a good option for you the example assumes that you’re in the 33 tax bracket and want to donate 100000 worth of stock in the example below you see that donating the stock results in no capitals gains tax being paid and a larger itemized deduction option 1 sell stock and donate the net proceeds option 2 donate stock directly to the charity current fair market value of stocks 100000 1000 shares × 100 per share 100000 1000 shares × 100 per sharelongterm capital gains tax paid 1 14250 0amount donated to charity 85750 100000personal income tax savings 2 033 × amount donated to charity 28298 330001 assumes a cost basis of 5000 that the investment has been held for more than a year and that all realized gains are subject to a 15 longterm capital gains tax rate the analysis does not take into account any state or local taxes2 assumes donor is in the 33 federal income tax bracket and does not take into account any state or local taxes certain federal income tax deductions including the charitable contribution are available only to taxpayers who itemize deductions and may be subject to reduction for taxpayers with agi above certain levels in addition deductions for charitable contributions may be limited based on the type of property donated the type of charity and the donors agi for example deductions for contributions of appreciated property to public charities generally are limited to 30 of the donors agi excess contributions may be carried forward for up to five years volunteering you can deduct transportation costs and other expenses related to volunteering however the value of volunteer time isn’t deductible limitation on itemized deductions starting with the 2013 tax year the socalled pease limitation on itemized deductions named for the congressman who first introduced it applies to charitable deductions for 2017 most itemized deductions including charitable deductions are reduced by 3 of agi over 261500 for single filers and 313800 for joint filers up to a maximum total of 80 of nonexempt itemized deductions the limitation is indexed for inflation and changes each year the pease limitation is driven by your income not the amount of your itemized deductions so don’t let it discourage you from charitable giving giving through specialized charitable vehicles while gifts of cash or appreciated investments can be given directly to a charity it often makes sense to consider specialized charitable vehicles to make giving easier and to manage the tax benefits if you give regularly endowed giving vehicles likedonoradvised funds or private foundations can make sense donoradvised funds for example allow you to make a contribution of cash or appreciated investments held for more than one year receive a current year tax deduction and avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of assets contributed you can invest funds to potentially grow over time and then grant the assets to a worthy cause down the road if you prefer to leave assets to charity but also earn income for a period of time acharitable remainder trust crt or pooled income fund is worth exploring each vehicle strategy and provider may offer different benefits including tax deductibility administrative costs flexibility and account minimums so compare options and talk with a financial planner schwab financial consultant or a donoradvised fund provider such as schwab
