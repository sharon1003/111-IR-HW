known as dom storage  document object model storage provides web application software methods and protocols used for storing data in a web browser web storage supports persistent data storage similar to cookies but with a greatly enhanced capacity 1 and no information stored in the http request header 2 there are two main web storage types local storage and session storage behaving similarly to persistent cookies and session cookies respectively web storage is being standardized by the world wide web consortium w3c it was originally part of the html5 specification but is now in a separate specification 3 it is supported by internet explorer 8 mozilla based browsers eg firefox 2 officially from 35  4 safari 4 google chrome 4 session storage is from 5 and opera 1050 as of 14 march 2011 opera and ie9 support the storage events 5contents  hide 1 features11 storage size12 clientside interface13 local and session storage14 interface and data model2 usage21 session storage22 local

simplistically as an improvement on cookies however it differs from cookies in some key ways storage size  editweb storage provides far greater storage capacity 5 mb per origin in mozilla firefox 6 and opera 10mb per origin in google chrome 7 10 mb per storage area in internet explorer 8 25mb per origin on black berry 10 devices compared to 4 k b around 1000 times less space available to cookies clientside interface  editunlike cookies which can be accessed by both the server and client side web storage falls exclusively under the purview of clientside scripting web storage data is not automatically transmitted to the server in every http request and a web server cant directly write to web storage however either of these effects can be achieved with explicit clientside scripts allowing for finetuning of the desired interaction with the server local and session storage  editweb storage offers two different storage areas—local storage and session storage—which differ in scope and lifetime data placed in local storage is per origin the combination of protocol hostname and port number as defined in the sameorigin policy the data is available to all scripts loaded from pages from the same origin that previously stored the data and persists after the browser is closed session storage is peroriginperwindowortab and is limited to the lifetime of the window session storage is intended to allow separate instances of the same web application to run in different windows without interfering with each other a use case thats not well supported by cookies 9interface and data model  editweb storage currently provides a better programmatic interface than cookies because it exposes an associative array data model where the keys and values are both strings an additional api for accessing structured data is being considered by the w3c web applications working group 10usage  editbrowsers that support web storage have the global variables session storage and local storage declared at the window level the following java script code can be used on these browsers to trigger web storage behavioursession storage  edit store value on browser for duration of the sessionsession storage set item  key value  retrieve value gets deleted when browser is closed and reopened alert  session storage get item  key local storage  edit store value on the browser beyond the duration of the sessionlocal storage set item  key value  retrieve value persists even after closing and reopening the browseralert  local storage get item  key accessing data for the currently browsed domain  editthe following code can be used to retrieve all values stored in local storage for the currently browsed domain the domain for the web page that is being browsed this java script code can be executed using development tools available in most modern browsers such as the ie developer toolbar chrome developer tools the firebug extension in firefox or opera dragonflyvar output  localstorage datannif  local storage if  local storage length for  var i  0 i  local storage length i  output  local storage key  i     local storage get item  local storage key  i  n else output  there is no data stored for this domain  else output  your browser does not support local storageconsole log  output data types  editonly strings can be stored via the storage api 11 attempting to store a different data type will result in an automatic conversion into a string in most browsers conversion into json java script object notation however allows for effective storage of java script objects store an object instead of a stringlocal storage set item  key  name value alert  typeof local storage get item  key   string store an integer instead of a stringlocal storage set item  key 1 alert  typeof local storage get item  key   string store an object using jsonlocal storage set item  key json stringify   name value alert  json parse  local storage get item  key  name   value nomenclature  editthe w3c draft is titled web storage dom storage has also been a commonly used name though it is becoming less so for example the dom storage web articles of the mozilla and microsoft developer sites have been replaced with web storage articles 12 13 14 15the dom in dom storage does not literally refer to the document object model according to the w3c the term dom is used to refer to the api set made available to scripts in web applications and does not necessarily imply the existence of an actual document object 16web storage management  editstorage of web storage objects is enabled by default in mozilla firefox and sea monkey but can be disabled by setting the aboutconfig parameter domstorageenabled to false 17mozilla firefox stores all web storage objects in a single file named webappsstoresqlite the sqlite3 command can be used to show the elements stored therein 18there are browser extensionsaddons for google chrome and mozilla firefox available that let the user deal with web storage such as clickclean 19 20 and better privacy which can be configured to remove the whole web storage automatically on a regular basis 21 22 23 mozilla is currently transitioning 24 from its old framework to web extensions during which time the better privacy addon has been removed see this uptodate firefox security settings guide for recommended alternatives see also
