direct energy faces mounting consumer complaints matt mc clure calgary herald published on december 30 2015  last updated december 30 2015 254 pm mstmore than 270 consumers have asked the advocates office to mediate over the last 12 months in their disputes with direct energy companies about billing contracts and other issues sal burciaga  handout share adjust comment print recent charges against direct energy under alberta’s consumer protection laws come in the wake of a marked increase in complaints about the houstonbased company to a provincial watchdog agency statistics from the utilities consumer advocate show the number of complaints each month involving both the regulated and competitive sides of the gas and electricity retailing giant have quadrupled during the past year more than 270 consumers have asked the advocate’s office to mediate over the past 12 months in their disputes with direct energy companies about billing contracts and other issues those complaints represent more than 80 per cent of the concerns about energy marketers that the consumer advocate investigated during that period by comparison just energy alberta — the only other retailer who employs doortodoor sales staff in the province — accounted for 19 complaints or about six per cent of cases opened direct energy spokeswoman jessica michan blamed the spike in complaints on the company’s move in october 2014 to a new online billing and customer care platform“despite a few bumps in the road the vast majority of our customers made the transition without any issues and now have access to convenient selfserve payment and service options” michan said in a prepared statement“of the 12 million bills generated since we transitioned to our new billing system 99 per cent have been generated on time”while threequarters of the complaints to the consumer advocate about direct energy through the year ending in november were billing concerns onequarter actually involved contract disputes service alberta charged direct energy under the province’s fair trading act this month for failing to provide a refund within 15 days after a prepaid contract to supply a furnace and air conditioner was cancelled by the homeowner in november department investigators charged the company with four counts under the law involving two separate incidents in one case direct energy is alleged to have enrolled a consumer in an energy contract even though the person had made a request to cancel the agreement within the legislated 10day “coolingoff” period the other case involved another furnace contract in which the company failed to provide a refund of a deposit within the required 15days after the deal was cancelled by the consumer penalties under the fair trading act include a maximum fine of 300000 and up to two years in jail in addition to any penalty meted out by the courts if a company is convicted under the legislation a service alberta spokesman said the department’s director of fair trading can suspend or cancel its licence to operate as an energy marketer or direct seller within the province“an administrative action must take into account … the nature and severity of the breaches whether they were intentional whether the company has engaged in due diligence and the impact of potential penalties on third parties like employees and clients” scott seymour said a subsidiary of u kbased centrica plc direct energy has about five million residential and business customers across north america including approximately 750000 in alberta the company says it employs approximately 5500 workers across the continent with an unknown number based in alberta the recent charges are not the first time the company’s business practices in the province have been called into question earlier this year direct energy’s regulated provider in alberta agreed to pay 9 million to settle a classaction lawsuit in which it was alleged the company’s late payment penalties were effectively charging customers an illegal interest rate of up to 91 per cent in 2009 the company entered into an agreement with service alberta to pay 5000 towards the cost of the department’s investigation of its marketing practices and to take steps to ensure it did not accidentally or intentionally mislead consumers when it was signing them up for unregulated energy rate plans direct energy saw its operating profit increase 81 per cent in the first six months of this year to approximately 375 million as it increasingly bundled the sale of gas and electricity with products like service protection plans and smart thermostats that can control usage“we are focused on expanding our range of customer propositions targeted at the most valuable customer segments” the company said in its midyear review sixtynine of the complaints or nearly onefifth of the total closed by the consumer advocate staff in the past four months took over a month to resolve the company told investors it wants to resolve more queries the first time it gets a calls and is on track to deliver a nine per cent yearoveryear reduction in the cost to serve each customer“building on our successful cost reduction programme in 2014 we continue to invest in programs that drive efficiency and enhance our customers’ experience” the review saidmmcclurecalgaryheraldcom
