failure to communicate line i looked at it and thought ‘now that’s interesting then i thought these words are going to be spoken by an actor strother martin who is playing a real redneck character who probably never went beyond high school and it has a faintly academic feel to it that line i thought people are going to question it” so he wrote a backstory for the character according to piersons
