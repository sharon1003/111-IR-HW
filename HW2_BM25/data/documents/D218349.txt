well that didn’t take long it was just a few weeks ago that amazon launched its amazon prime now service in los angeles and several other metropolitan areas promising customers one and twohour delivery for tens of thousands of products on tuesday four former amazon prime now drivers in southern california sued the online retail behemoth claiming the labor model behind the service is a sham the drivers had made deliveries for roughly a month before they filed their complaint  which alleges violations of minimum wage and overtime pay laws the lawsuit provides yet another glimpse at how amazon keeps its prices low in part by shaving labor costs deep down in its logistics network the drivers named in the complaint were not actually amazon employees rather they were “independent contractors” working on behalf of a courier service called scoobeez which the lawsuit indicates has a contract with amazon since the drivers don’t work for amazon the retailer doesn’t have to worry about paying payroll taxes workers’ compensation costs or unemployment insurance taxes on them and since the workers are independent contractors scoobeez doesn’t bear those costs either the drivers must cover their own workrelated expenses including providing their own vehicles and gasoline therein lies the claim that the amazonscoobeez arrangement runs afoul of labor law after paying their own automobile expenses the drivers say their wages fell below california’s minimum wage of 9 per hour they also claim they were not paid the required timeandahalf rate when they worked more than eight hours a day the suit argues that the drivers are in fact employees of scoobeez not independent contractors as they’ve been classified the drivers were working for hourly pay as opposed to the perdelivery rate that’s common in the courier industry according to the suit beth ross the attorney who filed the case says the drivers typically logged at least 50 miles per day on their cars often reaching or exceeding 100 miles after subtracting the cost of gasoline and wear and tear on the automobiles from the 11perhour wage ross says the pay came out to roughly 60 for 85 hours of work on some shifts or approximately 7 per hour“they are being paid a subminimum wage and amazon knew that” ross told the huffington post “and they’re giving away the service for free to customers well guess who’s paying for it downandout downontheirluck lowwage workers with no other job opportunities” note the amazon prime now service is free for prime members requesting a twohour delivery it costs 799 per order for onehour delivery with a 15 minimum order the prime service itself costs 99 per year an amazon spokeswoman said the company does not comment on pending litigation a message left for scoobeez which was named as a codefendant in the suit was not immediately returned the independent contractor scheme is a costsaving arrangement that already facilitates many amazon prime deliveries as huff post detailed last year in a story about the amazon contractor lasership many of that company’s drivers said they earned so little after expenses that a car breakdown would put them out of business the use of independent contractors is fast becoming the norm in trucking and delivery services nationwide since it saves companies so much money fed ex is widely credited with pioneering the independent contractor model and the delivery giant has been fending off related lawsuits from drivers for years ross successfully sued fed ex on behalf of drivers in a closely watched case that was settled earlier this year for 228 million in addition to the minimum wage and overtime claims the amazon prime now lawsuit also accuses the company of breach of contract the amazon prime now app allows customers to leave a tip for their courier but ross alleges that the four drivers did not receive all their tips“this is brandnew ground for amazon” ross said of the prime now service “they have the opportunity to make it right before this becomes a very entrenched business practice they can set themselves apart from the rest of socalled sharing economy”
