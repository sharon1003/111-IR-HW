cilia these tiny organelles although invisible to the naked eye play a major role in our respiratory systems functioning lets see what they are and do description the cilia are short hairlike outgrowths of certain cells usually single cells capable of rhythmic beating they can produce locomotion and feeding currents or the movement of fluids as in the respiratory ducts of animals and humans these outgrowths measure approximately 510 micrometers from the cell body some cilia cells are anchored in a tissue for example the epithelial cells which line our respiratory system organs the bending of cilia has many parallels to the contraction of muscle fibers they play a very important role in maintaining healthy the respiratory organs they serve types of cilia there are basically two types of cilia those capable of motion called motile cilia and the nonmotile or primary cilia the latter typically plays a sensory role these two types of cilia are part of the undulipodia organelle classification cilia of the respiratory system the membranes lining the lungs the sinus and nasal cavities bronchi and other respiratory organs contain many of those tiny hair like cilia which acting like small oars move fluids mucus foreign particles viruses bacteria and phlegm in the lower respiratory organs and most of the uppers some authorities have gone as far as saying that most respiratory organs health problems or diseases have their origin in the malfunctioning of the cilia these extraordinary organisms beat at 16 times per second in places like the sinuses they move fluids mucus particles etc in one direction only toward the nasal cavity while in other places like the lungs and bronchi they beat toward the throat how to keep cilia healthy one thing we should always remember is that air liquid or steam reaching 102° f or above will immobilize the cilia this has profound significance because it could if kept long enough compromise the health of your breathing system so next time you do steam inhalations spray your nose or use some otc remedies please remember that those tiny hairlike friends we have in our breathing organs dont like high temperature or strong chemicals over 20 pgs including onepage summary the best 3 sinus healing systems natural medicine · food · acupressure combined into one fastacting simple protocol it works unsolicited testimonials cant be wrongemailed instantlytestimonials you are right on m s md it really works    thank you r l p b fl3 steps to quick sinus  mucus freedom is the right thing r d cusi fr i found your publication very helpful springfield va this article really helped me thank you so much a u your advise has been quite helpful less pain m c3 steps to quick sinus  mucus freedom is working well k m l a the publication was quite helpful s k india my sinuses are much better glad i followed 3 steps tks e w memp the healing herb really helps r l p b fl amazed with reasearch magnificent n k forum its amazing to think how many doctors medications and tests ive gone through in the last three years    your information was by far the most helpful yet thanks again g w parma hts ohio to orderinstant e mailing use any major credit card pay pal ™will process your order for best secure paymentand protection only 19if you prefer you can send a check or money order for 2695 overseas postal mailing us 2995 and i will send it by first class mail
