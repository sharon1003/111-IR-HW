the urinary system  nephron function chart organs and functions of the urinary system see figure 2611 the urinary bladder  stores urine and contracts to release it to the urethra2 urethra  carries urine from the urinary bladder3 ureters carry urine from the kidney to the bladder4 kidney  maintains homeostasis of the blood it would be tempting to list the kidneys function as production of urine and it certainly does this but the production of urine is a side effect of the kidneys true function to regulate the homeostasis of electrolytes and water acidbase nutrients wastes and toxins even oxygen and blood pressure the detailed structure of s 1 through 3 will be discussed later we will begin with the kidney the kidney  see figure 263the kidney is composed of several years and is covered with a fibrous capsule the renal capsule the outer layer of the kidney is the cortex it contains the major upper portion of the nephrons the middle layer of the kidney is the medulla it is composed of the triangular shaped pyramids and the renal columns the pyramids contain the collecting tubules and loops of henle the lower portion of the nephrons these tubules run nearly parallel to one another and give the pyramids a grain which leads to their points or papillae the renal columns are regions between the pyramids in which blood vessels run to and from the cortex the papilla of each pyramid projects into a funnelshaped area known as the calyx the calyces plural of calyx collect the urine released from the papillae and allow it to drain into a large area known as the renal pelvis and then into the ureter the blood supply of the kidney is paramount in its function the two kidneys receive between 15 and 20 of the bodys systemic blood flow at rest the renal artery branches into lobar and then interlobar arteries these pass through the renal columns toward the cortex arcuate arteries branch into the cortex and lead to interlobular arteries which distribute the blood evenly throughout the cortex to the afferent arterioles which serve the nephrons blood flow leaving the nephrons returns by veins of the corresponding names the nephron  see figures 264 and 265  the nephrons are the functional units of the kidney ie individually and collectively they perform the functions of the kidney each nephron is served with blood by the afferent arteriole this vessel brings blood into a capillary tuft called the glomerulus blood leaving the glomerulus flows into the efferent arteriole usually an arteriole flows into a venule but in this case the efferent arteriole flows into more capillaries the peritubular capillaries and in juxtamedullary neurons see below the vasa recta the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta then lead to venules and the venous drainage of the kidney a capillary tuft differs from a capillary bed in that it does not perfuse a tissue like a capillary bed does instead this capillary tuft is a condensed mass of capillaries which allows substances to escape by filtration the capillaries of this tuft are surrounded by specialized cells which form the inner visceral layer of bowmans capsule see figure 267 these specialized cells are called podocytes foot cells because they have processes called pedicels which interdigitate or interlace producing openings called filtration slits the capillaries are fenestrated in order to allow a large amount of filtration the outer parietal layer of bowmans capsule consists of epithelial cells with tight junctions and serves to contain the filtrate in the capsular space the bowmans capsule opens into the proximal convoluted tubule which leads to the loop of henle the loop of henle has a descending limb which passes into the medulla recurves and becomes the ascending limb which leads back up to the distal convoluted tubule in the cortex most human nephrons are termed cortical nephrons because their corpuscles are located in the mid to outer cortex and their loops of henle are very short and pass only into the outer medulla but a small portion are called juxtamedullary nephrons and their loops travel deep into the inner medulla these nephrons are important in concentrating the urine by increasing the amount of water reabsorbed distal convoluted tubules lead into collecting tubules and ducts which pass through the medullary pyramids to the papillae see  orientation of the nephron diagram step 1 in urine formation filtration  fluid pressure forces water and dissolved substances out of the blood into bowmans capsule filtration averages 125 mlmin for your two kidneys this amounts to about 180 liters per day since we urinate an average of 1500 ml per day more than 99 must be returned to the blood filtration involves the small molecules water electrolytes urea glucose amino acids it does not involve the blood proteins or cells the large amount of filtration is the result of the porous glomerular membrane and filtration slits in the visceral layer of bowmans capsule step 2 reabsorption  the return of substances from the filtrate to the blood and interstitial fluid the major substances reabsorbed are water na cl glucose and amino acids some of the urea together with other salts are also reabsorbed water is reabsorbed by osmosis entering the proximal convoluted tubule the filtrate is very dilute compared to the blood 65 of water reabsorption occurs from the pct as a result of this osmotic gradient as the filtrate enters the descending limb of the loop of henle especially in juxtamedullary nephrons with long loops it is exposed to increasingly hypertonic medulla this pulls at least another 20 of absorbable water out of the filtrate reabsorption in this area is termed obligatory because it must occur due to the osmolarity of the surrounding interstitial fluid as the filtrate enters the ascending limb the tubule becomes impermeable to water otherwise it might actually diffuse back into the tubule as the osmotic gradient reverses when the filtrate now nearly urine passes through the medulla again in the collecting tubule it is once again exposed to the hypertonicity of the deep medulla this has the potential to pull more water out by osmosis but reabsorption of water from the collecting tubule is facultative because it is under control of the hormone adh see below the countercurrent mechanisms to increase water reabsorption1 the countercurrent multiplier  this mechanism works in the loop of henle to increase water reabsorbed from the descending limb as a result of salt reabsorbed from the ascending limb the term countercurrent comes from the fact that fluid is moving in opposite directions in the two limbs of the loop this magnifies the effect of transport from one limb on transport from the other limb the same principle is at work in heat exchangers used in industry2 the countercurrent exchange of salt in the vasa recta the vasa recta has descending and ascending limbs too blood flowing into the medulla in the descending limb picks up salt from the hypertonic medulla as the surrounding medullary fluid becomes more and more salty toward the papilla the gradient increases and more and more salt is picked up by the descending vasa recta limb but as the blood heads back up to the cortex in the ascending limb of the vasa recta the interstitial fluid becomes less and less salty this causes the gradient to reverse and salt diffuses back out of the vasa recta into the medulla this helps to conserve salt and keep the medulla hypertonic3 urea is also reabsorbed passively from the nephron and this too helps to keep the surrounding fluid hypertonic and pulling water this same urea will be filtered later and may in fact be reabsorbed again overall though urea experiences a net loss from the body because more is filtered and released in the urine than is reabsorbed step 3 secretion secretion is the release by active transport of substances into the filtrate it is accomplished by the tubular lining cells the substances released are usually derived from the blood in the peritubular capillaries actually secretion has already been going on but it is the third process we consider it begins in the proximal convoluted tubule and continues in the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting tube it is done for three purposes1 to release any residues from toxins and drugs which havent bee filtered2 to establish electrolyte balance since positive ions namely sodium are reabsorbed positive ions must be secreted in exchange the first choice is potassium k  in addition negative ions will be managed this usually means chloride cl  will either be secreted or will diffuse down its electrochemical gradient other anions may be available for release such as sulfate but certain ions will never be secreted for example bicarbonate will always be retained to help manage the buffering capacity of blood3 acid  base balance usually this means getting rid of acid the first choice for this is h   hydrogen ions are derived from the reaction of carbon dioxide and water just as they are in the rbc and in stomach lining cells the reaction yields carbonic acid which dissociates into h  and hco 3 as youve already learned the bicarbonate produced is retained for the buffer as mentioned above and exchanged for chloride called the chloride shift hydrogen ions can be secreted during moderately acidic conditions but when you have more severed acidity they reach their limit called the tubular maximum at that point they neutralize some of the h  with nh 2 and nh 3 groups derived from certain amino acids the result is ammonium ions nh 4  which are secreted during these more severely acidic conditions during extreme acidity they can also secrete phosphoric acid since the hydrogen ions and ammonium ions are also cations less potassium is secreted during acidic conditions as well since conserving potassium may be important for many people consuming liquids which are acidic as well as contain potassium are important in supplying the needed potassium and encouraging it to be retained by the body citrus juice although containing potassium does not acidify the blood greatly but cranberry juice grape juice watermelon etc work well cranberry juice also acidifies the urine which can help discourage bacteria and some types of kidney stones cranberry juice also reduces the adherence of bacteria onto the walls of the urinary tract thus reducing urinary tract infections the adh mechanism for controlling facultative reabsorption reabsorption in the collecting tubule is controlled by a hormone from the posterior pituitary gland known as adh antidiuretic hormone actually this hormone is released by nerve fibers coming from the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary adh is then released into the blood on command of the hypothalamus the hypothalamus responds to high blood osmolarity increased osmolarity results from water loss and dehydration from sweating vomiting and the like and from simply not taking in enough replacement water adh allows water to be reabsorbed from the collecting tubule and not leave the body with the urine the water is reabsorbed by osmosis due to medullary hypertonicity lack of adh causes the production of a large amount of dilute urine a condition called diabetes insipidus juxtaglomerular apparatus  jga and the tubuloglomerular mechanism in autoregulation the juxtaglomerular apparatus is a place where the distal convoluted tubule lies close to the glomerulus and to the afferent and efferent arterioles within the jga is a group of cells lining the distal tubule called the macula densa cells these cells monitor the rate of filtrate flow in the distal tubule which is directly related to the glomerular filtration rate gfr and the glomerular pressure it also monitors the salt levels in response to rising salt levels and reduced gfr the macula densa cells do two things1 the macula densa causes the juxtaglomerular cells lining the arterioles to secrete renin renin acts as an enzyme to cause a substance already in the blood angiotensinogen to undergo a structural change to become angiotensin i which is then converted to angiotensin ii by angiotensin converting enzyme see  angiotensin converting enzyme ace  angiotensin ii acts as a vasoconstrictor first causing vasoconstriction in the efferent arteriole since the efferent arteriole is the outflow from the glomerulus constricting it rapidly raises glomerular pressure angiotensin ii also causes the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubule to increase na reabsorption more sodium reabsorption means more water reabsorption and more water reabsorption means and increase in blood pressure2 the macula densa also acts directly on the afferent arteriole and cause it to vasodilate so at the same time the efferent arteriole is constricting the afferent arteriole is dilating bringing in more blood and the combination dramatically raises glomerular pressure and gfr other autoregulation  the only mechanism responsive to high blood pressure is the direct myogenic autoregulation of the afferent arteriole this vessel like others in the body responds to high pressure with vasoconstriction this reduces blood flow into the glomerulus and brings gfr back down to normal levels this mechanism works only for transitory pressure increases and is not effective against sustained hypertension normal and abnormal constituents of urine see table 262the ureter bladder and the micturition reflex urine travels to the urinary bladder through the ureter by peristalsis the ureter has two layers of smooth muscle which work like smooth muscle in the intestine except they are in reversed position longitudinal toward the inside circular toward the outside the ureter is lined with transitional epithelium to allow for stretch and reduce back pressure on the kidney the bladder is also lined with transitional epithelium and has many rugae for expansion the bladders detrusor muscle consists of three layers like the stomachs and also serves for compression at the lower end of the bladder the ureteral openings form a triangle with the urethra which is called the trigone the trigone has longitudinal folds which funnel the urine toward the urethra these folds help squeeze the ureteral openings closed when micturition occurs the urethra varies from a short tubule in females to a longer tubule in males with several sections see diagram near the bladder the urethra is lined with transitional epithelium and near the external os it is stratified squamous while in the middle it is pseudostratified columnar epithelium when urine pressure stimulates pressoreceptors in the bladder wall it triggers a parasympathetic reflex which stimulates mild detrusor contractions and relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter pathways to the brain stimulate the sense of a need to urinate then when conditions are appropriate additional parasympathetic stimuli result in micturition and voluntary stimuli relax the external sphincter see figure 2619disorders
