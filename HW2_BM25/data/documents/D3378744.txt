always confined to a single limb this usually involves only the lower extremities and on medial side of the epiphysis it is named after researcher david trevor 1diagnosis  editdifferential diagnosis  edittrevor disease can often mimic posttraumatic osseous fragments 2 3 synovial chondromatosis ostechondroma or anterior spur of ankle 4 5 6 7 it is not possible to distinguish deh from osteochondroma on the basis of histopathology alone 8 6 special molecular tests of the genes ext1 ext2 are used for the analysis of genetic expressions these are within normal ranges in deh while they are lower in ostechondroma owing to a mutation 2 6 9 10 these tests are expensive and the diagnosis is often made on clinical and radiological findings synovial chondromatosis occurs in a much older age group and can be ruled out on this basis 2treatment  editmost reported cases of deh in the literature have been treated surgically with excision of the mass as well as by the correction of any deformity while preserving the integrity of the affected joint as much as possible 2 11 12 13history  edittrevor disease was first described by the french surgeon albert mouchet and j belot in 1926 in 1956 the name dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica was proposed by fairbank 1 the usual symptoms are the appearance of an osseous protuberance on one side of the knee ankle or foot joint which gradually increases radiologically 14 the condition shows a nonuniformity of growth and multiple unconnected ossification centers around the epiphyses 8see also  editmultiple epiphyseal dysplasia references  edit a b
