inelastic collisions while collisions in the real world happen in many different and various ways we will restrict our attention to two particular kinds of collisions total momentum is always conserved s p l a t  b o i n gs p l a ttotally inelastic collisions are those in which the two objects collide and remain together and go off with a common final velocity b o i n gtotally elastic collisions are those in which the kinetic energy is also conserved spla t inelastic collisionsremember that momentum is a vector that means that motion to the right carries positive momentum while motion to the left carries negative momentum p tot  p 1  p 2p toti  p 1i  p 2ip 1f  p 2f  p totf momentum conservation means p toti  p totf p toti  p 1i  p 2i  m 1 v 1i  m 2 v 2i remember velocity and momentum are both vectors for straightline motion that means a velocity or momentum toward the right is positive and a velocity or momentum toward the left is negative that should sound familiar for an in elastic collision the two objects stick together and move off with a common velocity this means p totf  m tot v f  m 1  m 2 v f now we can use momentum conservation as p toti  p totfm 1 v 1i  m 2 v 2i  m 1  m 2 v f often we might want to know the final velocity v f if we have started with all the initial conditions then we can readily solve for v fv f   m 1 v 1i  m 2 v 2i   m 1  m 2 example two blocks with masses m 1  15 kg and m 2  25 kg approach each other with initial velocities v 1i  20 ms and v 2i   30 ms as shown in this diagram the two blocks collide in a totally inelastic collision that means they stick together after they collide what is their common final velocity after the inelastic collision we know that momentum is conserved so we will find the total momentum initially before the collision and set that equal to the total momentum finally after the collision remember momentum is a vector so the direction of the motion  and the sign of the velocity or the momentum  is very importantp tot  p 1  p 2p toti  p 1i  p 2i  m 1 v 1i  m 2 v 2i p toti  15 kg 20 ms  25 kg   30 msp toti  30 kg ms  75 kg ms p toti   45 kg ms momentum conservation means p toti  p totf p totf  m tot v f  40 kg v f p toti   45 kg ms  40 kg v f  p totf 45 kg ms  40 kg v f 40 kg v f   45 kg msv f    45 kg ms   40 kgv f   1125ms the negative sign means that the system moves to the left more examples inelastic collisions in two dimensions momentum is a vector this means that when we talk of momentum conservation and write p toti  p totfwe really mean p totix  p totfxm 1 v 1ix  m 2 v 2ix   m 1  m 2  v fx p totiy  p totfym 1 v 1iy  m 2 v 2iy   m 1  m 2  v fy example two cars collide at an intersection as sketched below the collide in a totally in elasc collision that is their bumpers and sheet metal become locked together so they will have to be forceably separated after the accident what is their common velocity  speed and direction  after the accident car number 1 has a mass of 1200 kg and moves with an initial velocity of 10 ms to the east while car number 2 has a mass of 1500 kg and moves with an initial velocity of 12 ms to the north what is the initial total momentum of this two car system remember momentum is a vector so when we write p toti  p 1i  p 2iwe really mean p totix  p 1ix  p 2ix p totix  m 1 v 1ix  m 2 v 2ixv 1ix  10 ms v 2ix  0p totix  1200 kg 10 ms  0p totix  12 000 kg ms p totiy  p 1iy  p 2iy p totiy  m 1 v 1iy  m 2 v 2iyv 2ix  0 v 2iy  12 ms p totiy  0  1500 kg 12 msp totiy  18 000 kg ms using momentum conservation once we know the initial total momentum we also know the final total momentum p totix  12 000 kg ms p totfx  p totix p totfx  12 000 kg ms p totfx  m tot v f p totfx  2 700 kg v fx 2 700 kg v fx  12 000 kg msv fx   12 000 kg ms   2 700 kgv fx  444 ms p totiy  18 000 kg ms p totfy  p totiy p totfy  18 000 kg ms p totfy  m tot v fy p totfy  2 700 kg v fy 2 700 kg v fy  18 000 kg msv fy   18 000 kg ms   2 700 kgv fy  667 ms now we know the components of the final velocity
