just exactly what is codependenceby dr irene matiatos some of the nicest people i know are codependent they always smile never refuse to do a favor they are happy and bubbly all the time they understand others and have the ability to make people feel good people like themso what is wrong with this nothing really unless the giving is onesided and so excessive that it hurts the giver then the giver is showing the signs of codependence partners who go out of their way for each other are interdependent only relatively healthy people are capable of interdependent relationships which involve give and take it is not unhealthy to unilaterally give during a time when your partner is having difficulty you know your partner will reciprocate should the tables turn interdependency also implies that you do not have to give until it hurts by comparison in a codependent relationship one partner does almost all the giving while the other does almost all the taking almost all of the time by giving codependent people avoid the discomfort of entitlement giving allows them to feel useful and justifies their existence rather than simply approving of themselves codependent people meet their need for selfesteem by winning their partner’s approval also because they lack selfesteem codependent people have great difficulty accepting from others one must feel deserving and entitled in order to accept what is offered codependent behavior is not easy it requires a lot of work it hurts these individuals typically suffer with low selfesteem depression anxiety and especially guilt as well as other painful thoughts and feelings they judge themselves using far stricter criteria than they use to measure the performance of others while they are brutally critical of their own misbehavior they are very good at justifying and excusing the misbehavior of others codependent people misplace their anger they get angry when they shouldnt and dont get angry when they should they have little contact with their inner world and thus very little idea about how they feel usually they dont want to know because it gives rise to painful emotions it is easier to stay on the surface and pretend things are peachy keen rather than deal with the stuff going on inside if they were to look inside they would find their emotional starvation they are busy taking care of others yet they do not meet their own needsthey may put up with abusive relationships or relationships that are not fulfilling because any warm body beats gasp no warm body being alone is perceived as scary empty depressing etc after all who will deliver their emotional supplies who will distract them so there is no time to deal with their inner life even an abusive relationship is better than no relationship these loving giving people find interesting ways of explaining their behavior to themselves loyal to a fault a codependent individual is likely to rationalize a loved ones disrespectful behavior by making excuses for them he doesnt mean it it was not done with malice it is the best he can do she had such an awful childhood etc etc etc the central concept is that the codependent individual takes it and understands despite feeling hurt waiting for brownie points in heaven or for a loved one to be magically healed through their persistent love and care taking they accept disrespect from others it does not occur to the codependent person that it is not ok to take it and put up no matter whatmuch of this abuse acceptance occurs without the codependent individual feeling abusedmore accurately these individuals do not feel ok enough to expect respectful treatment at all times and to notice when it is not forthcoming having grown up in a home where a parent or sibling demanded inordinate attention due to addiction illness anger or other problem the codependent person is trained to care for others having grown up in a difficult environment a negative emotional climate is experienced as normal and familiar this is why there is often little recognition of disrespect if their partner is angry or upset the codependent individual will implicitly assume that they did something to cause the anger it does not occur to them that it is their partners responsibility to deal with their problem and to treat others respectfully it does not occur to them that it is their responsibility to themselves to stop another persons demeaning behavior toward them but how can stop disrespect when misbehavior is not perceived as disrespectful or abusive disrespect is normal an unfortunate side effect of the codependent persons willingness to ignore excuse or otherwise allow the partners abuse or disrespect enables the misbehavior directed at them to continue and intensify implicit or explicit permission to continue misbehaving is granted since the codependent partner understands because codependent individuals are approvaldriven they cannot stand it when others are angry at or disappointed with them as such they unwittingly place themselves in a position to be taken advantage of the more approval is needed the less likely is the individual to realize the extent of their selfsacrifice in favor of tending to the needs of the other this hurts  ouchhh  and creates or maintains depression and low selfesteem in a vicious downward spiral while abuse disrespect or unrequited sacrifice angers them as it should codependent people do not realize how angry they are and at whom they are angry targeting the appropriate person may jeopardize a source of approval and selfesteem to avoid facing reality they distort it codependent individuals are likely to somehow blame themselves and rationalize their oversensitivity they justify the other persons behavior by thinking they must deserve the treatment they are getting this is preferable to facing the possibility that an individual who provides a measure of their selfesteem is hurting them angeris a signal that something is wrong and needs attention anger is healthy it is a signal that something is wrong and needs attention however if the source of anger is not articulated how can it be fixed codependent people are expert at denying anger and turning it against the self  into sadness and depression instead of asking themselves why are they are putting up with… fill in the blank they ask themselves how they could have behaved differently  to obtain a more favorable reaction from their partnerunarticulated anger is often misdirected and expressed inappropriately anger may be experienced as resentment expressed as an aggressive blowup or in passiveaggressive acting out the cognitive and verbal skills to appropriately assert oneself are lacking since codependent people are experts at controlling other peoples thoughts feelings and behavior they feel hurt that others dont reciprocate and know what they need if they really loved me they would know not so since codependents do not have the selfesteem to ask for what they secretly want they are unlikely to get it if they do make a request it is often a roundabout hint if their partner cannot decipher the request they feel hurt and unloved they believe they conveyed their desires when in fact they have notbecause most codependent individuals are controloriented they are very responsible they are great employees tasks are done thoroughly and on time even parts of the job that are not theirs get picked up if coworkers are neglectful or slow they try to control outcomes whether those outcomes are completed job tasks or reactions from other people anything for approval however some codependent individuals are very irresponsible in select or diverse life areas they dont know how to or dont feel the need to take care of some of their own basic needs especially if there is another person to care for instead why spend the time trying to figure out what the self needs when the self doesnt really matter anyway it is far more preferable to be out avoiding ones own issues out having fun hunting for a partner or selfmedicating feelings codependent people are addiction prone they may drink too much shop too much eat too much etc dulling the senses is a great way to avoid knowing yourself and dealing with your feelings intimacy is avoided intimate behavior requires familiarity and comfort with ones internal world since the codependent person regards ordinary human needs as shameful embarrassing dangerous or otherwise uncomfortable meeting basic needs are often dismissed any relationship that ignores the self is superficial unfortunately superficial relationships are safebut empty and unfulfilling control is central to the mo of the codependent person they control their selfesteem by catering to others needs they control by their overresponsible performance picking up where others leave off they control by avoiding intimacy or by clouding the mind they control by advising others on what to do these individuals work very hard to control everything and everybody yet they neglect the one person they do have control over themselves read an example of taking control here why be codependentby dr irene matiatos why would anybody spend time and energy to control outcomes while actively neglecting the inner self how can they do this and not realize they are selling themselves short the why they know no other way the how they received very good training early in life any dysfunction in the family predisposes a child to codependent behavior children are biologically programmed to seek love and approval they have to be cared for or they will die when a parent or family member is dysfunctional the child tends to focus on this personrather than on enjoying a carefree and joyful kid existence the child has to worry if the caretaker does not care take the child dies for example in an alcoholic home little sally has to worry about whether she can bring friends home  because daddy may be in a bad mood and embarrass her such events are training her in codependent thinking the art of anticipating the other person if mom is physically ill teddy has to worry about exerting her who would care for him if anything happened to her if daddy is angry and controlling timmy needs to worry about pleasing him to avoid punishment and humiliation  and to get his conditional love and approval children are naturally egocentric that means that they see the world revolving around them if mom and dad fight children feel that it is somehow their fault julie may try to make her parents happy by getting straight as in school in an attempt to keep the parental marriage together another child may have an abusive or simply overactive older sibling since the parents cannot be there at all times to police the situation the younger sibling may learn to anticipate the sibs moods and to behave in ways that might increase the probability of safety or perhaps daddy is depressed jennifer may tiptoe around him wondering if he is unhappy because she is not good enough and so on in sum codependent thinking tends to develop any time a child is growing up in a home where life is not care free often addiction can be traced in the family tree of these dysfunctional families whether there is an active addict in residence or not nevertheless these kids have an adult they have to worry aboutthe codependentintraining is taught to walk on eggshells to ensure survival the child learns to be extraordinarily sensitive in reading the moods and thoughts of others the child learns very early to pay attention to and tiptoe around the dysfunctional family members  at the childs expense these interactions take place silently implicitly the child learns to ignore the selfs inner needs instead pretending that all is ok when i tell my clients that codependent adults were once children who had an adult to worry about some sharply disagree they tell me about the loving families they came from and insist that their family members were wonderful etc as denial melts and selfawareness develops they begin to recognize the failings in a caregiver that spawned their selflessness sometimes both parents were codependent modeling no other behaviors for the child to learn help can i fix itby dr irene matiatos good news you certainly can you can get control over your life you can stop trying to control the lives of others and take charge of yourselfwhile children are truly not responsible for their actions adults are to experience a more satisfying life it becomes incumbent upon the adult to
