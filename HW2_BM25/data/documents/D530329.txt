answerscom ® wiki answers ® categories science physics mechanics waves vibrations and oscillations what indicates the amplitude of a compressional wave flag what indicates the amplitude of a compressional wave answer by bryan johnson confidence votes 21football life the amplitude of a compressional wave like a sound wave is determined by the concentration of molecules in each compression the higher the amplitude or energy that a wave carries the more compact the molecules are in a compression the lower the amplitude the more spread out those particles are the amplitude of a compressional wavelike a sound waveis determined by the contretration of waves in a compression10 people found this useful was this answer useful yes somewhat no majestic q 16 contributions what is a compressional wave answer 1 a compressional wave is a wave that is close together and transverse waves are waves that are going the way the wave travels answer 2 basically its a sound wave …faustina jeff 9 contributions what is compressional waves compressional waves are waves that move parallel to their direction sam chase 9 contributions the amplitude of a compressional wave depends on the density of material in compressions and rarefractions what is the difference between a compressional wave with a large amplitude and one with a small amplitudea larger amplitude means a smaller sound and a smaller amplitudemeans a larger sound explain how the spacing between coils of a spring changes if the amplitude of compressional waves traveling along the spring increasesidk because im doin homework right now and i have no clue what to put down desert winds 7 contributions how does amplitude affect a compressional wave the waves get closer together how is the amplitude of a compressional wave determined the amplitude of a compressional wave is related to how tightly the medium is pushed together at the compressions in a compressional wave the denser the medium is at the compression the smaller its amplitudeits larger looked it up in my book what does the amplitude of a compressional wave depend on well i take it you mean a wave in the air like a sound wave alternating compressions of air volume of a sound wave  a type of compressional wave is our perception of it …how do you measure the amplitude of a compressional wave there are two types of waves longitudinal and transverse in a longitudinal wave the wave moves parallel to the disturbance in a transverse wave the wave moves in a direct …is a compressional wave mechanical or compressionalcompressional how the spacing between coils of a spring changes as the amplitude of a compressional wave traveling along the spring increases in a spring squeezing some coils together more tightly causes the nearby coils to be more spread apart so this is how it increases answered in science explain how the spacing between coils of a spring changes as the amplitude of a compressional wave traveling along the spring increases in a spring squeezing some coils together more tightly causes the nearby coils to be more spread apart swaroop kumar ml answe 7 contributions answered in science what does the amplitude of a sound wave indicate amplitude is the maximum extent of vibration of a body from its mean position the amplitude of a sound wave indicates the loudness of the sound answered in physics describe the difference between a compressional wave with a large amplitude and one with a small amplitudei big beef that has one big wave answered in grand am sehow does the spacing between coils of a spring changes as the amplitude of a compressional wave traveling along the spring increases for example when you have a spring you pull it and some of it is tight together and some is spread out the spread out part is called a rarefaction and the tight part is co …answered in grand am sehow the spacing between coils of a sring change if the amplitude of compressional waves travling along the spring increasesif you squeeze a part of the spring close together the other part of the spring is going to be more apart
