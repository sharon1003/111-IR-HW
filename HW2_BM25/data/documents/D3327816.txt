research food truck regulations can differ from state to state so you will need to research what the restrictions are in the area where you plan to operate your food truck start by looking for what permits or licenses you will need and if there are any specific guidelines to what size your step van has to be or type of fuel it has to use you will also need to research where you will store your truck when not in use and which food distributors you will want to partner with the second part of the research will involve how you plan to finance your investment you will have to analyze your options and check if you are eligible for grants if you will qualify for a loan if you will need an investor or if you will use your personal savings to fund your new business what equipment can be

we suggest asking your food truck builder for professional advice what should i consider when comparing food truck builders when comparing food truck builders we recommend looking at how many food trucks or trailers they have built and what is the level of quality of their work pay special attention to their kitchen layouts and the brand of the equipment they frequently use ask if they offer any warranty on their fabrication and what kind of support you can expect from them once they deliver your truck lastly research their business online and look for pictures of their past clients and their contact information so you can reach out to them for an honest referral be sure to check their website and social media channels for clues on how they treat their customers and how they stand against their competitors also spend some time reading online reviews and looking for any media coverage they may have had in the past what size truck do i need typically a 16’ or 18’ stepvan is ideal
