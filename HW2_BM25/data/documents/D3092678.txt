wireless internet for all of your devices wow 4 gb for 4000 for theinternet and i can connect 5 devices at once sounds too good to be true or is it nowlets see if you like to watch youtube videos which is streaming that 4gb should lastforever right but wait it’s only been 20 minutes and my family of 5 are loving the speedand everything and then…………… stop what happened to the internet you guys it’snot working i better call st tech support i know they can help me what i used up my4000 card no that can’t be all 5 of us were only on for 20 minutes and bam theinternet just stopped it shows i am connected but nothing is coming through ugh what doyou mean streaming video on youtube uses more gb of data much more than downloadinginternet files mp3’s pics etc… o well i can just by another 4000 card that’s allbut wow it sure adds up quick this is a realistic example of what you get with thesewireless devices verizon att etc all have similar stuff i know someone who was tieddown to those low 4gb plans and talk about feeling restrained he spent upwards of 90 onemonth and i told him he should get rid of that unit but if you just want to use it forthat very quick check of email and news just don’t watch the news video because it’sstreaming too then it may be ok now remember folks most places have free wirelessinternet no matter where you go to check your email news and watch streaming videoincluding youtube and spend 2 hours there and have it free so if you purchase one ofthese devices and waste your hard earned money on one of those plans on top of it youwill see just how far you go with it you might as well flush the money you just spentdown the toilet let’s face it how many of you actually use 4 gb in a matter of hours byyourself lf you like to listen to or watch youtube unless your a hermit who only readstext and does not have your pics flash or video activated in your internet browser thisis the thing for you i hope after you read the very small print that you see what youreally get and thanks to this review i just saved you 12000 for the unit and themonthly plan so be careful when you see something like this that looks too good to betrue because it may just drain your wallet arthur january 20 2014 at 839 am  permalink you need to learn how much data is consumed with streaming it is huge this is not meant for that a movie will use scores of gband this was never designed for that purpose caveat emptor research before you buy alien martian november 10 2014 at 1015 am  permalink sounds to me like he did learn caveat emptor indeed my problem is when is our american infrastructure going to catch up with europe and why have these mobile broadband device plans continued to offer us nothing in the way of real economy i am tired of hearing the same old excuse about “bogging down the towersservers” it is the 21st century we can do better than this in his defense all the carriers advertise “video streaming” as one of the hot points when selling these plans that makes your insulting argument invalid try not to be such an assbag rahsaan brayboy december 9 2013 at 712 am  permalink yep… i got suckered i bought their mobile hotspot thinking to myself… eureka… i used up the 25gb of high speed very quickly apparently…without really even knowing it just streaming hulu and netflix into my tv… dang don’t even think about calling tech support it is all outsourced to some foreign country…i don’t know if these people are indian or philipino malaysian or whatever… i almost hung up several times due to the language barrier the straighttalk website is horrible i can’t even view the data i have left… it simply won’t even boot up without crashing i’m thinking to myself…what kind of bs is this… i thought i made a good choice — cheap internet at home with the convenience of taking it everywhere i go……it was too good to be true glenn kromminga december 13 2013 at 244 pm  permalink extremely overpriced you can rent an verizon hotspot for 1000 per day i only need a hotsport when i travel which is only occasionally i am still not happy that i cannot use my cell phone for the occasional need have a limitation on the data usage but not on the cell phone i have complained to the fcc they contacted straight talk the more people that complain to the fcc the more pressure there will be on straight talk rahsaan brayboy december 14 2013 at 1107 pm  permalink i returned it and got a full refund never again…straight talk never again brubaker december 17 2013 at 200 pm  permalinkstill looking for something positive  can you face book or check bank statements or email without breaking my wallet knowing that streaming is out looking for something to take on the road and for camping ashwad december 19 2013 at 939 am  permalink if…and its a big if you were to check the size of the videos that you were trying to stream you would know that they are substantial in size a hd youtube video can easily surpass 4gb a full length netflix movie 4gb any day user error and ignorance is the problem here not the technology or the device rtfmchad january 8 2014 at 1022 am  permalinkthank you thank you thank you anyone who has had a cell phone plan and has paid for a data plan seperate from their calling and text plan knows that streaming video is the worst thing you can do jhonymarketing december 23 2013 at 928 am  permalinkrest of the website is really good jhonymarketing httpwwwmarketingseotoolscom jamie goodwin december 28 2013 at 503 am  permalink what is funny is it can be used all month long to surf the web and even play online games if you watch your usage you can play world of warcraft daily as long as you don’t use any addon and still be below 4gb of monthly data streaming is a huge data user the 5gb plan would last the average person who only needs it for mail and searching for things not videos well over 1 month mark june 19 2014 at 127 pm  permalink just burned through 5 gb in 11 days doing nothing but email and facebook and google plus no streaming video or music i even turned off auto updates on pc i had a verizon hotspot and never went through 5 gb in a month and watched you tube vids and downloaded music i think straight talk is doing something to speed up usage to sell more refill cards never but again amanda december 29 2013 at 510 pm  permalink has anyone used this for there xbox live tim december 29 2013 at 1024 pm  permalink here is some common sense for anyone listening if you are in a tmobile area get itmy 50 a month plus all the ridiculous taxes gets me unlimited talktextweb ok yes the web is up to 4g for the first 500mb clocked from beginning of billing cycle up to because you might not be on a 4g cell but the mb clock is always running till the magic 500 is hit and yes they warn you at 400 that you are about to run out of 4g then dropped to 2g speed for the rest of billing cycle but is really unlimited but wait there’s more no i am not an infomercial or work for them tethering or hot spot with your phone is wait for it free zip nada nothing just have to have a phone that is capable most of their smartphones are some well under 100 you can up your plan to unlimited 4g on phone for 20 bucks 2gb is 10 more the beauty is that if you buy unlimited 4g you get the first 25gb tethering or hot spot at 4g and then down to 2g for rest of month the unlimited 4g is for the phone only if you want to get a tablet that is a stand alone you can get one and if you don’t mind 2g it is 0 per month  yes nothing added to your bill and they will even sell you a cellular ipad example ipad mini cellular 16gb 429 at regular retail and no interest for 24 months oh by the way you could still tether it to your phone if you had the need for speed no need for an extra device  no need for separate billing plan for tablet or any device you want to hot spot more  my wife has a regular 299 ipad not a cellular so you can skip the 130 cellular price difference and turn on hot spot on your phone hard work i know ok so where are we forget international data roaming which is also free since i don’t get out of the country much but you may need that so it’s free oh yeah i forgot buy a phone that has wifi calling feature use your wireless router at the house as your cell tower perfect reception that feature though comes at a price of 0 a month yes free so what are we up to oh yeah 50 and tax just saying tmobile not the best coverage but man if it works you get a lot of features vlad february 11 2014 at 502 pm  permalink thanks tim i tried tethering and it works well how silly i was – looking for internet plan and device when i have already had all that in my phone thanks againkay july 17 2014 at 112 pm  permalink how can u find out if ur phone tethers i dont know ehat that is or how to find out on a phonebarry january 3 2014 at 1019 am  permalink don’t ever buy this straight talk mobile hot spot it stops working every 10 minutes and it it limited not unlimited the two months service card is the lie the service can end any time in two weeks or 3 weeks because they don’t want you to watch movies  the more you watch movies or use it too much the more it will expire soon arthur january 20 2014 at 834 am  permalink if you are not an idiot about how data capacity is used no you can’t do netflix streaming or large mpgs etc or skype then a gb can last a month of use for emails web browsing etc easily turn off your images and pic data in your browser and you will do better if you just need email text and don’t care about the images so for a business user or light user in remote locations this is great remember  it is mobile 3g so you can use it in your car standing still of course no need to go to mc donalds unless you need larger data capacity so if you don’t care about streaming etc this is great news for business budget users and folks in the willy wags with no dsl etc to get internet connected no contracts is great too it beats verizon data plans handily mlaissa january 27 2014 at 736 am  permalink total scam i bought 4gb used it for a few days and only to check my email and fb no movies no downloads of anything and guess what it stopped working i called customer service and they told me that they were not sure why it stopped working reset it and let me go back on two weeks later it stopped working again thinking i was out of data i went and bought one more gb i called them back again they said they did not think i used up the 4 gb and reset i put the 1 gb on reserve a couple days go by and then it stops working again this time i call back customer service and the man tells me that not only am i out of the 4 gb but i am also out of the 1gb that i had put on reserve i asked how could this be he proceeds to ask me if i have set up a password for my network i said no because no one ever told me i needed to do that i assumed the first time around when i was on the phone with the representative that the password i entered to go to the 192 website was the password to keep others from using my wifi wrong so the man tells me to call back when i get another card and they will help me set up my password so the wifi wont be public i buy another refill card come back home call straight talk and a women walks me through setting up the password an automatic password pops up and it is ridiculous as in “12345” ridiculous i ask her if i can change that password because that is so easy anyone trying to access my wifi can figure that out she says no at this point i am beyound pissed and hang up the phone i reboot and the network is still unsecure i go back in and change the password myself rebooted and now i have nooooo internet at all so to sum it all up i spent 115 dollars in a matter of a month on internet that the public was able to use an assigned passcode that any moron could figure out and data that i wont be able to use thank you straight talk for ripping me off ps dont expect much from customer service as they can barely speak englishcheri january 27 2014 at 916 pm  permalink clear internet works i first bought t mobil hot spot my grandson lived with me wanted to play his play station on line 4th day no

attsprint as the carrier 4g 20meg down and can tether box360 4 laptops and we’d all stream netflix xfinityhbogo all day all week for years now and never had an issue with a data cap it’s truly unlimited and only 4998month that’s just a little hint for all you out therethebigpoobah february 16 2014 at 154 am  permalink wth r u talking about  you just said you have 3 different cell phone companies on one phone so you can tether what a idiot doesn’t even make sense btw its already well know straighttalk is a pos  anybody with a brain cell can do just a llittle bit of research and find that tmobile is about as good as it gets but the reality is they all scam us not only do they sale these phones as if they are high end laptops they won’t even let us use the phones like we are suppose too they put caps on data um hello this is a data device with 1080p screen wtf  you think i paid 550 to see email in high def i can’t wait to leave this world humans suck rs february 16 2014 at 519 pm  permalink seriously have you ever used st straight talk doesn’t have their own network depending on the phone you get is who your service is actually through for example i have two st phones…my phone is through sprint my wife’s phone is through verizon both in the same house on the same account so to say that i have st with carriers sprint and verizon i’m not claiming a bunch of different things as you say…it’s just how they work further rather your carrier is any good depends on your area…where i’m at now att sucks but sorintverizon are good and tmobile is downright horrible go to central florida and it’s attverizon that are the best tmobile is next and sprint is horrible it just depends on their infrastructure in your area but considering how you can switch networks with straight talk just by using a different phone and you get the best of whatever network your on in that area with truly unlimited everything been with st for over 2 years and never been capped on anything…well over 10k sms a month don’t even think about keeping track of mins for voice and data well above 10gb a month…the only downside is their cs but if you are strong enough in what you are saying and keep pushing it you’ll get what you deserve i’ve had a free phone sent to me to replace a defective service phone worked find just the service in central florida for sprint again defective phones replaced lost air time replaced it’s not bad just stick to your guns and you’ll get what you deservejg february 16 2014 at 501 pm  permalink ha you’re right…humans do suck lol lol that last post cracked me up if wireless internet issues cause you not to want to be here…i’d hate to see what a real tragedy does lol don’t let the wireless scams get ya down my friend it’s all big brother and a scam get used to itthebigpoobah february 16 2014 at 538 pm  permalink you must be the only person ever to use a cell phone as a means to play xbox and never get capped even a cable company puts caps on there internet but you want all of us to believe that we can all go get a straight talk plan that offers tether and use it unlimited with no restrictions no caps 0 yea ok rolls eyes you must think we stupid there is a good reason why thousands of people put straight talk sucks or straight talk scammed me all over the net but you expect us to believe you lo l yea ok whateva hand to faceken april 23 2014 at 328 am  permalink i would never consider watching video over one of these devices i already pay enough for dish tv mike may 30 2014 at 931 pm  permalink you know whats funny… i sit here reading all of your idiotic reviews when i myself bought the unit at walmart just yesterday… i figured id give it a test drive… so i bought a 1 gb card just to see how much playing my mmorpgs would use data wise and wow i played for 5 hours and barely made a dent in 1g if you want to stream high def movies or shows… i suggest getting fios or cable internet with no data cap but untill then dont blame the people of verizon and straight talk for giving people who don’t have the option of a wired connection a way to play friggen warcraft maybe you should read up on items you are completely clueless about before you spend the money instead of sitting and being a bunch of little bish’s d june 9 2014 at 1024 pm  permalink had att no caps but got suckered into switching to straight talk and got cappeddiana june 15 2014 at 703 am  permalink to all the folks complaining about straight talk hot spot plan being a rip off even the reps at brands wireless stores will caution you on streaming videos or music and how quickly eats all the data plan very fast i am a heavy internet user and i bought a usb huawei with 5gb reloadable data plan for 90 days in europe i couldn’t even use all the data in 3 month period i average 6 to 8 hrs of internet use a day emails web browsing shopping and rarely some software and music downloading including updates again i never fell short of data i purchased internet movie streaming in the us and around the world is still very expensive using hot spot devices the best way to to do it is on a broadband plan bundle which is still very pricy these is the only true unlimited data plan that will not give you a huge bill cable and phone companies do not sell you anything for extra or free it is on their interest to have customers tied up to reoccurring payments and plans this is very much so in the us where phone plans are still very expensive and one gets very little for the moneykay july 17 2014 at 122 pm  permalink how do u find out if ur phone can tether i dont know alot about stuff like that sierra july 31 2014 at 1259 pm  permalink i’m computer smart to certain things when it comes to giga bytes and other stuff like that no i was like everyone else… cheap internet cool i do t have to deal with dishes and poles just hook it up to my one laptop i didn’t buy the hot spot though cause something inside of me was telling me no this isn’t a good idea i even asked the woman at walmart she’s like yeah it’s cheaper your data won’t go over and cost you more like contracts she failed though cause she said if you do go over you can simply buy another card sweetie i might not be the smartest human on earth but i’m not that stupid yeah pay 100for the hot spot then 50 for the card let’s say i use it up in a day go buy another 50 card mmmmmm no thank youchris august 6 2014 at 857 am  permalinkyes i use mine for playing online with play station and as long as i’m not watching movies or downloading a lot i can play online email fb and a few other things all month no problems for me just gotta be smarter than the device and know your limits and no netflix lol cindy august 13 2014 at 353 pm  permalink let me tell you how i’m using this device … i dropped my average 70month bill through tmobile since i live in maine and there is no 4g with tmobile unless you go waaaay down to the southern portion of the state so i wasn’t losing anything by letting them go then i went to walmart and spent 80 to buy the device and then downloaded a free app to my android phone … textfree with voice this app gives you a dedicated phone number voice mail unlimited text messages and you can buy blocks of 100 min for 199 the voice quality is very good but there is a slight delay 3 sec maybe so people just have to be polite and not talk when the other person is talking lol what i then did was purchase 3 blocks of min for 597 total i now have over 400 min … how did i manage that when i only paid for 300 min here’s the neat part … texfree gives you 2 free minutes just for watching a 20 sec advertising video there’s usually up to 5 videos available each day that you can watch so that’s an extra 10 min a day you can add without paying anything i watch the videos when i’m at home and on my regular wifi so i don’t use up my gb on the hotspot so for 15month now going forward i have unlimited text msg voice mail 1 gb of data and 400 min a month of calling and toll free numbers and incoming calls don’t use any minutes after i make a few calls i simply watch a couple of short videos to add the minutes back i should never need to purchase blocks of minutes again but if i do they are cheap straight talk works great throughout maine so this will be my cell phone service from now on thank you straight talk for coming out with such an inexpensive hotspot optionler0n august 18 2014 at 1229 pm  permalink“i watch the videos when i’m at home and on my regular wifi so i don’t use up my gb on the hotspot”how much do you pay for your “regula wifi” each month service provider cindy august 13 2014 at 400 pm  permalink forgot to add … over the last 2 days i’ve been using it i’ve been on fb both reading and posting checked email downloaded attachments from my email made at least 2 calls a day lots of texting and web browsing i’m only using about 2030 mb per day granted i only have my phone connected to it so maybe that’s why but i know not to stream movies music tv shows download apps etc if you use it like i described above an average user can replace their cell phone service without any regretsrobert october 25 2014 at 812 am  permalink i have a nifty little place on my phone that tells me how much data i’ve used so far nearly 5 gb in 22 days so i’ll use about 7gb per month however only 14 of that is mobile data the rest is wi fi only 650mb of that is used by the app that i’ll use this hotspot for no need to be scrolling g or facebook while on this hotspot save that for “real” wi fi those who say this is no good please remember this is meant for a mobile hotspot not to replace your home internet connection use your brains use a location aware app that will switch your wi fi connection to your home wi fi when you’re there or get in the habit of switching it manually and you’ll be fine you just have to use this judiciously like we did in the last decade when we paid for mobile internet on a per mb basis we were paying between ten cents and a dollar per mb this is just over a penny per mb we’re paying that much now for satellite phone data and in ten years even that will be down to about a penny per mbmakayla november 2 2014 at 734 pm  permalink can i use a 4g internet thingy and get out the ps3 with out using it all« previous next »
