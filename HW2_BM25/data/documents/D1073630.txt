it puts you right there inside the circulus viciosus9 december 2003  by ivona021 – see all my reviews for anyone interested in kusturicas work this is my favorite dont get discouraged because its set someplace you never traveled before people are all alike youll recognize the patterns easily it tells a story how come a country which appeared to everyone inside as an uniquely ideal world they arent aware where they are could abruptly dissolve in a really really bloody war the moment that the outside interferes and more then that it lets you live and learn through this experience yourself it tells what time heals or cant heal it tells a lot about people and about powers of mass deception and examines personal issues arising from such a condition it talks about a different set of values which can be understood only in a specific situation it makes you understand the balkans as well as any other region held together by a weird claustrophobic mix of hundreds of years of love and war on a small piece of land a thread so fragile that it would break if love gets any more removed from war then it ever was the sense of time in this movie is marvelously directed and the reason it starts as an action flick but then at one point starts to drag towards the end is because there is always always a slowdown just before the next big boomcollapse dont fight this feeling or youll miss on the experience it is like the truman show without the hollywood ending the movie is based on a play from serbian master playwright dusan kovacevic anything based on his plays is well worth the watching53
