introducing your new cat to your dog its important to have realistic expectations when introducing a new pet to a resident pet some cats are more social than other cats for example an eightyearold cat that has never been around other animals may never learn to share her territory and her people with other pets in the household however an eightweekold kitten separated from her mom and littermates for the first time might prefer to have a cat or dog companion cats are territorial and need to be introduced to other animals very slowly in order to give them time to get used to each other before there is a facetoface confrontation slow introductions help prevent fear and aggression problems from developing please note when you introduce pets to each other one of them may send play signals that can be misinterpreted by the other pet if those signals are interpreted as aggression by one animal then you should handle the situation as aggressive general pettopet introduction info confinement confine your new cat to one mediumsized room with her litter box food water and a bed feed your resident pets and the newcomer on each side of the door to this room this will help all of them to associate something enjoyable eating with each others smells dont put the food so close to the door that the animals are too upset by each others presence to eat gradually move the dishes closer to the door until your pets can eat calmly directly on either side of the door next use two doorstops to prop open the door just enough to allow the animals to see each other and repeat the whole process swap scents switch sleeping blankets or beds between your new cat and your resident animals so they have a chance to become accustomed to each others scent rub a towel on one animal and put it underneath the food dish of another animal you should do this with each animal in the house switch living areas once your new cat is using her litter box and eating regularly while confined let her have free time in the house while confining your other animals to the new cats room this switch provides another way for the animals to experience each others scents without a facetoface meeting it also allows the newcomer to become familiar with her new surroundings without being frightened by the other animals avoid fearful and aggressive meetings avoid any interactions between your pets that result in either fearful or aggressive behavior if these responses are allowed to become a habit they can be difficult to change its better to introduce your pets to each other so gradually that neither animal becomes afraid or aggressive you can expect mild forms of these behaviors but dont give them the opportunity to intensify if either animal becomes fearful or aggressive separate them and start over with the introduction process in a series of very small gradual steps as outlined above precautions if one of your pets has a medical problem or is injured this could stall the introduction process check with your veterinarian to be sure that all of your pets are healthy youll also want to have at least one litter box per cat and youll probably need to clean all of the litter boxes more frequently make sure that none of the cats are being ambushed by another while trying to use the litter box try to keep your resident pets schedule as close as possible to what it was before the newcomers appearance cats can make lots of noise pull each others hair and roll around quite dramatically without either cat being injured if small spats do occur between your cats you shouldnt attempt to intervene directly to separate the cats instead make a loud noise throw a pillow or use a squirt bottle with water and vinegar to separate the cats give them a chance to calm down before reintroducing them to each other be sure each cat has a safe hiding place cattodog introductions dogs can kill a cat very easily even if theyre only playing all it takes is one shake and the cats neck can break some dogs have such a high prey drive they should never be left alone with a cat dogs usually want to chase and play with cats and cats usually become afraid and defensive use the techniques described above to begin introducing your new cat to your resident dog in addition practice obedience if your dog doesnt already know the commands sit down come and stay you should begin working on them small pieces of food will increase your dogs motivation to perform which will be necessary in the presence of such a strong distraction as a new cat even if your dog already knows these commands work with obeying commands in return for a tidbit controlled meeting after your new cat and resident dog have become comfortable eating on opposite sides of the door and have been exposed to each others scents as described above you can attempt a facetoface introduction in a controlled manner put your dogs leash on and using treats have him either sit or lie down and stay have another family member or friend enter the room and quietly sit down next to your new cat but dont have them physically restrain her have this person offer your cat some special pieces of food or catnip at first the cat and the dog should be on opposite sides of the room lots of short visits are better than a few long visits dont drag out the visit so long that the dog becomes uncontrollable repeat this step several times until both the cat and dog are tolerating each others presence without fear aggression or other undesirable behavior let your cat go next allow your cat freedom to explore your dog at her own pace with the dog still onleash and in a downstay meanwhile keep giving your dog treats and praise for his calm behavior if your dog gets up from his stay position he should be repositioned with a treat lure and praised and rewarded for obeying the stay command if your cat runs away or becomes aggressive youre progressing too fast go back to the previous introduction steps positive reinforcement although your dog must be taught that chasing or being rough with your cat is unacceptable behavior he must also be taught how to behave appropriately and be rewarded for doing so such as sitting coming when called or lying down in return for a treat if your dog is always punished when your cat is around and never has good things happen in the cats presence your dog may redirect aggression toward the cat directly supervise all interactions between your dog and cat you may want to keep your dog onleash and with you whenever your cat is free in the house during the introduction process be sure that your cat has an escape route and a place to hide keep your dog and cat separated when you arent home until youre certain your cat will be safe precautions dogs like to eat cat food you should keep the cat food out of your dogs reach in a closet or on a high shelf eating cat feces is also a relatively common behavior in dogs although there are no health hazards to your dog its probably distasteful to you its also upsetting to your cat to have such an important object invaded unfortunately attempts to keep your dog out of the litter box by booby trapping it will also keep your cat away as well punishment after the fact will not change your dogs behavior the best solution is to place the litter box where your dog cant access it for example behind a baby gate in a closet with the door anchored open from both sides and just wide enough for your cat or inside a tall topless cardboard box with easy access for your cat a word about kittens and puppies because theyre so much smaller kittens are in more danger of being injured of being killed by a young energetic dog or by a predatory dog a kitten will need to be kept separate from an especially energetic dog until she is fully grown and even then she should never be left alone with the dog usually a wellsocialized cat will be able to keep a puppy in its place but some cats dont have enough confidence to do this if you have an especially shy cat you might need to keep her separated from your puppy until he matures enough to have more selfcontrol when to get help if introductions dont go smoothly seek professional help immediately animals can be severely injured in fights and the longer the problem continues the harder it can be to resolve conflicts between pets in the same family can often be resolved with professional help punishment wont work though and could make things worse copyright dumb friends league all rights reserved
