how much liquid fortifier to use in hypertufa  concrete recipes january 21 2012 by claudia brownlie  9 comments admixes liquid fortifiers acrylic strengtheners what is their purpose and how much to add to your hypertufa and concrete recipes i get emails quite often asking me about “liquid fortifiers” and exactly what are they what do they “do” and how much should be put into a ‘tufa or concrete recipe so today i’ll share what i do know about using various types of admixes first as is commonly referred to either here on my blog or in forums that discuss hypertufa and concrete garden art recipes and projects the term “admix” or “admixture” and “fortifier” and “liquid bonding agent” are usually synonymous basically an admix is an acrylic liquid and is used as strengtheners to enhance the longevity of the cured object though not always necessary to use in a recipe in many circumstances folks add in some admix as “insurance” that their object will be “stronger” but most times because they are making items that will go through a lot of freezethaws due to the climate they live in or because the object will be a stepping stone or rock that might take more abuse than a planter or trough would also many people working with pure concrete recipes versus a ‘tufa project want very thinwalled objects such as when they’re making hollow garden spheres an acrylic admix added into the recipe allows thinner walls that will hold up and not crack apart some acceptable and widely used acrylic bonding agent admixes used are latex paint – yes ordinary latex paint – interior or exterior probond concrete bonder made by the elmer’s glue company quikrete’s concrete bonding adhesive elmer’s glue – yes white elmer’s glue next there is a misconception that admixes will make your cured object completely water proof – nope though there is a bit of waterproofing that happens because of the nature of the admix ingredients an admixture’s sole purpose is to make the object much more durable and strong the next concern many crafters have is do i use just admix or do i add some into the water and if so how much water and how much admix do i use first let me state that for the basic backyard crafter there really isn’t such a thing as an “ideal ratio” you’ve got to use for maximum strength if you are a professional using concrete in a commercialtype application … then yes ratios of all your ingredients will be critical but many of us have found that even a small amount like 10 admix added into the water makes a noticeable difference in the strength of the object and also often in the speed of the curing time this being said folks may use the acrylic admix fortifier up to a ratio of 25 – but now it may start to get pricey unless you are using leftover latex paint that would ultimately be thrown out and i’ve read of those who use admixes at 100 and swear by the result i cannot recommend 100 admix as i’ve no experience doing soadmix reduces your water needas prev statedso pieces are less impacted by that old freezethaw cycle i use about 25 depends on the conditions of the daydoesn’t it admix in my masks coulda done withoutbut want my clients to get bang for buckand 100 in anything that has to hold water nowi’m branching out to make thinnerharder concrete pieces for your wall about 3812 inch down to an edgeso i’m trying other additives like silica fume and superplasticizer to see what i can make concrete do as they used to sayso very long ago”verrrrrrry interesting”paul i’ve been using acrylic polymers for quite a while in my work laying stone floors etc and i find they are excellent at bonding and imparting strength and also a little flexibility to concreteadhesives however they don’t make the product entirely ‘waterproof’ you need an admix that is designed specifically for that and add it into the mix water before adding the water to the sandcement these products are expensive but you may be able to purchase them in small quantities at your local hardware store the polymer acrylics will make the product a lot more waterproof than it would have been without it thoughhttpforums2gardenwebcomforumsloadhypertufamsg0611341823019html filed under concrete projects hypertufa projects  tagged concrete recipe garden art project hypertufa recipe hypertufa recipes
