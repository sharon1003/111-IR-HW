professionals can spot material from a class exercise or online tutorial the work you produce in school will often look like other students’ work so leave it out are you proud of the work you’ve done every frame should present your very best creative and technical work do you have one or two minutes of great material keep your reel short most people will give you a minute of their time to watch your reel but if it runs over two minutes it will likely lose their interest consider excluding clips that might not be your very best and go for a shorter reel you can always expand your reel later

not just your friends and family choose the type of reel there are two basic types of demo reels collagestyle reels are often cut to music and contain many short clips they are best for showcasing shortform commercial work also known as spot work the collagestyle reel example shown here by production company coyote post highlights the studio’s commercial music video narrative and vfx work scenebased reels usually contain longer segments maybe 15 seconds long showcasing a technique or specific theme they are best for showing off cinematography documentary or narrative work the scenebased reel example shown here from the visual effects team at stargate studios shows their “virtual backlot” library of over 200000 stock footage clips virtual environments cg props and vfx elements for photorealistic scene augmentation whatever structure or style you choose for your demo reel your goal is to move and engage your audience viewers tend to remember the first few moments and the very last shot — so grab their attention visuals should flow together well connecting themes and ideas dramatic scenes should clearly convey key elements of the story to allow viewers to quickly understand the tension and excitement of the moments you included let people see what you’re passionate about keep it personal include your name or company logo let people know who you are whether it’s at the start or end of your reel — or both include your contact information provide enough information phone number email address and website so that people can reach you either bake it into your reel as a title placed at the end or include your contact information when you post your video on you tube vimeo behance or your preferred social media platform cut to the beat of your music if it lends itself to this treatment show that you pay attention to detail and know how to present visuals professionally viewers will feel it if you’re ahead of the beat on the beat or after — and it’s worth experimenting with all three approaches to timing highlight work you’ve done for known brands give extra screen time to logos people will recognize this kind of shared branding is a powerful way to be more memorable always confirm that you have permission to use company logos or names show before and after clips if you’re a matte painter visual effects artist colorist or similar specialist and your audience is considering your work for a particular project these are key to highlighting your skills show sequence shots this is particularly important if you build visuals in stages the way 3d modelers and compositors do show authentic emotions if your reel includes dramatic scenes choose moments with the most genuine performances as these will engage your audience more powerfully be professional never use unlicensed copyrighted music it’s illegal and demonstrates a lack of awareness of the issue don’t take credit for work you didn’t do clearly label any clips for which you did only part of the work adding a simple text overlay that says “3d modeler” or “responsible for motion tracking” avoids confusion and shows you can work as part of a creative team don’t pad your reel repeated footage gives the impression that you don’t have enough to fill a reel make it shorter instead don’t forget to check for errors misspellings audio glitches and squeezedlooking aspect ratios work against you these are incredibly easy to miss a fresh pair of eyes often helps — if possible get a friend to check the video for you get feedback test your reel with audiences who can provide brutally honest feedback it will save you time and energy later if they give you frank criticism or suggestions for improvements tiny adjustments can make a big difference — like cropping out a microphone that crept into a shot or taking more time to perfect the soundtrack get as many opinions as you can from mentors and colleagues you trust ask them is the reel too long is there any clip that doesn’t represent me well is the order exactly right what would you like to see more of and most importantly would you hire me based on this reel tailor your reel some industry niches have their own demo reel standards do your research and tailor your reel to a specific company’s preferences which they may post on their website if your reel contains dramatic scenes demonstrate
