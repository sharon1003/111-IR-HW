250000 sq mi in size though estimates differ it is located west of the paraguay river and east of the andes and is mostly an alluvial sedimentary plain shared among paraguay bolivia and argentina it stretches from about 17° to 33° south latitude and between 65° and 60° west longitude though estimates differ historically the chaco has been divided in three main parts the chaco austral or southern chaco south of the bermejo river and inside argentinian territory blending into the pampa region in its southernmost end the chaco central or central chaco between the bermejo and the pilcomayo river to the north also now in argentinian territory and the chaco boreal or northern chaco north of the pilcomayo up to the brazilian pantanal inside paraguayan territory and sharing some area with bolivia locals sometimes divide it today by the political borders giving rise to the terms argentinian chaco paraguayan chaco and bolivian chaco inside paraguay people sometimes use the expression central chaco for the area roughly in the middle of the chaco boreal where mennonite colonies are established the chaco boreal may be divided in two closer to the mountains in the west the alto chaco upper chaco sometimes known as chaco seco or dry chaco is very dry and sparsely vegetated to the east less arid conditions combined with favorable soil characteristics permit a seasonally dry highergrowth thorn tree forest and further east still higher rainfall combined with improperly drained lowland soils result in a somewhat swampy plain called the bajo chaco lower chaco sometimes known as chaco húmedo humid chaco it has a more open savanna vegetation consisting of palm trees quebracho trees and tropical highgrass areas with a wealth of insects the landscape is mostly flat and slopes at a 0004 degree gradient to the east this area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the paranaparaguay plain division the areas more hospitable to development are along the paraguay bermejo and pilcomayo rivers it is a great source of timber and tannin which is derived from the native quebracho tree special tannin factories have been constructed there the wood of the palo santo from the central chaco is the source of oil of guaiac a fragrance for soap  paraguay also cultivates mate in the lower part of the chaco large tracts of the central and northern chaco have high soil fertility sandy alluvial soils with elevated levels of phosphorus 1 and a topography that is favorable for agricultural development other aspects are challenging for farming a semiarid to semihumid climate 600–1300 mm annual rainfall with a sixmonth dry season and sufficient fresh groundwater restricted to roughly one third of the region two thirds being without groundwater or with groundwater of high salinity soils are generally erosion prone once the forest has been cleared in the central and northern paraguay chaco occasional dust storms have caused major top soil loss history  editthe chaco was occupied by nomadic peoples notably the various groups making up the guaycuru who resisted spanish control often with success of the chaco from the 16th until the early 20th century prior to national independence of the nations that compose the chaco the entire area was a separate colonial region named by the spaniards as chiquitos the gran chaco had been a disputed territory since 1810 officially it was supposed to be part of argentina bolivia and paraguay although a bigger land portion west of the paraguay river had belonged to paraguay since its independence argentina claimed territories south of the bermejo river until paraguays defeat in the war of the triple alliance in 1870 established its current border with argentina over the next few decades bolivia began to push the natives out and settle in the gran chaco while paraguay ignored it bolivia sought the paraguay river for shipping oil out into the sea it had become a landlocked country after the loss of its pacific coast in the war of the pacific  and paraguay claimed ownership of the land this became the backdrop to the gran chaco war 1932–1935 between paraguay and bolivia over supposed oil in the chaco boreal the aforementioned region north of the pilcomayo river and to the west of the paraguay river  eventually argentine foreign minister carlos saavedra lamas mediated a cease fire and subsequent treaty signed in 1938 which gave paraguay three quarters of the chaco boreal and gave bolivia a corridor to the paraguay river with the ability to use the puerto casado and the right to construct their own port in the end no oil was found in the region road construction in the deep gran chaco during the 1960s mennonites immigrated into the paraguayan part of the region from canada in the 1920s more came from the ussr in the 1930s and immediately following world war ii these immigrants created some of the largest and most prosperous municipalities in the deep gran chaco the region is home to over nine million people divided about evenly among argentina bolivia brazil and including around 100000 in paraguay the area remains relatively underdeveloped in the 1960s the paraguayan authorities constructed the transchaco highway and the argentine national highway directorate national routes 16 and 81 in an effort to encourage access and development all three highways extend about 700 km 430 mi from east to west and are now completely paved as are a network of nine brazilian highways in mato grosso do sul state flora and fauna  editan algarrobo white carob tree in the gran chaco area of argentina this prized shade tree is common to the area the gran chaco has some of the highest temperatures on the continent it has high biodiversity containing around 3400 plant species 500 birds 150 mammals and 220 reptiles and amphibians 2the floral characteristics of the gran chaco are varied given the large geographical span of the region the dominant vegetative structure is xerophytic deciduous forests with multiple layers including a canopy trees subcanopy shrub layer and herbaceous layer there are ecosystems such as riverine forests wetlands savannas and cactus stands as well 3at higher elevations of the eastern zone of the humidsubhumid chaco there are transitional mature forests from the wet forests of southern brazil these woodlands are dominated by canopy trees such as handroanthus impetiginosus and characterized by frequent lianas and epiphytes this declines to seasonally flooded forests at lower elevations that are dominated by schinopsis spp a common plains tree genus often harvested for its tannin content and dense wood the understory comprises bromeliad and cactus species as well as hardy shrubs like schinus fasciculatus these lower areas lack lianas but have abundant epiphytic species like tillandsia the river systems that flow through the area such as the rio paraguay and rio parana allow for seasonally flooded semi evergreen gallery forests that hold riparian species such as tessaria integrifolia and salix humboltiana other seasonally flooded ecosystems of this area include palm dominated  copernicia alba savannas with a bunch grass dominated herbaceous layer to the west in the semiaridarid chaco there are mediumsized forests consisting of aspidospermum quebrachoblanco and schinopsis quebracho with a slightly shorter subcanopy made up of several species from the fabaceae family as well as several arboreal cacti species that distinguish this area of the chaco there is a scrublike shrub and herbaceous layer on sandy soils the thick woodlands turn into savannas where the aforementioned species prevail as well as species like jacaranda mimosifolia the giant stetsonia coryne found throughout the western semiaridarid region becomes very conspicuous in these sandy savannas there are various upland systems of plant associations that occur throughout the gran chaco the highlands of the argentinian chaco are made up of on the dry sunny side up to 1800m schinopsis haenkeana woodlands the cooler side of the uplands hosts zanthoxylum coco locally referred to as fagara coco and schinus molleoides locally referred to as lithrea molleoides as the predominant species other notable species include bougainvillea stipitata and several spp from fabaceae the paraguyan uplands have other woodland slope ecosystems notably those dominated by anadenanthera colubrina on moist slopes 3 both of these upland systems as well as numerous other gran chaco areas are rich with endemism faunal diversity in the gran chaco is high as well the gran chaco has high levels of biodiversity containing around 3400 plant species 500 birds 150 mammals and 220 reptiles and amphibians animals typically associated with tropical and subtropical forests are often found throughout the eastern humid chaco including jaguars howler monkeys peccaries deer and tapirs edentate species including anteaters and armadillos are readily seen here as well 4 being home to at least ten species the argentinian chaco is the location of the peak diversity for the armadillo including species such as the ninebanded armadillo  dasypus novemcinctus whose range extends north to the southern us and the southern threebanded armadillo  tolypeutes matacus  5 the pink fairy armadillo  chlamyphrous truncates  is found nowhere else in the world 6 the giant armadillo  priodontes maximus  while not found in the eastern humid chaco can be seen in the drier arid chaco of the west some other notable endemics of the region include the san luis tucotuco  ctenomys pontifex  4 this small rodent is only found in the argentinian chaco all of 60 species of ctenomys are endemic to the continent of south america the chacoan peccary  catagonus wagneri  locally known as tauga is the largest of the three peccary species found in the area this species was thought to be extinct by scientists until 1975 when it was recorded by dr ralph wetzel 7due to the climatic regime of the gran chaco herpetofauna are restricted to moist refugia in various places throughout the chaco rotting logs debris piles old housing settlement wells and seasonal farm ponds are examples of such refugia 8 the blacklegged seriema  chunga burmeisteri  bluecrowned parakeet  aratinga acuticadauta  picui ground dove  columbina picui  guira cuckoo  guira guira  little thornbird  phacellodomus sibilatrix and manycolored chaco finch  saltaitricula multicolor are notable of the 409 bird species that are resident or breed in the gran chaco 252 of these chaco species are endemic

chaco is one of south americas last agricultural frontiers very sparsely populated and lacking sufficient allweather roads and basic infrastructure the argentinian part is more developed than the paraguayan or bolivian part it has long been too remote for crop planting the central chacos mennonite colonies are a notable exception two factors may substantially change the chaco in the near

average 1130 hectares are cut down per day – this equals 2300 football fields the soy plantations not only eliminate the forest but also other types of agriculture as well indigenous communities are losing their land to agrobusinesses and suffer under the intense use of fertilisers and pesticides that poisons the water they depend on since 2007 there is a law which is supposed to regulate and
