types are important to understand because patients with rare blood types can have serious complications eg death if they receive the wrong one during a transfusion before we delve into the details of a rare blood type lets first discuss the basic genetics behind the blood typing system were all familiar with the abo blood group abo blood group the abo blood group is based on three different versions of a particular gene known as alleles one version produces the a antigen a second produces the b antigen and a third produces the o antigen in general humans possess two copies of every gene therefore a person who has two copies of the a allele would have the genotype aa and would have type a blood a person who has the a allele and the o allele would have genotype ao and would also have type a blood the reason is because the o allele doesnt generate an antibody response more on that in a little bit genotypes bb and bo yield type b blood a person with genotype ab has type ab blood and a person with genotype oo has type o blood a person with type a blood cannot receive type b blood the reason is immunological a person with type a blood does not have type b antigens thus his immune system considers the type b antigen to be foreign and attacks it a person with type a blood cant receive type ab blood either for the same reason he can however accept type o blood the human body does not make antibodies against the o antigen therefore its safe to give type o blood to anybody type o is considered the universal donor  this also explains why a person with genotype ao has type a blood the only immunologically relevant antigen is the a antigen a person with type ab blood is the luckiest since he already possesses both a and b antigens his immune system considers neither of these to be foreign and he can receive blood from anybody type ab blood is known as the universal acceptor  the abo blood group isnt the only one in fact there are about 34 different human blood groups now scientists in nature genetics have explained the genetic basis behind a rare blood group called vel vel blood group most people are vel velpositive meaning that they possess the vel antigen on the surface of their red blood cells however about 1 in 5000 individuals are vel velnegative and thus do not carry the antigen their immune system recognizes the vel antigen as foreign and if given vel blood they can experience kidney failure or possibly death a screen currently exists for this blood type but it can be inaccurate therefore identifying the blood types genetic basis will allow doctors to more easily screen patients the researchers sequenced the dna of five individuals who were vel four of these people were homozygous ie possessed two copies of the defective allele for a gene called smim1 this particular mutation was a deletion of 17 nucleotides causing the dna sequence to be  frameshifted   a catastrophic mutation from the genes point of view that destroys the integrity of the gene sequence therefore the vel antigen was not produced by these individuals cloning the smim1 gene and expressing it in tissue culture confirmed that it was responsible for producing the vel antigen further analysis and experimentation revealed that smim1 is linked to hemoglobin concentration although its relevance in this function is unknown overall the authors have made a major contribution to the field by identifying the genetic basis behind a rare blood group developing a genetic screen should make blood transfusions for vel individuals safer note this isnt the entire story there is another antigen called rh factor which makes blood  positive  negative depending on whether or not a person has it for example a person who is o has type o blood and is positive for rh factor for transfusions it is best to match as many blood types as possible but abo and rh are the most important type o blood is the universal donor while type ab is the universal acceptor source ana cvejic et
