on this page choosing a trail camera will the camera be used for wildlife or security or something else wildlife how big is your target species and how far away will the camera be security are you targeting people or vehicles or both choosing a trail camera when customers contact us we usually begin with the following questions will the camera be used for wildlife or security or something else by wildlife we would include things such as fauna surveys detecting the presence of species and hunting but also domestic animals such as farming controlled experiments such as with animal enclosures at a zoo backyard surveys and similar by security we mean things like detecting the presence of people for example trespassing or approaching something like a shed fuel store or door or vehicles for example going through a gate accessing a private road or traveling at speed by other we include some of the less common but specific requests we have had these include requiring time lapse photography for example to document a construction project over a period of weeks or months monitoring nests or nest boxes inspecting burrows or searching for snakes monitoring in marine environments such as on oil rigs and similar these are all fairly specialist activities except perhaps the time lapse wildlife how big is your target species and how far away will the camera be many people ask  what is the detection range  or how far away can the camera be the answer depends on the size of your target species it is best to think of it this way  imagine taking a photo of an elephant that is 100 metres away imagine how large the elephant would appear within the frame of your photo now imagine taking a photo of a mouse just 2 metres away how large would the mouse be in your photo most likely both animals would be roughly the same size within the photo therefore if you are targeting mice you want to get them as close to the camera as possible if you are targeting elephants you might have success even at 100 metres but it is hard to tell most cameras will quote detection ranges of approximately 50 to 60 feet ie 20 metres bear in mind the original market for trail cameras was for hunting  so you might reasonably say a deersized animal can be detected at 60 feet at this point we might discuss different techniques for bringing animals closer to the camera or the camera closer to animals additionally if you are targeting nonmammal species there are specific techniques you can employ security are you targeting people or vehicles or both this article is in progress come back soon
