so what is a tone a semitone etc the musical interval between two adjacent notes in a partition of the octave into twelve not necessarily equal intervals is called a semitone other names for it are a half step and a halftone in the equal temperament when the twelve intervals are equal two notes are a semitone apart if the ratio between their frequencies is the 12th root of 2 or about 105946 a tone is the musical intervals between two notes that have exactly one other note between them in a partition of the octave into twelve intervals in the equal temperament a tone is exactly twice a semitone and two notes are therefore a tone apart if the ratio between their frequencies is the 6th root of 2 which is the 12th root of 2 squared or about 11225 similarly an octave is actually an interval of six tones and a perfect fifth is an interval of three and a half tones – the frequencey 65926 which is a perfect fifth above 440 in the equal temperament is the seventh frequency after 440 in the frequency list we saw in the article so it is seven semitones or three and a half tones above 440 so an octave equals six tones and corresponds to a frequency ratio of 12 then why is its name derived from the latin word octo meaning eight similarly what does the number five have to do with the perfect fifth if you want to know the answer click here  i deliberately did not use the terms “tone” and “semitone” in the explanation of the equal temperament as i think that at first reading they confuse more than they help somewhat paradoxically this is true especially for those who do know some musical theory it’s important to understand that a semitone in the equal temperament is generally different from a semitone in other temperaments moreover even within a given temperament it sometimes happens that two tones are not the same you can learn more about this here  most musicians who believe they understand well what a semitone and a tone are are actually not aware of the fact that these terms are illdefined in a sense and this is why i chose not to use them in the main explanation to be able to discuss in better precision notes and temperaments musicologists invented the term cent a cent is a hundredth of a semitone – it is the interval we would get if we partitioned the octave into 1200 equal musical intervals and therefore correspond to a ratio of the 1200th root of two between the frequencies of two notes back to the temperament page © all rights reserved to yuval nov
