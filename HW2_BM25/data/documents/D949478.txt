genetic drift real populations rarely exist under the rigid conditions of the hardyweinberg equilibrium instead gene frequencies in real populations change randomly with time through genetic drift there are two main mechanisms of evolution natural selection and genetic drift genetic drift occurs when the frequency of an allele allele an alternative form of a gene one of the different forms of a gene that can exist at a single locuschanges over generations due to random chance evolution due to genetic drift is not caused by environmental or other kinds of stresses on individuals and the resulting random changes can be detrimental neutral or beneficial to the reproductive success of the following generation the effects of genetic drift are much easier to see in small populations whereas the effects of genetic drift on large populations are minor compared to the entire gene pool gene pool the complete set of unique alleles in a species or populationand are often overshadowed by natural selection genetic drift working in small populations can quickly result in big changes suppose you have 6 oysters 3 darkcolored aa genotype and 3 mediumcolored aa genotype in this population you have a total of 9 a alleles and 3 a alleles or 75 a and 25 a if all of these oysters mate equally the second generation will have the same proportions of each allele — 75 a and 25 a in this example what the offspring oysters look like — their phenotype phenotype the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism as determined by both genetic makeup and environmental influences what an organism “looks like” adj phenotypic— doesn ’t matter no evolution change to the gene pool frequencies has occurred however if the oysters mate unequally due to random chance it is very easy to end up with different proportions such as 17 a alleles and 7 a alleles or any other combination random chance thus can result in an inherited change of allele frequency within the lineage thus we say that evolution has occurred through genetic drift one common example of the results of genetic drift is the founder effect founder effect genetic drift observed in a population that was founded by a small nonrepresentative sample of a larger population also called the “bottleneck effect” or “bottleneck effect” when a small part of a large population is removed from the main population this founder population might have a very different allele frequency than that of the original as the founder population reproduces in isolation the gene pool of the population will continue to diverge from that of the original population if you have a large oyster bed of 100 oysters composed of 50 darkcolored aa and 50 mediumcolored a a oysters that population has 75 a alleles 75 and 25 a alleles 25 let ’s suppose that a rock slide isolates a small group of 10 oysters in a tide pool thus separated from the main population and that this group has only 6 darkcolored aa and 4 mediumcolored a a oysters in this tide pool population there are 16 a alleles 80 and 4 a alleles 20 — the new gene pool is different from that of the original population as a result of the random rock slide as the population in the tide pool reproduces over time genetic drift can further change the allele frequencies becoming more and more different from the proportions in the original oyster bed
