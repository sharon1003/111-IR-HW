memo0674brussels 15 february 2006the kyoto protocol what is the kyoto protocol the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and its kyoto protocol provide the international framework for combating climate change the unfccc the first international measure to address the problem was adopted in may 1992 and came into force in march 1994 so far 189 governments  almost all governments in the world  have ratified it it obliges its parties to establish national programmes for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to submit regular reports it also requires the industrialised countries among the parties  but not developing countries  to stabilise their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 by differentiating between industrialised and developing countries the unfccc recognises that industrialised countries are responsible for most of the current buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and hence should lead in reducing emissions the unfccc parties meet annually to review progress and discuss further measures and a number of global monitoring and reporting mechanisms are in place to keep track of greenhouse gas emissions when they adopted the unfccc governments knew that the commitments would not be sufficient to seriously tackle climate change on 11 december 1997 they took a further step and adopted a protocol to the unfccc in the japanese town of kyoto the kyoto protocol building on the unfccc framework the protocol sets legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions from originally 38 industrialised countries and the european community the eu15 it also introduces innovative marketbased implementation mechanisms  the socalled kyoto flexible mechanisms  aimed at keeping the cost of curbing emissions low under the kyoto protocol industrialised countries are required to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases co 2 which is the most important one methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbons perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride by around 5 below the 1990 level during the first kyoto protocol “commitment period” from 2008 to 2012 a fiveyear commitment period was chosen rather than a single target year to smooth out annual fluctuations in emissions due to uncontrollable factors such as weather there are no emission targets for developing countries the kyoto protocol entered into force on 16 february 2005 the rules for its entry into force required that at least 55 parties to the unfccc ratify the protocol and that those include industrialised countries accounting for at least 55 of the industrialised countries co 2 emissions in 1990 the first threshold was achieved as early as 1998 on 18 november 2004 russia ratified responsible for 174 of the industrialised countries emission in 1990 which guaranteed the 55 emission threshold the protocol entered into force 90 days later this meant that the commitments taken on by its parties became legally binding as of 6 february 2006 160 countries and the european community have ratified the protocol three countries that originally signed the treaty have not ratified the us has rejected the protocol whereas australia has decided not to ratify it and monaco has not yet ratified this means there are 35 developed countries and the european community that are obliged to reach their kyoto targets what new came out of the un conference in montreal in 2005 during this conference taking place between 28 november and 9 december 2005 in montreal canada two meetings were held simultaneously the 11th conference of the parties to unfccc cop11 and the first ever meeting of the parties to kyoto protocol copmop1 with some 10000 participants it was the largest intergovernmental climate conference since the kyoto protocol was adopted and a historic event governments took more than 40 decisions that will strengthen global climate change efforts this package of decisions also referred to as the “montreal action plan” reinforce the kyoto protocol and open the way to a new international framework to tackle climate change after the protocol’s first commitment period ends in 2012 in montreal the kyoto parties adopted the socalled rule book of the kyoto protocol that establishes detailed rules that will make sure that the protocol operates smoothly they decided to streamline and strengthen the clean development mechanism one of the protocols innovative mechanisms that became operational when the protocol entered into force to this end developed countries committed an additional € 7 million in funding including € 37 million from eu member states and € 850000 from the european commission the parties also launched the joint implementation mechanism and agreed on the compliance regime which will not only deal with noncompliant countries but also provide assistance to countries that have difficulties to meet their obligations and decide on the eligibility of countries to participate in the kyoto flexible mechanisms most importantly the parties to the kyoto protocol agreed to start discussing without delay new emission targets for industrialised countries to succeed the current targets that have to be met by 2012 in parallel the 189 unfccc parties including those that are outside kyoto such as the us agreed to conduct over the next two years a dialogue on longterm cooperative action against climate change these discussions should lead to a further international framework to tackle climate change eu commitments under kyoto and progress towards meeting them under the protocol the eu15 the 15 countries that were members of the eu at the time of ratification of the protocol is committed to reducing its greenhouse gases emissions by 8 below 1990 levels during the first commitment period from 2008 to 2012 this target is shared between the 15 member states under a legally binding burdensharing agreement which sets an individual emissions target for each member state of the ten member states that acceded on 1 may 2004 eight have individual reduction targets of 6 or 8 under the kyoto protocol only cyprus and malta do not have kyoto targets in 2003 the most recent year for which data is available the eu15 had reduced its emissions by 17 euwide emissions were down by 8 projections show that additional policies and measures planned by the member states but not yet implemented and use of the kyoto flexible mechanisms will take eu15 emissions to 93 below 1990 levels by 2010  more than enough to meet the 8 reduction target  while eu25 reductions will reach 113 only six member states were not on track to meet their targets denmark ireland italy portugal slovenia and spain see annex for details what will happen if a country misses its target the compliance regime for the kyoto protocol is among the most comprehensive and rigorous in the international arena if a party fails to meet its emissions target the protocol requires it to make up the difference in the second commitment period after 2012 with an additional 30 penalty it must also develop a compliance action plan setting out the actions that it will take to meet the target and the timetable for doing so in addition its eligibility to “sell” under the protocol’s international emissions trading system will be suspended however for the eu15 member states the kyoto protocol compliance procedures will only apply if the eu15 as a whole misses its 8 reduction target should this occur then each member state will be held to its target under the eus burdensharing agreement and the eu as a whole will be in noncompliance with its obligation to reach the 8 target on top of that the european commission can decide to start infringement procedures against eu15 member states that miss their targets under the burdensharing agreement the remaining eight member states with kyoto targets czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland slovakia slovenia are bound to their individual targets as set out in the kyoto protocol both under the kyoto protocol’s noncompliance procedures and under eu law kyoto’s marketbased mechanisms the kyoto protocol envisages three marketbased mechanisms known as the kyoto flexible mechanisms emissions trading between governments with kyoto targets the clean development mechanism and joint implementation these will allow industrialised countries to meet their targets costeffectively by trading emission allowances between themselves and gaining credits for emissioncurbing projects abroad the rationale behind these three mechanisms is that greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem and that the place where reductions are achieved is irrelevant in scientific terms in this way reductions can be made where costs are lowest detailed rules and supervisory structures have been set up to ensure that these mechanisms are not abused emissions trading emissions trading can take place between countries with kyoto targets each country will be assigned a fixed maximum amount of emissions that it may emit over the commitment period 20082012 to comply with its target countries that emit less can sell the unused quota to others that emit more this will allow reductions to take place where they are cheapest reducing compliance costs inspired by this system the eu has developed and implemented its own emissions trading scheme which operates at company level this system which started on 1 january 2005 covers all 25 eu member states and is the first multinational emissions trading scheme in the world under the eu scheme eu member states have set limits on co 2 emissions from close to 11500 energyintensive plants steel factories power plants oil refineries paper mills and glass and cement installations which together account for almost half of the eus co 2 emissions they have done this by issuing emission allowances to the companies which determine how much co 2 the plants are allowed to emit during a first 20052007 trading period another round of allocations for the 20082012 trading period is being decided in 2006 companies that emit less than the number of allowances they receive can sell the surplus to companies that have problems staying within their limits or for which emissions reduction measures are more expensive than buying allowances on the market any company may also increase its emissions above the level of its allowances by acquiring more allowances from the market this scheme requires companies to fully integrate the costs of co 2 emissions in their decision making it induces them to make emission cuts where they are cheapest thereby ensuring that reductions are made at the lowest possible cost to the economy it also fosters innovation  companies have an incentive to improve their energy efficiency and invest in climatefriendly technologies the eu has indicated its willingness to link the eu scheme to similar trading schemes in other countries clean development mechanism and joint implementation the clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation ji will allow industrialised countries to achieve part of their emission reduction commitments by conducting emissionreducing projects abroad and counting the reductions achieved toward their own commitments ji will allow for projects in other industrialised countries with kyoto targets while cdm projects are carried out in countries without targets ie developing countries the two mechanisms will lower compliance costs transfer advanced technologies to developing countries and foster cooperation between countries with kyoto targets cdm credits can be generated retroactively from 2000 onward while ji credits must be generated during the 20082012 period cdm is therefore already operational a condition for the issue of credits in respect of the reductions achieved is that the projects result in real measurable and longterm climate change benefits that are additional to what would have happened without the projects the eu emissions trading scheme is linked to cdm and ji companies covered by the eu emissions trading system can use credits from cdm projects from 1 january 2005 and from ji projects from 1 january 2008 towards meeting their commitments under the trading scheme eu action to combat climate change the fight against climate change is one of the priorities of the european commission it is one of the main commitments under the eu’s sustainable development strategy and the first of four priority policy areas under the 6 th environmental action programme 20022012 the backbone of the commission’s effort to implement the protocol is the “european climate change programme” eccp which was launched in march 2000 under this umbrella the european commission and a wide range of experts and stakeholders have developed costeffective measures that will help the eu meet its 8 emissions reduction target so far some 35 such measures have been implemented they include the eu emissions trading scheme legislation to promote renewable energy sources for electricity production and biofuels in road transport as well as legislation to improve the energy efficiency of buildings to promote combined heat and power generation and to control the powerful fluorinated gases the commission has also negotiated agreements with european japanese and korean carmakers to cut co 2 emissions from new cars by an average of 25 below 1995 levels by 20082009 the second phase of the eccp was launched in october 2005 to identify further costeffective measures to reduce emissions post 2012 the focus is on reviewing and strengthening the implementation of the eccp i measures on carbon capture and geological storage emissions from road vehicles aviation and strategies to adapt to the unavoidable effects of climate change impacts of climate change the effects of climate change are already manifest and are expected to become stronger as temperatures rise further over the 20 th century the global average temperature rose by about 06°c and the mean temperature in europe increased by more than 09°c globally the 1990s were the warmest decade since 1861 when temperatures started to be measured and the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1991 according to nasa 2005 was the hottest year recorded followed by 1998 2002 2003 and 2004 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc which brings together the worlds leading experts in this field projected in its third assessment report in 2001 that the globally averaged surface temperature will increase by between 14 and 58°c from 1990 to 2100 under businessasusual and that sea levels will rise by between 9 and 88 centimetres over the same period if nothing is done to prevent or limit these changes they will have major environmental economic and social consequences these consequences will include geographic shifts in the occurrence of different species andor the extinction of species changes in rainfall patterns will put pressure on water resources in many regions which will in turn affect both drinking water supplies and irrigation extreme weather events  storms floods droughts and heat waves  will become more frequent and cause human suffering and economic damage warm seasons will become dryer in the interior of most midlatitude continents increasing the frequency of droughts and land degradation this will be particularly serious for areas where land degradation desertification and droughts are already severe developing countries will suffer particularly and tropical diseases will extend their geographic range the ipcc’s findings were reinforced by a report by the european environment agency issued in august 2004 1 which concluded that europe is warming faster than the global average the temperature in europe is projected to climb by a further 2063 °c this century as emissions of greenhouse gases continue building up the report identifies a broad range of current and future impacts of climate change in europe including the following almost two out of every three catastrophic events since 1980 have been directly attributable to floods storms droughts or heat waves the average number of such weather and climaterelated disasters per year doubled over the 1990s compared with the previous decade economic losses from such events have more than doubled over the past 20 years to around €85 billion annually this is due to several reasons including the greater frequency of such events but also socioeconomic factors such as increased household wealth more urbanisation and more costly infrastructure in vulnerable areas the annual number of floods in europe and the numbers of people affected by them are rising climate change is likely to increase the frequency of flooding particularly of flash floods which pose the greatest danger to people climate change over the past three decades has caused decreases in populations of plant species in various parts of europe including mountain regions some plants are likely to become extinct as other factors such as fragmentation of habitats limit the ability of plant species to adapt to climate change glaciers in eight of europes nine glacial regions are in retreat and are at their lowest levels for 5000 years sea levels in europe rose by 0830 mm per year in the last century the rate of increase is projected to be 24 times higher during this century projections show that by 2080 cold winters could disappear almost entirely and hot summers droughts and incidents of heavy rain or hail could become much more frequent which position does the commission take with regard to the talks on future action against climate change at the un climate change conference in montreal eu member states and the european commission represented by environment commission stavros dimas pushed for the launch of talks on further action the eus target reconfirmed at the eu summit in brussels in march 2005 is to limit the increase in global average temperature to 2°c above the preindustrial level  an increase believed to be within our adaptive capacities this requires deep cuts in global emissions in the next few decades and the prompt start of discussions how they can be achieved the eu was encouraged that all its partners at the montreal conference agreed to launch these talks they will now take place on two parallel tracks  the kyoto track kyoto parties will discuss further commitments for industrialised countries and the unfccc track parties will conduct a twoyear dialogue on longterm action  and begin in may 2006 in bonn the eu is determined to play a constructive and leading role in the talks working closely with our partners to ensure a truly cooperative effort the key principles to underpin the eu position are outlined in a policy paper published by the commission in february 2005 winning the battle against global climate change 2 they include five elements broad participation by all major emitting countriesinclusion of all emitting sectors including aviation maritime transport and forestry due to deforestationincreased research and development and uptake of lowcarbon technologiescontinued use of market mechanisms to keep reduction costs lowadaptation to the impacts of climate change since some effects are unavoidable the eu summit in brussels in march 2005 affirmed these principles and initiated an intensive outreach effort engaging the eu in dialogues with a range of countries on the further action on climate change it also invited other countries to jointly explore strategies for achieving necessary emission reductions including emission reduction pathways for the group of developed countries in the order of 1530 by 2020 compared to 1990 emissions as well as emission reductions for beyond 2020 further information about future action against climate change can be found
