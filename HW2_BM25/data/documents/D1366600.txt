acetate fabrics are made with spun filaments of cellulose taken from wood pulp classified as a chemical fiber textile or semisynthetic acetate is sometimes mixed with silk wool or cotton to make it stronger acetate flakes are generated by a reaction of the wood pulp to a variety of acetic acids the flakes are dissolved in a solvent and then passed through a spinneret  as the solvent evaporates  to create the filaments used to construct the acetate fabriccredit flashfilmphotodiscgetty images created from the wood pulp in trees acetate fabrics replicate the luxuriousness of silk history of acetate the second oldest manufactured fiber in the u s after rayon acetate was first used in france as an airplane wing varnish and later developed as a fiber in the u k in 1923 developed for use as a fabric in the u s in 1924 acetate could not be massproduced until chemists solved the problems with dyeing the fabric initially certain fumes and pollutants caused the fabric to fade or discolor while chemists solved the issues so the fabric could be dyed some acetates still discolor when exposed to pollutants fabric advantages acetate often takes the place of other shiny soft and luxurious fabrics on furniture and for drapes curtains and other home decor along with being used for clothing evening attire and clothing and furniture linings its advantages include drapes and hangs well multiple sheens and color options quick drying fabric that resists shrinking moth and mildew resistant low static high luster elegant appearance and feel fabric doesnt pill fabric disadvantages as a manmade chemical semisynthetic fabric acetate has some distinct disadvantages as well no elasticity not a strong material  rips easily melts when heated may require dry cleaning based on care tag wrinkles easily fabric care read the care tag to verify whether the acetate fabric is washable  some say dry clean only while others may say do not dry clean when its washable clean and rinse in cold water do not put the fabric in the dryer as it can melt if it has wrinkles â€“ and the care tag agrees  iron it on the cool setting perfume certain chemicalbased glues and nail polish removers can melt acetate so keep these chemicals away from acetate or acetateblend drapes upholstery or furniture show comments
