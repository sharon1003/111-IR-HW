the dewey decimal classification systemby jean halsey description the purpose of this lesson is to teach students about the fundamentals of the dewey decimal system to enable them to locate books in the library many students are overwhelmed when entering the library because of the vast amounts of books on the shelves learning the dewey decimal classification system will guide the students to the books of their choicebackground the dewey decimal classification system is the most widely used method for classifying books in the library this system is a general knowledge organization tool that is continuously revised to keep pace with knowledge it is named after melvil dewey an american librarian who developed it in 1876 this system is a numerical scheme for the arrangement of subjects of nonfiction books and it classifies books by dividing them into 10 main subject groups that are called categories each category is represented by figures beginning with 000 and going on to 999 in other words it is a system of numbers used to mark and arrange mostly nonfiction books each number stands for a special topic every book is given a number and is put on the shelf in number order books with the same number are put in alphabetical order by the author’s last name there are three summaries of the ddc  the first summary contains the ten main classes the first digit in each threedigit number represents the main class for example 5 00 represents natural sciences and mathematics the second summary contains the hundred divisions the second digit in each threedigit number indicates the division for example 5 0 0 is used for general works on the sciences 5 1 0 for mathematics 5 2 0 for astronomy 5 3 0 for physics the third summary contains the thousand sections the third digit in each threedigit number indicates the section thus 53 0 is used for general works on physics 53 1 for classical mechanics 53 2 for fluid mechanics 53 3 for gas mechanic a decimal point follows the third digit in a class number after which division by ten continues to the specific degree of classification needed a subject may appear in more than one discipline for example clothing has aspects that fall under several disciplines the psychological influence of clothing belongs in 15595 as part of the discipline of psychology customs associated with clothing belong in 391 as part of the discipline of customs and clothing in the sense of fashion design belongs in 74692 as part of the discipline of the arts the dewey decimal classification system is used in most public school libraries it is essential for students to understand why books are numbered and how to find the numbers on the shelves so they can use the library effectively and in a friendly manner dewey is also used for other purposes eg as a browsing mechanism for resources on the web one of deweys great strengths is that the system is developed and maintained in a national bibliographic agency the library of congress objectives the students will be able to identify each of the 10 major classes of the dewey decimal system identify the difference between fiction and nonfiction identify the numbers in the 2 nd and 3 rd places locate nonfiction books and explain the call number by using the dewey decimal system materials computer pen pencil paper and handouts identifying the categories of the dewey

the other students will name a title of a book that will fall under the category activity 2 make up a game using decimal jeopardy for example given the book title “the biography of michael jordan” the student will have to identify the category and number of the book activity 3 students will make up a dewey decimal system rap song using all the numbers and categories activity 4 students will write a biography about melvin dewey evaluation identify nonfiction books according to classification and add correct call numbers to each locate books on the shelf according to the dewey decimal system matching quiz using numbers and categories dewey decimal quiz the book “fishing with dad” has the dewey number 799 what does each number represent using the dewey numbers arrange the following numbers in order 7961 7969 7964 79601 and 79612 name the continent represented by the call number 916 books about trees have this call number  what class division would you check to locate a book on occupations answers to quiz7 represents “fine arts” the second 9 represents “recreation” the third 9 represents “hunting fishing and shooting”79601 7961 79612 7964 7969africa582300back to the smart
