chapter 111 now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on the fifth day of the month that i was in the midst of the captivity by the river of chobar and the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god 2 on the fifth day of the month this was the fifth year of the captivity of king joakim 3 and the word of the lord came to jezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river of chobar and the hand of the lord was upon me4 and i looked and behold a sweeping wind came from the north and a great cloud on it and there was brightness round about it and gleaming fire and in the midst of it as it were the appearance of amber in the midst of the fire and brightness in it5 and in the midst as it were the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance the likeness of a man was upon them 6 and each one had four faces and each one had four wings 7 and their legs were straight and their feet were winged and there were sparks like gleaming brass and their wings were light 8 and the hand of a man was under their wings on their four sides 9 and the faces of them four turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward 10 and the likeness of their faces was the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right of the four and the face of a calf on the left of the four and the face of an eagle to the four 11 and the four had their wings spread out above each one had two joined to one another and two covered their bodies 12 and each one went straight forward wherever the spirit was going they went and turned not back13 and in the midst of the living creatures there was an appearance as of burning coals of fire as an appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures and the brightness of fire and out of the fire came forth lightning 14 15 and i looked and behold the four had each one wheel on the ground near the living creatures 16 and the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of beryl and the four had one likeness and their work was as it were a wheel in a wheel 17 they went on their four sides they turned not as they went 18 neither did their backs turn and they were high and i beheld them and the backs of them four were full of eyes round about19 and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures lifted themselves off the earth the wheels were lifted off 20 wherever the cloud happened to be there was the spirit ready to go the wheels went and were lifted up with them because the spirit of life was in the wheels 21 when those went the wheels went and when those stood the wheels stood and when those lifted themselves off the earth they were lifted off with them for the spirit of life was in the wheels22 and the likeness over the heads of the living creatures was as a firmament as the appearance of crystal spread out over their wings above 23 and their wings were spread out under the firmament reaching one to the other two wings to each covering their bodies 24 and i heard the sound of their wings when they went as the sound of much water and when they stood their wings were let down25 and lo a voice from above the firmament 26 that was over their head there was as the appearance of a sapphire stone and the likeness of a throne upon it and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as an appearance of a man above 27 and i saw as it were the resemblance of amber from the appearance of the loins and upwards and from the appearance of the loins and under i saw an appearance of fire and the brightness thereof round about 28 as the appearance of the bow when it is in the cloud in days of rain so was the form of brightness round about chapter 221 this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and i saw and fell upon my face and heard the voice of one speaking and he said to me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak to thee 2 and the spirit came upon me and took me up and raised me and set me on my feet and i heard him speaking to me 3 and he said to me son of man i send thee forth to the house of israel them that provoke me who have provoked me they and their fathers to this day 4 and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord 5 whether then indeed they shall hear or fear for it is a provoking house yet they shall know that thou art a prophet in the midst of them6 and thou son of man fear them not nor be dismayed at their face for they will madden and will rise up against thee round about and thou dwellest in the midst of scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their countenance for it is a provoking house 7 and thou shalt speak my words to them whether they will hear or fear for it is a provoking house8 and thou son of man hear him that speaks to thee be not thou provoking as the provoking house open thy mouth and eat what i give thee 9 and i looked and behold a hand stretched out to me and in it a volume of a book 10 and he unrolled it before me and in it the front and the back were written upon and there was written in it lamentation and mournful song and woe chapter 331 and he said to me son of man eat this volume and go and speak to the children of israel 2 so he opened my mouth and caused me to eat the volume and he said to me son of man 3 thy mouth shall eat and thy belly shall be filled with this volume that is given to thee so i ate it and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey4 and he said to me son of man go thy way and go in to the house of israel and speak my words to them 5 for thou art not sent to a people of hard speech but to the house of israel 6 neither to many nations of other speech and other tongues nor of harsh language whose words thou wouldest not understand although if i had sent thee to such they would have hearkened to thee7 but the house of israel will not be willing to hearken to thee for they will not hearken to me for all the house of israel are stubborn and hardhearted 8 and behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and i will strengthen thy power against their power 9and it shall be continually stronger than a rock be not afraid of them neither be dismayed at their faces because it is a provoking house10 and he said to me son of man receive into thine heart all the words that i have spoken to thee and hear them with thine ears 11and go thy way go in to the captivity to the children of thy people and thou shalt speak to them and say to them thus saith the lord whether they will hear or whether they will forbear12 then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me the voice as of a great earthquake saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his place 13 and i perceived the sound of the wings of the living creatures clapping one to the other and the sound of the wheels was near them and the sound of the earthquake 14 and the spirit lifted me and took me up and i went in the impulse of my spirit and the hand of the lord was mighty upon me15 then i passed through the air and came into the captivity and went round to them that dwelt by the river of chobar who were there and i sat there seven days conversant in the midst of them16 and after the seven days the word of the lord came to me saying son of man 17 i have made thee a watchman to the house of israel and thou shalt hear a word of my mouth and shalt threaten them from me 18 when i say to the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou hast not warned him to give warning to the wicked to turn from his ways that he should live that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thy hand 19 but if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness and from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity and thou shalt deliver thy soul20 and when the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits a trespass and i shall bring punishment before him he shall die because thou didst not warn him he shall even die in his sins because his righteousness shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thine hand 21 but if thou warn the righteous not to sin and he sin not the righteous shall surely live because thou hast warned him and thou shalt deliver thine own soul22 and the hand of the lord came upon me and he said to me arise and go forth into the plain and there shalt thou be spoken to23 and i arose and went forth to the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there according to the vision and according to the glory of the lord which i saw by the river of chobar and i fell on my face 24 then the spirit came upon me and set me on my feet and spoke to me and said to me go in and shut thyself up in the midst of thine house 25 and thou son of man behold bonds are prepared for thee and they shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not come forth of the midst of them 26 also i will bind thy tongue and thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover because it is a provoking house 27 but when i speak to thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord he that hears let him hear and he that is disobedient let him be disobedient because it is a provoking house chapter 441 and thou son of man take thee a brick and thou shalt set it before thy face and shalt portray on it the city even jerusalem 2and thou shalt besiege it and build works against it and throw up a mound round about it and pitch camps against it and set up engines round about 3 and take thou to thyself an iron pan and thou shalt set it for an iron wall between thee and the city and thou shalt set thy face against it and it shall be in a siege and thou shalt besiege it this is a sign to the children of israel4 and thou shalt lie upon thy left side and lay the iniquities of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the hundred and fifty days during which thou shalt lie upon it and thou shalt bear their iniquities 5 for i have appointed thee their iniquities for a number of days for a hundred and ninety days so thou shalt bear the iniquities of the house of israel 6 and thou shalt accomplish this and then shalt lie on thy right side and shalt bear the iniquities of the house of juda forty days i have appointed thee a day for a year7 so thou shalt set thy face to the siege of jerusalem and shalt strengthen thine arm and shalt prophesy against it 8 and behold i have prepared bonds for thee land thou mayest not turn from thy one side to the other until the days of thy siege shall be accomplished9 take thou also to thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and breadcorn and thou shalt cast them into one earthen vessel and shalt make them into loaves for thyself and thou shalt eat them a hundred and ninety days according to the number of the days during which thou sleepest on thy side 10 and thou shalt eat thy food by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat them 11 and thou shalt drink water by measure even from time to time thou shalt drink the sixth part of a hin12 and thou shalt eat them as a barley cake thou shalt bake them before their eyes in man’s dung13 and thou shalt say thus saith the lord god of israel thus shall the children of israel eat unclean things among the gentiles 14then i said not so lord god of israel surely my soul has not been defiled with uncleanness nor have i eaten that which died of itself or was torn of beasts from my birth until now neither has any corrupt flesh entered into my mouth15 and he said to me behold i have given thee dung of oxen instead of man’s dung and thou shalt prepare thy loaves upon it16 and he said to me son of man behold i break the support of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and in want and shall drink water by measure and in a state of ruin 17 that they may want bread and water and a man and his brother shall be brought to ruin and they shall pine away in their iniquities chapter 551 and thou son of man take thee a sword sharper than a barber’s razor thou shalt procure it for thyself and shalt bring it upon thine head and upon thy beard and thou shalt take a pair of scales and shalt separate the hair 2 a fourth part thou shalt burn in the fire in the midst of the city at the fulfillment of the days of the siege and thou shalt take a fourth part and burn it up in the midst of it and a fourth part thou shalt cut with a sword round about it and a fourth part thou shalt scatter to the wind and i will draw out a sword after them3 and thou shalt take thence a few in number and shalt wrap them in the fold of thy garment 4 and thou shalt take of these again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them up with fire from thence shall come forth fire and thou shalt say to the whole house of israel5 thus saith the lord this is jerusalem i have set her and the countries round about her in the midst of the nations 6 and thou shalt declare mine ordinances to the lawless one from out of the nations and my statutes to the sinful one of the countries round about her because they have rejected mine ordinances and have not walked in my statutes7 therefore thus saith the lord because your occasion for sin has been taken from the nations round about you and ye have not walked in my statutes nor kept mine ordinances nay ye have not even done according to the ordinances of the nations round about you therefore thus saith the lord 8 behold i am against thee and i will execute judgment in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations 9 and i will do in thee things which i have not done and the like of which i will not do again for all thine abominations 10therefore the fathers shall eat their children in the midst of thee and children shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and i will scatter all that are left of thee to every wind11 therefore as i live saith the lord surely because thou hast defiled my holy things with all thine abominations i also will reject thee mine eye shall not spare and i will have no mercy 12 a fourth part of thee shall be cut off by pestilence and a fourth part of thee shall be consumed in the midst of thee with famine and as for another fourth part of thee i will scatter them to every wind and a fourth part of thee shall fall by sword round about thee and i will draw out a sword after them13 and my wrath and mine anger shall be accomplished upon them and thou shalt know that i the lord have spoken in my jealousy when i have accomplished mine anger upon them14 and i will make thee desolate and thy daughters round about thee in the sight of every one that passes through 15 and thou shalt be mourned over and miserable among the nations round about thee when i have executed judgments in thee in the vengeance of my wrath i the lord have spoken 16 and when i have sent against them shafts of famine then they shall be consumed and i will break the strength of thy bread 17 so i will send forth against thee famine and evil beasts and i will take vengeance upon thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through upon thee and i will bring a sword upon thee round about i the lord have spoken chapter 661 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man set thy face against the mountains of israel and prophesy against them 3 and thou shalt sayye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord to the mountains and to the hills and to the valleys and to the forests behold i bring a sword upon you and your high places shall be utterly destroyed 4 and your altars shall be broken to pieces and your consecrated plats and i will cast down your slain men before your idols 5 and i will scatter your bones round about your altars 6 and in all your habitations the cities shall be made desolate and the high places utterly laid waste that your altars may be destroyed and your idols be broken to pieces and your consecrated plats be abolished 7 and slain men shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am the lord8 when there are some of you escaping from the sword among the gentiles and when ye are scattered in the countries 9 then they of you that escape among the nations whither they were carried captive shall remember me i have sworn an oath against their heart that goes awhoring from me and their eyes that go awhoring after their practices and they shall mourn over themselves for all their abominations 10 and they shall know that i the lord have spoken11 thus saith the lord clap with thy hand and stamp with thy foot and say aha aha for all the abominations of the house of israel they shall fall by the sword and by pestilence and by famine 12 he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that is far off shall die by the pestilence and he that is in the siege shall be consumed with famine and i will accomplish mine anger upon them13 then ye shall know that i am the lord when your slain are in the midst of your idols round about your altars on every high hill and under every shady tree where they offered a sweet savour to all their idols 14 and i will stretch out my hand against them and i will make the land desolate and ruined from the wilderness of deblatha in all their habitations and ye shall know that i am the lord chapter 771 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying also thou son of man say 2 thus saith the lordan end is come to the land of israel the end is come on the four corners of the land 3 the end is come on thee 7 the inhabitant of the land the time is come the day has drawn nigh not with tumult nor with pangs 8 now i will pour out my anger upon thee near at hand and i will accomplish my wrath on thee and i will judge thee for thy ways and recompense upon thee all thine abominations 9 mine eye shall not spare nor will i have any mercy for i will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord that smite thee 7 now the end is come to thee and i will send judgment upon thee and i will take vengeance on thy ways and will recompense all thine abominations upon thee4mine eye shall not spare nor will i have any mercy for i will recompense thy way upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord5 for thus saith the lord behold the end is come10 behold the day of the lord although the rod has blossomed 11 pride has sprung up and will break the staff of the wicked one and that not with tumult nor with haste 12 the time is come behold the day let not the buyer rejoice and let not the seller mourn13 for the buyer shall never again return to the seller neither shall a man cleave with the eye of hope to his life 14 sound ye the trumpet and pass sentence on all together 15 there shall be war with the sword without and famine and pestilence within he that is in the field shall die by the sword and famine and pestilence shall destroy them that are in the city16 but they that escape of them shall be delivered and shall be upon the mountains and i will slay all the rest every one for his iniquities 17 all hands shall be completely weakened and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture 18 and they shall gird themselves with sackcloth and amazement shall cover them and shame shall be upon them even upon every face and baldness upon every head 19 their silver shall be cast forth in the streets and their gold shall be despised their souls shall not be satisfied and their bellies shall not be filled for it was the punishment of their iniquities 20 as for their choice ornaments they employed them for pride and they made of them images of their abominations therefore have i made them uncleanness to them21 and i will deliver them into the hands of strangers to make them a prey and to the pests of the earth for a spoil and they shall profane them 22 and i will turn away my face from them and they shall defile my charge and shall go in to them unguardedly and profane them 23 and they shall work uncleanness because the land is full of strange nations and the city is full of iniquity 24 and i will turn back the boasting of their strength and their holy things shall be defiled 25 and though propitiation shall come and one shall seek peace yet there shall be none 26 there shall be woe upon woe and there shall be message upon message and a vision shall be sought from a prophet but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the elders 27 the prince shall clothe himself with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be made feeble i will do to them according to their ways and according to their judgments will i punish them and they shall know that i am the lord chapter 881 and it came to pass in the sixth year in the fifth month on the fifth day of the month i was sitting in the house and the elders of juda were sitting before me and the hand of the lord came upon me 2 and i looked and behold the likeness of a man from his loins and downwards there was fire and from his loins upwards there was as the appearance of amber 3 and he stretched forth the likeness of a hand and took me by the crown of my head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and sky and brought me to jerusalem in a vision of god to the porch of the gate that looks to the north where was the pillar of the purchaser 4 and behold the glory of the lord god of israel was there according to the vision which i saw in the plain5 and he said to me son of man lift up thine eyes toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes toward the north and behold i looked from the north toward the eastern gate 6 and he said to me son of man hast thou seen what these do they commit great abominations here so that i should keep away from my sanctuary and thou shalt see yet greater iniquities7 and he brought me to the porch of the court 8 and he said to me son of man dig so i dug and behold a door 9 and he said to me go in and behold the iniquities which they practise here 10 so i went in and looked and beheld vain abominations and all the idols of the house of israel portrayed upon them round about 11 and seventy men of the elders of the house of israel and jechonias the son of saphan stood in their presence in the midst of them and each one held his censer in his hand and the smoke of the incense went up 12 and he said to me thou hast seen son of man what the elders of the house of israel do each one of them in their secret chamber because they have said the lord see not the lord has forsaken the earth13 and he said to me thou shalt see yet greater iniquities which these do 14 and he brought me in to the porch of the house of the lord that looks to the north and behold there were women sitting there lamenting for thammuz 15 and he said to me son of man thou hast seen but thou shalt yet see evil practices greater then these16 and he brought me into the inner court of the house of the lord and at the entrance of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about twenty men with their back parts toward the temple of the lord and their faces turned the opposite way and these were worshipping the sun 17 and he said to me son of man thou hast seen this is it a little thing to the house of juda to practise the iniquities which they have practised here for they have filled the land with iniquity and behold these are as scorners18therefore will i deal with them in wrath mine eye shall not spare nor will i have any mercy chapter 991 and he cried in mine ears with a loud voice saying the judgment of the city has drawn nigh and each had the weapons of destruction in his hand 2 and behold six men came from the way of the high gate that looks toward the north and each one’s axe was in his hand and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with a long robe down to the feet and a sapphire girdle was on his loins and they came in and stood near the brazen altar 3 and the glory of the god of israel that was upon them went up from the cherubs to the porch of the house and he called the man that was clothed with the long robe who had the girdle on his loins 4 and said to him go through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that groan and that grieve for all the iniquities that are done in the midst of them 5 and he said to the first in my hearing go after him into the city and smite and let not your eyes spare and have no mercy 6 slay utterly old man and youth and virgin and infants and women but go ye not nigh any on whom is the mark begin at my sanctuary so they began with the elder men who were within in the house 7 and he said to them defile the house and go out and fill the ways with dead bodies and smite8 and it came to pass as they were smiting that i fell upon my face and cried out and said alas o lord wilt thou destroy the remnant of israel in pouring out thy wrath upon jerusalem 9 then said he to me the iniquity of the house of israel and juda is become very exceedingly great for the land is filled with many nations and the city is filled with iniquity and uncleanness because they have said the lord has forsaken the earth the lord looks not upon it 10 therefore mine eye shall not spare neither will i have any mercy i have recompensed their ways upon their heads11 and behold the man clothed with the long robe and girt with the girdle about his loins answered and said i have done as thou didst command me chapter 10101 then i looked and behold over the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs there was a likeness of a throne over them as a sapphire stone 2 and he said to the man clothed with the long robe go in between the wheels that are under the cherubs and fill thine hands with coals of fire from between the cherubs and scatter them over the city and he went in my sight3 and the cherubs stood on the right hand of the house as the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court 4 then the glory of the lord departed from the cherubs to the porch of the house and the cloud filled the house and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the lord 5 and the sound of the cherubs’ wings was heard as far as the outer court as the voice of the almighty god speaking6 and it came to pass when he gave a charge to the man clothed with the sacred robe saying take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubs that he went in and stood near the wheels 7 and he stretched forth his hand into the midst of the fire that was between the cherubs and took thereof and put it into the hands of the man clothed with the sacred robe and he took it and went out8 and i saw the cherubs having the likeness of men’s hands under their wings 9 and i saw and behold four wheels stood by the cherubs one wheel by each cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of a carbuncle stone 10 and as for their appearance there was one likeness to the four as if there should be a wheel in the midst of a wheel 11 when they went they went on their four sides they turned not when they went for whichever way the first head looked they went and they turned not as they went 12 and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about the four wheels 13 and these wheels were called gelgel in my hearing 14 15 and the cherubs were the same living creature which i saw by the river of chobar16 and when the cherubs went the wheels went and they were close to them and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth their wheels turned not 17 when they stood the wheels stood and when they mounted up the wheels mounted up with them because the spirit of life was in them18 then the glory of the lord departed from the house and went up on the cherubs 19 and the cherubs lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth the wheels were also beside them and they stood at the entrance of the front gate of the house of the lord and the glory of the god of israel was upon them above20 this is the living creature which i saw under the god of israel by the river of chobar and i knew that they were cherubs 21 each one had four faces and each one had eight wings and under their wings was the likeness of men’s hands 22 and as for the likeness of their faces these are the same faces which i saw under the glory of the god of israel by the river of chobar and they went each straight forward chapter 11111 moreover the spirit took me up and brought me to the front gate of the house of the lord that looks eastward and behold at the entrance of the gate were about five and twenty men and i saw in the midst of them jechonias the son of ezer and phaltias the son of banaeas the leaders of the people2 and the lord said to me son of man these are the men that devise vanities and take evil counsel in this city 3 who say have not the houses been newly built this is the caldron and we are the flesh 4 therefore prophesy against them prophesy son of man 5and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said to me saythus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel and i know the devices of your spirit 6 ye have multiplied your dead in this city and ye have filled your ways with slain men 7 therefore thus saith the lord your dead whom ye have smitten in the midst of it these are the flesh and this city is the caldron but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it 8 ye fear the sword and i will bring a sword upon you saith the lord 9 and i will bring you forth out of the midst of it and will deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you 10 ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you on the mountains of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord11 and it came to pass while i was prophesying that phaltias the son of banaeas died and i fell upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said alas alas o lord wilt thou utterly destroy the remnant of israel 14 and the word of the lord came to me saying 15son of man thy brethren and the men of thy captivity and all the house of israel are come to the full to whom the inhabitants of jerusalem said keep ye far away from the lord the land is given to us for an inheritance 16 therefore say thouthus saith the lord i will cast them off among the nations and will disperse them into every land yet will i be to them for a little sanctuary in the countries which they shall enter 17 therefore say thou thus saith the lord i will also take them from the heathen and gather them out of the lands wherein i have scattered them and will give them the land of israel18 and they shall enter in there and shall remove all the abominations of it and all its iniquities from it 19 and i will give them another heart and will put a new spirit within them and will extract the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh 20 that they may walk in my commandments and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be to me a people and i will be to them a god21 and as for the heart set upon their abominations and their iniquities as their heart went after them i have recompensed their ways on their heads saith the lord22 then the cherubs lifted up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above 23and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain which was in front of the city24 and the spirit took me up and brought me to the land of the chaldeans to the captivity in a vision by the spirit of god and i went up after the vision which i saw 25 and i spoke to the captivity all the words of the lord which he had shewed me chapter 12121 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man thou dwellest in the midst of the iniquities of those who have eyes to see and see not and have ears to hear and hear not because it is a provoking house3 thou therefore son of man prepare thyself baggage for going into captivity by day in their sight and thou shalt be led into captivity from thy place into another place in their sight that they may see that it is a provoking house 4 and thou shalt carry forth thy baggage baggage for captivity by day before their eyes and thou shalt go forth at even as a captive goes forth in their sight5dig for thyself into the wall of the house and thou shalt pass through it in their sight 6 thou shalt be lifted up on men’s shoulders and shalt go forth in secret thou shalt cover thy face and shalt not see the ground because i have made thee a sign to the house of israel7 and i did thus according to all that he commanded me and i carried forth my baggage for captivity by day and in the evening i dug through the wall for myself and went out secretly i was taken up on men’s shoulders before them 8 and the word of the lord came to me in the morning saying 9 son of man have not the house of israel the provoking house said to thee what doest thou10 say to themthus saith the lord god the prince and the ruler in israel even to all the house of israel who are in the midst of them 11 say i am performing signs as i have done so shall it be to him they shall go into banishment and captivity 12 and the prince in the midst of them shall be borne upon shoulders and shall go forth in secret through the wall and shall dig so that he may go forth thereby he shall cover his face that he may not be seen by any eye and he himself shall not see the ground 13 and i will spread out my net upon him and he shall be caught in my toils and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans but he shall not see it though he shall die there 14 and i will scatter to every wind all his assistants round about him and all that help him and i will draw out a sword after them15 and they shall know that i am the lord when i have scattered them among the nations and i will disperse them in the countries16 and i will leave of them a few men in number spared from the sword and from famine and pestilence that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they have gone and they shall know that i am the lord17 and the word of the lord came to me saying 18 son of man eat thy bread with sorrow and drink thy water with torment and affliction 19 and thou shalt say to the people of the land thus saith the lord to the inhabitants of jerusalem on the land of israel they shall eat their bread in scarcity and shall drink their water in desolation that the land may be desolate with all that it contains for all that dwell in it are ungodly 20 and their inhabited cities shall be laid utterly waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord21 and the word of the lord came to me saying 22 son of man what is your parable on the land of israel that ye say the days are long the vision has perished 23 therefore say to themthus saith the lord i will even set aside this parable and the house of israel shall no more at all use this parable for thou shalt say to them the days are at hand and the import of every vision 24 for there shall no more be any false vision nor any one prophesying flatteries in the midst of the children of israel 25 for i the lord will speak my words i will speak and perform them and will no more delay for in your days o provoking house i will speak the word and will perform it saith the lord26 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying 27 son of man behold the provoking house of israel boldly say the vision which this man sees is for many days and he prophesies for times afar off 28 therefore say to them thus saith the lord henceforth none of my words shall linger which i shall speak i will speak and do saith the lord chapter 13131 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel and thou shalt prophesy and shalt say to them hear ye the word of the lord3 thus saith the lord woe to them that prophesy out of their own heart and who see nothing at all 4 thy prophets o israel are like foxes in the deserts 5 they have not continued steadfast and they have gathered flocks against the house of israel they that say 6 in the day of the lord have not stood seeing false visions prophesying vanities who say the lord saith and the lord has not sent them and they began to try to confirm the word 7 have ye not seen a false vision and spoken vain prophecies 8 and therefore saythus saith the lord because your words are false and your prophecies are vain therefore behold i am against you saith the lord9 and i will stretch forth my hand against the prophets that see false visions and those that utter vanities they shall not partake of the instruction of my people neither shall they be written in the roll of the house of israel and they shall not enter into the land of israel and they shall know that i am the lord 10 because they have caused my people to err saying peace and there is no peace and one builds a wall and they plaster it —it shall fall11 say to them that plaster it it shall fall and there shall be a flooding rain and i will send great stones upon their joinings and they shall fall and there shall be a sweeping wind and it shall be broken 12 and lo the wall has fallen and will they not say to you where is your plaster wherewith ye plastered it 13 therefore thus saith the lord i will even cause to burst forth a sweeping blast with fury and there shall be a flooding rain in my wrath and in my fury i will bring on great stones for complete destruction 14 and i will break down the wall which ye have plastered and it shall fall and i will lay it on the ground and its foundations shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed with rebukes and ye shall know that i am the lord15 and i will accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that plaster it it shall fall and i said to you the wall is not nor they that plaster it 16 even the prophets of israel who prophesy concerning jerusalem and who see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord 17 and thou son of man set thy face firmly against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy against them 18 and thou shalt say thus saith the lord woe to the women that sew pillows under every elbow and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to pervert souls the souls of my people are perverted and they have saved souls alive 19 and they have dishonoured me before my people for a handful of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls which should not die and to save alive the souls which should not live while ye speak to a people hearing vain speeches20 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your pillows whereby ye there confound souls and i will tear them away from your arms and will set at liberty their souls which ye pervert to scatter them 21 and i will tear your kerchiefs and will rescue my people out of your hands and they shall no longer be in your hands to be confounded and ye shall know that i am the lord22 because ye have perverted the heart of the righteous whereas i perverted him not and that in order to strengthen the hands of the wicked that he should not at all turn from his evil way and live 23 therefore ye shall not see false visions and ye shall no more utter prophecies but i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord chapter 14141 and there came to me men of the people of israel of the elders and sat before me 2 and the word of the lord came to me saying 3 son of man these men have conceived their devices in their hearts and have set before their faces the punishment of their iniquities shall i indeed answer them 4 therefore speak to them and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord any man of the house of israel who shall conceive his devices in his heart and shall set the punishment of his iniquity before his face and shall come to the prophet i the lord will answer him according to the things in which his mind is entangled 5 that he should turn aside the house of israel according to their hearts that are estranged from me in their thoughts6 therefore say to the house of israel thus saith the lord god be converted and turn from your evil practices and from all your sins and turn your faces back again 7 for any man of the house of israel or of the strangers that sojourn in israel who shall separate himself from me and conceive his imaginations in his heart and set before his face the punishment of his iniquity and come to the prophet to enquire of him concerning me i the lord will answer him according to the things wherein he is entangled8and i will set my face against that man and will make him desolate and ruined and will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord9 and if a prophet should cause to err and should speak i the lord have caused that prophet to err and will stretch out my hand upon him and will utterly destroy him from the midst of my people israel 10 and they shall bear their iniquity according to the trespass of him that asks and it shall be in like manner to the prophet according to the trespass 11 that the house of israel may no more go astray from me and that they may no more defile themselves with any of their transgressions so shall they be my people and i will be their god saith the lord12 and the word of the lord came to me saying 13 son of man if a land shall sin against me by committing a trespass then will i stretch out my hand upon it and will break its staff of bread and will send forth famine upon it and cut off from it man and beast14and though these three men should be in the midst of it noe and daniel and job they alone should be delivered by their righteousness saith the lord15 if again i bring evil beasts upon the land and take vengeance upon it and it be ruined and there be no one to pass through for fear of the wild beasts 16 and if these three men should be in the midst of it as i live saith the lord neither sons nor daughters shall be saved but these only shall be saved and the land shall be destroyed 17 or again if i bring a sword upon that land and say let the sword go through the land and i cut off from them man and beast 18 though these three men were in the midst of it as i live saith the lord they shall not deliver sons or daughters but they only shall be saved themselves19 or if again i send pestilence upon that land and pour out my wrath upon it in blood to destroy from off it man and beast 20 and should noe and daniel and job be in the midst of it as i live saith the lord there shall be left them neither sons nor daughters only they by their righteousness shall deliver their souls21 thus saith the lord and if i even send upon jerusalem my four sore judgments sword and famine and evil beasts and pestilence to destroy from out of it man and beast 22 yet behold there shall be men left in it the escaped thereof who shall lead forth of it sons and daughters behold they shall go forth to you and ye shall see their ways and their thoughts and ye shall mourn over the evils which i have brought upon jerusalem even all the evils which i have brought upon it 23 and they shall comfort you because ye shall see their ways and their thoughts and ye shall know that i have not done in vain all that i have done in it saith the lord chapter 15151 and the word of the lord came to me saying2 and thou son of man—of all the wood of the branches that are among the trees of the forest what shall be made of the wood of the vine 3 will they take wood of it to make it fit for work will they take of it a peg to hang any vessel upon it 4 it is only given to the fire to be consumed the fire consumes that which is yearly pruned of it and it is utterly gone will it be useful for any work 5not even while it is yet whole will it be useful for any work if the fire shall have utterly consumed it will it still be fit for work 6therefore say thus saith the lord as the vinetree among the trees of the forest which i have given up to the fire to be consumed so have i given up the inhabitants of jerusalem 7 and i will set my face against them they shall go forth of the fire and yet fire shall devour them and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set my face against them 8 and i will give up the land to ruin because they have utterly transgressed saith the lord chapter 16161 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man testify to jerusalem of her iniquities 3 and thou shalt say thus saith the lord to jerusalem thy root and thy birth are of the land of chanaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother a chettite4 and as for thy birth in the day wherein thou wast born thou didst not bind thy breasts and thou wast not washed in water neither wast thou salted with salt neither wast thou swathed in swaddlingbands 5 nor did mine eye pity thee to do for thee one of all these things to feel at all for thee but thou wast cast out on the face of the field because of the deformity of thy person in the day wherein thou wast born6 and i passed by to thee and saw thee polluted in thy blood and i said to thee let there be life out of thy blood 7 increase i have made thee as the springing grass of the field so thou didst increase and grow and didst enter into great cities thy breasts were set and thy hair grew whereas thou wast naked and bare8 and i passed by thee and saw thee and behold it was thy time and a time of resting and i spread my wings over thee and covered thy shame and swear to thee and i entered into covenant with thee saith the lord and thou becamest mine 9 and i washed thee in water and washed thy blood from thee and anointed thee with oil 10 and i clothed thee with embroidered garments and clothed thee beneath with purple and girded thee with fine linen and clothed thee with silk 11 and decked thee also with ornaments and put bracelets on thine hands and a necklace on thy neck 12 and i put a pendant on thy nostril and rings in thine ears and a crown of glory on thine head 13 so thou wast adorned with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and variegated work thou didst eat fine flour and oil and honey and didst become extremely beautiful 14 and thy name went forth among the nations for thy beauty because it was perfected with elegance and in the comeliness which i put upon thee saith the lord15 thou didst trust in thy beauty and didst go awhoring because of thy renown and didst pour out thy fornication on every passer by 16 and thou didst take of thy garments and madest to thyself idols of needlework and didst go awhoring after them therefore thou shalt never come in nor shall the like take place 17 and thou tookest thy fair ornaments of my gold and of my silver of what i gave thee and thou madest to thyself male images and thou didst commit whoredom with them 18 and thou didst take thy variegated apparel and didst clothe them and thou didst set before them mine oil and mine incense 19 and thou tookest my bread which i gave thee  yea i fed thee with fine flour and oil and honey and didst set them before them for a sweetsmelling savour yea it was so saith the lord20 and thou tookest thy sons and thy daughters whom thou borest and didst sacrifice these to them to be destroyed thou didst go awhoring as if that were little 21 and didst slay thy children and gavest them up in offering them to them for an expiation 22 this is beyond all thy fornication and thou didst not remember thine infancy when thou wast naked and bare and didst live though defiled in thy blood23 and it came to pass after all thy wickedness saith the lord 24 that thou didst build thyself a house of fornication and didst make thyself a public place in every street 25 and on the head of every way thou didst set up thy fornications and didst defile thy beauty and didst open thy feet to every passer by and didst multiply thy fornication 26 and thou didst go awhoring after the children of egypt thy neighbors great of flesh and didst go awhoring often to provoke me to anger27 and if i stretch out my hand against thee then will i abolish thy statutes and deliver thee up to the wills of them that hate thee even to the daughters of the philistines that turned thee aside from the way wherein thou sinned28 and thou didst go awhoring to the daughters of assur and not even thus wast thou satisfied yea thou didst go awhoring and wast not satisfied 29 and thou didst multiply thy covenants with the land of the chaldeans and not even with these wast thou satisfied30 why should i make a covenant with thy daughter saith the lord while thou doest all these things the works of a harlot and thou hast gone awhoring in a threefold degree with thy daughters 31 thou hast built a house of harlotry in every top of a way and hast set up thine high place in every street and thou didst become as a harlot gathering hires 32 an adulteress resembles thee taking rewards of her husband 33 she has even given rewards to all that went awhoring after her and thou hast given rewards to all thy lovers yea thou didst load them with rewards that they should come to thee from every side for thy fornication34 and there has happened in thee perverseness in thy fornication beyond other women and they have committed fornication with thee in that thou givest hires over and above and hires were not given to thee and thus perverseness happened in thee35 therefore harlot hear the word of the lord 36 thus saith the lord because thou hast poured forth thy money therefore thy shame shall be discovered in thy harlotry with thy lovers and with regard to all the imaginations of thine iniquities and for the blood of thy children which thou hast given to them 37 therefore behold i will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast consorted and all whom thou hast loved with all whom thou didst hate and i will gather them against thee round about and will expose thy wickedness to them and they shall see all thy shame 38 and i will be avenged on thee with the vengeance of an adulteress and i will bring upon thee blood of fury and jealousy 39 and i will deliver thee into their hands and they shall break down thy house of harlotry and destroy thine high place and they shall strip thee of thy garments and shall take thy proud ornaments and leave thee naked and bare 40 and they shall bring multitudes upon thee and they shall stone thee with stones and pierce thee with their swords 41 and they shall burn thine houses with fire and shall execute vengeance on thee in the sight of many women and i will turn thee back from harlotry and i will no more give thee rewards42 so will i slacken my fury against thee and my jealousy shall be removed from thee and i will rest and be no more careful for thee 43 because thou didst not remember thine infancy and thou didst grieve me in all these things therefore behold i have recompensed thy ways upon thine head saith the lord for thus hast thou wrought ungodliness above all thine other iniquities44 these are all the things they have spoken against thee in a proverb saying 45 as is the mother so is thy mother’s daughter thou art she that has rejected her husband and her children and the sisters of thy sisters have rejected their husbands and their children your mother was a chettite and your father an amorite 46 your elder sister who dwells on thy left hand is samaria she and her daughters and thy younger sister that dwells on the right hand is sodom and her daughters 47 yet notwithstanding thou hast not walked in their ways neither hast thou done according to their iniquities within a little but thou hast exceeded them in all thy ways48 as i live saith the lord this sodom and her daughters have not done as thou and thy daughters have done 49 moreover this was the sin of thy sister sodom pride she and her daughters lived in pleasure in fullness of bread and in abundance this belonged to her and her daughters and they helped not the hand of the poor and needy 50 and they boasted and wrought iniquities before me so i cut them off as i saw fit51 also samaria has not sinned according to half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine iniquities beyond them and thou hast justified thy sisters in all thine iniquities which thou hast committed 52 thou therefore bear thy punishment for that thou hast corrupted thy sisters by thy sins which thou hast committed beyond them and thou hast made them appear more righteous than thyself thou therefore be ashamed and bear thy dishonour in that thou hast justified thy sisters 53 and i will turn their captivity even the captivity of sodom and her daughters and i will turn the captivity of samaria and her daughters and i will turn thy captivity in the midst of them 54 that thou mayest bear thy punishment and be dishonoured for all that thou hast done in provoking me to anger55 and thy sister sodom and her daughters shall be restored as they were at the beginning and thou and thy daughters shall be restored as ye were at the beginning56 and surely thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the days of thy pride 57 before thy wickedness was discovered even now thou art the reproach of the daughters of syria and of all that are round about her even of the daughters of the philistines that compass thee round about 58 as for thine ungodliness and thine iniquities thou hast borne them saith the lord59 thus saith the lord i will even do to thee as thou hast done as thou hast dealt shamefully in these things to transgress my covenant 60 and i will remember my covenant made with thee in the days of thine infancy and i will establish to thee an everlasting covenant 61 then thou shalt remember thy way and shalt be utterly dishonoured when thou receivest thine elder sisters with thy younger ones and i will give them to thee for building up but not by thy covenant 62 and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord 63 that thou mayest remember and be ashamed and mayest no more be able to open thy mouth for thy shame when i am reconciled to thee for all that thou hast done saith the lord chapter 17171 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man relate a tale and speak a parable to the house of israel 3 and thou shalt say thus saith the lord a great eagle with large wings spreading them out very far with many claws which has the design of entering into libanus—and he took the choice branches of the cedar 4 he cropped off the ends of the tender twigs and brought them into the land of chanaan he laid them up in a walled city 5 and he took of the seed of the land and sowed it in a field planted by much water he set it in a conspicuous place 6 and it sprang up and became a weak and little vine so that the branches thereof appeared upon it and its roots were under it and it became a vine and put forth shoots and sent forth its tendrils7 and there was another great eagle with great wings and many claws and behold this vine bent itself round toward him and her roots were turned towards him and she sent forth her branches towards him that he might water her together with the growth of her plantation 8 she thrives in a fair field by much water to produce shoots and bear fruit that she might become a great vine9 therefore say thus saith the lord shall it prosper shall not the roots of her tender stem and her fruit be blighted yea all her early shoots shall be dried up and that not by a mighty arm nor by many people to tear her up from her roots 10 and behold it thrives shall it prosper shall it not wither as soon as the east wind touches it it shall be withered together with the growth of its shoots11 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying 12 son of man say now to the provoking house know ye not what these things were say to them whenever the king of babylon shall come against jerusalem then he shall take her king and her princes and shall take them home to babylon 13 and he shall take of the seed royal and shall make a covenant with him and shall bind him with an oath and he shall take the princes of the land 14 that it may become a weak kingdom so as never to lift itself up that he may keep his covenant and establish it 15 and if he shall revolt from him to send his messengers into egypt that they may give him horses and much people shall he prosper shall he that acts as an adversary be preserved and shall he that transgresses the covenant be preserved16 as i live saith the lord verily in the place where the king is that made him king who dishonoured my oath and who broke my covenant shall he die with him in the midst of babylon 17 and pharaoh shall make war upon him not with a large force or great multitude in throwing up a mound and in building of forts to cut off souls 18 whereas he has profaned the oath so as to break the covenant when behold i engage his hand and he has done all these things to him he shall not escape19 therefore say thus saith the lord as i live surely mine oath which he has profaned and my covenant which he has transgressed i will even recompense it upon his head 20 and i will spread a net upon him and he shall be caught in its snare 21 in every battle of his they shall fall by the sword and i will scatter his remnant to every wind and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it22 for thus saith the lord i will even take of the choice branches of the cedar from the top thereof i will crop off their hearts and i will plant it on a high mountain 23 and i will hang it on a lofty mountain of israel yea i will plant it and it shall put forth shoots and shall bear fruit and it shall be a great cedar and every bird shall rest beneath it even every fowl shall rest under its shadow its branches shall be restored 24 and all the trees of the field shall know that i am the lord that bring low the high tree and exalt the low tree and wither the green tree and cause the dry tree to flourish i the lord have spoken and will do it chapter 18181 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man what mean ye by this parable among the children of israel saying the fathers have eaten unripe grapes and the children’s teeth have been set on edge3 as i live saith the lord surely this parable shall no more be spoken in israel 4 for all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son they are mine the soul that sins it shall die5 but the man who shall be just who executes judgment and righteousness 6 who shall not eat upon the mountains and shall not at all lift up his eyes to the devices of the house of israel and shall not defile his neighbor’s wife and shall not draw nigh to her that is removed 7 and shall not oppress any man but shall return the pledge of the debtor and shall be guilty of no plunder shall give his bread to the hungry and clothe the naked 8 and shall not lend his money upon usury and shall not receive usurious increase and shall turn back his hand from injustice shall execute righteous judgment between a man and his neighbor 9 and has walked in my commandments and kept mine ordinances to do them he is righteous he shall surely live saith the lord10 and if he beget a mischievous son shedding blood and committing sins 11 who has not walked in the way of his righteous father but has even eaten upon the mountains and has defiled his neighbor’s wife 12 and has oppressed the poor and needy and has committed robbery and not restored a pledge and has set his eyes upon idols has wrought iniquities 13 has lent upon usury and taken usurious increase he shall by no means live he has wrought all these iniquities he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him14 and if he beget a son and the son see all his father’s sins which he has wrought and fear and not do according to them 15 and if he has not eaten on the mountains and has not set his eyes on the devices of the house of israel and has not defiled his neighbor’s wife 16 and has not oppressed a man and has not retained the pledge nor committed robbery has given his bread to the hungry and has clothed the naked 17 and has turned back his hand from unrighteousness has not received interest or usurious increase has wrought righteousness and walked in mine ordinances he shall not die for the iniquities of his father he shall surely live 18 but if his father grievously afflict or plunder he has wrought enmity in the midst of my people and shall die in his iniquity19 but ye will say why has not the son borne the iniquity of the father because the son has wrought judgment and mercy has kept all my statues and done them he shall surely live 20 but the soul that sins shall die and the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the iniquity of the transgressor shall be upon him21 and if the transgressor turn away from all his iniquities which he has committed and keep all my commandments and do justice and mercy he shall surely live and shall by no means die 22 none of his trespasses which he has committed shall be remembers in his righteousness which he has done he shall live 23 shall i at all desire death of the sinner saith the lord as i desire that he should turn from his evil way and live24 but when the righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity according to all the transgressions which the transgressor has wrought none of his righteousness which he has wrought shall be at all remembered in his trespass wherein he has trespassed and in his sins wherein he has sinned in them shall he die25 yet ye have said the way of the lord is not straight hear now all the house of israel will not my way be straight is your way straight 26 when the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits a trespass and dies in the trespass he has committed he shall even die in it 27 and when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed and shall do judgment and justice he has kept his soul 28 and has turned away from all his ungodliness which he has committed he shall surely live he shall not die29 yet the house of israel say the way of the lord is not right is not my way right o house of israel is not your way wrong 30 i will judge you o house of israel saith the lord each one according to his way be converted and turn from all your ungodliness and it shall not become to you the punishment of iniquity 31 cast away from yourselves all your ungodliness wherein ye have sinned against me and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit for why should ye die o house of israel 32 for i desire not the death of him that dies saith the lord chapter 19191 moreover do thou take up a lamentation for the prince of israel 2 and say why is thy mother become a whelp in the midst of lions in the midst of lions she has multiplied her whelps 3 and one of her whelps sprang forth he became a lion and learned to take prey he devoured men 4 and the nations heard a report of him he was caught in their pit and they brought him into the land of egypt in chains5 and she saw that he was driven away from her and her hope of him perished and she took another of her whelps she made him a lion 6 and he went up and down in the midst of lions he became a lion and learned to take prey he devoured men 7 and he prowled in his boldness and laid waste their cities and made the land desolate and the fullness of it by the voice of his roaring8 then the nations set upon him from the countries round about and they spread their nets upon him he was taken in their pit 9and they put him in chains and in a cage and he came to the king of babylon and he cast him into prison that his voice should not be heard on the mountains of israel 10 thy mother was as a vine and as a blossom on a pomegranate tree planted by water her fruit and her shoot abounded by reason of much water 11 and she became a rod for a tribe of princes and was elevated in her bulk in the midst of other trees and she saw her bulk in the multitude of her branches12 but she was broken down in wrath she was cast upon the ground and the east wind dried up her choice branches vengeance came upon them and the rod of her strength was withered fire consumed it 13 and now they have planted her in the wilderness in a dry land 14 and fire is gone out of a rod of her choice boughs and has devoured her and there was no rod of strength in her her race is become a parable of lamentation and it shall be for a lamentation chapter 20201 and it came to pass in the seventh year on the fifteenth day of the month there came men of the elders of the house of israel to enquire of the lord and they sat before me 2 and the word of the lord came to me saying 3 son of man speak to the elders of the house of israel and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord are ye come to enquire of me as i live i will not be enquired of by you saith the lord 4 shall i utterly take vengeance on them son of man testify to them of the iniquities of their fathers 5 and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lordfrom the day that i chose the house of israel and became known to the seed of the house of jacob and was known to them in the land of egypt and helped them with my hand saying i am the lord your god 6 in that day i helped them with my hand to bring them out of the land of egypt into the land which i prepared for them a land flowing with milk and honey it is abundant beyond every land 7 and i said to them let every one cast away the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the devices of egypt i am the lord your god8 but they revolted from me and would not hearken to me they cast not away the abominations of their eyes and forsook not the devices of egypt then i said that i would pour out my wrath upon them to accomplish my wrath upon them in the midst of egypt9but i wrought so that my name should not be at all profaned in the sight of the gentiles in the midst of whom they are among whom i was made known to them in their sight to bring them out of the land of egypt10 and i brought them into the wilderness 11 and i gave them my commandments and made known to them mine ordinances all which if a man shall do he shall even live in them 12 and i gave them my sabbaths that they should be for a sign between me and them that they should know that i am the lord that sanctify them13 and i said to the house of israel in the wilderness walk ye in my commandments but they walked not in them and they rejected mine ordinances which if a man shall do he shall even live in them and they grievously profaned my sabbaths and i said that i would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness to consume them 14 but i wrought so that my name should not be at all profaned before the gentiles before whose eyes i brought them out15 but i lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness once for all that i would not bring them into the land which i gave them a land flowing with milk and honey it is sweeter than all lands 16 because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my commandments but profaned my sabbaths and went after the imaginations of their hearts17 yet mine eyes spared them so as not to destroy them utterly and i did not make an end of them in the wilderness 18 and i said to their children in the wilderness walk not ye in the customs of your fathers and keep not their ordinances and have no fellowship with their practices nor defile yourselves with them 19 i am the lord your god walk in my commandments and keep mine ordinances and do them 20 and hallow my sabbaths and let them be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am the lord your god21 but they provoked me and their children walked not in my commandments and they took no heed to mine ordinances to do them which if a man shall do he shall even live in them and they profaned my sabbaths then i said that i would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness to accomplish mine anger upon them 22 but i wrought so that my name might not be at all profaned before the gentiles and i brought them out in their sight23 i lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the gentiles and disperse them in the countries 24 because they kept not mine ordinances and rejected my commandments and profaned my sabbaths and their eyes went after the imaginations of their fathers25 so i gave them commandments that were not good and ordinances in which they should not live 26 and i will defile them by their own decrees when i pass through upon every one that opens the womb that i may destroy them27 therefore son of man speak to the house of israel and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord hitherto have your fathers provoked me in their trespasses in which they transgressed against me 28 whereas i brought them into the land concerning which i lifted up mine hand to give it them and they looked upon every high hill and every shady tree and they sacrificed there to their gods and offered there sweetsmelling savour and there they poured out their drinkofferings 29 and i said to them what is abama that ye go in thither and they called its name abama until this day30 therefore say to the house of israel thus saith the lord do ye pollute yourselves with the iniquities of your fathers and do ye go awhoring after their abominations 31 and do ye pollute yourselves with the firstfruits of your gifts in the offerings wherewith ye pollute yourselves in all your imaginations until this day and shall i answer you o house of israel as i live saith the lord i will not answer you neither shall this thing come upon your spirit 32 and it shall not be as ye say we will be as the nations and as the tribes of the earth to worship stocks and stones33 therefore as i live saith the lord i will reign over you with a strong hand and with a high arm and with outpoured wrath 34 i will bring you out from the nations and will take you out of the lands wherein ye were dispersed with a strong hand and with a high arm and with outpoured wrath 35 and i will bring you into the wilderness of the nations and will plead with you there face to face36 as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i judge you saith the lord 37 and i will cause you to pass under my rod and i will bring you in by number 38 and i will separate from among you the ungodly and the revolters for i will lead them forth out of their place of sojourning and they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord even the lord39 and as to you o house of israel thus saith the lord even the lord put away each one his evil practices and hereafter if ye hearken to me then shall ye no more profane my holy name by your gifts and by devices 40 for upon my holy mountain on the high mountain saith the lord even the lord there shall all the house of israel serve me for ever and there will i accept you and there will i have respect to your firstfruits and the firstfruits of your offerings in all your holy things41 i will accept you with a sweetsmelling savour when i bring you out from the nations and take you out of the countries wherein ye have been dispersed and i will be sanctified among you in the sight of the nations 42 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have brought you into the land of israel into the land concerning which i lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers 43 and ye shall there remember your ways and your devices wherewith ye defiled yourselves and ye shall bewail yourselves for all your wickedness 44 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have done thus to you that my name may not be profaned in your evil ways and in your corrupt devices saith the lord45 and the word of the lord came to me saying 46 son of man set thy face against thaeman and look toward darom and prophesy against the chief forest of nageb 47 and thou shalt say to the forest of nageb hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord even the lord behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour in thee every green tree and every dry tree the flame that is kindled shall not be quenched and every face shall be scorched with it from the south to the north 48 and all flesh shall know that i the lord have kindled it it shall not be quenched49 and i said not so o lord god they say to me is not this that is spoken a parable chapter 21211 and the word of the lord came to me saying2 therefore prophesy son of man set thy face steadfastly toward jerusalem and look toward their holy places and thou shalt prophesy against the land of israel 3 and thou shalt say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and i will draw forth my sword out of its sheath and i will destroy out of thee the transgressor and unrighteous 4 because i will destroy out of thee the unrighteous and the transgressor therefore so shall my sword come forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north 5 and all flesh shall know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath it shall not return any more6 and thou son of man groan with the breaking of thy loins thou shalt even groan heavily in their sight 7 and it shall come to pass if they shall say to thee wherefore dost thou groan that thou shalt say for the report because it comes and every heart shall break and all hands shall become feeble and all flesh and every spirit shall faint and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture behold it comes saith the lord8 and the word of the lord came to me saying 9 son of man prophesy and thou shalt say thus saith the lord say sword sword be sharpened and rage 10 that thou mayest slay victims be sharpened that thou mayest be bright ready for slaughter slay set at nought despise every tree 11 and he made it ready for his hand to hold the sword is sharpened it is ready to put into the hand of the slayer12 cry out and howl son of man for this sword is come upon my people this sword is come upon all the princes of israel they shall be as strangers judgment with the sword is come upon my people therefore clap thine hands for sentence has been passed 13 and what if even the tribe be rejected it shall not be saith the lord god14 and thou son of man prophesy and clap thine hands and take a second sword the third sword is the sword of the slain the great sword of the slain and thou shalt strike them with amazement lest the heart should faint 15 and the weak ones be multiplied at every gate—they are given up to the slaughter of the sword it is well fitted for slaughter it is well fitted for glittering 16 and do thou go on sharpen thyself on the right and on the left whithersoever thy face may set itself17 and i also will clap my hands and let loose my fury i the lord have spoken it18 and the word of the lord came to me saying 19 and thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may enter in the two shall go forth of one country and there shall be a force at the top of the way of the city thou shalt set it at the top of the way 20 that the sword may enter in upon rabbath of the children of ammon and upon judea and upon jerusalem in the midst thereof21 for the king of babylon shall stand on the old way at the head of the two ways to use divination to make bright the arrow and to enquire of the graven images and to examine the victims  22 on his right was the divination against jerusalem to cast a mound to open the mouth in shouting to lift up the voice with crying to cast a mound against her gates to cast up a heap and to build forts23 and he was to them as one using divination before them and he himself recounting his iniquities that they might be borne in mind24 therefore thus saith the lord because ye have caused your iniquities to be remembered in the discovery of your wickedness so that your sins should be seen in all your wickedness and in your evil practices because ye have caused remembrance of them in these shall ye be taken 25 and thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day even an end is come in a sea of iniquity thus saith the lord 26 thou hast taken off the mitre and put on the crown it shall not have such another after it thou hast abased that which was high and exalted that which was low 27 injustice injustice injustice will i make it woe to it such shall it be until he comes to whom it belongs and i will deliver it to him28 and thou son of man prophesy and thou shalt say thus saith the lord concerning the children of ammon and concerning their reproach and thou shalt say o sword sword drawn for slaughter and drawn for destruction awake that thou mayest gleam 29while thou art seeing vain visions and while thou art prophesying falsehoods to bring thyself upon the necks of ungodly transgressors the day is come even an end in a season of iniquity30 turn rest not in this place wherein thou wert born in thine own land will i judge thee 31 and i will pour out my wrath upon thee i will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath and i will deliver thee into the hands of barbarians skilled in working destruction 32thou shalt be fuel for fire thy blood shall be in the midst of thy land there shall be no remembrance at all of thee for i the lord have spoken it chapter 22221 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 and thou son of man wilt thou judge the bloody city yea declare thou to her all her iniquities 3 and thou shalt say thus saith the lord god o city that sheds blood in the midst of her so that her time should come and that forms devices against herself to defile herself 4 in their blood which thou hast shed thou hast transgressed and in thy devices which thou hast formed thou hast polluted thyself and thou hast brought nigh thy days and hast brought on the time of thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach to the gentiles and a mockery to all the countries 5 to those near thee and to those far distant from thee and they shall mock thee thou that art notoriously unclean and abundant in iniquities6 behold the princes of the house of israel have conspired in thee each one with his kindred that they might shed blood 7 in thee they have reviled father and mother and in thee they have behaved unjustly toward the stranger they have oppressed the orphan and widow 8 and they have set at nought my holy things and in thee they have profaned my sabbaths 9 there are robbers in thee to shed blood in thee and in thee they have eaten upon the mountains they have wrought ungodliness in the midst of thee 10 in thee they have uncovered the father’s shame and in thee they have humbled her that was set apart for uncleanness 11 they have dealt unlawfully each one with his neighbor’s wife and each one in ungodliness has defiled his daughterinlaw and in thee they have humbled each one his sister the daughter of his father12 in thee they have received gifts to shed blood they have received in thee interest and usurious increase and by oppression thou hast brought thy wickedness to the full and hast forgotten me saith the lord13 and if i shall smite my hand at thine iniquities which thou hast accomplished which thou hast wrought and at thy blood that has been shed in the midst of thee 14 shall thy heart endure shall thine hands be strong in the days which i bring upon thee i the lord have spoken and will do it  15 and i will scatter thee among the nations and disperse thee in the countries and thy uncleanness shall be removed out of thee 16 and i will give heritages in thee in the sight of the nations and ye shall know that i am the lord17 and the word of the lord came to me saying 18 son of man behold the house of israel are all become to me as it were mixed with brass and iron and tin and lead they are mixed up in the midst of the silver19 therefore say thus saith the lord god because ye have become one mixture therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem 20 as silver and brass and iron and tin and lead are gathered into the midst of the furnace to blow fire into it that they may be melted so will i take you in my wrath and i will gather and melt you 21 and i will blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof 22 as silver is melted in the midst of a furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my wrath upon you23 and the word of the lord came to me saying 24 son of man say to her thou art the land that is not rained upon neither has rain come upon thee in the day of wrath 25 whose princes in the midst of her are as roaring lions seizing prey devouring souls by oppression and taking bribes and thy widows are multiplied in the midst of thee 26 her priests also have set at nought my law and profaned my holy things they have not distinguished between the holy and profane nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i was profaned in the midst of them 27 her princes in the midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood that they may get dishonest gain 28 and her prophets that daub them shall fall that see vanities that prophesy falsehoods saying thus saith the lord when the lord has not spoken 29 that sorely oppress the people of the land with injustice and commit robbery oppressing the poor and needy and not dealing justly with the stranger30 and i sought from among them a man behaving uprightly and standing before me perfectly in the time of wrath so that i should not utterly destroy her but i found him not 31 so i have poured out my wrath upon her in the fury of mine anger to accomplish it i have recompensed their ways on their own heads saith the lord god chapter 23231 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man there were two women daughters of one mother 3 and they went awhoring in egypt in their youth there their breasts fell there they lost their virginity 4 and their names were oola the elder and ooliba her sister and they were mine and bore sons and daughters and as for their names samaria was oola and jerusalem was ooliba5 and oola went awhoring from me and doted on her lovers on the assyrians that were her neighbors 6 clothed with purple princes and captains they were young men and choice all horseman riding on horses 7 and she bestowed her fornication upon them all were choice sons of the assyrians and on whomsoever she doted herself with them she defiled herself in all their devices8 and she forsook not her fornication with the egyptians for in her youth they committed fornication with her and they deflowered her and poured out their fornication upon her 9 therefore i delivered her into the hands of her lovers into the hands of the children of the assyrians on whom she doted 10 they uncovered her shame they took her sons and daughters and slew her with the sword and she became a byword among women and they wrought vengeance in her for the sake of the daughters11 and her sister ooliba saw it and she indulged in her fondness more corruptly than she and in her fornication more than the fornication of her sister 12 she doted upon the sons of the assyrian princes and captains her neighbours clothed with fine linen horsemen riding on horses they were all choice young men 13 and i saw that they were defiled that the two had one way14 and she increased her fornication and she saw men painted on the wall likenesses of the chaldeans painted with a pencil 15having variegated girdles on their loins having also richly dyed attire upon their heads all had a princely appearance the likeness of the children of the chaldeans of their native land 16 and she doted upon them as soon as she saw them and sent forth messengers to them into the land of the chaldeans 17 and the sons of babylon came to her into the bed of rest and they defiled her in her fornication and she was defiled by them and her soul was alienated from them 18 and she exposed her fornication and exposed her shame and my soul was alienated from her even as my soul was alienated from her sister19 and thou didst multiply thy fornication so as to call to remembrance the days of thy youth wherein thou didst commit whoredom in egypt 20 and thou didst dote upon the chaldeans whose flesh is as the flesh of the asses and their members as the members of horses 21 and thou didst look upon the iniquity of thy youth the things which thou wroughtest in egypt in thy lodgings where were the breasts of thy youth22 therefore ooliba thus saith the lord behold i will stir up thy lovers against thee from whom thy soul is alienated and i will bring them upon thee round about 23 the children of babylon and all the chaldeans phacuc and sue and hychue and all the sons of the assyrians with them choice young men governors and captains all princes and renowned riding on horses 24 and they all shall come upon thee from the north chariots and wheels with a multitude of nations shields and targets and the enemy shall set a watch against thee round about and i will set judgment before them and they shall take vengeance on thee with their judgments 25and i will bring upon thee my jealousy and they shall deal with thee in great wrath they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and shall cast down thy remnant with the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy remnant fire shall devour 26and they shall strip thee of thy raiment and take away thine ornaments 27 so i will turn back thine ungodliness from thee and thy fornication from the land of egypt and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes upon them and shalt no more remember egypt28 wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the hands of those whom thou hatest from whom thy soul is alienated 29 and they shall deal with thee in hatred and shall take all the fruits of thy labours and thy toils and thou shalt be naked and bare and the shame of thy fornication shall be exposed and thy ungodliness and thy fornication 30 brought this upon thee in that thou wentest awhoring after the nations and didst defile thyself with their devices31 thou didst walk in the way of thy sister and i will put her cup into thine hands 32 thus saith the lord drink thy sister’s cup deep and large and full to cause complete drunkenness 33 and thou shalt be thoroughly weakened and the cup of destruction the cup of thy sister samaria 34 drink thou it and i will take away her feasts and her new moons for i have spoken it saith the lord 35therefore thus saith the lord because thou has forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore receive thou the reward of thine ungodliness and thy fornication36 and the lord said to me son of man wilt thou not judge oola and ooliba and declare to them their iniquities 37 for they have committed adultery and blood was in their hands they committed adultery with their devices and they passed through the fire to them their children which they bore to me 38 so long too as they did these things to me they defiled my sanctuary and profaned my sabbaths 39 and when they sacrificed their children to their idols they also went into my sanctuary to profane it and whereas they did thus in the midst of my house 40 and whereas they did thus to the men that came from afar to whom they sent messengers and as soon as they came immediately thou didst wash thyself and didst paint thine eyes and adorn thyself with ornaments 41 and satest on a prepared bed and before it there was a table set out and as for mine incense and mine oil they rejoiced in them 42 and they raised a sound of music and that with men coming from the wilderness out of a multitude of men and they put bracelets on their hands and a crown of glory on their heads43 therefore i said do they not commit adultery with these and has she also gone awhoring after the manner of a harlot 44 and they went in to her as men go in to a harlot so they went in to oola and to ooliba to work iniquity 45 and they are just men and shall take vengeance on them with the judgment of an adulteress and the judgment of blood for they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands46 thus saith the lord god bring up a multitude upon them and send trouble and plunder into the midst of them 47 and stone them with the stones of a multitude and pierce them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and shall burn up their houses 48 and i will remove ungodliness out of the land and all the women shall be instructed and shall not do according to their ungodliness 49 and your ungodliness shall be recompensed upon you and ye shall bear the guilt of your devices and ye shall know that i am the lord chapter 24241 and the word of the lord came to me in the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day of the month saying 2 son of man write for thyself daily from this day on which the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem even from this day 3 and speak a parable to the provoking house and thou shalt say to themthus saith the lord set on the caldron and pour water into it 4 and put the pieces into it every prime piece the leg and shoulder taken off from the bones 5 which are taken from choice cattle and burn the bones under them her bones are boiled and cooked in the midst of her6 therefore thus saith the lord o bloody city the caldron in which there is scum and the scum has not gone out of she has brought it forth piece by piece no lot has fallen upon it 7 for her blood is in the midst of her i have set it upon a smooth rock i have not poured it out upon the earth so that the earth should cover it 8 that my wrath should come up for complete vengeance to be taken i set her blood upon a smooth rock so as not to cover it9 therefore thus saith the lord i will also make the firebrand great 10 and i will multiply the wood and kindle the fire that the flesh may be consumed and the liquor boiled away 11 and that it may stand upon the coals that her brass may be thoroughly heated and be melted in the midst of her filthiness and her scum may be consumed 12 and her abundant scum may not come forth of her 13 her scum shall become shameful because thou didst defile thyself and what if thou shalt be purged no more until i have accomplished my wrath14 i the lord have spoken and it shall come and i will do it i will not delay neither will i have any mercy i will judge thee saith the lord according to thy ways and according to thy devices therefore will i judge thee according to thy bloodshed and according to thy devices will i judge thee thou unclean notorious and abundantly provoking one15 and the word of the lord came to me saying 16 son of man behold i take from thee the desire of thine eyes by violence thou shalt not lament neither shalt thou weep 17 thou shalt groan for blood and have mourning upon thy loins thy hair shall not be braided upon thee and thy sandals shall be on thy feet thou shalt in no wise be comforted by their lips and thou shalt not eat the bread of men18 and i spoke to the people in the morning as he commanded me in the evening and i did in the morning as it was commanded me 19 and the people said to me wilt thou not tell us what these things are that thou doest 20 then i said to them the word of the lord came to me saying 21 say to the house of israelthus saith the lord behold i will profane my sanctuary the boast of your strength the desire of your eyes and for which your souls are concerned and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword 22 and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not be comforted at their mouth and ye shall not eat the bread of men 23 and your hair shall be upon your head and your shoes on your feet neither shall ye at all lament or weep but ye shall pine away in your iniquities and shall comfort every one his brother 24 and jezekiel shall be for a sign to you according to all that i have done shall ye do when these things shall come and ye shall know that i am the lord25 and thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take their strength from them the pride of their boasting the desires of their eyes and the pride of their soul their sons and their daughters 26 that in that day he that escapes shall come to thee to tell it thee in thine ears 27 in that day thy mouth shall be opened to him that escapes thou shalt speak and shalt be no longer dumb and thou shalt be for a sign to them and they shall know that i am the lord chapter 25251 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man set thy face steadfastly against the children of ammon and prophesy against them 3 and thou shalt say to the children of ammonhear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord forasmuch as ye have rejoiced against my sanctuary because it was profaned and against the land of israel because it was laid waste and against the house of juda because they went into captivity 4 therefore behold i will deliver you to the children of kedem for an inheritance and they shall lodge in thee with their stuff and they shall pitch their tents in thee they shall eat thy fruits and they shall drink thy milk 5 and i will give up the city of ammon for camels’ pastures and the children of ammon for a pasture of sheep and ye shall know that i am the lord6 for thus saith the lord because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with thy foot and heartily rejoiced against the land of israel 7 therefore i will stretch out my hand against thee and i will make thee a spoil to the nations and i will utterly destroy thee from among the peoples and i will completely cut thee off from out of the countries and thou shalt know that i am the lord8 thus saith the lord because moab has said behold are not the house of israel and juda like all the other nations 9 therefore behold i will weaken the shoulder of moab from his frontier cities even the choice land the house of bethasimuth above the fountain of the city by the seaside 10 i have given him the children of kedem in addition to the children of ammon for an inheritance that there may be no remembrance of the children of ammon 11 and i will execute vengeance on moab and they shall know that i am the lord12 thus saith the lord because of what the idumeans have done in taking vengeance on the house of juda and because they have remembered injuries and have exacted full recompense 13 therefore thus saith the lord i will also stretch out my hand upon idumea and will utterly destroy out of it man and beast and will make it desolate and they that are pursued out of thaeman shall fall by the sword 14 and i will execute my vengeance on idumea by the hand of my people israel and they shall deal in idumea according to mine anger and according to my wrath and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord15 therefore thus saith the lord because the philistines have wrought revengefully and raised up vengeance rejoicing from their heart to destroy the israelites to a man 16 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will stretch out my hand upon the philistines and will utterly destroy the cretans and will cut off the remnant that dwell by the seacoast 17 and i will execute great vengeance upon them and they shall know that i am the lord when i have brought my vengeance upon them chapter 26261 and it came to pass in the eleventh year on the first day of the month that the word of the lord came to me saying2 son of man because sor has said against jerusalem aha she is crushed the nations are destroyed she is turned to me she that was full is made desolate 3 therefore thus saith the lord behold i am against thee o sor and i will bring up many nations against thee as the sea comes up with its waves 4 and they shall cast down the walls of sor and shall cast down thy towers and i will scrape her dust from off her and make her a bare rock 5 she shall be in the midst of the sea a place for repairing nets for i have spoken it saith the lord and it shall be a spoil for the nations 6 and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain with the sword and they shall know that i am the lord7 for thus saith the lord behold i will bring up against thee o sor nabuchodonosor king of babylon from the north he is a king of kings with horses and chariots and horsemen and a concourse of very many nations 8 he shall slay thy daughters that are in the field with the sword and shall set a watch against thee and build forts around thee and carry a rampart round against thee and set up warlike works and array his spears against thee 9 he shall cast down with his swords thy walls and thy towers 10 by reason of thy multitude of his horses their dust shall cover thee and by reason of the sound of his horsemen and the wheels of his chariots the walls shall be shaken when he enters into thy gates as one entering into a city from the plain 11 with the hoofs of his horses they shall trample all thy streets he shall slay thy people with the sword and shall bring down to the ground the support of thy strength12 and he shall prey upon thy power and plunder thy substance and shall cast down thy walls and break down thy pleasant houses and he shall cast thy stones and thy timber and thy dust into the midst of thy sea 13 and he shall destroy the multitude of thy musicians and the sound of thy psalteries shall be heard no more 14 and i will make thee a bare rock thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for i the lord have spoken it saith the lord15 for thus saith the lord god to sor shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall while the wounded are groaning while they have drawn a sword in the midst of thee 16 and all the princes of the nations of the sea shall come down from their thrones and shall take off their crowns from their heads and shall take off their embroidered raiment they shall be utterly amazed they shall sit upon the ground and fear their own destruction and shall groan over thee 17 and they shall take up a lamentation for thee and shall say to thee how art thou destroyed from out of the sea the renowned city that brought her terror upon all her inhabitants18and the isles shall be alarmed at the day of thy fall19 for thus saith the lord god when i shall make the city desolate as the cities that shall not be inhabited when i have brought the deep up upon thee 20 and great waters shall cover thee and i shall bring thee down to them that go down to the pit to the people of old time and shall cause thee to dwell in the depths of the earth as in everlasting desolation with them that go down to the pit that thou mayest not be inhabited nor stand upon the land of life 21 i will make thee a destruction and thou shalt be no more for ever saith the lord god chapter 27271 and the word of the lord came to me saying2 and thou son of man take up a lamentation against sor 3 and thou shalt say to sor that dwells at the entrance of the sea to the mart of the nations coming from many islands thus saith the lord to sorthou hast said i have clothed myself with my beauty 4 in the heart of the sea thy sons have put beauty upon thee for beelim 5cedar in senir was employed for thee in building boards of cypress timber were taken out of libanus and wood to make thee masts of fir 6 they made thine oars of wood out of the land of basan thy sacred utensils they made of ivory thy shady houses of wood from the isles of chetiim 7 fine linen with embroidery from egypt supplied the couch to put honour upon thee and to clothe thee with blue and purple from the isles of elisai and they became thy coverings8 and thy princes were the dwellers in sidon and the aradians were thy rowers thy wise men o sor who were in thee these were thy pilots 9 the elders of the biblians and their wise men who were in thee these helped thy counsel and all the ships of the sea and their rowers traded for thee to the utmost west10 persians and lydians and libyans were in thine army thy warriors hung in thee shields and helmets these gave thee thy glory 11the sons of the aradians and thine army were upon the walls there were guards in thy towers they hung their quivers on thy battlements round about these completed thy beauty12 the carthaginians were thy merchants because of the abundance of all thy strength they furnished thy market with silver and gold and iron and tin and lead 13 greece both the whole world and the adjacent coasts these traded with thee in the persons of men and they gave as thy merchandise vessels of brass14 out of the house of thogarma horses and horsemen furnished the market 15 the sons of the rhodians were thy merchants from the islands they multiplied thy merchandise even elephants’ teeth and to them that came in thou didst return thy prices 16 even men as thy merchandise from the multitude of thy trading population myrrh and embroidered works from tharsis ramoth also and chorchor furnished thy market 17 juda and the children of israel these were thy merchants in the sale of corn and ointments and cassia and they gave the best honey and oil and resin to thy trading population 18 the people of damascus were thy merchants by reason of the abundance of all thy power wine out of chelbon and wool from miletus and they brought wine into thy market19 out of asel came wrought iron and there is the sound of wheels among thy trading population 20 the people of daedan were thy merchants with choice cattle for chariots 21 arabia and all the princes of kedar these were thy traders with thee bringing camels and lambs and rams in which they trade with thee 22 the merchants of sabba and ramma these were thy merchants with choice spices and precious stones and they brought gold to thy market 23 charra and chanaa these were thy merchants assur and charman were thy merchants 24 bringing for merchandise blue and choice stores bound with cords and cypress wood 25 ships were thy merchants in abundance with thy trading population and thou wast filled and very heavily loaded in the heart of the sea26 thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the south wind has broken thee in the heart of the sea 27 thy forces and thy gain and that of thy traders and thy rowers and thy pilots and thy counselors and they that traffic with thee and all thy warriors that are in thee and all thy company in the midst of thee shall perish in the heart of the sea in the day of thy fall 28 at the cry of thy voice thy pilots shall be greatly terrified29 and all the rowers and the mariners shall come down from the ships and the pilots of the sea shall stand on the land 30 and they shall wail over thee with their voice and cry bitterly and put earth on their heads and spread ashes under them31 32 and their sons shall take up a lament for thee even a lamentation for sor saying 33 how large a reward hast thou gained from the sea thou hast filled nations out of thine abundance and out of thy mixed merchandise thou hast enriched all the kings of the earth 34 now art thou broken in the sea thy traders are in the deep water and all thy company in the midst of thee all thy rowers have fallen 35 all the dwellers in the islands have mourned over thee and their kings have been utterly amazed and their countenance has wept 36 merchants from the nations have hissed at thee thou art utterly destroyed and shalt not be any more for ever chapter 28281 and the word of the lord came to me saying2 and thou son of man say to the prince of tyrus thus saith the lord because thine heart has been exalted and thou hast said i am god i have inhabited the dwelling of god in the heart of the sea yet thou art man and not god though thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god 3 art thou wiser than daniel or have not the wise instructed thee with their knowledge 4 hast thou gained power for thyself by thine own knowledge or thine own prudence and gotten gold and silver in thy treasures 5 by thy abundant knowledge and thy traffic thou hast multiplied thy power thy heart has been lifted up by thy power6 therefore thus saith the lord since thou hast set thine heart as the hart of god 7 because of this behold i will bring on thee strange plagues from the nations and they shall draw their swords against thee and against the beauty of thy knowledge 8 and they shall bring down thy beauty to destruction and they shall bring thee down and thou shalt die the death of the slain in the heart of the sea 9 wilt thou indeed say i am god before them that slay thee whereas thou art man and not god 10 thou shalt perish by the hands of strangers among the multitude of the uncircumcised for i have spoken it saith the lord11 and the word of the lord came to me saying 12 son of man take up a lamentation for the prince of tyre and say to him thus saith the lord god thou art a seal of resemblance and crown of beauty 13 thou wast in the delight of the paradise of god thou hast bound upon thee every precious stone the sardius and topaz and emerald and carbuncle and sapphire and jasper and silver and gold and ligure and agate and amethyst and chrysolite and beryl and onyx and thou hast filled thy treasures and thy stores in thee with gold 14 from the day that thou wast created thou wast with the cherub i set thee on the holy mount of god thou wast in the midst of the stones of fire 15 thou wast faultless in thy days from the day that thou wast created until iniquity was found in thee16 of the abundance of thy merchandise thou hast filled thy storehouses with iniquity and hast sinned therefore thou hast been cast down wounded from the mount of god and the cherub has brought thee out of the midst of the stones of fire 17 thy heart has been lifted up because of thy beauty thy knowledge has been corrupted with thy beauty because of the multitude of thy sins i have cast thee to the ground i have caused thee to be put to open shame before kings 18 because of the multitude of thy sins and the iniquities of thy merchandise i have profaned thy sacred things and i will bring fire out of the midst of thee this shall devour thee and i will make thee to be ashes upon thy land before all that see thee 19 and all that know thee among the nations shall groan over thee thou art gone to destruction and thou shalt not exist any more20 and the word of the lord came to me saying 21 son of man set thy face against sidon and prophesy against it 22 and say thus saith the lord behold i am against thee o sidon and i will be glorified in thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord when i have wrought judgments in thee and i will be sanctified in thee 23 blood and death shall be in thy streets and men wounded with swords shall fall in thee and on every side of thee and they shall know that i am the lord 24 and there shall no more be in the house of israel a thorn of bitterness and a pricking briar proceeding from them that are round about them who dishonoured them and they shall know that i am the lord25 thus saith the lord god i will also gather israel from the nations among whom they have been scattered and i will be sanctified among them and before the peoples and nations and they shall dwell upon their land which i gave to my servant jacob 26 yea they shall dwell upon it safely and they shall build houses and plant vineyards and dwell securely when i shall execute judgment on all that have dishonoured them even on those that are round about them and they shall know that i am the lord their god and the god of their fathers chapter 29291 in the twelfth year in the tenth month on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man set thy face against pharao king of egypt and prophesy against him and against the whole of egypt 3 and saythus saith the lord behold i am against pharao the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers that says the rivers are mine and i made them 4 and i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy river to stick to thy sides and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy river 5 and i will quickly cast down thee and all the fish of thy river thou shalt fall on the face of the plain and shalt by no means be gathered and shalt not be brought together i have given thee for food to the wild beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the sky 6 and all the dwellers in egypt shall know that i am the lord because thou hast been a staff of reed to the house of israel 7 when they took hold of thee with their hand thou didst break and when every hand was clapped against them and when they leaned on thee thou wast utterly broken and didst crush the loins of them all8 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring a sword upon thee and will cut off from thee man and beast 9 and the land of egypt shall be ruined and desert and they shall know that i am the lord because thou sayest the rivers are mine and i made them10 therefore behold i am against thee and against all thy rivers and i will give up the land of egypt to desolation and the sword and destruction from magdol and syene even to the borders of the ethiopians 11 no foot of man shall pass through it and no foot of beast shall pass through it and it shall not be inhabited for forty years12 and i will cause her land to be utterly destroyed in the midst of a land that is desolate and her cities shall be desolate forty years in the midst of cities that are desolate and i will disperse egypt among the nations and will utterly scatter them into the countries13 thus saith the lord after forty years i will gather the egyptians from the nations among whom they have been scattered 14 and i will turn the captivity of the egyptians and will cause them to dwell in the land of phathore in the land whence they were taken 15and it shall be a base kingdom beyond all other kingdoms it shall not any more be exalted over the nations and i will make them few in number that they may not be great among the nations 16 and they shall no more be to the house of israel a confidence bringing iniquity to remembrance when they follow after them and they shall know that i am the lord17 and it came to pass in the twentyseventh year on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying18 son of man nabuchodonosor king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyre every head was bald and every shoulder peeled yet there was no reward to him or to his army serving against tyre nor for the service wherewith they served against it19 thus saith the lord god behold i will give to nabuchodonosor king of babylon the land of egypt and he shall take the plunder thereof and seize the spoils thereof and it shall be a reward for his army 20 in return for his service wherewith he served against tyre i have given him the land of egypt thus saith the lord god21 in that day shall a horn spring forth for all the house of israel and i will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord chapter 30301 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord woe woe worth the day 3for the day of the lord is nigh a day of cloud it shall be the end of the nations4 and the sword shall come upon the egyptians and there shall be tumult in ethiopia and in egypt men shall fall down slain together and her foundations shall fall 5 persians and cretans and lydians and libyans and all the mixed multitude and they of the children of my covenant shall fall by the sword therein 6 and the supports of egypt shall fall and the pride of her strength shall come down from magdol to syene they shall fall by the sword in it saith the lord 7 and it shall be made desolate in the midst of desolate countries and their cities shall be desolate in the midst of desolate cities 8 and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall send fire upon egypt and when all that help her shall be broken 9 in that day shall messengers go forth hasting to destroy ethiopia utterly and there shall be tumult among them in the day of egypt for behold it comes10 thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the multitude of the egyptians by the hand of nabuchodonosor king of babylon 11 his hand and his people’s they are plagues sent forth from the nations to destroy the land and they all shall unsheath their swords against egypt and the land shall be filled with slain 12 and i will make their rivers desolate and will destroy the land and the fulness of it by the hands of strangers i the lord have spoken13 for thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the nobles from memphis and the princes of memphis out of the land of egypt and they shall be no more 14 and i will destroy the land of phathore and will send fire upon tanis and will execute vengeance on diospolis 15 and i will pour out my wrath upon sais the strength of egypt and will destroy the multitude of memphis 16 and i will send fire upon egypt and syene shall be sorely troubled and there shall be a breaking in diospolis and waters shall be poured out17 the youths of heliopolis and bubastum shall fall by the sword and the women shall go into captivity 18 and the day shall be darkened in taphnae when i have broken there the scepters of egypt and the pride of her strength shall perish there and a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall be taken prisoners 19 and i will execute judgment on egypt and they shall know that i am the lord20 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month on the seventh day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying 21 son of man i have broken the arms of pharao king of egypt and behold it has not been bound up to be healed to have a plaster put upon it or to be strengthened to lay hold of the sword 22 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharao king of egypt and i will break his strong and outstretched arms and will smite down his sword out of his hand 23 and i will disperse the egyptians among the nations and will utterly scatter them among the countries24 and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword into his hand and he shall bring it upon egypt and shall take her plunder and seize her spoils 25 yea i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and the arms of pharao shall fail and they shall know that i am the lord when i have put my sword into the hands of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out over the land of egypt 26 and i will disperse the egyptians among the nations and utterly scatter them among the countries and they all shall know that i am the lord chapter 31311 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month on the first day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man say to pharao king of egypt and to his multitudeto whom hast thou compared thyself in thy haughtiness 3 behold the assyrian was a cypress in libanus and was fair in shoots and high in stature his top reached to the midst of the clouds 4 the water nourished him the depth made him grow tall she led her rivers round about his plants and she sent forth her streams to all the trees of the field 5 therefore was his stature exalted above all the trees of the field and his branches spread far by the help of much water 6 all the birds of the sky made their nests in his boughs and under his branches all the wild beasts of the field bred the whole multitude of nations dwelt under his shadow 7 and he was fair in his height by reason of the multitude of his branches for his roots were amidst much water 8 and such cypresses as this were in the paradise of god and there were no pines like his shoots and there were no firs like his branches no tree in the paradise of god was like him in his beauty 9 because of the multitude of his branches and the trees of god’s paradise of delight envied him10 therefore thus saith the lord because thou art grown great and hast set thy top in the midst of the clouds and i saw when he was exalted 11 therefore i delivered him into the hands of the prince of the nations and he wrought his destruction 12 and ravaging strangers from the nations have destroyed him and have cast him down upon the mountains his branches fell in all the valleys and his boughs were broken in every field of the land and all the people of the nations are gone down from their shelter and have laid him low13 all the birds of the sky have settled on his fallen trunk and all the wild beasts of the field came upon his boughs 14 in order that none of the trees by the water should exalt themselves by reason of their size whereas they set their top in the midst of the clouds yet they continued not in their high state in their place all that drank water all were consigned to death to the depth of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit15 thus saith the lord god in the day wherein he went down to hades the deep mourned for him and i stayed her floods and restrained her abundance of water and libanus saddened for him all the trees of the field fainted for him 16 at the sound of his fall the nations quaked when i brought him down to hades with them that go down to the pit and all the trees of delight comforted him in the heart and the choice of plants of libanus all that drink water 17 for they went down to hell with him among the slain with the sword and his seed even they that dwelt under his shadow perished in the midst of their life18 to whom art thou compared descend and be thou debased with the trees of paradise to the depth of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword thus shall pharao be and the multitude of his host saith the lord god chapter 32321 and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the tenth month on the first day of the month that the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man take up a lamentation for pharao king of egypt and say to himthou art become like a lion of the nations and as a serpent that is in the sea and thou didst make assaults with thy rivers and didst disturb the water with thy feet and didst trample thy rivers3 thus saith the lord i will also cast over thee the nets of many nations and will bring thee up with my hook 4 and i will stretch thee upon the earth the fields shall be covered with thee and i will cause all the birds of the sky to settle upon thee and i will fill with thee all the wild beasts of the earth 5 and i will cast thy flesh upon the mountains and will saturate them with thy blood 6 and the land shall be drenched with thy dung because of thy multitude upon the mountains i will fill the valleys with thee 7 and i will veil the heavens when thou art extinguished and will darken the stars thereof i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light 8 all the bodies that give light in the sky shall be darkened over thee and i will bring darkness upon the earth saith the lord god9 and i will provoke to anger the heart of many people when i shall lead thee captive among the nations to a land which thou hast not known 10 and many nations shall mourn over thee and their kings shall be utterly amazed when my sword flies in their faces as they wait for their own fall from the day of thy fall11 for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee 12 with the swords of mighty men and i will cast down thy strength they are all destroying ones from the nations and they shall destroy the pride of egypt and all her strength shall be crushed 13 and i will destroy all her cattle from beside the great water and the foot of man shall not trouble it any more and the step of cattle shall no more trample it 14 thus shall their waters then be at rest and their rivers shall flow like oil saith the lord 15 when i shall give up egypt to destruction and the land shall be made desolate with the fullness thereof when i shall scatter all that dwell in it and they shall know that i am the lord 16 there is a lamentation and thou shalt utter it and the daughters of the nations shall utter it even for egypt and they shall mourn for it over all the strength thereof saith the lord god17 and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the first month on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the lord came to me saying18 son of man lament over the strength of egypt for the nations shall bring down her daughters dead to the depth of the earth to them that go down to the pit 19 20 they shall fall with him in the midst of them that are slain with the sword and all his strength shall perish the giants also shall say to thee 21 be thou in the depth of the pit to whom art thou superior yea go down and lie with the uncircumcised in the midst of them that are slain with the sword22 there are assur and all his company all his slain have been laid there 23 and their burial is in the depth of the pit and his company are set around about his tomb all the slain that fell by the sword who had caused the fear of them to be upon the land of the living24 there is ælam and all his host round about his tomb all the slain that fell by the sword and the uncircumcised that go down to the deep of the earth who caused their fear to be upon the land of the living and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit 25 in the midst of the slain26 there were laid mosoch and thobel and all his strength round about his tomb all his slain men all the uncircumcised slain with the sword who caused their fear to be in the land of the living 27 and they are laid with the giants that fell of old who went down to hades with their weapons of war and they laid their swords under their heads but their iniquities were upon their bones because they terrified all men during their life 28 and thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that have been slain by the sword29 there are laid the princes of assur who yielded their strength to a wound of the sword these are laid with the slain with them that go down to the pit30 there are the princes of the north even all the captains of assur who go down slain to hades they lie uncircumcised among the slain with the sword together with their terror and their strength and they have received their punishment with them that go down to the pit31 king pharao shall see them and shall be comforted over all their force saith the lord god 32 for i have caused his fear to be upon the land of the living yet he shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword even pharao and all his multitude with him saith the lord god chapter 33331 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man speak to the children of thy people and thou shalt say to themon whatsoever land i shall bring a sword and the people of the land take one man of them and set him for their watchman 3 and he shall see the sword coming upon the land and blow the trumpet and sound an alarm to the people 4 and he that hears the sound of the trumpet shall hear indeed and yet not take heed and the sword shall come upon him and overtake him his blood shall be upon his own head 5 because he heard the sound of the trumpet and took no heed his blood shall be upon him but the other because he took heed has delivered his soul6 but if the watchman see the sword coming and do not sound the trumpet and the people do not watch and the sword come and take a soul from among them that soul is taken because of its iniquity but the blood thereof will i require at the watchman’s hand7 and thou son of man i have set thee as a watchman to the house of israel and thou shalt hear a word from my mouth 8 when i say to the sinner thou shalt surely die if thou speak not to warn the wicked from his way the wicked himself shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand 9 but if thou forewarn the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in his ungodliness but thou hast delivered thine own soul10 and thou son of man say to the house of israel thus have ye spoken saying our errors and our iniquities weigh upon us and we pine away in them and how then shall we live 11 say to them thus saith the lord as i live i desire not the death of the ungodly as that the ungodly should turn from his way and live turn ye heartily from your way for why will ye die o house of israel12 say to the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day wherein he errs and the iniquity of the ungodly shall not harm him in the day wherein he turns from his iniquity but the righteous erring shall not be able to deliver himself13 when i say to the righteous thou shalt live and he trusts in his righteousness and shall commit iniquity none of his righteousnesses shall be remembered in his unrighteousness which he has wrought in it shall he die14 and when i say to the ungodly thou shalt surely die and he shall turn from his sin and do judgment and justice 15 and return the pledge and repay that which he has robbed and walk in the ordinances of life so as to do no wrong he shall surely live and shall not die 16 none of his sins which he has committed shall be remembered because he has wrought judgment and righteousness by them shall he live17 yet the children of thy people will say the way of the lord is not straight whereas this their way is not straight 18 when the righteous turns away from his righteousness and shall commit iniquities then shall he die in them 19 and when the sinner turns from his iniquity and shall do judgment and righteousness he shall live by them 20 and this is that which ye said the way of the lord is not straight i will judge you o house of israel every one for his ways21 and it came to pass in the tenth year of our captivity in the twelfth month on the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped from jerusalem came to me saying the city is taken 22 now the hand of the lord had come upon me in the evening before he came and he opened my mouth when he came to me in the morning and my mouth was open it was no longer kept closed23 and the word of the lord came to me saying 24 son of man they that inhabit the desolate places on the land of israel say abram was one and he possessed the land and we are more numerous to us the land is given for a possession25 26 27 therefore say to them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the desolate places shall fall by swords and they that are in the open plain shall be given for food to the wild beasts of the field and them that are in the fortified cities and them that are in the caves i will slay with pestilence 28 and i will make the land desert and the pride of her strength shall perish and the mountains of israel shall be made desolate by reason of no man passing through 29 and they shall know that i am the lord and i will make their land desert and it shall be made desolate because of all their abominations which they have wrought30 and as for thee son of man the children of thy people are they that speak concerning thee by the walls and in the porches of the houses and they talk one to another saying let us come together and let us hear the words that proceed from the lord 31 they approach thee as a people comes together and sit before thee and hear thy words but they will not do them for there is falsehood in their mouth and their heart goes after their pollutions 32 and thou art to them as a sound of a sweet welltuned psaltery and they will hear thy words but they will not do them 33 but whenever it shall come to pass they will say behold it is come and they shall know that there was a prophet in the midst of them chapter 34341 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say to the shepherdsthus saith the lord god o shepherds of israel do shepherds feed themselves do not the shepherds feed the sheep 3 behold ye feed on the milk and clothe yourselves with the wool and slay the fat but ye feed not my sheep 4 the weak one ye have not strengthened and the sick ye have not cherished and the bruised ye have not bound up and the stray one ye have not turned back and the lost ye have not sought and the strong ye have wearied with labour 5 and my sheep were scattered because there were no shepherds and they became meat to all the wild beasts of the field 6 and my sheep were scattered on every mountain and on every high hill yea they were scattered on the face of the earth and there was none to seek them out nor to bring them back7 therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord 8 as i live saith the lord god surely because my sheep became a prey and my sheep became meat to all the wild beasts of the field because there were no shepherds and the shepherds sought not out my sheep and the shepherds fed themselves but fed not my sheep 9 for this cause o shepherds 10 thus saith the lord god behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my sheep at their hands and will turn them back that they shall not feed my sheep and the shepherds shall no longer feed them and i will deliver my sheep out of their mouth and they shall no longer be meat for them11 for thus saith the lord god behold i will seek out my sheep and will visit them 12 as the shepherd seeks his flock in the day when there is darkness and cloud in the midst of the sheep that are separated so will i seek out my sheep and will bring them back from every place where they were scattered in the day of cloud and darkness 13 and i will bring them out from the gentiles and will gather them from the countries and will bring them into their own land and will feed them upon the mountains of israel and in the valleys and in every inhabited place of the land 14 i will feed them in a good pasture on a high mountain of israel and their folds shall be there and they shall lie down and there shall they rest in perfect prosperity and they shall feed in a fat pasture on the mountains of israel 15 i will feed my sheep and i will cause them to rest and they shall know that i am the lord thus saith the lord god 16 i will seek that which is lost and i will recover the stray one and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen the fainting and will guard the strong and will feed them with judgment17 and as for you ye sheep thus saith the lord god behold i will distinguish between sheep and sheep between rams and hegoats 18 and is it not enough for you that ye fed on the good pasture that ye trampled with your feet the remnant of your pasture and that ye drank the standing water that ye disturbed the residue with your feet 19 so my sheep fed on that which ye had trampled with your feet and they drank the water that had been disturbed by your feet20 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will separate between the strong sheep and the weak sheep 21 ye did thrust with your sides and shoulders and pushed with your horns and ye cruelly treated all the sick 22 therefore i will save my sheep and they shall not be any more for a prey and will judge between ram and ram23 and i will raise up one shepherd over them and he shall tend them even my servant david and he shall be their shepherd 24 and i the lord will be to them a god and david a prince in the midst of them i the lord have spoken it 25 and i will make with david a covenant of peace and i will utterly destroy evil beasts from off the land and they shall dwell in the wilderness and sleep in the forests 26 and i will settle them round about my mountain and i will give you the rain the rain of blessing 27 and the trees that are in the field shall yield their fruit and the earth shall yield her strength and they shall dwell in the confidence of peace on their land and they shall know that i am the lord when i have broken their yoke and i will deliver them out of the hand of those that enslaved them 28 and they shall no more be a spoil to the nations and the wild beasts of the land shall no more at all devour them and they shall dwell safely and there shall be none to make them afraid 29 and i will raise up for them a plant of peace and they shall no more perish with hunger upon the land and they shall no more bear the reproach of the nations30 and they shall know that i am the lord their god and they my people o house of israel saith the lord god 31 ye are my sheep even the sheep of my flock and i am the lord your god saith the lord god chapter 35351 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it 3 and say to itthus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o mount seir and i will stretch out my hand against thee and will make thee a waste and thou shalt be made desolate 4 and i will cause desolation in thy cities and thou shalt be desolate and thou shalt know that i am the lord 5 because thou hast been a perpetual enemy and hast laid wait craftily for the house of israel with the hand of enemies with a sword in the time of injustice at the last6 therefore as i live saith the lord god verily thou hast sinned even to blood therefore blood shall pursue thee 7 and i will make mount seir a waste and desolate and i will destroy from off it men and cattle 8 and i will fill thy hills and thy valleys with slain men and in all thy plains there shall fall in thee men slain with the sword 9 i will make thee a perpetual desolation and thy cities shall not be inhabited any more and thou shalt know that i am the lord10 because thou saidst the two nations and the two countries shall be mine and i shall inherit them whereas the lord is there 11therefore as i live saith the lord i will even deal with thee according to thine enmity and i will be made known to thee when i shall judge thee 12 and thou shalt know that i am the lord i have heard the voice of thy blasphemies whereas thou hast said the desert mountains of israel are given to us for food 13 and thou hast spoken swelling words against me with thy mouth i have heard them 14 thus saith the lord when all the earth is rejoicing i will make thee desert 15 thou shalt be desert o mount seir and all idumea and it shall be utterly consumed and thou shalt know that i am the lord their god chapter 36361 and thou son of man prophesy to the mountains of israel and say to the mountains of israel hear ye the word of the lord2 thus saith the lord god because the enemy has said against you aha the old waste places are become a possession for us 3therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because ye have been dishonoured and hated by those round about you that ye might be a possession to the remainder of the nations and ye became a byword and a reproach to the nations 4 therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord to the mountains and to the hills and to the streams and to the valleys and to the places that have been made desolate and destroyed and to the cities that have been deserted and have become a spoil and a trampling to the nations that were left round about 5 therefore thus saith the lord verily in the fire of my wrath have i spoken against the rest of the nations and against all idumea because they have appropriated my land to themselves for a possession with joy disregarding the lives of the inhabitants to destroy it by plunder 6 therefore prophesy concerning the land of israel and say to the mountains and to the hills and to the valleys and to the forests thus saith the lord behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath because ye have borne the reproaches of the heathen 7 therefore i will lift up my hand against the nations that are round about you they shall bear their reproach8 but your grapes and your fruits o mountains of israel shall my people eat for they are hoping to come 9 for behold i am toward you and i will have respect to you and ye shall be tilled and sown 10 and i will multiply men upon you even all the house of israel to the end and the cities shall be inhabited and the desolate land shall be built upon 11 and i will multiply men and cattle upon you and i will cause you to dwell as at the beginning and will treat you well as in your former times and ye shall know that i am the lord 12 and i will increase men upon you even my people israel and they shall inherit you and ye shall be to them for a possession and ye shall no more be bereaved of them13 thus saith the lord god because they said to thee thou land devourest men and hast been bereaved of thy nation 14 therefore thou shalt no more devour men and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation saith the lord god 15 and there shall no more be heard against you the reproach of the nations and ye shall no more bear the revilings of the peoples saith the lord god16 and the word of the lord came to me saying 17 son of man the house of israel dwelt upon their land and defiled it by their way and with their idols and with their uncleannesses and their way was before me like the uncleanness of a removed woman 18 so i poured out my wrath upon them 19 and i dispersed them among the nations and utterly scattered them through the countries i judged them according to their way and according to their sin 20 and they went in among the nations among which they went and they profaned my holy name while it was said of them these are the people of the lord and they came forth out of his land 21 but i spared them for the sake of my holy name which the house of israel profaned among the nations among whom they went22 therefore say to the house of israel thus saith the lord i do not this o house of israel for your sakes but because of my holy name which ye have profaned among the nations among whom ye went 23 and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the nations which ye profaned in the midst of them and the nations shall know that i am the lord when i am sanctified among you before their eyes24 and i will take you out from the nations and will gather you out of all the lands and will bring you into your own land 25 and i will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be purged from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols and i will cleanse you 26 and i will give you a new heart and will put a new spirit in you and i will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh and will give you a heart of flesh 27 and i will put my spirit in you and will cause you to walk in mine ordinances and to keep my judgments and do them 28 and ye shall dwell upon the land which i gave to your fathers and ye shall be to me a people and i will be to you a god 29 and i will save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call for the corn and multiply it and will not bring famine upon you 30 and i will multiply the fruit of the trees and the produce of the field that ye may not bear the reproach of famine among the nations31 and ye shall remember your evil ways and your practices that were not good and ye shall be hateful in your own sight for your transgressions and for your abominations 32 not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god as it is known to you be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways o house of israel33 thus saith the lord god in the day wherein i shall cleanse you from all your iniquities i will also cause the cities to be inhabited and the waste places shall be built upon 34 and the desolate land shall be cultivated whereas it was desolate in the eyes of every one that passed by 35 and they shall say that desolate land is become like a garden of delight and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are inhabited 36 and the nations as many as shall have been left round about you shall know that i the lord have built the ruined cities and planted the waste lands i the lord have spoken and will do it37 thus saith the lord god yet for this will i be sought by the house of israel to establish them i will multiply them even men as sheep 38 as holy sheep as the sheep of jerusalem in her feasts thus shall the desert cities be full of flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord chapter 37371 and the hand of the lord came upon me and the lord brought me forth by the spirit and set me in the midst of the plain and it was full of human bones 2 and he led me round about them every way and behold there were very many on the face of the plain very dry3 and he said to me son of man will these bones live and i said o lord god thou knowest this 4 and he said to me prophesy upon these bones and thou shalt say to them ye dry bones hear the word of the lord 5 thus saith the lord to these bones behold i will bring upon you the breath of life 6 and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and will spread skin upon you and will put my spirit into you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord7 so i prophesied as the lord commanded me and it came to pass while i was prophesying that behold there was a shaking and the bones approached each one to his joint 8 and i looked and behold sinews and flesh grew upon them and skin came upon them above but there was not breath in them 9 and he said to me prophesy to the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord come from the four winds and breathe upon these dead men and let them live 10 so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath entered into them and they lived and stood upon their feet a very great congregation11 and the lord spoke to me saying son of man these bones are the whole house of israel and they say our bones are become dry our hope has perished we are quite spent 12 therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will open your tombs and will bring you up out of your tombs and will bring you into the land of israel 13 and ye

land and ye shall know that i am the lord i have spoken and will do it saith the lord15 and the word of the lord came to me saying 16 son of man take for thyself a rod and write upon it juda and the children of israel his adherents and thou shalt take for thyself another rod and thou shalt inscribe it for joseph the rod of ephraim and all the children of israel that belong to him 17 and thou shalt joint them together for thyself so as that they should bind themselves into one stick and they shall be in thine hand18 and it shall come to pass when the children of thy people shall say to thee wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these things 19 then shalt thou say to them thus saith the lord behold i will take the tribe of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel that belong to him and i will add them to the tribe of juda and they shall become one rod in the hand of juda 20 and the rods on which thou didst write shall be in thine hand in their presence 21 and thou shalt say to them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the whole house of israel out of the midst of the nations among whom they have gone and i will gather them from all that are round about them and i will bring them into the land of israel 22 and i will make them a nation in my land even on the mountains of israel and they shall have one prince and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided any more at all into two kingdoms 23 that they may no more defile themselves with their idols and i will deliver them from all their transgressions whereby they have sinned and will cleanse them and they shall be to me a people and i the lord will be to them a god24 and my servant david shall be a prince in the midst of them there shall be one shepherd of them all for they shall walk in mine ordinances and keep my judgments and do them 25 and they shall dwell in their land which i have given to my servant jacob where their fathers dwelt and they shall dwell upon it and david my servant shall be their prince forever26 and i will make with them a covenant of peace it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and i will establish my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever 27 and my tabernacle shall be among them and i will be to them a god and they shall be my people 28and the nations shall know that i am the lord that sanctifies them when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for ever chapter 38381 and the word of the lord came to me saying 2 son of man set thy face against gog and the land of magog rhos prince of mesoch and thobel and prophesy against him 3 and say to him thus saith the lord godbehold i am against thee rhos prince of mesoch and thobel 4 and i will gather thee and all thine host horses and horsemen all wearing

evil devices 11 and thou shalt say i will go up to the rejected land i will come upon them that are at ease in tranquility and dwelling in peace all inhabiting a land in which there is no wall nor bars nor have they doors 12 to seize plunder and to take their spoil to turn my hands against the desolate land that is now inhabited and against a nation that is gathered from many nations that have acquired property dwelling in the midst of the land 13 sabba and daedan and carthaginian merchants and all their villages shall say to thee thou art come for plunder to take a prey and to get spoils

people israel are dwelling securely 15 and come out of thy place from the farthest north and many nations with thee all of them mounted on horses a great gathering and a large force 16 and thou shalt come up upon my people israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall come to pass in the last days that i will bring thee up upon my land that all the nations may know me when i am sanctified in thee before them17 thus saith the lord god to gog thou art he concerning whom i spoke in former times by the hand of my servants the prophets of israel in those days and years that i would bring thee up against them 18 and it shall come to pass in that day in the day when gog shall come against the land of israel saith the lord god 19 that my wrath and my jealousy shall arise i have spoken in the fire of mine anger verily in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel 20 and the fish of the sea shall quake at the presence of the lord and the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the field and all the reptiles that creep upon the earth and all the men that are on the face of the earth and the mountains shall be rent and the valleys shall fall and every wall on the land shall fall 21 and i will summon against it even every fear saith the lord the sword of every man shall be against his brother 22 and i will judge him with pestilence and blood and sweeping rain and hailstones and i will rain upon him fire and brimstone and upon all that are with him and upon many nations with him23 and i will be magnified and sanctified and glorified and i will be known in the presence of many nations and they shall know that i am the lord chapter 39391 and thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus saith the lord behold i am against thee o gog rhos prince of mesoch and thobel 2 and i will assemble thee and guide thee and raise thee up on the extremity of the north and i will bring thee up upon the mountains of israel 3 and i will destroy the bow out of thy left hand and thine arrows out of thy right hand and i will cast thee down on the mountains of israel 4 and thou and all that belong to thee shall fall and the nations that are with thee shall be given to multitudes of birds even to every fowl and i have given thee to all the wild beasts of the field to be devoured 5 thou shalt fall on the face of the field for i have spoken it saith the lord6 and i will send a fire upon gog and the islands shall be securely inhabited and they shall know that i am the lord 7 and my holy name shall be known in the midst of my people israel and my holy name shall no more be profaned and the nations shall know that i am the lord the holy one in israel 8 behold it is come and thou shalt know that it shall be saith the lord god this is the day concerning which i have spoken9 and they that inhabit the cities of israel shall come forth and make a fire with the arms the shields and the spears and bows and arrows and handstaves and lances and they shall keep fire burning with them for seven years 10 and they shall not take any wood out of the field neither shall they cut any out of the forests but they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall plunder those that plundered them and spoil those that spoiled them saith the lord11 and it shall come to pass that in that day i will give to gog a place of renown a tomb in israel the burialplace of them that approach the sea and they shall build round about the outlet of the valley and there they shall bury gog and all his multitude and the place shall then be called the burialplace of gog 12 and the house of israel shall bury them that the land may be cleansed in the space of seven months 13 yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a place of renown in the day wherein it was glorified saith the lord 14 and they shall appoint men continually to go over the land to bury them that have been left on the face of the earth to cleanse it after the space of seven months and they shall seek them out 15 and every one that goes through the land and sees a man’s bone shall set up a mark by it until the buriers shall have buried it in the valley the burial place of gog 16 for the name of the city shall be burialplace so shall the land be cleansed17 and thou son of man say thus saith the lord say to every winged bird and to all the wild beasts of the field gather yourselves and come gather yourselves from all places round about to my sacrifice which i have made for you even a great sacrifice on the mountains of israel and ye shall eat flesh and drink blood 18 ye shall eat the flesh of mighty men and ye shall drink the blood of princes of the earth rams and calves and goats and they are all fatted calves 19 and ye shall eat fat till ye are full and shall drink wine till ye are drunken of my sacrifice which i have prepared for you 20 and ye shall be filled at my table eating horse and rider and mighty man and every warrior saith the lord21 and i will set my glory among you and all the nations shall see my judgment which i have wrought and my hand which i have brought upon them 22 and the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god from this day and onwards23 and all the nations shall know that the house of israel were led captive because of their sins because they rebelled against me and i turned away my face from them and delivered them into the hands of their enemies and they all fell by the sword 24 according to their uncleannesses and according to their transgressions did i deal with them and i turned away my face from them25 therefore thus saith the lord god now will i turn back captivity in jacob and will have mercy on the house of israel and will be jealous for the sake of my holy name 26 and they shall bear their reproach and the iniquity which they committed when they dwelt upon their land in peace yet there shall be none to terrify them 27 when i have brought them back from the nations and gathered them out of the countries of the nations and i will be sanctified among them in the presence of the nations 28 and they shall know that i am the lord their god when i have been manifested to them among the nations 29 and i will no more turn away my face from them because i have poured out my wrath upon the house of israel saith the lord god chapter 40401 and it came to pass in the

gate looking eastward 5 and the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the house of the lord was full of glory 6 and i stood and behold there was a voice out of the house of one speaking to me and a man stood near me 7 and he said to meson of man thou hast seen the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet in which my name shall dwell in the midst of the house of israel for ever and the house of israel shall no more profane my holy name they and their princes by their fornication or by the murders of their princes in the midst of them 8 when they set my doorway by their doorway and my thresholds near to their thresholds and they made my wall as it were joining myself and them and they profaned my holy name with their iniquities which they wrought and i destroyed them in my wrath and with slaughter 9 and now let them put away from me their fornication and the murders of their princes and i will dwell in the midst of them forever10 and thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that they may cease from their sins and shew its aspect and the arrangement of it 11 and they shall bear their punishment for all the things that they have done and thou shalt describe the house and its entrances and the plan thereof and all its ordinances and thou shalt make known to them all the regulations of it and describe them before them and they shall keep all my commandments and all my ordinances and do them12 and thou shalt shew the plan of the house on the top of the mountain all its limits round about shall be most holy13 and these are

carried round about it of half a cubit and the rim of it shall be a cubit round about and the steps thereof looking eastward18 and he said to me son of man thus saith the lord god of israel these are the ordinances of the altar in the day of its being made to offer upon it wholeburntofferings and to pour blood upon it 19 and thou shalt appoint to the priests the levites of the seed of sadduc that draw nigh to me saith the lord god to minister to me a calf of the herd for a sinoffering 20 and they shall take of its blood and shall put it on the four horns of the altar and upon the four corners of the propitiatory and upon the base round about and they shall make atonement for it 21 and they shall take the calf of the sinoffering and it shall be consumed by fire in the separate place of the house outside the sanctuary 22 and on the second day they shall take two kids of the goats without blemish for a sinoffering and they shall make atonement for the altar as they made atonement with the calf 23 and after they have finished the atonement they shall bring an unblemished calf of the herd and an unblemished ram of the flock 24 and ye shall offer them before the lord and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them and shall offer them up as wholeburntofferings to the lord25 seven days shalt thou offer a kid daily for a sinoffering and a calf of the herd and a ram out of the flock they shall sacrifice them unblemished for seven days 26 and they shall make atonement for the altar and shall purge it and they shall consecrate themselves27 and it shall come to pass from the eighth day and onward that the priests shall offer your wholeburntofferings on the altar and your peaceofferings and i will accept you saith the lord chapter 44441 then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary that looks eastward and it was shut 2 and the lord said to me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no one shall pass through it for the lord god of israel shall enter by it and it shall be shut 3 for the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate and shall go forth by the way of the same4 and he brought me in by the way of the gate that looks northward in front of the house and i looked and behold the house was full of the glory of the lord and i fell upon my face 5 and the lord said to me son of man attend with thine heart and see with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say to thee according to all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the regulations thereof and thou shalt attend well to the entrance of the house according to all its outlets in all the holy things 6 and thou shalt say to the provoking house even to the house of israel thus saith the lord god let it suffice you to have committed all your iniquities o house of israel 7 that ye have brought in aliens uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary and to profane it when ye offered bread flesh and blood and ye transgressed my covenant by all your iniquities 8 and ye appointed others to keep the charges in my sanctuary9 therefore thus saith the lord god no alien uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of all the children of strangers that are in the midst of the house of israel10 but as for the levites who departed far from me when israel went astray from me after their imaginations they shall even bear their iniquity 11 yet they shall minister in my sanctuary being porters at the gates of the house and serving the house they shall slay the victims and the wholeburntofferings for the people and they shall stand before the people to minister to them 12 because they ministered to them before their idols and it became to the house of israel a punishment of iniquity therefore have i lifted up my hand against them saith the lord god 13 and they shall not draw nigh to me to minister to me in the priests’ office nor to approach the holy things of the children of israel nor to approach my holy of holies but they shall bear their reproach for the error wherein they erred 14 they shall bring them to keep the charges of the house for all the service of it and for all that they shall do15 the priests the levites the sons of sadduc who kept the charges of my sanctuary when the house of israel went astray from me these shall draw night to me to minister to me and shall stand before my face to offer sacrifice to me the fat and the blood saith the lord god 16 these shall enter into my sanctuary and these shall approach my table to minister to me and they shall keep my charges17 and it shall come to pass when they enter the gates of the inner court that they shall put on linen robes and they shall not put on woollen garments when they minister at the gate of the inner court 18 and they shall have linen mitres upon their heads and shall have linen drawers upon their loins and they shall not tightly

and these shall attend at a judgment of blood to decide it they shall rightly observe my ordinances and judge my judgments and keep my statutes and my commandments in all my feasts and they shall hallow my sabbaths25 and they shall not go in to the dead body of a man to defile themselves only a priest may defile himself for a father or for a mother or for a son or for a daughter or for a brother or for his sister who has not been married 26 and after he has been cleansed let him number to himself seven days 27 and on whatsoever day they shall enter into the inner court to minister in the holy place they shall bring a propitiation saith the lord god28 and it shall be to them for an inheritance i am their inheritance and no possession shall be given them among the children of israel for i am their possession 29 and these shall eat the meatofferings and the sinofferings and the trespassofferings and every special offering in israel shall be theirs 30 and the firstfruits of all things and the firstborn of all animals and all offerings of all your firstfruits there shall be a share for the priests and ye shall give your earliest produce to the priest to bring your blessings upon your houses 31 and the priests shall eat no bird or beast that dies of itself or is taken of wild beasts chapter 45451 and when ye measure the land for inheritance ye shall set apart firstfruits

the princes of israel shall no more oppress my people but the house of israel shall inherit the land according to their tribes9 thus saith the lord god let it suffice you ye princes of israel remove injustice and misery execute judgment and justice take away oppression from my people saith the lord god 10 ye shall have a just balance and a just measure and a just choenix for measure 11 and in like manner there shall be one choenix as a measure of capacity the tenth of the gomor shall be the choenix and the tenth of the gomor shall be in fair proportion to the gomor 12 and the weights shall be twenty oboli your pound shall be five shekels fifteen shekels and fifty shekels13 and these are the firstfruits which ye shall offer a sixth part of a gomor of wheat and the sixth part of it shall consist of an ephah of a core of barley 14 and ye shall give as the appointed measure of oil one bath of oil out of ten baths for ten baths are a gomor 15and one sheep from the flock out of ten as an oblation from all the tribes of israel for sacrifices and for wholeburntofferings and for peaceofferings to make atonement for you saith the lord god 16 and all the people shall give these firstfruits to the prince of israel17 and through the prince shall be offered the wholeburntofferings and the meatofferings and the drinkofferings in the feasts and at the new moons and on the sabbaths and in all the feasts of the house of israel he shall offer the sinofferings and the meatoffering and the wholeburntofferings and the peaceofferings to make atonement for the house of israel18 thus saith the lord god in the first month on the first day of the month ye shall take a calf without blemish out of the herd to make atonement for the holy place 19 and the priest shall take of the blood of the atonement and put it on the thresholds of the house and upon the four corners of the temple and upon the altar and upon the thresholds of the gate of the inner court 20 and thus shalt thou do in the seventh month on the first day of the month thou shalt take a rate from each one and ye shall make atonement for the house21 and in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month ye shall have the feast of the passover seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread 22 and the prince shall offer in that day a calf for a sinoffering for himself and the house and for all the people of the land 23 and for the seven days of the feast he shall offer as wholeburntofferings to the lord seven calves and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days and a kid of the goats daily for a sinoffering and a meatoffering 24 and thou shalt prepare a cake for the calf and cakes for the ram and a hin of oil for the cake 25 and in the seventh month on the fifteenth day of the month thou shalt sacrifice in the feast in the same way seven days as they sacrificed the sinofferings and the wholeburntofferings and the freewilloffering and the oil chapter 46461 thus saith the lord god the gate that is in the inner court that looks eastward shall be shut the six working days but let it be opened on the sabbathday and it shall be opened on the day of the new moon 2 and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the inner gate and shall stand at the entrance of the gate and the priests shall prepare his wholeburntofferings and his peaceofferings and he shall worship at the entrance of the gate then shall he come forth but the gate shall not be shut till evening 3 and the people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate both on the sabbaths and at the new moons before the lord4 and the prince shall offer wholeburntofferings to the lord on the sabbathday six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish 5 and a freewilloffering a meatoffering for the ram and a meatoffering for the lambs the gift of his hand and a hin of oil for the meatoffering 6 and on the day of the new moon a calf without blemish and six lambs and there shall be a ram without blemish 7 and a meatoffering for the ram and there shall be a meatoffering for the calf as a freewilloffering and for the lambs according as his hand can furnish and there shall be a hin of oil for the cake8 and when the prince goes in he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate and he shall go forth by the way of the gate 9 and whenever the people of the land shall go in before the lord at the feasts he that goes in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate and he that goes in by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate he shall not return by the gate by which he entered but he shall go forth opposite it 10 and the prince shall enter with them in the midst of them when they go in and when they go forth he shall go forth11 and in the feasts and in the general assemblies the freewill oblation shall be a meatoffering for the calf and a meatoffering for the ram and for the lambs as his hand can furnish and a hin of oil for the meatoffering 12 and if the prince should prepare as a thanksgiving a wholeburntpeaceoffering to the lord and should open for himself the gate looking eastward and offer his wholeburntoffering and his peaceofferings as he does on the sabbathday then shall he go out and shall shut the doors after he has gone out13 and he shall prepare daily as a wholeburntoffering to the lord a lamb of a year old without blemish in the morning shall he prepare it 14 and he shall prepare a freewilloffering for it in the morning the sixth part of a measure of flour and a third part of a hin of oil to mix therewith the fine flour as a freewilloffering to the lord a perpetual ordinance 15 ye shall prepare the lamb and the freewilloffering and the oil in the morning for a perpetual wholeburntsacrifice16 thus saith the lord god if the prince shall give a gift to one of his sons out of his inheritance this shall be to his sons a possession as an inheritance 17 but if he give a gift to one of his servants then it shall belong to him until the year of release and then he shall restore it to the prince but of the inheritance of his sons the possession shall continue to them 18 and the prince shall by no means take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them he shall give an inheritance to his sons out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every one from his possession19 and he brought me into the entrance of the place behind the gate into the chamber of the sanctuary belonging to the priests that looks toward the north and behold there was a place set apart 20 and he said to me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespassofferings and the sinofferings and there shall they bake the meatoffering always so as not to carry them out into the outer court to sanctify the people21 and he brought me into the outer court and led me round upon the four sides of the court and behold there was a court on each of the sides of the court 22 on every side a court even a court for all the four sides and each little court belonging to the court was in length forty cubits and in breadth thirty cubits there was one measure to the four 23 and there were chambers in them round about round about the four and cookingplaces formed under the chambers round about 24 and he said to me these are the cooks’ houses where they that serve the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people chapter 47471 and he brought me to the entrance of the house and behold water issued from under the porch eastward for the front of the house looked eastward and the water came down from the right side from the south to the altar 2 and he brought me out by the way of the northern gate and he led me round by the way outside to the gate of the court that looks eastward and behold water came down from the right side 3 in the direction in which a man went forth opposite and there was a measuring line in his hand and he measured a thousand cubits with the measure 4 and he passed through the water it was water of a fountain and again he measured a thousand and passed through the water and the water was up to the thighs and again he measured a thousand and he passed through water up to the loins 5 and again he measured a thousand and he could not pass through for the water rose as of a torrent which men cannot pass over6 and he said to me hast thou seen this son of man then he brought me and led me back to the brink of the river 7 as i returned and behold on the brink of the river there were very many trees on this side and on that side 8 and he said to me this is the water that goes forth to galilee that lies eastward and it is gone down to arabia and has reached as far as to the sea to the outlet of the water and it shall heal the waters 9 and it shall come to pass that every animal of living and moving creatures all on which the river shall come shall live and there shall be there very many fish for this water shall go thither and it shall heal them and they shall live everything on which the river shall come shall live10 and fishers shall stand there from ingadin to enagallim it shall be a place to spread out nets upon it shall be distinct and the fishes thereof shall be as the fishes of the great sea a very great multitude 11 but at the outlet of the water and the turn of it and where it overflows its banks they shall not heal at all they are given to salt 12 and every fruit tree shall grow by the river even on the bank of it on this side and on that side they shall not decay upon it neither shall their fruit fail they shall bring forth the firstfruit of their early crop for these their waters come forth of the sanctuary and their fruit shall be for meat and their foliage for health13 thus saith the lord god ye shall inherit these borders of the land they are given by lot to the twelve tribes of the children of israel 14 and ye shall inherit it each according to his brother’s portion even the land concerning which i lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers and this land shall fall to you by lot15 and these are the borders of the land that lies northward from the great sea that comes
