december when i was on the tour the shop was closed because it was a sunday but they had regular old jd black label for sale in there maybe a special exemption was made for the distillery itself13hate

bottle that was gallon it was really full of jd though we drank it ive also seen gallon bottles of vodka they have little pumps on the top i havent seen them for years though i would assume that they dont sell full barrels to bars because of inventory control and taxes its one thing to have a 50 keg of beer on tap for anyone that wants the mark up on tap beer is insane and a 9k barrel of whiskey15the fez man apr 1 2009hate  discontent yo homie is that my briefcase joined aug 22 2005messages 15737likes received 1317when they sell the barrel you dont get the whiskey in the barrel  its
