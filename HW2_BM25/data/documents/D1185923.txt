shttpwwwgoldenrayorkiescom pat · 10 years ago0 0 comment there are alot of different factors to consider when buying a food whats your budget how close are you to a pet specialty shop are you comfortable buying food online my personal opinion is that by your dog being so small its much more affordable to buy a high quality food in the end you get more than your moneys worth in regards to skincoat stool hipsjoints breath etc by buying a good quality food you pretty much have to shop at pet specialty stores or online regardless of what you see on tv or in sales ads walmart and other grocery stores do not have high quality food i have a 16lb pug and have tried her on several different foods bil jac pro plan nutro solid gold wellness natural balance natures recipe and science diet out of the bunch i didnt care for the results i got from science diet her stool was huge and she started shedding really bad now i wouldnt recommend changing foods alot of times i had to because my dog has food allergies currently my dog is on canidae chickenrice and shes doing great donna · 2 years ago0 0 commentdry food is generally preferable to wet food because it keeps their teeth in better condition and tooth decay can eventually lead to heart disease any high quality dry dog food should work out well small size pieces usually marketed as small bites will probably prove helpful as well there are a variety of highly recommended foods by vets on the market such as science diet and others if you tour the pet store there are even foods for different types of dogs usually specially blended to help with various health conditions in this case you could get the toy food hope this helps help please · 10 years ago1 0 comment those food are some of the worst dog foods when looking for
