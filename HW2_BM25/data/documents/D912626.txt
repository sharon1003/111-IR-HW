dermatology times dermatology cost of care the tale of the 220 tube of clobetasol cream august 05 2015 by norman levine m d a patient with a minimally steroidresponsive dermatosis vitiligo recently contacted me to complain that he could no longer afford the medication that i had prescribed for him i was puzzled when he informed me that a 60gram tube of clobetasol cream would now cost him 220 an amount that was far beyond his budget the medication was no longer on his insurance plan’s formulary presumably because it had become too expensive for them as well at first i was highly doubtful and assumed that the dispensing pharmacy had mistakenly substituted a namebrand product for the generic version i had prescribed a quick survey of several local pharmacies confirmed that all were pricing clobetasol above 200 in this particular instance i reluctantly substituted fluocinonide cream for the clobetasol knowing that it was unlikely that he would repigment while on this therapy to make matters worse this new medication was now being sold for about 5000 for a 60gram tube when 6 months prior was one of the 400 specials at several chain drugstores read step therapy stalls appropriate patient treatment this new economic reality strikes at the heart of the service we dermatologists provide for our patients if we can no longer use medications that work best we may revert to secondrate status medically and only marginally improve the lives of the people we treat in a conversation with a recently trained colleague he indicated that some of his fellow residents intend on not writing any prescriptions but instead will provide only surgical and cosmetic care the rationale for this decision is that it is simply too big of a hassle to fight with third party payers who are reluctant to allow expensive medications to be used by their insured customers if this approach to practice becomes widespread our specialty will be reduced to a mere shadow of its former self if dermatologists decide against treating skin conditions with effective prescription medications who will be capable of treating complicated conditions how did we get to this state of affairs individuals with far more knowledge than me have given several explanations including high costs of developing new drugs problems with manufacturing and the lack of profit in producing generic drugs as reasons for cost inflation without any particular expertise but with an advanced case of paranoia i think it is most likely that big pharma has bought out the smaller manufacturers of generics and has eliminated the competition that has kept pharmaceutical prices affordable in addition the affordable care act has mandated that medicare cannot negotiate lower prices for the medications that they provide therefore drug manufacturers are free to increase prices to astronomical levels without any controls whatsoever this is probably what the 1880’s felt like when the robber barons were at the peak of their powers next sanitysaving strategies1 2
