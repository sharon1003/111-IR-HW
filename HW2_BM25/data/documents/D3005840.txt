dont recommend going cold turkey you need to wean yourself off just like you would anything youve become dependent on if you typically drink multiple servings of soda a day sacks suggests first cutting back to one a day give that two weeks then switch to three sodas a week it gives you a chance to adjust gradually which should lead to real sustainable change says sacks mix it with water sandon also recommends weaning yourself slowly off soda and sometimes suggests that her clients start drinking halfsoda halfwater youre automatically drinking less and hydrating and filling up with

some lemon mint or a small amount of sugar or artificial sweetener—at least during your transitionfromsoda phase the important thing is that youre aware of and in charge of exactly whats going into your drink and how much is added drink a glass of water first whenever the urge to drink a soda hits fill up a big glass of ice water and finish that first a lot of times people drink soda just because theyre bored or theyre thirsty and thats whats available or thats what theyre used to says sacks if youre still craving a soda after youve downed your h2o then you can reconsider whether its really worth it—but chances are your thirst will be quenched and youll feel satisfied from just the water you can make this work while youre out and about too by always carrying a bottle of water with you treat yourself to natural brands when sacks has successfully weaned her clients down to just a few sodas a week she often recommends they switch to a brand with fewer artificial ingredients theyre more expensive but youll be drinking them less often she says sacks likes grown up soda santa cruz organics and blue sky because they dont contain highfructose corn syrup or artificial ingredients and generally contain less sugar than the big brands theyre an overall healthier choice especially if youre only drinking them occasionally give seltzer a try if its carbonation you crave try drinking

hunting for a cold soda frozen berries and fresh mint can also be tasty additions to a cold glass of h2o buy caffeinefree if you drink a lot of soda and youre not quite ready to give it up try buying caffeinefree versions instead you may start drinking less without even realizing it suggests a 2015 study published in the british journal of nutrition in the study participants were split into two groups and all told to drink as much soda as theyd like for the next 28 days one group got regular one group got caffeinefree even though there was no noticeable taste difference between the two the caffeinated group drank 53 more over the next month—about 5 ounces a day when our bodies get used to regular caffeine we crave more of it say the study authors prompting us to drink more related 12 surprising sources of caffeine steer clear of soda triggers you may notice that you only drink soda in certain places or situations in the afternoon at the office for example or when you eat at a certain restaurant you may not be able to completely avoid these scenarios—youve still got to go to work and should still enjoy eating out—but you may be able to change those bad habits if its the office vending machine that tempts you to buy a soda every day try to stay away from it in the afternoon—and pack your own healthy beverage or a refillable water bottle so you have an alternative or if you tend to crave soda with a certain type of food try restaurants that offer other options instead try it for two weeks weaning yourself off something gradually works best for most people says
