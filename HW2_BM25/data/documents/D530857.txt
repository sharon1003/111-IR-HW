daughter of clara née provost and robert geisman she had a brother henry who was two years older she said she had been raised as a roman catholic  citation needed but a discrepancy exists relating to her early life and her studio biography was often the source of the confusion her paternal grandparents harry geisman and anna hafner were immigrants from germany 3 although allyson claimed her last name was originally van geisman and was of dutch origin 4 studio biographies listed her as jan allyson born to frenchenglish parents upon her death her daughter said allyson was born eleanor geisman

living with her maternal grandparents 6 to make ends meet her mother worked as a telephone operator and restaurant cashier when she had enough funds she would occasionally reunite with her daughter

7 allyson sustained a fractured skull and broken back and her dog was killed her doctors said she would never walk again and confined her to a heavy steel brace from neck to hips for four years and she ultimately regained her health but when allyson had become famous she was terrified that people would discover her background from the tenement side of new york city and she readily agreed to studio tales of a rosy life including a concocted story that she underwent months of swimming exercises in rehabilitation to emerge as a star swimmer 6 in her later memoirs allyson does describe a summer program of swimming that did help her recovery 8after gradually progressing from a wheelchair to crutches to braces allysons true escape from her impoverished life was to go to the cinema where she was enraptured by ginger rogers and fred astaire movies 6 as a teen allyson memorized the trademark ginger rogers dance routines she claimed later to have watched the gay divorcee 17 times 9 she also tried to emulate the singing styles of movie stars although she never mastered reading music 10 when her mother remarried and the family was reunited with a more stable financial standing allyson was enrolled in the ned wayburn dancing academy and began to enter dance competitions with the stage name of elaine peters 11 with the death of her stepfather and a bleak future ahead she left high

1938 14 the legend is that the choreographer gave her a job and a new name allyson a family name and june for the month 7 although like many aspects of her career resume the story is highly unlikely as she was already dubbing herself june allyson prior to her broadway engagement and has even attributed the name to a later director n 2 allyson subsequently appeared in the chorus in the jerome kern  oscar hammerstein ii musical very warm for may 1939 12the handprints of june allyson in front of the great movie ride at walt disney world s disneys hollywood studios theme park when vitaphone discontinued new york production in 1940 allyson returned to the new york stage to take on more chorus roles in rodgers and hart s higher and higher 1940 and cole porter s panama hattie 1940 her dancing and musical talent led to a stint as an understudy for the lead betty hutton and when hutton contracted measles allyson appeared in five performances of panama hattie 12 broadway director george abbott caught one of the nights and offered allyson one of the lead roles in his production of best foot forward 1941 15after her appearance in the broadway musical allyson was selected for the

good reviews as a sidekick to best foot forward s star lucille ball but was still relegated to the drop list 17 mgms musical supervisor arthur freed saw her test sent up by an agent and insisted that allyson be put on contract immediately 18 another musical thousands cheer 1943 was again a showcase for her singing and dancing albeit still in a minor role 19 as a new starlet although allyson had already been a performer on stage and screen she was presented as an overnight sensation with hollywood press agents attempting to portray her as an ingenue selectively slicing years off her true age studio bios listed her variously as being born in 1922 and 1923 6allysons breakthrough was in two girls and a sailor 1944 where the studio image of the girl next door 20 was fostered by her being cast alongside longtime acting chum van johnson the quintessential boy next door 21 as the sweetheart team johnson and allyson were to appear together in four later films 22allysons early success as a musical star led to several other postwar musicals including two sisters from boston 1946 and good news 1947 15 her “ thou swell ” was a high point of the rodgers and hart biopic words and music 1948 as performed in the “ a connecticut yankee ” segment with the blackburn twins allyson also played straight roles such as constance in the three musketeers 1948 the tomboy jo march in little women 1949

efforts were dismissed by the entertainment reviewer in the la examiner as reaching down to the level of mag fiction 24 however tv guide and other fan magazines such as tv considered allysons foray into television as revitalizing her fame and career for a younger audience and remarked that her stereotyping by the movie industry as the girl next door was the waste and neglect of talent on its own doorstep 25personal life  editmarriages and children  editcirca 1953on her arrival in hollywood studio heads attempted to enhance the pairing of van johnson and allyson by sending out the two contracted players on a series of official dates which were highly publicized and led to a public perception that a romance had been kindled 26 although dating david rose peter lawford and john kennedy allyson was actually being courted by dick powell who was 13 years her senior and had been previously married to mildred maund and joan blondell 27on august 19 1945 allyson caused mgm studio

generally complimentary reviews due to its insider look at hollywood in one of its golden ages a more critical appraisal came from janet maslin at the new york times in her review hollywood leaves its imprint on its chroniclers who noted miss allyson presents herself as the same sunny tomboyish figure she played on screen in hollywood like someone who has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen 7 privately allyson admitted that her earlier screen portrayals had left her uneasy about the typecast good wife roles she had played 37as a personal friend of ronald and nancy reagan she was invited to many white house dinners and in 1988 reagan appointed her to the federal council on aging allyson and her later husband david ashrow actively supported fundraising efforts

picture stars references  editexplanatory notes during her lifetime allyson published an autobiography that has led to much of the confusion as her recollections did not correspond to the actual record starting with her birthdate and her family background mgm was partly to blame as the studio pr machine created a goody twoshoes image of a young ingenue which required some imaginative tailoring of her age family circumstances and even her famous tree limb story the name june allyson has been attributed to three different sources and june herself had a different memory of from where it came but the use of a nickname and stage name had already begun in her teen years on the larry king interview her recollection was that broadway producer george abbott had given her the name while other sources have her first stage choreographer calling her that in exasperation as he could not be bothered to remember her real one at least that was the tale in her book probably it made sense to her as she liked allison her brothers name and simply tacked june onto it and was reportedly using it before her broadway debut citations a b c kimberlyclark corporation honors june allyson and her
