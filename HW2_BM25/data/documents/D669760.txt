live science planet earth reference facts about tin by stephanie pappas live science contributor  july 27 2015 0830pm etmorea tin can used to store food most cans used for this purpose are now tinplated steel credit sergio stakhnyk  shutterstock tin is an element perhaps best known for its use in tin cans — which these days are almost always actually aluminum even the original tin cans first introduced in the 1800s were mostly steel plated with tin so tin may be unassuming but its not unimportant this metal is used to prevent corrosion and to produce glass its most often found mixed or alloyed with other metals pewter for example is mostly tin sources of tin tin is relatively rare making up only about 2 parts per million of the earths crust according to the u s geologic survey tin is extracted from various ores chiefly from cassiterite sn o 2  the metal is produced from reducing the oxide ore with coal in a furnace very little tin has been found in the united states much of it in alaska and california according to los alamos national laboratory the metal is mainly produced in malaya bolivia indonesia zaire thailand and nigeria uses of tin perhaps the most important use of tin historically has been to make bronze — an alloy of copper and tin or other metals — that changed civilization by ushering in the bronze age people began making or trading for bronze tools and weapons at different times depending on geography but the bronze age is commonly accepted to have started around 3300 b c in the near east just the facts according to the jefferson national linear

shutterstock an old metal tins use in bronze stretches back some 5000 years it has also appeared occasionally in the archaeological record on its own for example researchers excavating at the jewish temple in jerusalem in 2011 discovered a buttonsized piece of tin stamped with the aramaic words for pure for god this seal may have been used to mark ceremonially pure objects for rituals according to a report in the haaretz newspaper  beyond bronze tins greatest contribution to humankind was probably the humble tin can the can had its origins in the perennial problem of how to feed an onthemove army according to the can manufacturers institute yes even cans have a trade organization napoleon bonaparte offered a reward in 1795 to anyone who could come up with a way to preserve food for military use in 1810 french chef nicolas appert won the 12000franc prize by inventing canning — the process of sealing food or drink in a jar or bottle with the use of boiling water this discovery cleared the way for the invention of the tin can only a year later in 1810 british merchant peter durand got a patent for using tinplated steel to can food tin resists corrosion making it an ideal covering for relatively cheap steel the tin can arrived on american shores in 1818 and thomas kensett  co a manufacturing company patented the tin can in america in 1825 the civil war prompted the increased popularity of the tin can as generals once again searched for a way to feed their soldiers tins heyday ended in the mid20 th century however when coors brewery introduced the first aluminum can cheaper lighter and recyclable aluminum rapidly overtook tin and steel but tin still has its uses tin plus the element niobium makes a superconductive metal used for wire a tinlead alloy is used to make solder copper and other metals are mixed with tin to make pewter which was once a common metal for tableware and window glass gets its silky smooth surface from a mold of molten tin a method called the pilkington process who knew those gold oscar statuettes arent solid gold theyre actually britannia metal plated with gold and britannia metal is made of approximately 92 percent tin the rest is copper and antimony sn shouldnt tins atomic symbol be tn instead actually sn is short for the latin word for tin stannum  when tin is bent at room temperature it makes a highpitched creaking sound known as the tin cry caused by the deformation of tin crystals below 13 degrees celsius tin turns into a form called alphatin this powdery grey tin is an allotrope a different form of the element alpha tin is a semiconductor but is difficult to make according to chemist andrea sella of university college london current research recently tech researchers have gotten excited about graphene a singleatom layer of carbon that is both harder than diamonds and stretchable like rubber its entirely possible that the next hightech advance like graphene will come from humble tin researchers are stanford university and the department of energys slac national accelerator laboratory have invented a oneatomthick layer of tin theyre calling stanene stanene is special because it is the first material able to conduct electricity with 100 percent efficiency at room temperature the addition of a few fluorine atoms maintains this efficiency up to and beyond the temperatures at which computer chips operate — up to about 212 f 100 c according to moores law the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years study researcher yong xu now a physicist at tsinghua university in beijing told live science as a consequence the power density of integrated circuits increases exponentially leading to serious problems of power consumption and heat dissipation xu and his team including physicist shoucheng zhang at stanford knew they needed a heavy element with the properties of a socalled topological insulator a topological insulator is a material that conducts electricity along its surface but does not conduct electricity in its interior many topological insulators have been fabricated by heavy elements including mercury bismuth antimony tellurium and selenium xu said none of them were perfect conductors of electricity at room temperature tin hadnt been studied for this purpose before but xu and his colleagues found that when tin atoms are arranged in a single honeycomb layer the elements properties change it becomes a perfect conductor of electricity at room temperature with not a single stray electron lost the researchers reported in november 2014 electronics made with stanene should thus produce less heat and draw less power than their silicon counterparts xu and his collaborators made the singlelayer tin with a process called molecular beam epitaxy which condenses gaseous versions of the element in a thin layer inside a vacuum its a challenging process xu said requiring exact temperatures and growth speed of the layer to ensure the atomic structure is just right the team hopes to develop cheaper and easier ways to make stanene in the future the next step is to grow highquality stanene samples on the large scale and then use the material for fundamental research and practical applications xu said follow live science livescience facebook  google  additional resources jefferson lab the element
