omega6 fatty acids also referred to as ω6 fatty acids or n 6 fatty acids are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carboncarbon double bond in the n 6 position that is the sixth bond counting from the methyl end 1 members of the family can have proinflammatory or antiinflammatory effects 2the biological effects of the omega6 fatty acids are largely produced during and after physical activity for the purpose of promoting growth and during the inflammatory cascade to halt cell damage and promote cell repair by their conversion to omega6 eicosanoids that bind to diverse receptors found in every tissue of the body contents  hide 1 biochemistry2 pharmacology3 suggested negative health effects4 omega6 consumption5 list of omega6 fatty acids6 dietary linoleic

acids and is categorized as an essential fatty acid because the human body cannot synthesize it mammalian cells lack the enzyme omega3 desaturase and therefore cannot convert omega6 fatty acids to omega3 fatty acids closely related omega3 and omega6 fatty acids act as competing substrates for the same enzymes 3 this outlines the importance of the proportion of omega3 to omega6 fatty acids in a diet 3omega6 fatty acids are precursors to endocannabinoids lipoxins and specific eicosanoids medical research on humans found a correlation though correlation does not imply causation between the high intake of omega6 fatty acids from vegetable oils and disease in humans however biochemistry research has concluded that air pollution heavy metals smoking passive smoking lipopolysaccharides lipid peroxidation products found mainly in vegetable oils roasted nuts and roasted oily seeds and other exogenous toxins initiate the inflammatory response in the cells which leads to the expression of the cox2 enzyme and subsequently to the temporary production of inflammatory promoting prostaglandins from arachidonic acid for the purpose of alerting the immune system of the cell damage and eventually to the production of antiinflammatory molecules eg lipoxins  prostacyclin during the resolution phase of inflammation after the cell damage has been repaired 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

health effects  editsome medical research suggests that excessive levels of omega6 fatty acids from seed oils relative to certain omega3 fatty acids may increase the probability of a number of diseases 17 18 19modern western diets typically have ratios of omega6 to omega3 in excess of 10 to 1 some as high as 30 to 1 the average ratio of omega6 to omega3 in the western diet is 151–1671 16 humans are thought to have evolved with a diet of a 1to1 ratio of omega6 to omega3 and the optimal ratio is thought to be 4 to 1 or lower 16 although some sources suggest ratios as low as 11 20 a ratio of 2–31 omega 6 to omega 3 helped reduce inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 16 a ratio of 51 had a beneficial effect on patients with asthma but a 101 ratio had a negative effect 16 a ratio of 251 reduced rectal cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer whereas a ratio of 41 had no effect 16excess omega6 fatty acids from vegetable oils interfere with the health benefits of omega3 fats in part because they compete for the same ratelimiting enzymes a high proportion of omega6 to omega3 fat in the diet shifts the physiological state in the tissues toward the pathogenesis of many diseases prothrombotic proinflammatory and proconstrictive 21chronic excessive production of omega6 eicosanoids is correlated with arthritis inflammation and cancer many of the medications used to treat and manage these conditions work by blocking the effects of the cox2 enzyme 22 many steps in formation and action of omega6 prostaglandins from omega6 arachidonic acid proceed more vigorously than the corresponding competitive steps in formation and action of omega3 hormones from omega3 eicosapentaenoic acid 23 the cox1 and cox2 inhibitor medications used to treat inflammation and pain work by preventing the cox enzymes from turning arachidonic acid into inflammatory compounds 24 see cyclooxygenase for more information the lox inhibitor medications often used to treat asthma work by preventing the lox enzyme from converting arachidonic acid into the leukotrienes 25 26 many of the antimania medications used to treat bipolar disorder work by targeting the arachidonic acid cascade in the brain 27a high consumption of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas which are found in most types of vegetable oil may increase the likelihood that postmenopausal women will develop breast cancer 28 similar effect was observed on prostate cancer but the study was performed on mice 29 another analysis suggested an inverse association between total polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk but individual polyunsaturated fatty acids behaved differently from each other  a 202 derivative of linoleic acid  was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer 30omega6 consumption  editindustrysponsored studies have suggested that omega6 fatty acids should be consumed in a 11 ratio to omega3 31 though it has been observed that the diet of many individuals today is at a ratio of about 161 mainly from vegetable oils 31 omega6 and omega3 are essential fatty acids that are metabolized by some of the same enzymes and therefore an imbalanced ratio can affect how the other is metabolized 32 in a study performed by ponnampalam 33 it was noticed that feeding systems had a great effect on nutrient content on the meat sold to consumers cynthia doyle conducted an experiment to observe the fatty acid content of beef raised through grass feeding versus grain feeding she concluded that grass fed animals contain an overall omega6omega3 ratio that is preferred by nutritionists 32 in todays modern agriculture the main focus is on production quantity which has decreased the omega3 content and increased the omega6 content due to simple changes such as grainfeeding cattle 16 in grainfeeding cattle this is a way to increase their weight and prepare them for slaughter much quicker compared to grassfeeding this modern way of feeding animals may be one of many indications as to why the omega6omega3 ratio has increased list of omega6 fatty acids  editcommon name lipid name chemical name linoleic acid la 182  n −6 allcis

dietary linoleic acid requirement  editadding more controversy to the omega6 fat issue is that the dietary requirement for linoleic acid has been questioned because of a significant methodology error proposed by university of toronto scientist stephen cunnane 34 cunnane proposed that the seminal research used to determine the dietary requirement for linoleic acid was based on feeding animals linoleic aciddeficient diets which were simultaneously deficient in omega3 fats the omega3 deficiency was not taken into account the omega6 oils added back systematically to correct the deficiency also contained trace amounts of omega3 fats therefore the researchers were inadvertently correcting the omega3 deficiency as well ultimately it took more oil to correct both deficiencies according to cunnane this error overestimates linoleic acid requirements by 5 to 15 times  needs updatedietary sources  editthe evening primrose flower  o biennis produces an oil containing a high content of
