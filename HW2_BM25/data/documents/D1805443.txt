area it is located mostly within the brazilian state of mato grosso do sul but it extends into mato grosso and portions of bolivia and paraguay it sprawls over an area estimated at between 140000 and 195000 square kilometres 54000 and 75000 sq mi various subregional ecosystems exist each with distinct hydrological geological and ecological characteristics up to 12 of them have been defined radambrasil 1982 1 2 3 4 5roughly 80 of the pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons nurturing an astonishing biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping to support a dense array of animal species the name pantanal comes from the portuguese word pântano meaning wetland bog swamp quagmire or marsh by comparison the brazilian highlands are locally referred to as the planalto plateau or literally high plain contents  hide 1 geology geography and ecology11 hydrodynamics12 flora13 fauna2 ecological stability3 protected areas4 main cities located within the

gentlysloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas the planalto highlands and slowly releases the water through the paraguay river and tributaries the formation is a result of the large concave preandean depression of the earths crust related to the andeanorogeny of the tertiary it constitutes an enormous internal river delta in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge depositing their sediments and erosion residues which have been filling throughout the years the large depression area of the pantanal this area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger paranaparaguay plain area  citation neededpantanal landscape the pantanal is bounded by the chiquitano dry forests to the west and northwest by the arid chaco dry forests to the southwest and the humid chaco to the south the cerrado savannas lie to the north east and southeast the pantanal has an average yearly rainfall of 1000–1400 mm 39–55 in but is fed by the upper paraguay river its average temperature is 25 °c 77 °f but temperatures can fluctuate from 0 to 40 °c 32 to 104 °f hydrodynamics  editpantanal in flood condition with a private fazenda in the background floodplain ecosystems such as the pantanal are defined by their seasonal inundation and desiccation 1 they shift between phases of standing water and phases of dry soil when the water table can be well below the root region 1 soils range from high levels of sand in higher areas to higher amounts of clay and silt in riverine areas elevation of the pantanal ranges from 80 to 150 m 260 to 490 ft above sea level 1 annual rainfall over the flood basin is between 1000 and 1500 mm 39 and 59 in with most rainfall occurring between november and march 1 in the paraguay river portion of the pantanal water levels rise between two meters to five meters seasonally water fluctuations in other parts of the pantanal are less than this 1 flood waters tend to flow slowly 2 to 10 cm 079 to 394 in per second 1 due to the low gradients and high resistance offered by the dense vegetation when rising river waters first contact previously dry soil the waters become oxygendepleted rendering the water environs anoxic 1 many natural fish kills can occur if there are no oxygenated water refuges available the reason for this remains speculative it may be due to the growth of toxin producing bacteria in the deoxygenated water rather than as a direct result of lack of oxygen mc clain 2002 typical dryland vegetation flora  editmain article list of plants of pantanal vegetation of brazil the vegetation of the pantanal often referred to as the pantanal complex  is a mixture of plant communities typical of a variety of surrounding biome regions these include moist tropical amazonian rainforest plants semiarid woodland plants typical of northeast brazil brazilian cerrado savanna plants and plants of the chaco savannas of bolivia and paraguay 1 forests usually occur at higher altitudes of the region while grasslands cover the seasonally inundated areas the key limiting factors for growth are inundation and even more importantly waterstress during the dry season 1 the pantanal ecosystem is home to 3500 known plant species  citation neededfauna  editwikimedia commons has media related to animals of the pantanal the pantanal ecosystem is also thought to be home to 1000 bird species 400 fish species 300 mammalian species 480 reptile species and over 9000 different subspecies of invertebrates the apple snail is a keystone species in pantanals ecosystem when the wetlands are flooded once a year the grass and other plants will eventually die and start to decay during this process decomposing microbes deplete the shallow water of all oxygen suffocating larger decomposers unlike other decomposing animals the apple snail have both gills and lungs making it possible for them to thrive in anoxic waters where they recycle the nutrients to get oxygen they extend a long snorkel to the water surface pumping air into their lungs this ability allows them to consume all the dead plant matter and turn it into nutritious fertilizer available for the plants in the area the snails themselves are also food for a variety of animals 6 7 8among the rarest animals to inhabit the wetland of the pantanal are the marsh deer  blastocerus dichotomus and the giant river otter  pteroneura brasiliensis  parts of the pantanal are also home to the following endangered or threatened species the hyacinth macaw  anodorhyncus hyacinthinus a bird endangered due to smuggling the crowned solitary eagle the maned wolf  chrysocyon brachyurus  the bush dog  speothos venaticus  the south american tapir  tapirus terrestris and the giant anteater  myrmecophaga tridactyla  common species in the pantanal include the capybara  hydrochoerus hydrochaeris and the yacare caiman  caiman yacare  according to 1996 data there were 10 million caimans in the pantanal making it the highest concentration of crocodilians in the world 9 the pantanal is home to one of the largest and healthiest jaguar  panthera onca populations on earth most fish are detritivores primarily ingesting fine particles from sediments and plant surfaces 1 this is characteristic of fish living in south american floodplains in general fish migration between river channels and floodplain regions occurs seasonally 1 these fish have many adaptations that allow them to survive in the oxygendepleted floodplain waters 1in addition to the caiman some of the reptiles that inhabit the pantanal are the yellow anaconda  eunectes notaeus  the gold tegu  tupinambis teguixin  the redfooted tortoise  geochelone carbonaria and the green iguana  iguana iguana  lowland tapir hyacinth macaws giant anteater

essential sanctuaries for migratory birds critical nursery grounds for aquatic life and refuges for such creatures as the yacare caiman deer and pantanal jaguar 10the main human activities which threaten the pantanal ecosystems are commercial fishing fishing is focused on only a few species and is probably not sustainable 1national and international sport fishing the paraguay river and its tributaries are the main focus for fishing activities 1cattleranching approximately 99 of the land in the pantanal is privately owned for the purpose of agriculture and ranching 11there are 2500 fazendas in the region and up to eight million cattle 12erosion and sedimentation caused by this activity alter the soil and hydrological characteristics of pantanal floodplain ecosystems consequently native species are threatened by the change in ecosystem variables 11hunting poaching and smuggling of endangered species 13 reptile wild cat and parrot species are particularly at risk from the smuggling industry due to their high value on the black market uncontrolled tourism and overuse of natural resources deforestation deforestation is more relevant to elevated areas of the pantanal which contain forest stands than lowland grassy areas 1silt runoff from deforested highlands alters soil hydrology and is a significant threat to the pantanal 10pollution from gold mining operations and agroindustry 11the pantanal is a natural water treatment system as it removes chemicals including pollutants from water overpollution from industrial development especially gold mining can harm native flora and fauna however water quality in the pantanal was not significantly impacted as of 2002 1pollution from sewage systems and pesticides 13infrastructure development shipping canals raised roads pipelines 11 the proposed plan to dredge the paraguay and paraná rivers to allow oceangoing ships to travel 3442 kilometres 2139 mi inland is of particular concern and could affect the hydrology flooding and drainage cycles of the region and therefore impact the ecosystem 13 14protected areas  edithotel sesc porto cercado in the sesc reserve a portion of the pantanal in brazil has been
