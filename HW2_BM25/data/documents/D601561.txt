author messagestoy4speed basic member posts11710 dec 2008 1156 amim contemplating the purchase of a tire changer machine but would appreciate any feedback experiences from anyone who has gone this route already this would be for home use usual autox rtirewheels sidewall aspect no lower than 35 ratio hoosier or kumho not sure yet have seen a bit and heard of corghi sp  ranger hunter  and seems like just a ton of add on options available do all those side swing arm things provide essential purpose for the occasional home user what would be a fair estimate on a price for a adequate machine i still have to figure out shipping problems too seems truck freight shipping requires purchaser to unload from delivery truck at over 600 lbs not sure how i might manage that if delivery could be made with a power lift tailgate and the delivery service could drop it in my driveway id be happy with that thanks for any help47cp veteran member posts274710 dec 2008 0129 pmwe have a ranger from american automotive httpwwwamericanautomotiveequipmtc1202htm  targetblank relnofollowhttpwwwamericanautomotiveequipmtc1202htm i am pretty sure it is this one i got it about 5 years ago i went in with a few local racers and we split the costs interestingly enough only 1 or 2 of the group of 5 use the machine very often i have some experience mounting wheels and tires from a prior life i have been able to do tires from the 12 wide cp tires 14 wide em wheels 35 series race tires etc but they can be a challenge the 12 and 14 inch wide whees dont really fit so the bottom bead has to be done by hand low profile tires sometimes need two people i would not be comfortable doing certain tires on fancy wheels that absolutely couldnt be scratched if i had to do it over again i would get all the assist arms like on this one httpwwwamericanautomotiveequipmtc1202htm  targetblank relnofollowhttpwwwamericanautomotiveequipmtc1202htm or a used hunter machine those assist arms make all the difference in doing tough tires i think by definition any hoosier or kuhmo race tire is going to be much tougher than the equivelant road handler owning the machine is very nice and has certainly paid for itself in the time we have had it dave wtoy4speed basic member posts11711 dec 2008 1007 amhmmm thanks for the input those assist arms probably add about 600 to 700 to cost of a machine gotta check whatever budget i have i guess were not mounting 70 series tires anymore kupop new member posts11 dec 2008 0349 pmi have this machine httpwwwgregsmithequipmentcomatc589xhtm its a lot cheaper than most of the bigger named equipment but i dont think i went wrong buying this item at all i actually found it used about 25 hours away from my house on craigslist and picked it up with my sisters truck we used a back hoe to get it out of the truck and then lowered it down onto 2 of my car dollies placed on a piece of plywood in the driveway rocks and rolled it into the garage once on the cement it rolled around to where we needed it and i was able to tilt one side up at a time and get the car dollies out one on the ground by itself it can be slide around a bit for final movement i do not have it bolted down and sometimes while working on some tires it may wonder a bit the one thing i liked about this machine as some others do also is that you can add an assist arm to it at some later date i never did really wide wheelstires yet widest i did was a 255 or extremely low profile race tires lowest i did was 20540 but a street tire but havent had a wheeltire i was unable to get on some of the tires do fight a lot in either coming off or going on though i have a second pry bar that helps and bought a hands free clamp which helps a lot the hands free clamp is almost like an assist arm but a lot cheaper there is no adjustment on it so depending on the wheel it may not hold the bead down far enough im still using the standard metal head and have yet to scratch any wheels i do have a plastic head for it but havent switched over yet i also have the following balancer httpwwwgregsmithequipmentcomaatwb42htm i actually found this for sale only about 10 miles away from my garage and lucked out with it being the same model as the tire machine i got i dont balance all of my race tires that i mount but ive used these machines on plenty of street tires already with no issues the only time i had a problem with this balancer was on some very large truck tires im not into that type of stuff so if the balancer is unable to do them or i was doing it incorrectly i dont mind as it works just fine for the type of wheelstires i need to work with although both machines i got were lightly used i did buy them myself and it is a little expensive i havent even had them for a year yet and could not tell you how many times i have used them i will change tires for local people i know and charge them a little bit of money which helps pay for it but also every time i use it myself it is saving me money and so much more convenient than having to take the tires off and haul them to some shop i know over time they will more than pay for themself and i should of invested in machines like this years ago just be prepared for a large amount of junk tires around your place ive got mountains behind the garage i just dont understand why i have to pay to dispose of a junk tire when there are places making money off of these thingstoy4speed basic member posts11713 dec 2008 0306 amthanks for suggesting another good choice in brands my learning curve is now more closely approximating my hp curve and less like my torque curve yes piles of old tires will be an issue i believe our waste disposal company will take away 2 sets of used tires a year for free almost enoughsnaponbob veteran member posts286213 dec 2008 0915 amwith the economy in the condition its in local shop equipment suppliers will be getting buried in used equipment if you purchase an air powered upright tire changer you will need a real air compressor if you purchase an electric tire changer make sure your electrical supply is up to the task convenience factor will be very high but return on investment wont be check with some local shops about the general satisfaction of the local equipment repair outfits  for instance when i was selling snapon in the d c area i knew the hunter servcie was exceptional here in k c not so much this could matter in the future some balancers can be easily calbrated by an owner and some cant find out on the one you want make an attempt to test drive a few tire mounting machines to see if you even want to bother with it and see if different machines can actually do what you want example my local goodyear store has an upright machine that simply can not mount up a 29530x18 a6 on an 18x8 wheel a local race shop has a much better yet still not real new tire machine that can handle it but he has lots of experience and knows how to hold his mouth right you get what you pay for  good machines cost more new or used stay away from jim bean and fmc machines they were in my product line older snapon balancers were top notch but are now old enough that they may no longer be serviceable also accuturn tire equipment is relabeled jim bean hunter and coats tire machines are very good lots of good to excellent balancers are available hth some good luck bob buxbaum stx e36 328 kc

on the policy is realitively cheap same with equipment as the basic piece is the price of entry and for a little bit more money one will be able to obtain equipment that has reserve strength power and capacity money spent well once is money spent only once quality costs less bob buxbaum stx e36 328 kc regionbarryott new member posts6313 dec 2008 0948 pmheres a similar

the same one jason isley does a few of us bought one of these used for 300 about 4 years ago it was extra cheap since it had some air leaks but some pm and it runs fine vic ran it on his 30gal 5hp compressor for a few years and it would run that compressor most of the time i got a 60gal 7hp compressor and it stays well ahead of the machine like others id recommend scouring the used markert you should be able to find a decent unit at a fraction of new and the fact you should be drastically reducing the duty cycle on it compared to a tire shop means it will probably last a good long while the number of times this machine has paid for itself is enormousandy m windscreen new member posts17 dec 2008 1152 amill put in some good words for a hunter tc3500 thats the machine you see the hoosier and bridgestone guys using at nationals the assist arms along with a bead depressor will enable you to get pretty much any width tire onto a wheel the issue then will become one of technique and experience to get it to bead up on super pinched tires due to the side wall wrinkling and not sealing to the wheels bead hump there are lots of flavors of bead depressors i prefer hunters depressor tail some like mounting clamps and others just use a pair of tire spoons to manually hold the tire in the drop center the nice thing about the tc3500 is nothing metal ever touches your wheel ive seen decent used tc3500s go for under 2000 on cragslist and e bay i bought mine on e bay for a bit over that and then had to put a couple hundred  of parts into it the parts probably werent neeed but im a perfectionist and ive now got a like new machine you dont want to have to put major components into it as big parts form hunter are not cheap but the trinkets like orings and gaskets are very reasonable so far ive been successful running the machine on a 110v 6 hp 25 gal compressor but if im tearing though some easy to mount stuff set of z06 tires in 20 mins the compressor probably runs 8090 as a home use compressor its only rated for 50 duty freight shipping actually wasnt as bad as i thought at least at prices this past spring ft lauderdale to southeast wisconsin base rate was about 300 for 560 lbs with an extra 6080 for a truck with a liftgate on the pick up end if you can find a friend that works somewhere with a loading dock and a fork lift you can save yourself  by
