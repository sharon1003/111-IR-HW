september 28 2014optical poetry  an oskar fischinger retrospective presented in association with center for visual music decades before computer graphics before music videos even before fantasia the 1940 version there were the abstract animated films of oskar fischinger 1900  1967 master of ‘absolute’ or nonobjective filmmaking he was cinemas kandinsky an animator who beginning in the 1920s in germany created exquisite ‘visual music’ using geometric patterns and shapes choreographed tightly to classical music and jazz – john canemaker new york times oskar fischinger is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century embracing the abstraction that became the major art movement of that century and exploring the new technology of the cinema to open abstract painting into a new visual music that performs in liquid time – biographer william moritz in motion painting number one for the first time visual music was born creating that deep emotional almost pleasurable feeling as we know it that we get from good music – oskar fischinger early in his filmmaking career oskar fischinger established a pattern of alternating commercial work with personal experimental filmmaking while it seems clear that he preferred working in an avant garde way commercial work afforded both income and access to the most advanced technology and oskar was among all of the radical filmmakers of the twenties the most technically knowledgeable and adventurous oskar supported himself during this period by making conventional animation which demonstrates his mastery of realistic anatomy perspective and linear storytelling yet his personal film spiritual constructions shows the same radical consciousness and experimental techniques as his abstract works the slender tale of two drunks who argue and stagger home becomes an epic voyage of warping shapes and thwarted perceptions rendered with singleframe editing and scratching directly on film frames—devices that would reemerge thirty years later in avantgarde filmmaking hired to make special effects of rockets starscapes and planet surfaces for fritz langs 1929 sciencefiction feature woman in the moon he broke his ankle on the set while recuperating he began drawing animations on white paper in charcoal which became his remarkable series of studies comprised of 17 short blackandwhite film experiments tightly synchronized to music in which he set out to solve a different visual problem at this time fischinger was also pursuing a series of film experiments with drawn synthetic sound  ornament sound experiments  the close synchronization of the studies with music originally begun as ads for recordings thus direct precursors of the music video made them immensely popular with audiences worldwide but after the advent of the nazi regime abstract works were classed as degenerate art and it became more difficult to make experimental films fischinger was involved with the development of the threeexposure gaspar color film process a european rival to technicolor although experimentation was still proscribed color opened up new venues for fischingers animated and abstract works in the field of the commercial advertisement one of the first color films in europe kreise  circles was cleared as an advertising film but it is essentially abstract imagery with the ad text only appearing in the last few frames fischinger’s animated color films muratti greift ein muratti marches on and composition in blue received great critical and popular success—attracting the eye of hollywood in 1936 paramount brought fischinger to hollywood and commissioned him to create the opening number for their big broadcast of 1937 feature when paramount would not pay for the color film stock he had requested he resigned and later bought allegretto back from paramount completing it in color fischinger used a cellayering technique to animate formal visual equivalents of the musical concepts of rhythm harmony and counterpoint he implemented a divisionist technique of changing colors from frame to frame in order to achieve particularly luminous and chromatic hues that could not be produced by normal methods of animation photography shown all over the world allegretto eventually came to be recognized as one of the most accomplished pieces in the history of visual music fischinger found it extremely difficult to work in studio situations enduring episodes at paramount 1936 mgm 1937 and disney 19389 for whom he designed the bach toccata and fugue sequence in fantasia he finally quit because his designs were simplified and altered to be more representational the museum of nonobjective painting guggenheim foundation supported oskars work during the difficult war years and commissioned him to synchronize a film with a sousa march afterward oskar proposed a film without sound in order to demonstrate the artistic validity of nonobjective imagery but the curator insisted that he make a film to bachs brandenburg concerto no 3 while carrying out his commission oskar discreetly composed the silent masterpiece radio dynamics although the museum of nonobjective painting specifically required a cel animation film fischinger made his bach film as a radical documentation of the act of painting exposing a single frame each time he made a brush stroke the film parallels the structure of the bach music without slavish synchronization and rediscovers some of the playfulness inherent in bachs sense of formal invention although motion painting no 1 won the grand prix for experimental film at the brussels international experimental film competition in 1949 fischinger never again received funding for one of his personal films and turned increasingly to oil painting as a creative outlet during the last twenty years of his life fischinger worked on a few commercial projects several unfinished film and multimedia projects many unfinished animation drawings and by the end of his life had completed a substantial body of graphic work which included over eight hundred paintings — excerpted from the center for visual music’s oskar fischinger biography wwwcenterforvisualmusicorgfischinger
