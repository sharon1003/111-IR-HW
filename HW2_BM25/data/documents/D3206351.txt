contacts the hulu servers and requests an activation code the device then polls the server using that activation code the server either answers with try again or with a successful registration the device will keep checking the activation code until it gets a success or it times out usually after a few minutes at hulu there is a cluster of backend servers that generate and maintain the activation code these servers are configured to uniquely generate codes that dont repeat within a certain period of time and can quickly lookup an activation code to see if it is associated with an account after some period of time the activation code is deleted and can be reused for future activation attempts by other devices the website also communicates with these backend servers after you login to the website you can enter the activation code the website sends a message to the backend servers to associate your account with that activation code the next time your device polls the server
