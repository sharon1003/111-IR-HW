engineered vs laminate flooring which is better this entry was posted on october 3 2014 by jonathan sapir there’s real confusion between engineered wood flooring and laminate flooring it’s really common for people to mistakenly assume that they are one and the same thing in fact this couldn’t be further from the truth while both of these flooring options have their pros and cons confusing one with the other is like confusing apples with pears if you’re in a situation where you’re almost tossing a coin between engineered wood and laminate flooring it’s time to get down to the nittygritty of the differences in this article we’ll start by briefly defining what’s meant by the different terms so you’re clear about what you’re dealing with thereafter we’ll look at the pros and cons of each in terms of cost ease of fitting life expectancy visual impact and so on so here goes engineered wood flooring engineered wood flooring is a man made product that is made from natural materials commonly made up of layers of ply that are bonded together engineered wood flooring is always topped off with a layer of solid wood this layer of solid wood is called the lamella or top layer and it’s thanks to this solid wood finish that engineered wood looks so convincingly like solid wood engineered wood flooring has the advantage over solid wood that its stable structure means that it is much more resistant to expansion and contraction than solid wood what this means is that it can safely be fitted in rooms where temperature and moisture fluctuations are significant like bathrooms and kitchens engineered wood flooring can also be installed over under floor heating laminate flooring laminate flooring on the other hand is a synthetic manmade product that is made up of various layers that are fused together using a lamination process laminate flooring is a relatively recent addition to the range of flooring options available on the market and made its first appearance in the late 1970s it originally launched as a competitor to vinyl flooring  made up of typically five or fewer layers laminate flooring can be made to look like any material the manufacturer wants because effectively the layer which makes up the image is just that an image cost comparison laminate flooring is often thought of as a cheaper option than engineered wood flooring while it is possible to pick up seriously cheap laminate wood flooring it is not the case across the board that laminate wood flooring is cheaper than engineered what’s more when you take into account the fact that engineered wood flooring is likely to last significantly longer thanlaminate flooring savings made at the start soon disappear as time goes by and floors need to be replaced it’s also worth remembering that many laminate floors require investment into an additional layer of underlay to make the floor stable and look good and this element can significantly increase what appears to be a low cost floor at the start ease of fitting both engineered and laminate wood flooring are simple and easy to install each lending themselves perfectly to both glue down and floating fitting methods there is little difference in expertise required to fit one rather than the other what you need to remember is that a badly fitted laminate floor will look as awful as a badly fitted engineered wood floor so from that point of view it may be the case that you need to pay for installation to get it right on either count maintenance both flooring options are easy to clean each option only needs a regular vacuuming and in the case of engineered wood flooring a light moist mopping on a regular basis with laminate flooring you can afford be a bit more enthusiastic with your use of water but apart from that you shouldn’t find much difference between the two when it comes to ongoing maintenance when it comes to significant maintenance this is where the differences become really apparent with engineered wood flooring you can resand and refinish your floor a number of times during its lifetime how often you’ll be able to do this will depend on the thickness of the lamella or top layer but you can safely assume that with most quality engineered wood floors you can have your floor looking brand new at least 3 or 4 times during it’s life this simply isn’t possible with laminate flooring choice suffice to say that like most things these days there are hundreds if not thousands of each flooring option available on the market today so when it comes to choice you’ll be spoilt on both counts life expectancy this is one of the most significant differences between the two flooring options in very general terms when you buy a laminate floor you can expect a maximum life expectancy of around 20 years whereas a quality engineered wood floor should last for up to 75 years this simply has to be taken into account when making your decisions visual impact the importance of visual impact will depend entirely on the look you’re trying to achieve at the end of the day if you want something that looks like real wood there’s no contest between engineered and laminate flooring so there you have it a whistlestop tour of the key differences between engineered and laminate wood flooring which you decide will work best for you will depend on your budget the desired duration for your floor and whether or not you want to have something that looks like real wood or fake if you’d like to discuss which flooring option would suit your project best why not contact us this entry was posted in on october 3 2014 by jonathan
