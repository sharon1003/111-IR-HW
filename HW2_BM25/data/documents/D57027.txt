reset os x password without an os x cdjenny kortina jun 22 2008  659 pm cst269 comments tweet share post i wrote about this a while back on my blog hackaddict but it was such a popular post i thought i’d give it a revisit a lot of people buy used macs and they often run into the problem of not knowing the admin password so here is a way to get around not knowing the admin password on macs to reset your os x password without an os x cd you need to enter terminal and create a new admin account reboot hold apple  s down after you hear the chime when you get text prompt enter in these terminal commands to create a brand new admin account hitting return after each linemount uw rm vardb apple setup doneshutdown h now after rebooting you should have a brand new admin account when you login as the new admin you can simply delete the old one and you’re good to go againtagshack osx password reset related stories still having problems with i os 7 try one of these reset options6 great apps for

mean to have a used computer transferred to a new owner name address etc ryansway october 1st 2008i was able to get it to work but only after pulling out the ram and restarting the machine it was the only way to get past the lock which prevented any of the hot key combo’s during start up once the ram was out i had no problems using â€œapple sâ€ – that method should probably be included in this procedure for those encountering the same problem i did cheersmark october 1st 2008this method seems to work fine to all those who tell you to use passwd – it doesn’t work in 103x and above…dave johnson september 28th 2008this reset procedure worked absolutely great thanks it was a godsend dave hyper shadow5592september 26th 2008this actually worked thanx so much f y i i used this on a mac os x panther desktop ryansway september 23rd 2008i’ve just tried this method several dozen times on an old apple ibook 500 running 1048 and it doesn’t work the install cd method doesn’t work either as they are the original 102 nor does the restore cd method so i tried this method using “apple s” holding it down before during and after the chime but no luck tried various intensities on the keys no luck either any ideas dyllen dj oseptember 18th 2008do as he says but upon the start up you will here a chime the apple chime  once that is done you have a 3 second time period to hit apple command – s this works on any computer using mac os x 1040 – 11 you must hold both firmly not to tough to brake your keys just enough to let it know whose boss a screen “will ” pop up and you must hold both of them down at the same time until that appears once it does you will wait about a minute then do as it says and voila it works and for all the nay sayers no it doesn’t wipe your information say do not transfer anything and nothing is wiped logon as the admin and put in your password and change the old admins privileges to standard and then change yours to admin settings then reset the password on the old one to something you will remember then log out and go onto the old one and all of your things are there and nothing is deleted i have done this 20000 times trust me my company uses macs and so many people forget the password and it takes to much time to do this with the disk that its easier this way and nothing will be deleted if you just put in the information needed nothing more don’t transfer anything example – the old account let say was name joe shomo joeshomo forgot his password and doesn’t no how to get it back reads this then says okay shuts down his computer turns it on hears the chime 3 notes before the end hits apple command – s together comes to the text screen types in what it says and then reboots comes to the first time start up screen follows the instructions and doesn’t transfer anything “trust me dont transfer ” then names his new account fixer he logs on to fixer and goes to account preference clicks make this computer an administrator ” no need to put in any password here ” clicks on the lock if its locked which it will be if someone is secure with there computer goes to the joe shomo account and clicks don’t allow administrator privileges then below the names and short name clicks reset password change it to what ever you want that you will remember and finish up close the account settings log out and go to the joe shomo account don’t be worried your stuff is there and if your smart you will leave fixer account or whatever you name it but if not then change it back and that does it don”t listen to people that tell you that it will screw anything up it wont its just a glitch that allows the computer to think its the first time starting up but doesn’t wipe the hard drive because it already has a os just a refresher if you will if that doesn’t help and you need more then that contact me at dyllenowensymailcom i will help you further any other problems contact me willing to helpjoyce february 12th 2010i have an acer and it

startup disk when you reboot it will boot into os x by default instead of windows and then you can boot into single user mode oh and using punctuation is not a bad habit to get intodevious july 8th 2008hi i have a dual os mac with windows and mac how do i get to command line on the mac as when my pc reboots it loads up windows asap or if i keep hold of alt it gives me option to choose but then when i click on mac and hold apple and s it doesnt take me to command prompt the tech juice june 30th 2008awesomei had no idea i recently just reformatted a mac had i known this i could have saved valuable time and effort thanksi3azjune 26th 2008john all personal computers can be “hacked” this way even bios password can be got around by just pulling out the batteriesthats why on the first mission impossible film u have the computer locked up in a secure room shrikeejune 23rd 2008mount uw  passwd username reboot now obviously replace username with the desired login name if you don’t know it go in to users and see which folders are available…cd users ls akush october 26th 2010you saved my lifesimon december 10th 2010brilliant following the much treasured kiss principle thanks alot  rick june 23rd 2008if you’re already going into single user mode do it the right way honza june 23rd 2008rm r usersusername that removes the users home directory it doesn’t actually remove the account from the user list the oz june 23rd 2008actualy no it does not delete the user account to do that you would have to do thisrm r usersusername the command simply deletes the prefs for the apple setup assistant and it could be another way to regain access should you not have your install dvd after running the command and rebooting youll be brought to the apple setup assistant where it will allow you to create another admin user which in turn allows you to enable the root user and then regain access to your files resetting a firmware password is as easy as changing the amount of ram in the machine and them zapping pram that takes care of any firmware passwordsflysi june 22nd 2008does this work if a firmware password is enabled cuz otherwise it’s a little disappointing to think it would be that easy to snag a computer and wipe all of its data even if the owner thinking he’s being all securityconscious has bothered to enable a firmware password…todd baur june 22nd 2008yeah this is a bad idea sorry but removing that file will just trick os x into thinking its the first time its been powered up and take you through registration so if you absolutely need to reset your password without an apple cd available you’re better doing thismrana march 3rd 2010its not working ewjune 22nd 2008you fail to mention that in the process you delete all of your information that is not resetting the os x password that is called creating a new account and taking over someone else’s computer with a fresh start the title of this post should be changed tex june 23rd 2009yeah now i’m fed
