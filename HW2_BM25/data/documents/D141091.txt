mlb history10 most mindblowing singlegame feats in mlb history zachary d rymer may 1 2012milwaukee brewer ryan braun did something pretty remarkable at petco park on monday night the left fielder blasted three home runs and hit a triple resulting in six rbi and 15 total bases weve seen players hit three home runs in a game before heck curtis granderson did it less than two weeks before braun what makes brauns big night on monday slightly more remarkable is the triple he tacked on in his final atbat according to the elias sports bureau via the associated press  braun is the first hitter since fred lynn in 1975 to hit three homers and a triple in the same game pretty mindblowing am i right heres a list of 10 singlegame feats that are even more mindblowing than what braun did in san diego on monday night10 shawn green compiles 19 total bases in one game 20021 of 10ryan braun had an outstanding game on monday night but it pales in comparison to the day thenlos angeles dodger outfielder shawn green enjoyed on may 23 2002 at miller park in that game green hit four home runs a double and a single thats 19 total bases which is a major league record for a single game to put that in perspective it took as outfielder seth smith 24 games and over 60 atbats to reach that mark this season9 toronto blue jays hit 10 home runs in one game 19872 of 10if you like home runs and i know you do you should sit back and imagine how awesome life would have been if you had been at the game between the baltimore orioles and toronto blue jays at exhibition stadium on september 14 1987 that day the blue jays hit 10 home runs an mlb record for a single game george bell pictured hit two as did rance mulliniks ernie whitt however stole the show by hitting three also going deep in that game was a young fred mc griff lighthitting mike hart added a homer for the orioles to add at least some semblance of balance jack oconnor was the only os pitcher there were six total that did not allow a home run that day8 robby thompson is caught stealing four times in one game 19863 of 10robby thompson was a decent basestealer during his 11year career he ended up with 103 swiped bags with a careerhigh 16 in 1987 thompson learned to be careful on the bases the hard way during his rookie year in 1986 in a game against the cincinnati reds on june 27 1986 thompson was caught stealing four times that by the way is a singlegame mlb record and its probably not one that thompson is proud of he ended up getting caught trying to steal 15 times that season and 11 times the season after for the rest of his career he was never caught stealing more than nine times in a single season looks like thompson learned his lesson—well sort of7 minnesota twins turn two triple plays 19904 of 10triple plays are a relative rarity in baseball they are awesome when they happen but they just dont happen very often anyone who got to see the minnesota twins play the boston red sox at fenway park on july 17 1990 should consider themselves lucky the twins turned two triple plays that day the only time thats happened in the same game in baseball history scott erickson pictured was on the mound for the first one which came in the bottom of the fourth he walked wade boggs gave up a double to jody reed and then walked carlos quintana he saved himself by getting tom brunansky to ground into a triple play third to second to first the next triple play came in the bottom of the eighth inning with john candelaria on the mound he gave up a double to tim naehring walked boggs and then got reed to ground to third for yet another aroundthehorn triple play guess what the twins still lost the game 106 fernando tatis hits two grand slams in the same inning 19995 of 10back in 1999 it was fernando tatis job to provide protection for mark mc gwire in the st louis cardinals lineup its something he did quite well as he hit 34 homers with 107 rbi that year tatis was constantly overshadowed by big mac but on april 23 1999 he momentarily stole the spotlight that day tatis stepped to the plate in the top of the third and cranked a grand slam off of los angeles dodgers hurler chan ho park giving the cardinals a 42 lead later in the inning the bases were again loaded for tatis and park was still on the mound tatis got him again launching his second grand slam of the inning he remains the only baseball player in history to hit two grannies in a single inning i cant believe it happened said tatis according to baseballalmanaccom i did not expect to hit another one ive never been a home run hitter i just try to meet the ball im not like mark mc gwire you sure about that fernando5 tom cheney strikes out 21 in 16 innings of work 19626 of 10the major league record for strikeouts in a game officially is 20 its been done by roger clemens twice kerry wood and  unofficially randy johnson personally im more impressed with what thenwashington senators hurler tom cheney did on september 12 1962 against the baltimore orioles that day cheney pitched 16 strong innings striking out a grand total of 21 hitters he won the game upping his record for the season to 68 cheney wasnt overly dominant he gave up 10 hits and an earned run also walking four but a 16inning start with 21 punchouts isnt a bad day at the office by any stretch of the imagination somebody might strike out 21 in a game again but in this day and age nobodys ever going to pitch 16 innings ever again cheneys accomplishment will withstand the test of time4 tom seaver strikes out 10 straight 19707 of 10tom cheney struck out 21 in 16 innings and roger clemens kerry wood and randy johnson struck out 20 in nine innings but none of them ever struck out 10 straight hitters in a single game tom seaver did he did it back on april 22 1970 against the san diego padres a game in which he struck out a thenrecord 19 hitters the strikeout streak began in the top of the sixth when seaver punched out al ferrara from that point on every out he recorded was a strikeout his last ended the evening against—you guessed it—ferrara seavers game score for that game was 97 in case you were wondering3 allan travers allows 26 hits and 24 runs in nine innings 19128 of 10look up allan travers on baseballreferencecom and you will see that he pitched one major league game in his career if you can call it that and it wasnt a good one on may 18 1912 travers took the mound for the detroit tigers against the philadelphia athletics he went the distance but he gave up 26 hits and 24 runs while walking seven his whip for the game was over 400 so what exactly was the story with this guy well travers wasnt a pitcher sabrorg tells the story which is about a young college student thrust into the spotlight due to extraordinary circumstances a week before tigers star ty cobb had leaped into the stands during a game against the new york highlanders and attacked a heckler appropriately named al president ban johnson responded by suspending cobb indefinitely the tigers went on strike in protest of cobbs suspension forcing the team to go out and find replacement players travers was the pitcher the team found tigers players returned to work soon after travers performance2 tom mc creery hits three insidethepark homers in the same game 18979 of 10its my opinion that the straight steal of home is the most exciting play not just in baseball but in all of sports however i do like a good insidethepark home run as long as i live i shall regret not being in attendance at the louisville colonels game against the philadelphia athletics on july 12 1897 that day louisville outfielderpitcher tom mc creery hit three insidethepark home runs all off jack taylor according to baseballreferencecom the colonels played their game at eclipse park in those days and my presumption is that the park did not have outfield fences a ball in the gap could have rolled forever outfield fences or no outfield fences mc creerys record is one that will never be broken not bad for a guy who hit just 27 homers in a nineyear career1 germany schaefer steals the same base twice in the same inning 190810 of 10stealing one base in an inning thats been done in fact quite a few players have stolen second third and home all in the same inning before you would be surprised but only germany schaefer could claim to have stolen the same base twice in the same inning wait what the story according to 11pointscom is that schaefer then with the detroit tigers was on first base in a game against the cleveland indians with another runner on third the plan was to do a doublesteal with schaefer serving as bait while the other runner broke for home schaefer held up his end of the bargain but the runner on third stayed put it was legal back then to steal bases in backwards order so schaefer proceeded to steal first on the next pitch on the next pitch he broke for and successfully stole second base again im going to go out on a limb and guess this will never be done again comments
