dancers trending theresa ruth howard apr 28 2017 1238pm estwhy some dancers are giving “hiplet” serious side eye giphy hiplet is sweeping the nation between ted x refinery29 desigual campaigns anna wintours madeforher fundraiser and the plethora of morning show spots the hybrid dance craze—known for its sassy runwaystyle walks on pointe and crablike bentknee jazzy chassés—has gone viral hiplet is the brain child of homer hans bryant a former dance theatre of harlem principal who in 1981 founded chicago multicultural dance center then called bryant ballet aka the studio where young sasha and malia obama studied before moving to the white house bryant started putting hip hop movement on pointe in 1994 with a piece he choreographed for his students called the rap ballet that evolved into what became hiplet a portmanteau of hip hop and ballet which is now a regular class at his school jason derulo hip hop ballet routine your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats

urban and european dance vernaculars as a positive byproduct of the black ballerina movement for me and many others it sets our teeth on edge why such strong reactions as a former ballet dancer and current ballet educator ive attempted to break down why it evokes such icky feelings1 the lack of ballet technique unlike hiplet robert garlands return blends ballet with social dance in a way that shows off the dancers virtuosic technique most troublesome for me is the fact that the hiplet ladies have so little ballet technique to be fair the three older dancers who are typically featured in the group numbers have beautiful feet and show flashes of solid ballet training but many of the rest are unable to fully get on their box its cringeworthy and dangerous perhaps if the hiplet dancers exhibited the duality of striking beautiful first arabesque lines in addition to being able to break it down there might be less vitriol for example robert garlands return set to music by aretha franklin and james brown melds ballet and social dance quite well by highlighting the adroit ballet technique and versatility of dance theatre of harlems dancers but most of the hiplet dancers cant hit those ballet lines and as a result the technique is more akin to a toe tapping in a vaudevillian sideshow which is weird because bryant is a fantastic ballet teacher known for his bootcamplike approach to ballet training hes famous for employing tactics like nonstop aerobic barres from pliés to battements with no breaks as you turn from the left side to the right hell bark out the next combination i know because i was his student at a dth summer intensive at age 13 he was inspiring and effective wellversed in technique and was a stickler for strength stamina and precision so for people who have danced and trained in the traditional capacity with bryant hiplet leaves many of us asking the question what happened bryant is finally getting some of the recognition that he is due its unfortunate is it not for what he is truly gifted at training technically proficient ballet dancers2 it’s neither hip hop nor ballet is memphis jookin more balletic than hiplet lil buck uses elements of pointe work in his movement hiplet purports to be a blend of hip hop and ballet but the lack of authentic representation of either genre is another reason some of us are giving it a hard sideeye the only aspects of ballet would be the use of pointe shoes and some questionablyexecuted basic ballet vocabulary and the technique doesnt draw from real hip hop roots either the foundational techniques of hip hop are popping locking and breaking although jookin a memphisborn derivative also known as the gangsta walk sometimes resembles ballet with its elements of gliding and toe work but hiplet is more of a mashup of many styles of west african horton jazz dance hall and social dance3 it undercuts legit advances for black dancers just when black ballerinas like michaela de prince are climbing the ranks in major companies hiplet presents a caricature of blacks doing ballet photo by angela sterling courtesy dutch national ballet for ballet dancers of color hiplet is something of an embarrassment just when artistic directors are finally taking the need for diversity seriously and a few black ballerinas are climbing the ranks in major companies there is hiplet just when we can proudly and enthusiastically hashtag blackballerinas blackelegance browngirlsdoballet and mean it when we feel like we are the jeffersons movin on up hiplet is the ghettoization of blacks doing ballet not because it blends african american urban social dance and a european court social dance but because it does it crudely without sophistication and hence becomes a mockery of our honest efforts to excel at the latter while not honoring the brilliance of the former it is not coincidental that just as we have numerous examples of black ballet excellence a caricaturized image of blacks doing ballet becomes the rage there has always been a cultural counterbalance that happens when african americans start to make progress when movies or televisions shows featuring positive black characters and stories are finally produced there is always what feels like a backlash where we are presented with versions of ourselves that are laughable or belittling it feels like tiny weights have been tethered to our wings just as we think we are about to soar4 it feels immature and opportunistic performance  the hiplet ballerinas  tedx san francisco your browser does not currently recognize any of

with the yassssses and werks in the background was responsible for hiplet people could better understand it because it feels immature impromptu faddish when you learn that it is the product of a 67yearold man it seemsodd it feels opportunistic a phenomenon that is riding the wave of conversations about blacks in ballet straight to the bank there is nothing inherently wrong with that but you have to ask at what cost more than ever images create our reality does hiplet help or hurt who knows how long hiplet will be on our radar i am sure that these young ladies are having wonderful experiences and seeing aspects of the world that they never thought possible that in and of itself is a positive but it is hard to imagine these students growing up become hiplet teachers or mothers being willing to spend upwards of 80 a pop for pointe shoes for daughters to learn to dougie on in the longterm but stranger things have happened for now in oldschool fashion ill give a nod to naughty by nature and say hip hop hiplet hey no
