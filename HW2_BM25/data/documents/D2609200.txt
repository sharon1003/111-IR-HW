and money vs buying in a physical store i can also reduce my credit card risk by prepayingjune 23 2015subscription length 12 months format online game code verified purchase i purchased a 12 month xbox live gold membership for the first time on amazon a couple years ago and i love the convenience i typically use the online game code option which provides you with a code you enter on your xbox or within your xbox live account this allows me to make the purchase and basically instantly redeem the code on my xbox live account its great if you need to quickly start reactivate or extend membership without waiting for a physical card to arrive in the mail or without needing to run to the store to buy one i also like using these prepaid cards or codes to pay for xbox live over paying with a credit card or debit card if you pay with a creditdebit card microsoft typically automatically renews it when your subscription is up as a single dad i may not always have the required funds where they need to be when that happens i dont like surprises and the associated fees that come with them  i prefer not having a credit card linked to my xbox anyway because it helps prevent fraud and the kids cant accidentally purchase something which membership length should you purchase xbox live membership prepaid cardscodes are available in 3 month 12 month or 24 month subscriptions i typically buy the 12 month and ill explain why in a minute the 3 months option is good if youre on a tight budget or if youre not sure youll like xbox live i typically avoid the 3 month option because it costs you much more in the long run if you pay for 12 months of xbox live using the 3 month option at 2499 youll pay 9996 for a year of xbox live for 3 cents more you could have purchased a two year subscription card currently 9999 thats crazy i purchase the 12 month subscription because i know well want   no need    xbox live all year in our household the 12 month card saves me money over a monthly credit card billed subscription or the 3 month options in fact if youre patient i know at least the 12 month memberships go on sale from time to time i think i scored my first one on amazon for 3999 which is about 20 off the normal price if youve got extra cash burning a hole in your pocket you can also pony up the dough for a 24 month xbox live gold membership and take advantage of the discount it offers im a bit too cheap and try to hold our household to too much of a budget to justify buying the 9999 24 month subscription cardcode it does save about 20 vs buying two 12 month cards but the 1999 it currently saves me isnt enough to justify the expense if youre lucky enough to find these xbox live gold membership cardscodes on sale you can always buy and redeem multiples you can add them at any time and microsoft allows you to stack them i believe you can redeem up to 3 years worth of xbox live gold membership credits on your account at any one time since many parentsgrandparentsadults may be considering buying this as a gift they might have questions the information below should be helpful in these cases if youre not new to xbox live gold just skip the rest of this review what the heck is xbox live gold  to any parents grandparents adults and gamers that dont know what xbox live gold is its basically an extra service that allows video game players to play with other players via the internet most of todays games are made to be enjoyed by playing them with and against other players online the days where you sit on the couch and play with 12 other people are pretty much gone the sad truth is to get the most of their video games xbox one and xbox 360 gamers need xbox live gold xbox live also allows players to access other features like online video etc but the main focus and benefit is online multiplayer gaming a word of caution parents adults guardians please monitor what your kids are doing just like you shouldnt turn your impressionable child loose on the internet without any supervision or guidance you shouldnt turn them loose on xbox live people can chat and interact with each other via xbox multiplayer games messages and more many games allow players to create their own emblems logos etc it should be no surprise that many people adults and children cant behave themselves online interactions on xbox live gold are largely out of the control of xbox and the game developers there are rules governing the actions of players online but for the most part things are on the honor system things are moderated to a certain extent but for the most part any disciplinary action is reactionary and comes long after violations of the xbox live terms of service for example if they receive enough complaints microsoftxbox will take action against anyone who is acting inappropriately unfortunately this action is typically taken long after your child has been exposed to language or images you didnt want them to be exposed to just know if your child plays online multiplayer games they will eventually hear adult language and sometimes worse if you arent comfortable with this do not let them use xbox live gold you can supervise your child change settings to reduce risks slightly but in the end you cant control what other players say or do read more comment 260 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse tamara  chris50 out of 5 stars digital code purchases are quick  easy june 7 2016subscription length 12 months format online game code verified purchase my family has had xbox live gold memberships for several years every time a membership is about to lapse i begin furiously looking for reduced price memberships the gold memberships allow you to play certain games with other members online and you also get a certain number of free downloadable games every month free games are always great even if they arent the best games having something new to play is a big hit at my house by purchasing the digital code you eliminate the need to waste gas driving to the store or waiting several days for a code to arrive in the mail i had my digital code in my amazon account within minutes i entered the code into my xbox live account and was playing with friends online a few minutes later comment 20 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abusepayton50 out of 5 stars great way to keep your credit card info safe june 8 2016subscription length 12 months format online game code verified purchase first off i dont like microsoft or any game service having my credit card info 1 after having to deal with the aftermath of someone breaking into my account and racking up 200 in charges to my card on file 2 microsoft automatically resubscribing if your card is on file which could be bad if you are low on money when your subscription expires i found it a huge pain dealing with microsoft when someone makes unauthorized purchases using your card on file i had to get my bank involved to get my money back since microsoft would barely do anything to resolve the issue so i really like that amazon has this service available i get an instant code for a live subscription seconds after checkout and piece of mind knowing microsoft doesnt have any of my card info trust me dont keep your card on file on your xbox its safer and saves you headache in the long run comment 14 people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse dmgenest 50 out of 5 stars foreign gold card microsoft xbox live 12 month gold membership november 22 2015subscription length 12 months format card verified purchase normally i would not review a membership card but this one bears a closer look literally not because it did not work on the contrary it worked perfectly it is because it is from or for another country i find that funny because on this web page it says this item is not eligible for international shipping simple irony except for the xbox logo name and the word gold on the face of the paper package most everything else that is in white and green is not in english there is a white overlay sticker on the section that has restrictions directions system requirements etc  also the added bar code sticker is in english the bar code and number were obscured by the reviewer i think it was important to mention since some of you may be getting them and may not want to use them for fear they wont work the card worked as promised on my sons old xbox 360 it has been about 4 days now and there have been no problems of any sort so you can take a peek at the photos ive uploaded for your own amusement and be 999 assured that your foreign xbox gold card will work in spite of the foreign language arent we just the bon vivant so 5 stars for the foreign gold card that worked as promised even if they promised in another language  update april 2016 absolutely no problems in the past few months of use read more comment
