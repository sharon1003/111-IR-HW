review polaroid xs100 hd action camera december 18 2014 by giovanni considering polaroid’s photographic pedigree i had high expectations for their xs100 hd action cam once i received the review unit i expected it to be a formidable competitor to many of the current action cams on the market today as is usual i didn’t look for situations where i expected an action cam to shine i took the xs100 to one of my regular shoots a willie nelson concert and set it up back stage looking out onto the audience i use action cams on a regular basis at concerts to get unusual shots which would normally be distracting to the audience i also set it up on my car and drove around town a bit at different times of the day – another typical usage for action cams in my documentary work this allows me to test for shutter roll and low light  extreme light performance the details the xs100 includes a “professional sensor with lowlight performance” according to the marketing spec sheet my experience with the device is that the lowlight performance for a camera at this price point you can get one on amazon for 129 without wi fi and for 179 with wi fi as of this writing is acceptable but not earthshattering we will revisit this point later uniquely the xs100 vibrates to confirm functions when visual confirmation isn’t practical it also has a “gsensor” which controls auto rotation so the camera always knows “which end is up” – a great time saver in post it is also waterproof up to 30 feet the distortionfree ultra wide angle lens provides 170 degrees of coverage – you can see this in the sample video below while the xs100 ’s aerodynamic design and shockproof exterior minimizes wind noise this feature would not really factor into my usage since i typically only shoot brollsecond camera or have a separate audio person on my shoots however the single button record feature is easy and is always ready for action – which i liked a lot the camera allows for recording in 1080p 960p and 720p it also provides dual file recording with every hd video an additional smaller file is created for more efficient uploading and sharing this is useless in my opinion as it just creates an additional step in the workflow when you have to separate the small files from the hd files i’d rather polaroid just produce the high quality file and save the space on the card for more video other specs still

– distance8mfull helmet  handlebar mounts included andone year warranty while i’ve used just about every sports camera on the market rarely do i use them for action or sports footage i tend to put them on stages at concerts use them as broll cameras in documentaries take them out fishing and hunting when shooting tv shows put them on tour busses or capture timelapse by leaving around the city attached to road signs parking meters or railroad trussels running the risk of using the “gword” it’s difficult to complete a review of any action cam without comparing it to a go pro with that said – the polaroid xs100 hd beats the go pro in its price point flat out in performance and value one plus with the polaroid xs100 hd action cam is the allinone main power button design with a large main power button that is made so that one can easily find it by feeling for it to take photos and videos without actually being able to see it since i’m usually having to feel around in the dark on a riverbank or on a stage this one single design element is no small feature for me all other things being equal it would the the one defining element in me choosing the xs100 over another action camera in most situations low light is the action cams enemy the photo quality on the xs100 especially in low light is decent with both video and photo in bright light colors are vibrant and the video is detailed enough to be passable with other action cameras at its pricepoint but here’s the kicker – the xs100 hd is less than half the price of most other action cams on the market today and that my friends is the punchline here at less than 200 street for either model i haven’t seen another action cam which produces better video than the polaroid xs100 hd action cam oh and it’s waterproof out of the box did you get that this camera includes plenty of accessories like mounts for everything you could want a carrying case and a thin wrist strap one way they keep the cost down on the camera is by not including the micro sd card in the box that’s more than fair since they stock the cam with so many other accessories in the sample video for this review we used the mounts to attach the polaroid xs100 to a mic stand behind the drum kit on the stage no additional hardware needed we had a few different camera makes  models on stage at the concert shutter roll on the vehicle tests wasn’t any more or less pronounced than would be expected from any other action cam in this category that’s to say that it’s just a bad and all the other action cams i’ve every used i was pleased with the relatively low noise in the video from the nighttime drives and in particular with the nice rich gradients the sensor produced in the skyline during dusk we still haven’t made a final decision if the xs100 video will make it into the final edit i’ll keep you all posted on that in the end the polaroid xs100 hd action camera is easy to set up and when compared to the contour roam and the go pro hero the polaroid has better video in low light conditions and is easier to operate add to this the outofthebox waterproofing up to 30 feet and the big fat power button and there is no camera on the market that can compete with the polaroid xs100 hd action cam at this price giddyup filed under reviews tagged with giovanni polaroid video
