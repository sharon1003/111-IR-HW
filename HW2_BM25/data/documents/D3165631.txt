biometrics authentication and identification 2018 version française last updated 01 march 2018biometrics allows a person to be identified and authenticated based on a set of recognizable and verifiable data which are unique and specific to them biometric authentication is the process of comparing data for the persons characteristics to that persons biometric template in order to determine resemblance the reference model is first store in a database or a secure portable element like a smart card the data stored is then compared to the persons biometric data to be authenticated here it is the persons identity which is being verified in this mode the question being asked is are you indeed mr or mrs x biometric identification consists of determining the identity of a person the aim is to capture an item of biometric data from this person it can be a photo of their face a record of their voice or an image of their fingerprint this data is then compared to the biometric data of several other persons kept in a database in this mode the question is a simple one who are you to know more about our biometric technology and solutions visit our product pages biometrics trends faced with document fraud and identity theft with new threats such as terrorism or cybercrime and faced with the understandable changes in international regulations new technological solutions are gradually being implemented one of these technologies biometrics has quickly established itself as the most pertinent means of identifying and authenticating individuals in a reliable and fast way through the use of unique biological characteristics today many applications make use of this technology that which in the past was reserved for sensitive applications such as the security of military sites is now developing rapidly through applications in the public domain what is biometrics biometrics is the science of analyzing physical or behavioral characteristics specific to each individual in order to be able to authenticate their identity if we were to define biometry or biometrics in the most simple sense we would say the  measurement of the human body there are two categories of biometric technologies  physiological measurements they can be either morphological or biological these mainly consist of fingerprints the shape of the hand of the finger vein pattern the eye iris and retina and the shape of the face for morphological analyses for biological analyses dna blood saliva or urine may be used by medical teams and police forensics science of innovation  biometrics your browser

universitys growing department of forensic and investigative science in 2007 cogent systems – recently acquired by gemalto – began donating biometric software hardware and support services to the university leading to the creation of cogent systems laboratory located in oglebay hall the lab is equipped with a professional automated finger identification system afis 24 workstations for fingerpalm analysis 3 livescans for enrolling prints an integrated ballistics identification system ibis and a teaching station the systems are supported and upgraded from gemaltos nearby reston va office this ensures that the nations future forensic investigators are trained using the best technology and biometric algorithms available behavioral measurements the most common are voice recognition signature dynamics speed of movement of pen accelerations pressure exerted inclination keystroke dynamics the way objects are used gait the sound of steps gestures etc the different techniques used are the subject of ongoing research and development and of course are being constantly improved to see how behavioral biometrics is gaining momentum in banking visit our october 2017 web dossier however the different sorts of measurements do not all have the same level of reliability physiological measurements are usually considered to offer the benefit of remaining more stable throughout the life of an individual for example they are not as subject to the effects of stress in contrast to identification by behavioral measurement when was biometrics first invented biometrics addresses a longstanding concern to be able to prove ones identity irrefutably by making use of what makes one different going as far back as prehistoric times man already had a feeling that certain characteristics such as the trace of his finger were sufficient to identify him and he signed with his finger in the second century b c the chinese emperor tsin she was already authenticating certain seals with a fingerprint in the 19th century bertillon took the first steps in scientific policing he used measurements taken of certain anatomical characteristics to identify reoffending criminals a technique which often proved successful though without offering any real guarantee of reliability this budding use of biometrics was then somewhat forgotten only to be rediscovered by william james herschel a british officer to be used for an entirely different purpose having been put in charge of building roads in bengal he had his subcontractors sign contracts with their fingerprints an early form of biometric authentication and a sure way of being able to find them more easily if they defaulted…in the uk the metropolitan police started the use of biometrics for identification in 1901 in the us it was initiated by the new york police in 1902 and by the fbi in 1924 the french police started to intitiate the same process in late 1902 the measurement of unique patterns aka behavioral biometrics is not new either it goes back to the 1860s telegraph operators using morse code recognized each other by the way they would send dash and dot signals during world war ii allied forces used the same method to identify senders and authentication messages they received this is the basic principle of biometrics to identify a person based on certain unique characteristics biometrics is growing fast particularly in the field of identity documents it is generally combined with other security technologies such as smart cards identity and biometrics there are three possible ways of proving ones identityby means of something that you possess until now this was something that was relatively easy to do whether it was by using the key to ones vehicle a document a card or a badgeby means of something that you know a name a secret or a passwordby means of what you are your fingerprint your hand your face the use of biometrics has a number of benefits the leading one is the level of security and accuracy that it guarantees in contrast to passwords badges or documents biometric data cannot be forgotten exchanged or stolen and cannot be forged  according to calculations made by sir francis galton darwins cousin the probability of finding two similar fingerprints is one in 64 billion even with identical twins homozygotes it is in this sense that biometrics is inextricably linked to the question of identity what is biometrics used for these applications are predominantly introduced by national authorities as the biometric enrollment and management of a populations biomeric data call for a tightly regulated legal and technical framework law enforcement and biometrics law enforcement biometrics are refering to applications of biometric systems which support law enforcement agencies this category can include criminal id solutions such as automated fingerprint and palm print identification systems afis they process store search and retrieve fingerprint images and subject records today automated biometric identification systems abis can create and store biometric information that matches biometric templates for face finger and iris discover the work of forensic analysts in our video live face recognition  the ability to do face identification in a crowd in realtime or postevent  is also gaining interest for homeland security – in cities airports and at borders biometrics and border control the application which has been most widely deployed to date is the electronic passport epassport particularly with the second generation of such documents also known as biometric passports on which two fingerprints are stored in addition to a passport photo biometrics provides irrefutable evidence of the link between the document and its holder biometric authentication is done by comparing the fingerprint s read with the fingerprints in the passport microcontroller if both biometric data match authentication is confirmed identification if necessary is done with the biographic data in the chip and printed another advantage of this solution is that it speeds up border crossing through the use of scanners which use the principle of recognition by comparison of the face andor fingerprints in addition many countries have set up biometric infrastructures to control migration flows to and from their territories fingerprint scanners and cameras at border posts capture information that help identify travelers entering the country in a more precise and reliable way in some countries the same applies in consulates to visa applications and renewals data acquisition requires reliable equipment to ensure optimum capture of photos and fingerprints essential for precision during comparison and verification we describe in details two well known examples of such application the u s department of homeland securitys ident biometric system the largest of its kind in the world the european unions eurodac  serving 32 nations in europe biometrics for asylum seekershealthcare and subsidies other applications exist chiefly national identity cards widespread in european and middle east countries or in africa for id and health insurance programs such as in gabon with these biometric id cards fingerprints are used to confirm the identity of the bearer of the card before he or she is given access to governmental services or healthcare why is it so in gabon for example even before the program started it was clear to everyone that all resources should be implemented to avoid the health cover program turning into a center of attention for the citizens of neighboring countries and to ensure that the generosity of the program would not lead to its collapse through the fraudulent use of rights hence beneficiaries are individually identified so that access to care can be reserved for them it has been decided that the identification of insured parties will be nominative with the implementation of a gabonese individual health insurance number civil data a photograph of the holder and two fingerprints are digitized within the microprocessor ensuring encryption and protection of this data the health insurance card is used in hospitals pharmacies and clinics to check social security rights whilst protecting the confidentiality of personal data checks are performed using terminals with fingerprint sensors civil identity population registration and voter registration afis databases automated fingerprint identification system often linked to a civil register database ensure the identity and uniqueness of the citizen in relation to the rest of the population in a reliable fast and automated way they can combine digital fingerprints a photo and an iris scan for greater reliability civil identity and population registration india’s aadhaar project is emblematic of biometric registration it is by far the worlds largest biometric identification system and the cornerstone of strong identification and authentication in india aadhaar number is a 12digit unique identity number issued to all indian residents this number is based on their biographic and biometric data a photograph ten fingerprints two iris scans12b people have an aadhaar number as of march 2108 covering more that 99 of the indian adult population initially the project has been linked to public subsidy and unemployment benefit schemes but it now includes a payment scheme according to finance minister arun jaitley in his speech of 1 february 2018 aahaar is providing an identity to every indian has made many services more accessible to the people it has reduced corruption cost of delivery of public services and middlemen financial inclusion is expected to be a key application of aadhaar authentication with aadhaar pay a new payment scheme announced in 2017 voter registration biometrics can also be key for the one person one vote principle to know more on this aspect please visit our web dossier on biometric voter registration  biometric technologies combining security and comfort biometrics offers a broad range of techniques and can be used in a wide variety of different domains ranging from state security to the comfort of individuals these technologies are mainly used in the sectors of forensic identification identity management as well as for biometric access control both in private and public institutions the effectiveness of this technology is closely linked to the use of data processing data is stored in files to enable rapid and reliable identification which in turn guarantees both comfort and security the most wellknown techniques include fingerprints face recognition iris palm and dnabased recognition research is currently opening the way for new types of biometrics such as ear shape or facial thermography whatever the method what all these biometric techniques have in common is that they all collect characteristics which areuniversal as they can be found in all individualsunique as they make it possible to differentiate one individual from anotherpermanent allowing for change over timerecordable as the characteristics of an individual cannot be collected without their consentmeasurable allowing for future comparisonand forgeryproof to increase security and accuracy multimodal biometrics combines several biometric sources multimodal biometric systems usually require two biometric credentials for positive identification such as face and fingerprints instead of one they are able to overcome limitations commonly encountered in unimodal systems the challenge to be met the justice system for example which must take the necessary time to identify a criminal and cannot accept the slightest error will not be worried by a long and costly process an everyday individual will seek to protect their own personal property and have access to it easily at a reasonable price governments and public administrations are in their case confronted with multiple issues at once making it easier to cross borders while controlling illegal immigration fighting terrorism cybercrime or electoral fraud issuing documents compliant with new international standards and regulations guaranteeing the security of systems for the production issuing and checking of such documents and data interoperability within the limits of their budgets on this scale only an innovative approach to global security which make use of technological solutions and process which are adapted to the challenges to be met can enable states to effectively address the issues they face and provide them with the means of building trust the reliability of biometrics biometric authentication relies on statistical algorithms it therefore cannot be 100 reliable when used alone false rejections or false acceptanceswhats the story here in one case the machine fails to recognize an item of biometric data that does however correspond to the person in the reverse case it assimilates two items of biometric data that are not in fact from the same person false rejection or false acceptance are symptoms which occur with all techniques used in biometrics multimodal biometrics for a number of years now the use of several biometrics in combination for example the face and the iris or the iris and fingerprints has made it possible to reduce error rates considerably but this reliability depends on the acquisition tools and algorithms used being of good quality though this solution may appear attractive in principle identification requires the implementation of a centralized server with a particularly secure architecture how accurate is biometrics whats the problem why would biometrics not be accurate think about this one minute again the technical challenges of automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral characteristics are inherent in to the transformation of analog facial image fingerprint voice pattern to digital information patterns minutiae that can then be processed and comparedmatched with effective algorithms fingerprints there are about 30 minutiae specific points in a fingerprint scan obtained by a live fingerprint reader the us federal bureau of investigation fbi has evidenced that no two individuals can have more than 8 common minutiae recognition decisions in biometric systems have to be taken in real time and therefore computing efficiency is key in biometric apps it is not the case in biometric forensics where realtime recognition is not a requirement facial recognition facial recognition is the most natural means of biometric identification the face recognition system does not require any contact with the person the 1000 million electronic passports in circulation in mid 2017 provide a huge opportunity to implement face recognition at international borders guidelines to improve the quality of the reference picture embedded in the epassport microchip are provided by the isoiec 197945 standard and used by the international civil aviation organization 9303 standard for passport photographs according to the keesing journal of documents  identity march 2017  2 complementary topics have been identified by standardization groups make sure the captured image has been done from a person and not from a mask a photograph or a video screen liveliness check or liveness detection  make sure that facial images morphed portraits or two or more individuals have not been joined into a reference document such as a passport the risks of error are related to very different factors take the example of a person with their biometric characteristics we have noted that particular biometric techniques were more or less well suited to certain categories of persons the difficulties are related to ergonomic factors of which we do not yet have a firm grasp or understanding a certain system may work for women but less well for men or for young people but not for older people for people with lighter skin but less well for those with darker skin other difficulties arise in particular with facial recognition when the person dyes or cuts their hair changes the line of their eyebrows or grows a beard we can imagine cases of false acceptance when the photo taken modifies distinctive character traits in such a way that they match another item of biometric data stored in the database other errors are also possible depending on the technologies used during the biometric enrollment phase a verification photo taken with a lowquality model of camera can noticeably increase the risk of error the accuracy of the identification relies entirely on the reliability of the equipment used to capture data the risk of error also varies depending on the environment and the conditions of application the light may differ from one place to another and the same goes for the intensity or nature of background noise the persons position may have changed in the laboratory under perfect conditions in a controlled environment and using adapted technologies the rate of error in detection of a face varies between 5 and 10  in addition in a biometric control application the rejection or acceptance rate are intertwined and can be tuned according to an acceptable level of risk it is not possible to modify one without impact the other one think about it in the case of a nuclear plant access control application the rate of false acceptance will be extremely reduced you dont want anyone to enter by chance this will also impact the rate of false rejections because you will tune the system to be extremely accurate you will probably use several authentication factors including a valid id in addtional to biometrics single mode or multimodal tokens and smart biometric id cards biometrics suffers from the fact that the matching algorithms cannot be compared to the hashes of passwords as we said this means that two biometric measures cannot be compared with each other without them at some point being in plaintext in the memory of the device doing the matching biometric checks must therefore be carried out on a trusted device which means the alternatives are to have a centralized and supervised server a trusted terminal or a personal security component smart id cards this is why tokens and smart cards ids or banking cards now are increasingly used as the ideal companions for a biometric system numerous national identity cards  portugal ecuador south africa mongolia algeria etc now incorporate digital security features which are based on the  matchoncard  fingerprint matching algorithm unlike conventional biometric processes the matchoncard algorithm allows fingerprints to be matched locally with a reference frame thanks to a microprocessor built into the biometric id card and without having to connect to a central biometric database 11 matching biometric sensor cards another form of delivering a safe and convenient way to authenticate people has been enabled with the integration of fingerprint scanner into smart cards these biometric sensor cards open up a new dimension in identification with an easytouse portable and secure device they are being launched in 2018 for the first time by bank of cyprus and gemalto for emv contactless and contact payment they use fingerprint recognition instead of a pin code to authenticate the cardholder theres more the cards can also be tailored to support access physical or online identity verification services as users biometric data is stored on the card not on a central database customer details are highly protected if the bank was to suffer a cyberattack likewise if the card was to become lost or stolen the holders fingerprint could not be replicated put it in another way the biometric identifiers are checked locally and protected as they are stored solely on the card they never leave the card biometrics and information security biometrics can fulfill two distinct functions authentication and identification identification answers the question who are you in this case the person is identified as one among a group of others 1 n matching the personal data of the person to be identified are compared with the data of other persons stored in the same database or possibly other linked databases authentication answers the question are you really who you say you are in this case biometrics allows the identity of a person to be certified by comparing the data that they provide with prerecorded data for the person they claim to be 11 matching these two techniques solutions call upon different techniques identification in general requires a centralized database which allows the biometric data of several persons to be compared authentication can do without such a centralized database the data can simply be stored on a decentralized device such as one of our smart cards for the purposes of data protection a process of authentication with a decentralized device is to be preferred such a process involves less risk the token id card military card health card is kept in the users personal possession and their data does not have to be stored in any database conversely if an identification process requiring an external database is used the user does not have physical control over their data with all the risks which that involves why are biometrics controversial biometrics offer many advantages to strongly authenticate and identify but is not without controversy this is linked to privacy and citizens ability to really control information about himherself2 types of risks can be identified the use of biometric data to other ends than those agreed by the citizen either by service providers or fraudsters as soon as biometric data is in the possession of a third party there is always a risk that such data may be used for purposes different to those to which the person concerned has given their consent there may thus be cases of unwanted end use if such data is interconnected with other files or if it is used for types of processing other than those for which it was initially intended the risk on the biometric database and data presented for biometric check the data can be captured during their transmission to the central database and fraudulently replicated in another transaction the result is a person losing control over their own data which poses major risks in terms of privacy in practice data protection authorities seem to give preference to solutions which feature decentralized data devices for gemalto whether it is a matter of biometrics or not the identity of a person provided by their country should be under hisher control want to see how biometric data are protected around the world biometrics and data protection while there are hardly any legal provisions in the world that are specific to biometric data despite the very specific character of such data the french data protection act of 1978 officially entitled the  loi relative à linformatique aux fichiers et aux libertés  english title act on information technology data files and civil liberties sets out specific requirements for biometric data the united nations resolution of december 14 1990 which sets out guidelines for the regulation of computerized personal data files does not have any binding force on the contrary the new eu regulation will replace the existing national laws as of may 2018 can this really be true yes on april 14 2016 the draft general data protection regulation was adopted by the european parliament its provisions will be directly applicable in all 27 member states of the european union and the uk in may 2018 and biometric data are clearly defined it will then replace the directive dating from 1995 in a nutshell it establishes a harmonized framework within the eu the right to be forgotten clear and affirmative consent and amongst other things serious penalties for failure to comply with these rules on a more global basis legal deliberations thus rely to a very large extent on provisions relating to personal data in the broad sense but such provisions sometimes prove to be poorly adapted to biometrics finally it should be pointed out that outside the european union the level of protection differs depending on the legislation in force assuming – that is – that there is any such legislation another example is the united states where 3 states illinois washington and texas clearly protect biometric data and 47 dont to know more about biometric data protection in the eu and uk gdpr in the united states and recent changes in india read our dossier dedicated to privacy regulations and biometric data putting biometrics to work for digital security gemalto possesses its own technology recognized worldwide which combined with its impartial stance on the source of biometric data allows it to help everyone put their trust in the digital world an expert in strong identification with more than 200 civil id population registration and law enforcement projects that incorporate biometrics gemalto is able to act as an independent force in proposing and recommending the most suitable solution in each case gemalto attaches a great deal of importance to the assessment of risks which may not always be visible to the general public and to the capacity of private operators to manage such risks similarly the legal and social implications are also very important though gemalto keeps an open mind with regard to biometric techniques it remains no less convinced
