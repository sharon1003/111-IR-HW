court and the countys department of children and family services to regularly assist mexican nationals in dependency proceedings court and county officials welcomed the help even giving the consulate space for a desk at the edelman childrens court in monterey park ted myers chief deputy director of the family services department said having consular representatives on site helps parents who are often in shock after having their children taken away understand and maneuver through the dependency court system its great having them there and being able to connect parents to the services right away he said it vastly increases the probability of them following through and keeping appointments in march michael nash the presiding judge in juvenile court and juan marcos gutierrezgonzalez the

counseling and take anger management domestic violence and parenting classes galvan who works part time at a garment factory said she was grateful to find a free course because she already had to spend more than 100 a week on the other courses during the 12week parenting class at the consulate galvan said she learned how to talk to her children at their level and how to control herself when they misbehave galvan has visits with her children every week and said she believes she is on track to get them back by the end of the year nash said the court has had a relationship with the mexican consulate in the past with the government occasionally helping to find and evaluate relatives south of the border but there wasnt regular contact until this year nash said the classes are especially valuable because many parents cannot find affordable programs thus delaying family reunification in todays economy    to have the mexican government come in and offer these services is truly a bonus he said adding that he hoped the services would help the families get out from under our system susana preciado a social worker who teaches the course said she gears the classes to mexican natives talking about legal and cultural differences between the two countries parents who come here often dont know what is and isnt acceptable she said they have very basic knowledge about the laws in the united states she said they kind of need guidance during a recent class preciado gave the group of nearly 20 parents a series of tips treat your children as you would want others to treat them know your child choose your battles be consistent use the same rules at home and in public she said if they cant do it at home they cant do it anywhere her assistant jose carlos chimed in remember children
