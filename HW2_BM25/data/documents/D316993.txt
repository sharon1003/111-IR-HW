0let’s face it bigotry within the ranks of the development community is rampant java developers look down on  net stalwarts and vice versa surprisingly i’ve noticed the same behavior with sql structured query language many developers view sql as an afterthought—a relatively easy syntax for accessing data these novices usually access relational data by way of open database connectivity odbc java database connectivity jdbc or a native driver they are blind to the power of sql yes sql is a language as the sql acronym pronounces it is a language it offers looping logic directives variables and so on now it’s not a language in the same sense as say java or c sql is considered a fourthgeneration language 4gl whereas java and c are thirdgeneration languages 3gls fourthgeneration languages are programming languages that are closer to human language than highlevel languages like java these 4gls are often used to access databases such as sql where humanlike syntax is used to retrieve and manipulate data sql may not be a language on par with java or c but it is a language this is often a moot argument with visual basic or c developers they refute the claim by stating that sql is not compiled and offers little functionality compared to a 3gl the power of sql the best way to prove a point is by offering a concrete example the following sample sql illustrates the power and depth of sql if exists select  from tablename1 begin update tablename2 set fieldname  ‘value’ from tablename2 alias2 inner join tablename1 alias1 on alias2fieldname  alias1fieldname and alias2fieldname  alias1fieldname end else begin update tablename2 set fieldname  ‘value’ from tablename2 alias3 inner join tablename1 alias4 on alias3fieldname  alias4fieldname and alias3fieldname  alias4fieldname end else print ‘error’ this example was constructed on sql server it demonstrates a few points control flow ifelse control block beginend and boolean operators and—all elements of a programming language in addition it’s easy to incorporate variables you can reuse code in stored procedures and automate or schedule procedures using triggers many of these elements depend on the database platform  sql server oracle sybase informix db2 etc  but the core sql99 standard is often supported learn more about sqlsql allows easy access to that valuable data read these buildercom articles to learn more about this important standardmaster joins with these conceptssql basics query multiple tablesuse sql subselects to consolidate queriesdata is king data is the backbone of an enterprise it’s retrieved for reporting or viewing and new data is often added with the purging of older data sql provides the language to easily work with this valuable commodity the power afforded by sql should not be dismissed lightly i’d like to know your thoughts have you encountered similar sql bigotry please post your comments in the discussion below or send me an email i look forward to a lively discussion related topics big data analytics data centers digital transformation cloud0
