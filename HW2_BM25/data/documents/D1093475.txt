home » handmade baby bracelet june 4 2013 crafts handmade baby bracelet hello sweet c’s readers sarah here from craft quickies and bombshell bling jewelry and i am thrilled to be here once again to share a new project with you today i am going back to my artistic roots jewelry making my husband and i are each the oldest of three children since we are also fairly young that means we don’t have many nieces and nephews yet in fact we only have one nephew on my side and until just a few weeks ago we had no nieces or nephews at all on my husband’s side of the family but i am thrilled to announce that a few weeks ago my sisterinlaw had a little baby girl hooray for a niece well anyone who has ever been to my blog for even two seconds knows that i have a bit of a problem when it comes to baby headbands as in… i can’t stop making them true story so naturally when i found out a niece was on the way i knew that i wanted to make her a lovely headband for her baby blessing our church’s ceremony in lieu of a baby baptism or christening and then i had the idea to make her a matching tiny bracelet as well when my sisterinlaw got married i made her wedding jewelry including the bracelet shown in the picture below i realized that i still had leftover pearls and crystals from that bracelet and i thought it would be special to make my niece’s bracelet using those materials read along if you would like to learn how to do this yourself here are the supplies that you will need to make a lovely heirloomquality baby bracelet most of them can be bought at a large craft shop local beading store or online  4mm swarovski crystals  tiny freshwater pearls  a tiny sterling silver lobster clasp  fine gauge beading wire it is more flexible than the medium or heavy widths  two crimp tubes  a very very small amount of chain sterling silver if possible  a single headpin or eyepin sterling silver if possible  crimp pliers or flatnosed pliers miniature roundnosed pliers wire snips you can buy a package of these tools at a large craft store for very cheap  and then if you get excited about jewelry making you can upgrade to nicer tools later on measure baby’s wrist standard infant bracelets are about 3 12 inches long tiny right like insanely you will think it is too small but it just isn’t babies are tiny lay out your pearls and crystals in a way that you find attractive string your crystals and pearls onto the beading wire put one crimp tube on the end of your beading wire now put the wire through the clasp and then back through the crimp tube again as shown use your crimp pliers or your flatnosed pliers to seal the crimp tube for flatnosed pliers you just squeeze hard so it flattens for crimp pliers you first use the inner divet of the pliers to squeeze and then the outer one if you have them you will see what i mean now use your wire snips to snip off the extra beading wire repeat the same thing on the other end of the bracelet but loop the wire through the piece of chain rather than the clasp as shown above the reason i use a tiny length of chain on this side is so that the bracelet is adjustable in length this next part is optional at this point you can be finished if you would like however i like to add a little dangling crystal as a finishing detail place a tiny crystal on a headpin or eyepin use your roundnosed pliers to loop the headpin around you can see a detailed picture demonstration of that in this earring tutorial  and then stick it through the chain use your roundnosed pliers to grip the looped headpin so that is holds still as shown above grab the long end of the headpin with your flatnosed pliers and wrap the wire around the headpin a couple of times as shown below now use your wire snips to snip off that crazy long wire end voila you are finished wasn’t that easy it will look precious on any little princess be sure to hop over to my blog craft quickies to see how i made the elegant baby headband to coordinate
