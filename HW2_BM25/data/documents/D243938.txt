too good to be true right that’s the alluring sell behind the military diet a strict eating regimen that’s been sweeping the internet over the past few months the rules follow a rigid meal plan for three days then do four days of maintenance and watch as the pounds “melt away” by the end of the week related how to know if the ketogenic diet is right for you pinners bloggers and you tube vlogs are driving this trend forward with viral beforeandafter pictures showcasing impressive and often hard to believe changes devotees of the diet consume 1100 to 1400 calories a day in the form of socalled “fatburning” food combinations like hot dogs and bananas and tuna and toast yes we said hot dogs it’s a onesizefitsall plan so athletic men and women are going to dine on the same grub as their more sedentary peers but is this really a healthy way to lose weight we got to the bottom of this muchtalkedabout plan what the military diet is all about no shocker here it turns out that the military diet isn’t quite the unique weight loss solution it’s made out to be “this diet concept has been dressed up differently and brought out to dance before” says kimberly gomer r d director of nutrition at pritikin longevity center in other words a restrictive threeday plan is nothing new in the health industry plus the diet’s affiliation with the actual u s army seems to be just a gimmick fun fact the cleveland clinic diet british heart foundation diet mayo clinic diet and navy diet aren’t linked to those institutions either so don’t judge a book — or a diet — by its cover related can the paleo diet improve your health according to websites dedicated to the meal plan the threeday military diet prescribes the following meal plan military diet day one to get started you’ll prep a half grapefruit slice of toast scoop of peanut butter and some coffee for breakfast and for lunch it’s tuna toast and more coffee or caffeinated tea on the dinner menu three ounces of meat a cup of green beans half a banana a small apple and yup a cup of vanilla ice cream photo twenty20military diet day two this is where things get especially…interesting for breakfast you’ll have an egg a slice of toast and half a banana for lunch another hardboiled egg some saltines and a cup of cottage cheese then for dinner have those hot dogs handy you’ll eat two mystery tubes plus some fruits and veggies finished off with more vanilla ice cream photo twenty20military diet day three on the last day of the diet you’ll cut calories down to approximately 1100 in the following breakdown for breakfast five saltines an ounce of cheddar cheese and a small apple up next just one egg and slice of toast for lunch then for the grand finale a cup of tuna half of a banana and one last cup of vanilla ice cream photo twenty20then what once you complete the threeday diet you’re supposed to eat and exercise normally for the next four days “what i found interesting is that this diet allows for almost 1500 calories which is a pretty normal weight management diet” says gomer “it’s not a crazy 800calorie crash diet” but its promises aren’t all they appear to be photo marjonellaurea threeday diet crazy or legit one of the central claims of the military diet is that your meals are arranged in “fatburning” food combinations however “there’s no science behind it” says gomer you may still lose weight if the calories you’re consuming are less than the calories you’re burning off throughout your day but nothing about pairing grapefruit with peanut butter toast will necessarily help you slim your waistline more than another combination of similarly caloric foods gomer says the military diet’s focus on small quantities of highfat food might leave you feeling hungry too “this is allowing a very little bit of rich food” explains gomer noting that you’ll still feel hungry despite indulging in ice cream each night “it makes me frustrated because i could give people six times the amount of food for the same amount of calories” says gomer related to sip or not to sip the benefits of bone broth you’d be better off focusing on filling lowdensity foods such as fruits and vegetables which have a lot of water and fiber gomer notes plus the diet is also lacking in whole grains which can reduce your risk of many chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease and help with weight maintenance so we hate to break it to you but devouring hot dogs and ice cream probably won’t be your ticket to sustainable and healthy weight loss “the idea that there’s something magical in a certain diet that’s the american dream” says gomer the military diet isn’t sustainable she says “you’ll get hungry and grouchy and you break your diet and then you’re looking for the next miracle”it might be time to get off the diet rollercoaster and leave the miracles to disney originally published october 2015 updated january 2017 share 18k pin 577 email24k
