rare exceptions is always fatal it is spread through bites or scratches from infected animals the virus infects the brain causing an animal to exhibit unusual often aggressive behavior the rabies virus is present in the saliva of the infected animal and is spread when the saliva gets into a bite or scratch the risk of getting rabies is greater if a person is bitten multiple times or if the bites are close to or on the head in developing countries 90 percent or more of rabies cases in humans are caused by dog bites in the united states rabies in dogs has been largely eliminated as a result of animal vaccination and control wild bats now pose the greatest risk for rabies to humans in north america although rabies in raccoons skunks and foxes pose the greatest risk to domestic animals this topic discusses strategies to prevent rabies after being bitten or exposed to an infected animal or an animal suspected of having rabies animal bites are discussed in a separate article see patient education animal and human bites beyond the basics  postbite rabies preventionrabies infection can be prevented even after a bite or a scratch from an infected animal occurs rabies vaccine and immune globulin — a series of injections including rabies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin rig can prevent rabies even if the virus enters the body this preventive strategy is called postexposure prophylaxis rig contains antibodies against the rabies virus and provides immediate protection against rabies infection whereas the rabies vaccine provides protection within approximately two weeks side effects of rabies vaccine and rig can include discomfort at the injection site similar to a flu shot lowgrade fever and mild muscle aches if needed rabies postexposure prophylaxis is safe to give to children and pregnant women who need postexposure prophylaxis wounds should be washed with soap and lots of water and may be rinsed with an antiseptic this will reduce the risk of the rabies virus entering the body see rabies immune globulin and vaccine  when is rabies prophylaxis needed — certain information is needed to determine if postexposure rabies prophylaxis is needed this includes● whether the person was bitten or scratched and the location of the wounds● the type of animal involved  table 1● whether the exposure was provoked or unprovoked animals with rabies are more likely to attack even when not provoked● whether the animal was previously vaccinated against rabies● the likely presence of rabies infection in that animal species in the region● the availability of the animal for testing or observation immediate treatment recommended — a person with a high risk exposure to an animal that is or may be infected with rabies virus should be given immediate postexposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine and rig if the animal is not available for observation or testing and is determined to be at high risk for having rabies most experts recommend postbite rabies prophylaxis because of the risk for developing a fatal illness see when to use rabies prophylaxis  if postexposure prophylaxis is needed● the rabies vaccine should be given as soon as possible first dose considered day zero for the immunization schedule the rabies vaccine is given into a muscle usually in the upper arm the rabies vaccine is given again on the third seventh and fourteenth day after the exposure a fifth dose of rabies vaccine was previously recommended for routine use but experts now agree that this is not necessary unless an individual has a medical condition that might interfere with their ability to respond to the vaccine eg immune compromise● one dose of rig is also given on day zero as much of the rig dose as possible is injected into and around the wound s some people have received rabies prophylaxis before exposure eg veterinarians veterinary technicians animal control officers people visiting places of higher risk for rabies exposure these persons only require two doses of rabies vaccine after exposure on days zero and three no rig is necessary for people who have previously received the rabies vaccine defer treatment during observation period — if the animal is a healthy pet such as a dog cat or ferret and the animal is available for observation rabies prophylaxis can be delayed while the animal is observed in a secure facility such as a veterinary clinic for 10 days a rabid animal will usually succumb to rabies within five to six days of having the rabies virus in its saliva if the animal develops signs of rabies postbite rabies vaccine and immune globulin should be started immediately see rabies vaccine and immune globulin above if the animal remains healthy during the 10day observation then the animal did not have rabies virus in its saliva at the time of exposure and the bite victim does not need vaccine or immune globulin indirect exposure — many people receive postexposure prophylaxis in circumstances of indirect exposure for example if a pet dog gets into a fight with a rabid or potentially rabid wild animal the owner will frequently comfort their pet immediately if there is infectious saliva from the attacking animal on the pet and this saliva gets into a break in the owners skin other open wound eye nose or mouth there is a theoretical risk for rabies however there have never been any reports of a human rabies resulting from this type of exposure for the virus to be infectious and for any theoretical risk to exist the person must be exposed to wet saliva from the rabid animal the need for postexposure prophylaxis in cases of indirect exposure should be discussed with a public health official in the united states further information is available from the centers for disease control and prevention  wwwcdcgovrabies  rabies and travelrabies is still quite common in many developing countries when traveling to countries where rabies is more common you should avoid approaching and touching all wild and domestic animals if you are bitten or scratched you should wash the area immediately and seek expert advice about the need for postexposure prophylaxis in developing countries the availability and type of rabies vaccine and immune globulin varies considerably if a person has a high risk exposure to rabies he or she should consult with a reliable source of information and care preexposure rabies vaccination may be recommended if you are traveling to a developing country and might be living in conditions where exposure to rabid and potentially rabid animals is possible the decision to have preexposure rabies vaccination should be discussed with a health care provider who is knowledgeable about travel medicine eg an infectious disease physician it is important to know that having preexposure rabies vaccination does not eliminate the need for additional vaccination if you are bitten if you have had the rabies vaccine previously and are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal you need two doses of rabies vaccine on days zero and three no rabies immune globulin is needed see patient education vaccines for travel the basics  advice regarding specific animals and rabiescontact with wild and unfamiliar domestic animals should always be avoided wild animals should not be kept as pets and should never be handled by people who are not properly trained and vaccinated domestic animals — in the united states dogs cats or ferrets that have received rabies vaccination are unlikely to be infected with rabies the number of rabies cases among domestic animals such as dogs and cats declined markedly in the united states in the 1930 and 40s due to rabies vaccination while vaccinated animals present little risk domestic animals must be uptodate on rabies booster vaccination to assure their protection rabies booster vaccines are given every one to four years depending upon the vaccine used the likelihood of rabies in domestic animals is small and varies by region in the united states rabies is most often reported in dogs along the united statesmexico border and in cats in areas of rabid raccoon activity however sporadic cases of rabies develop in domestic animals outside of these areas domestic animals that have been imported from areas of the world where rabies is more common have occasionally developed rabies after arrival these animals can be a threat to humans and other animals wild animals — bites from wild animals are considered to carry a risk of rabies unless proven otherwise by testing postexposure prophylaxis should be given immediately to anyone who is bitten or scratched unless the animal is caught and tested promptly in the united states raccoons skunks foxes bats and coyotes are the most commonly infected species among large rodents rabies has been reported in woodchucks and beavers in areas where raccoon rabies is common small rodents such as squirrels chipmunks rats hamsters gerbils guinea pigs mice and lagomorphs such as rabbits are almost never found to be rabid and there has never been a reported case of rabies transmission to a human from one of these animals these animals are capable of developing rabies although this is unlikely because small animals are usually killed or severely injured during an initial attack by a rabid animal pet rabbits and rodents that are caged outdoors are at risk for exposure to rabid wild animals the pet could survive the exposure and could potentially develop rabies decisions about postexposure prophylaxis for people bitten by such animals must be made depending upon the individual situation livestock — among all types of domestic livestock rabies is most likely to occur in cows horses goats and other livestock species are rarely affected anyone who is bitten by potentially rabid livestock should be managed individually in consultation with local public health authorities bats — rabies occurs in many species of bats among 53 reported cases of human rabies in the us between 1990 and 2011 due to animal exposure 46 cases 87 percent were caused by a bat strain of rabies in many instances a history of bat exposure could not be obtained from very ill cases and the bat strain of rabies virus was identified as the cause of infection through genetic analysis anyone who is bitten or scratched by a bat should receive postexposure prophylaxis unless the bat can be collected and tests negative for rabies however under certain circumstances bats can bite and transmit rabies without the victim being aware of the bite as a result the following precautions are recommended● postexposure prophylaxis is recommended if a person has direct physical contact with a bat unless the exposed individual is certain that there was no bite or scratch or the bat was tested and found not to be rabid if there is any uncertainty about possible contact eg person sleeping in room with bat present advice should be sought from the local health department● bats should never be kept as pets and should not be picked up or handled by anyone except those who are trained and have received rabies vaccination if a bat is found in a home avoid touching it if no person or pet was exposed to the bat if possible it should be allowed to escape outdoors if it is not feasible to allow the bat to escape advice about safely capturing the bat is available at httpwwwcdcgovrabiesbatscontactcapturehtml individuals can also contact their local health department with questions about assessing a potential rabies exposure andor testing captured bats testing animals for rabies — public health laboratories offer testing of animals for rabies thus the local health department should be consulted when a human or domestic animal is exposed to a possibly rabid animal and that animal is available for testing summary● postexposure rabies prophylaxis with both vaccine and rabies immune globulin is recommended immediately if a biting or scratching animal has rabies or is suspected to have rabies anyone who is bitten or scratched by a bat should always receive postexposure prophylaxis unless the bat can be collected and tested for rabies● if a biting or scratching dog cat or ferret is healthy and available for observation it should be observed for 10 days if the animal remains healthy during the 10day observation then the bite victim was not exposed to rabies and does not need rabies vaccine or rabies immune globulin if the animal develops signs of rabies during the 10 days the exposed person should receive rabies vaccine and immune globulin immediately there is no recommendation for a 10day observation of other animals because of lack of data about virus in the saliva● postexposure prophylaxis may be needed immediately if a bite from a high risk animal involves the head or neck if the animal is not rabid as determined by either testing or observation the regimen can be discontinued● if the animal is not available for observation and it is determined to present a risk for rabies most health care providers recommend postexposure rabies prophylaxis because of the risk of serious illness caused by rabies
