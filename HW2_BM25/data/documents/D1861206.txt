the state of north carolina the state legislature established general statute 5878514b which requires the state fire and rescue commission to establish voluntary minimum professional qualifications for all levels of fire and rescue service personnel the standard for firefighter certification is considered to be a minimum standard and the fire  rescue commission fully recognizes that due to differing requirements many fire departments may set forth standards much higher than these for their personnel it is the intent however that through a voluntary program personnel who provide firefighting services to the communities of our state will meet or exceed this standard performance standard the nfpa 1001 standard for firefighter professional qualifications current edition will be the performance standard used for firefighter certification entrance requirements the firefighter candidate must meet the entrance requirements listed below before certification can be issued age  education requirements the candidate must be at least 18 years of age training and course work may be completed in advance but certification cannot be issued until the candidateâ€™s 18th birthday moreover the candidate must meet the requirements of the standard in place at the time of hisher birthday even though heshe may have been working toward a previous standard the candidate must have a high school diploma or equivalent recognized by the state department of public instruction ie ged this requirement may be waived for an individual who completed certification objectives prior to october 1 1990 physical recommendations the candidate should undergo a thorough physical examination prior to any activity to ensure hisher ability to perform the required tasks this examination should be conducted by a qualified physician or recognized medical practitioner using a recommended medical standard such as nfpa 1582 standard for medical requirements for fire service personnel
