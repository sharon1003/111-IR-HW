daniel murrell mdtypes preparation procedure risks and side effects recovery endoscopy is the insertion of a long thin tube directly into the body to observe an internal organ or tissue in detail it can also be used to carry out other tasks including imaging and minor surgery endoscopes are minimally invasive and can be inserted into the openings of the body such as the mouth or anus alternatively they can be inserted into small incisions for instance in the knee or abdomen surgery completed through a small incision and assisted with special instruments such as the endoscope is called keyhole surgery because modern endoscopy has relatively few risks delivers detailed images and is quick to carry out it has proven incredibly useful in many areas of medicine today tens of millions of endoscopies are carried out each year in this article we will explain some of the types of endoscopy why and how they are performed the general procedure and any potential risks fast facts on endoscopy here are some key points about endoscopy more detail and supporting information is in the main article endoscopies are quick and relatively safe procedures the first endoscope was designed in 1806 the main reasons for endoscopy are investigation confirmation and treatment endoscopy can be used to remove tumors or polyps from the digestive tract types endoscopy can be useful in a wide array of medical situations endoscopy is useful for investigating many systems within the human body these areas include gastrointestinal tract esophagus stomach and duodenum esophagogastroduodenoscopy small intestine enteroscopy large intestinecolon colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy bile duct rectum rectoscopy and anus anoscopy respiratory tract nose rhinoscopy lower respiratory tract bronchoscopy ear otoscopy urinary tract cystoscopy female reproductive tract gynoscopy cervix colposcopy uterus hysteroscopy fallopian tubes falloposcopy through a small incision abdominal or pelvic cavity laparoscopy interior of a joint arthroscopy organs of the chest thoracoscopy and mediastinoscopy what is a capsule endoscopy capsule endoscopy was developed in the mid1990s and involves a wireless camera the camera is small enough to fit into a capsule roughly the size of a vitamin tablet and can therefore be swallowed as the capsule travels through the digestive tract it takes thousands of pictures which are transmitted to a device attached to a wearable belt capsule endoscopy is used to image the small intestine a region that is difficult to image using standard endoscopy it is also very useful for examining the small intestinal mucosa and diagnosing crohns disease the capsule usually passes through the digestive system within 2448 hours this is a relatively new technique and was given fda approval for use in the united states in 2001 to date more than 500000 capsule endoscopy procedures have been carried out and nearly 1000 articles have been published covering its clinical use preparation advice will be provided by a doctor on how to prepare for an endoscopy as different procedures will have different requirements the procedure does not require an overnight stay in the hospital and usually only takes around 1 hour to complete the doctor will provide instructions about the preparation for the procedure for many types of endoscopy the individual needs to fast for around 12 hours though this varies based on the type for procedures investigating the gut laxatives may be taken the night before to clear the system a doctor will carry out an examination before the endoscopy it is important to mention all current medications including supplements and any previous procedures biopsy what you need to know an endoscopy can be used to take a biopsy read now procedure the procedure will depend to some extent on the reason for the endoscopy there are three main reasons for carrying out an endoscopy investigation if an individual is experiencing vomiting abdominal pain breathing disorders stomach ulcers difficulty swallowing or gastrointestinal bleeding for example an endoscope can be used to search for a cause confirmation of a diagnosis endoscopy can be used to carry out a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of cancer or other diseases treatment an endoscope can be used to treat an illness directly for instance endoscopy can be used to cauterize seal using heat a bleeding vessel or remove a polyp sometimes endoscopy will be combined with another procedure such as an ultrasound scan it can be used to place the ultrasound probe close to organs that can be difficult to image such as the pancreas modern endoscopes are sometimes fitted with sensitive lights that use narrow band imaging this type of imaging uses specific blue and green wavelengths that allow the doctor to spot precancerous conditions more easily an endoscopy is typically performed while the patient is conscious although sometimes the patient will receive local anesthetic commonly an anesthetic spray to the back of the throat often the patient is sedated for endoscopy procedures involving entry through the mouth a mouth guard will be used to protect the teeth and lips as the tube is inserted endoscope use in surgery endoscopes used in surgery help minimize bleeding and recovery times endoscopy has advanced in recent years enabling some forms of surgery to be conducted using a modified endoscope this makes the surgery less invasive procedures such as the removal of the gallbladder sealing and tying the fallopian tubes and the removal of small tumors from the digestive system or lungs are now commonplace a laparoscope is a modified endoscope used for keyhole surgery also referred to as laparoscopic surgery laparoscopic surgery requires only a small incision and can be used for appendectomies removal of the appendix hysterectomies removal of the uterus and prostatectomies removal of prostate tissue using this technique patients lose less blood during and after surgery and can recover much faster compared with standard surgical procedures risks and side effects endoscopy is a relatively safe procedure but there are certain risks involved risks depend on the area that is being examined risks of endoscopy may includeoversedation although sedation is not always necessaryfeeling bloated for a short time after the proceduremild crampinga numb throat for a few hours due to the use of local anestheticinfection of the area of investigation this most commonly occurs when additional procedures are carried out at the same time the infections are normally minor and treatable with a course of antibioticspersistent pain in the area of the endoscopyperforation or tear of the lining of the stomach or esophagus occurs in 1 in every 250011000 casesinternal bleeding usually minor and sometimes treatable by endoscopic cauterizationcomplications related to preexisting conditions any of the following symptoms should be reported to a doctordark colored stoolshortness of breathsevere and persistent abdominal painchest painvomiting blood recovery recovery will depend on the type of procedure for an upper endoscopy which is used to enable a doctor to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract the patient will be observed for some time after the procedure usually around one hour while any sedative medication wears off the person should not usually work or drive for the rest of the day because of the sedative effect of the medication used to prevent the pain there may be some soreness with this type of endoscopy there may be bloating and a sore throat but these usually resolve quickly related coverage endoscopy complications more common than previously estimated ushospital visits to deal with complications
