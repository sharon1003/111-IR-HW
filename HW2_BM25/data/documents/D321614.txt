who were the vikings contrary to some popular conceptions of the vikings they were not a “race” linked by ties of common ancestry or patriotism and could not be defined by any particular sense of “vikingness” most of the vikings whose activities are best known come from the areas now known as denmark norway and sweden though there are mentions in historical records of finnish estonian and saami vikings as well their common ground–and what made them different from the european peoples they confronted–was that they came from a foreign land they were not “civilized” in the local understanding of the word and–most importantly–they were not christian did you know the name viking came from the scandinavians themselves from the old norse word vik bay or creek which formed the root of vikingr pirate the exact reasons for vikings venturing out from their homeland are uncertain some have suggested it was due to overpopulation of their homeland but the earliest vikings were looking for riches not land in the eighth century a d europe was growing richer fueling the growth of trading centers such as dorestad and quentovic on the continent and hamwic now southampton london ipswich and york in england scandinavian furs were highly prized in the new trading markets from their trade with the europeans scandinavians learned about new sailing technology as well as about the growing wealth and accompanying inner conflicts between european kingdoms the viking predecessors–pirates who preyed on merchant ships in the baltic sea–would use this knowledge to expand their fortuneseeking activities into the north sea and beyond early viking raids in a d 793 an attack on the lindisfarne monastery off the coast of northumberland in northeastern england marked the beginning of the viking age the culprits–probably norwegians who sailed directly across the north sea–did not destroy the monastery completely but the attack shook the european religious world to its core unlike other groups these strange new invaders had no respect for religious institutions such as the monasteries which were often left unguarded and vulnerable near the shore two years later viking raids struck the undefended island monasteries of skye and iona in the hebrides as well as rathlin off the northeast coast of ireland the first recorded raid in continental europe came in 799 at the island monastery of st philibert’s on noirmoutier near the estuary of the loire river for several decades the vikings confined themselves to hitandrun raids against coastal targets in the british isles particularly ireland and europe the trading center of dorestad 80 kilometers from the north sea became a frequent target after 830 they then took advantage of internal conflicts in europe to extend their activity further inland after the death of louis the pious emperor of frankia modernday france and germany in 840 his son lothar actually invited the support of a viking fleet in a power struggle with brothers before long other vikings realized that frankish rulers were willing to pay them rich sums to prevent them from attacking their subjects making frankia an irresistible target for further viking activity conquests in the british isles by the midninth century ireland scotland and england had become major targets for viking settlement as well as raids vikings gained control of the northern isles of scotland shetland and the orkneys the hebrides and much of mainland scotland they founded ireland’s first trading towns dublin waterford wexford wicklow and limerick and used their base on the irish coast to launch attacks within ireland and across the irish sea to england when king charles the bald began defending west frankia more energetically in 862 fortifying towns abbeys rivers and coastal areas viking forces began to concentrate more on england than frankia in the wave of viking attacks in england after 851 only one kingdom–wessex–was able to successfully resist viking armies mostly danish conquered east anglia and northumberland and dismantled mercia while in 871 king alfred the great of wessex became the only king to decisively defeat a danish army in england leaving wessex the danes settled to the north in an area known as “danelaw” many of them became farmers and traders and established york as a leading mercantile city in the first half of the 10th century english armies led by the descendants of alfred of wessex began reconquering scandinavian areas of england the last scandinavian king erik bloodaxe was expelled and killed around 952 permanently uniting english into one kingdom viking settlements europe and beyond meanwhile viking armies remained active on the european continent throughout the ninth century brutally sacking nantes on the french coast in 842 and attacking towns as far inland as paris limoges orleans tours and nimes in 844 vikings stormed seville then controlled by the arabs in 859 they plundered pisa though an arab fleet battered them on the way back north in 911 the west frankish king granted rouen and the surrounding territory by treaty to a viking chief called rollo in exchange for the latter’s denying passage to the seine to other raiders this region of northern france is now known as normandy or “land of the northmen”in the ninth century scandinavians mainly norwegians began to colonize iceland an island in the north atlantic where no one had yet settled in large numbers by the late 10th century some vikings including the famous erik the red moved even further westward to greenland according to later icelandic histories some of the early viking settlers in greenland supposedly led by the norwegian viking hero leif eriksson son of erik the red may have become the first europeans to discover and explore north america calling their landing place vinland wineland they built a temporary settlement at l’anse aux meadows in modernday newfoundland beyond that there is little evidence of viking presence in the new world and they didn’t form permanent settlements danish dominance the mid10thcentury reign of harald bluetooth as king of a newly unified powerful and christianized denmark marked the beginning of a second viking age largescale raids often organized by royal leaders hit the coasts of europe and especially england where the line of kings descended from alfred the great was faltering harald’s rebellious son sven forkbeard led viking raids on england beginning in 991 and conquered the entire kingdom in 1013 sending king ethelred into exile sven died the following year leaving his son knut or canute to rule a scandinavian empire comprising england denmark and norway on the north sea after knut’s death his two sons succeeded him but both were dead by 1042 and edward the confessor son of the previous nondanish king returned from exile and regained the english throne from the danes upon his death without heirs in 1066 harold godwinesson the son of edward’s most powerful noble laid claim to the throne harold’s army was able to defeat an invasion led by the last great viking king–harald hardrada of norway–at stamford bridge near york but fell to the forces of william duke of normandy himself a descendant of scandinavian settlers in northern france just weeks later crowned king of england on christmas day in 1066 william managed to retain the crown against further danish challenges end of the viking age the events of 1066 in england effectively marked the end of the viking age by that time all of the scandinavian kingdoms were christian and what remained of viking “culture” was being absorbed into the culture of christian europe today signs of the viking legacy can be found mostly in the scandinavian origins of some vocabulary and placenames in the areas in which they settled including northern england scotland and russia in iceland the vikings left an extensive body of literature the icelandic sagas in which they celebrated the greatest victories of their glorious past
