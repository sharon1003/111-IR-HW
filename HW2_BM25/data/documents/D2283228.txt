software agreement and disclaimer downloads and links current server or internet access internet access required glossary of terms comments or feedback company overview the simo time home page introduction this program cv80alercbl is one in a series of programs that will convert the file format and record content for files with records containing 80 byte logical records these files are commonly referred to as card files or control files this reference is based on an historical beginning that used 80 column cards and small decks of cards that contained control information this information was used to determine the behavior of a utility program or user written program additional information about this program may be obtained by sending an email to helpdesksimotimecom we have made a significant effort to ensure the documents and software technologies are correct and accurate we reserve the right to make changes without notice at any time the function delivered in this version is based upon the enhancement requests from a specific group of users the intent is to provide changes as the need arises and in a timeframe that is dependent upon the availability of resources copyright © 19872018 simo time technologies and services all rights reserved cv80aler what it does this program will convert an asciiencoded line sequential file of 80byte logical records to an ebcdicencoded record sequential file of 80byte physical records cv80aler how to use the cv80aler program reads a line sequential file getls080 and writes to a record sequential file putrs080 prior to executing the program the logical file names used in the program should be mapped to the actual physical file namesnote the file format is changed from line sequential to record sequential with trailing space characters the logical record content is changed the ascii encoding of the input file is converted to ebcdic encoding for the output file the following aler80e1cmd is a sample command file that uses two set statements to map the file names and then runs the cv80aler program echo offrem   rem  aler80e1cmd  a windows command file  rem  this program is provided by simo time

as input   the sysmask1 provides for the sequential reading of the input   file and the sequential writing of the output file     if the output file is indexed then the input file must be in   sequence by the field that will be used to provide the key   for the output file this is a sequential load process     if the key field is not in sequence then refer to sysmask2   to provide for a random add or update of the indexed file     this program mask will have the asciiebcdic table inserted   for use by the translate function of simo zaps     for additional information contact simo

the creation and deployment of business applications using new or existing technologies and services we have a team of individuals that understand the broad range of technologies being used in todays environments our customers include small businesses using internet technologies to corporations using very large mainframe systems quite often to reach larger markets or provide a higher level of service to existing customers it requires the newer internet technologies to work in a complementary manner with existing corporate mainframe systems we specialize in preparing applications and the associated data that are currently residing on a single platform to be distributed across a variety of platforms preparing the application programs will require the transfer of source members that will be compiled and deployed on the target platform the data will need to be transferred between the systems and may need to be converted and validated at various stages within the process simotime has the technology services and experience to assist in the application and data management tasks involved with doing business in a multisystem environment whether you want to use the internet to expand into new market segments or as a delivery vehicle for existing business functions or need assistance with converting nonrelational data structures simply give us a call at 415 8836565 or check
