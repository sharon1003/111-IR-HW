terms definitions what is defined as the annual statement of expenditures and tax revenues of the u s government the federal budget what does it mean if the federal government has a budget surplus that tax reciepts exceed government expenditures what does it mean if the federal government has a budget deficit that government expenditures exceed tax reciepts what if tax revenues equal government expenditures then there is a balanced budget what is the national debt the debt outstanding that arises from past budget deficits in the u s who submits the annual government budget proposal the president submits it to congress who decides the annual federal budget the president of the u s and the u s congress how does the process of determining the federal budget begin it starts with a proposal from the president and then tough choices are made by congress what do we see when we look at the federal government budget over the past 40 years most years the budget has been in a deficit what is discretionary fiscal policy fiscal policy initiated by an act of congress when congress passed tax laws in 2001 to reduce income tax rates for all taxpayers what was this action called a discretionary fiscal policy what is the government expenditure multiplier used to determine the amount aggregate demand is affected by a change in government expenditures compare the magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier to the magnitude of the tax multiplier the magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier is greater than the tax multiplier if government expenditures on goods and services increased by 20 billion what would happen to aggregate demand it would increase by more than 20 billion if the government reduces expenditures on goods and services by 30 billion what would happen to aggregate demand and gdp aggregate demand would decrease and real gdp would decrease why is the magnitude of the tax multiplier smaller than the magnitude of the government expenditure multiplier because a change in taxes does not change expenditures by as much as the same change in government expenditures what are the characteristics of the balanced budget multiplier it is greater than zero and less than the government expenditure multiplier if the economy is in equilibrium what type of gap exists and what does the fiscal policy do a recessionary gap exists and the fiscal policy increases aggregate demand if the economy is in equilibrium how could the government increase real gdp by using a discretionary fiscal policy by decreasing taxes andor increasing government expenditures if the economy is in equilibrium how could discretionary fiscal policy move the economy towards potential gdp by simultaneously cutting taxes and increasing government expenditures how can the government eliminate a recessionary gap by increasing government expenditures or decreasing taxes what happens if the government uses fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap government expenditure can be increased by less than the gap because of the government expenditure multiplier if an economy faced an inflationary gap what would be an appropriate fiscal policy to decrease government expenditure if an economy is in equilibrium with an inflationary gap what can policy makers use discretionary fiscal policy and decrease government expenditure when should a decrease in taxes be applied during a recessionary gap if the economy is at short run equilibrium what discretionary fiscal policy could adjust the economy to full employment increase taxes and decrease government spending simultaneously how could an expansionary fiscal policy increase real gdp and lower the price level if aggregate supply increases more than aggregate demand increases what are limitations of discretionary fiscal policy law making lags and estimating potential gdp why might discretionary fiscal policy more the economy away from potential gdp instead of towards it because it is difficult to know whether real gdp is above of below potential gdp what must happen for the u s to use discretionary fiscal policy to deal with a recessionary gap time must pass in order for congress to decide what taxes and government programs to change what are automatic stabilizers defined as policy that stabilizes without the need for action by the government what is an example of automatic fiscal policy the expenditures for unemployment compensation increasing as economic growth slows what are automatic changes in tax revenues and expenditures that occur as a result of fluctuations in real gdp automatic stabilizers what are fiscal policies that move the economy toward potential gdp without a change in policy automatic stablizers what are taxes that change or vary with the level of real gdp and income induced taxes what is the term for government spending on programs that pay suitably qualified people and give them business benefits needstested spending what is needstested spending defined as spending on programs for people qualified to recieve benefits what does needstested spending do during recessions and expansions it increases in recessions and decreases in expansions in a recession what does needstested spending do to induced taxes it decreases induced taxes in an expansion what does needstested spending do to induced taxes it leads to higher induced taxes what is the beige book a report that summarizes the economy across the fed districts who makes monetary policy decisions federal open market committee who sets monetary policy in the united states the federal reserve how does the fed change the federal funds rate by using open market operations to change the quantity of money in the short run what does the fed do if they want to raise the interest rate they instruct the new york fed to sell government securities in the open market how does the fed influence the real interest rate the fed can influence the real interest rate in the short run but cannot influence the real interest rate in the long run in the short run what happens when the fed raises the nominal interest rate the real interest rate temporarily increases thereby decreasing investment and consumption expenditure in the long run what is the real interest rate determined by the nominal interest rate what does the federal reserve influence in the long run nominal interest rate by the effects of its policies on the inflation rate what does the federal reserve have to do to decrease the interest rate in the short run increase the quantity of money by buying government securities what does a change in monetary policy affect consumption expenditure investment and net exports if the fed increases interest rates foreigners demand more dollars thereby increasing the price of the dollar on the foreign exchange market when the price of the dollar decreases on the foreign exchange market what happens to imports and exports imports decrease and exports increase as the interest rates increases in the united states what happens to demand for u s dollars in the foreign exchange market demands increase and exports decrease if the fed decreases the interest rate what happens to exports and imports exports increase and imports decrease what if the fed decreases the quantity of money exports decrease and imports increase what does the fed do if it fears inflation it decreases aggregate demand by selling government securities to curb inflation the fed decreases the quantity of money and in the short run raises the interest rate if the as and the ad curve intersect at a level of real gdp that exceeds potential the the appropriate monetary policy is one that raises the interest rate and decreases aggregate demand if real gdp exceeds potential gdp to move the economy to potential gdp the fed raises the interest rate to decrease real gdp but not potential gdp if the fed raises the interest rate initially the ad curve shifts leftward decreasing real gdp and the price level if the feds policies aim to increase aggregate demand the fed must fear recession what are the limitations shared by both monetary policy and fiscal policy estimating potential gdp and economic forecasting difficulties
