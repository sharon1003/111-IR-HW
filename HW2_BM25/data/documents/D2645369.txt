vii of egypt from september 2 44 bc he held the position of sole ruler between the death of cleopatra on august 12 30 bc up to august 23 30 bc the time his death was ordered by octavian who would become the roman emperor augustus it is unknown whether octavians order was carried out successfully he was the eldest son of cleopatra vii and possibly the only biological son of julius caesar after

editlimestone stela of a high priest of god ptah it bears the cartouches of cleopatra and caesarion from egypt ptolemaic period the petrie museum of egyptian archaeology london caesarion was born in egypt on june 23 47 bc his mother cleopatra insisted that he was the son of julius caesar caesarion was said to have inherited caesars looks and manner but caesar apparently did not officially acknowledge him caesars supporter gaius oppius wrote a pamphlet which attempted to prove that caesar could not have fathered caesarion nevertheless caesar may have allowed caesarion to use his name 1 the matter became contentious when caesars adopted son octavian came into conflict with cleopatra in some medical literature caesarion is said to have suffered from epilepsy a neurological condition apparently inherited from his father julius caesar 2 this thesis has recently been refuted by paleopathologist francesco m galassi and surgeon hutan ashrafian who have shown how the first mention of potential epileptic attacks can only be found in 20th century novels instead of ancient primary sources and how this controversial assumption has been mistakenly used in the historicomedical debate on julius caesars alleged epilepsy to strengthen the notion that the dictator really suffered from that disease 3caesarion spent two of his infant years from 46 to 44 bc in rome where he and his mother were caesars guests cleopatra hoped that her son would eventually succeed his father as the head of the roman republic as well as of egypt after caesars assassination on march 15 44 bc cleopatra and caesarion returned to egypt caesarion was named coruler by his mother on september 2 44 bc at the age of three although he was pharaoh in name only with cleopatra keeping actual authority all to herself cleopatra compared her relationship to her son with the egyptian goddess isis and her divine child horus 1during the tense period leading up to the final conflict between mark antony marcus antonius and octavian future emperor augustus  the two of them initially shared control of the republic in a triumvirate with lepidus lepidus was forced into retirement by octavian in 36 bc octavian and mark antony were then left in control of the western and eastern provinces respectively there is no historical record of caesarion between 44 bc until the donations of antioch in 36 bc two years later he also appears at the donations of alexandria cleopatra and antony staged both donations to donate lands dominated by rome and parthia to cleopatras children the 11yearold caesarion presumed to have been fathered by julius caesar and the four yearold twins alexander helios and cleopatra selene ii initially in 36 bc and in 34 bc including the two yearold ptolemy philadelphus all three fathered by marc antony octavian gave public approval to the donations of antioch in 36 bc which have been described as an antonian strategy to rule the east making use of cleopatras unique royal seleucid lineage in the regions donated 4pharaoh  editin 34 bc antony granted further eastern lands and titles to caesarion and to his own three children with cleopatra in the donations of alexandria caesarion was proclaimed to be a god a son of a god and  king of kings  this grandiose title was unprecedented in the management of roman clientking relationships and could be seen as threatening the greatness of the roman people 5 antony also declared caesarion to be caesars true son and heir this declaration was a direct threat to octavian whose claim to power was based on his status as julius caesars grandnephew and adopted son these proclamations partly caused the fatal breach in antonys relations with octavian who used roman resentment over the donations to gain support for war against antony and cleopatra 6downfall  editthis mid1stcenturybc roman wall painting in pompeii italy showing venus holding a cupid is most likely a depiction of cleopatra vii of ptolemaic egypt as venus genetrix with her son caesarion as the cupid similar in appearance to the now lost statue of cleopatra erected by julius caesar in the temple of venus genetrix within the forum of caesar  the owner of the house of marcus fabius rufus at pompeii walled off the room with this painting most likely in immediate reaction to the execution of caesarion on orders of augustus in 30 bc when artistic depictions of caesarion would have been considered a sensitive issue for the ruling regime 7 8after the defeat of antony and cleopatra at the battle of actium in 31 bc cleopatra seems to have groomed caesarion to take over as sole ruler without his mother 1 she may have intended to go into exile perhaps with antony who may have hoped that he would be allowed to retire as lepidus had caesarion reappears in the historical record in 30 bc when octavian invaded egypt and searched for him cleopatra may have sent caesarion at the time 17 years old to the red sea port of berenice for safety possibly as part of plans for an escape to india he may have been sent years earlier but the sources are unclear plutarch does say that caesarion was sent to india but also that he was lured back by false promises of the kingdom of egypt caesarion who was said to be cleopatras son by julius caesar was sent by his mother with much treasure into india by way of ethiopia there rhodon another tutor like theodorus persuaded him to go back on the ground that octavian caesar invited him to take the kingdom 9octavian captured the city of alexandria on august 1 30 bc the date that marks the official annexation of egypt to the roman republic around this time mark antony and cleopatra died traditionally said to be by suicide though murder has been suggested 10 details of the narratives in plutarch are generally challenged and not taken literally 11 caesarions guardians including his tutor either were themselves lured by false promises of mercy into returning him to alexandria or perhaps even betrayed him the records are unclear octavian is supposed to have had pharaoh caesarion executed in alexandria following the advice of arius didymus who said too many caesars is not good a pun on a line in homer  12 it is popularly thought that he was strangled but the exact circumstances of his death or even whether he lived to old age in hiding under a reinvented identity have not been documented  citation needed octavian then assumed absolute control of egypt the year 30 bc was considered the first year of the new rulers reign according to the traditional chronological system of

philopator or nickname eg auletes the number given here is the present consensus but there has been some disagreement in the 19th century about which of the later ptolemies should be counted as reigning since older sources may give a number one higher or lower epithets are the most reliable way of determining which ptolemy is being referred to in any given case references  edit a b c duane w
