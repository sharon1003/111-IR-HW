etc  meyer 1989 21n44 the first person to apply the term parameter to music may have been joseph schillinger though its relative popularity may be due to werner meyereppler  grant 2005 62n85 gradation is gradual change within one parameter or an overlapping of two blocks of sound meyer gives melody rhythm timbre harmony and the like  meyer 1973 9 while narmour lists melody harmony rhythm dynamics tessitura timbre tempo meter texture and perhaps others  narmour 1988 326 according to mc clellan two things should be considered the quality or state of an element and its change over time  mc

article definition of music does the definition of music determine its aspects or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music for example intensional definitions list aspects or elements that make up their subject some definitions refer to music as a score or a composition  dictionarycom 2015 merriamwebstercom 2015 oxforddictionariescom  music can be read as well as heard and a piece of music written but never played is a piece of music notwithstanding the process of reading music at least for trained musicians involves a process called inner hearing or audiation by gordon where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played  gordon 1999  this suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music it may not be jean molino 1975 43 points out that any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated or taken as a strategic variable of musical production nattiez gives as examples mauricio kagel s con voce with voice where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments in this example sound a common element is excluded while gesture a less common element is given primacy however nattiez goes on to say that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious because it is heard in the mind sound is a minimal condition of the musical fact  nattiez 1990 43 universal aspect  editthere is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are universal as well as whether the concept of music is universal this debate often hinges on definitions for instance the fairly common assertion that tonality is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality a pulse is sometimes taken as a universal yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythms no regular pulse  johnson 2002 62 one example being the alap section of an indian classical music performance harwood questions whether a crosscultural musical universal may be found in the music or in the making of music including performance hearing conception and education  harwood 1976 522 one aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multicultural associations is that an englishlanguage word ie the word music not a universal concept is the object of scrutiny for this reason it is important to approach apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution based on the many disparate definitions that can be found just in english language dictionaries  googlecomau 2015 dictionarycom 2015 merriamwebstercom 2015 music  1991 1994 1998 2000 2003  it seems there is no agreement on what the word music means in english  original research let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture kenneth gourlay describes how since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music dance and related concepts translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them citing nigerian musicologist chinyere nwachukwus definition of the igbo term nkwa  nwachukwu 1981 59 as an activity combining andor requiring singing playing musical instruments and dancing  gourlay 1984 35 he then concludes that there exists nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic other terms  editother terms used to discuss particular pieces include note —an abstraction that refers to either a specific pitch or rhythm or the written symbol chord —a simultaneity of notes heard as some sort of unit chord progression —a succession of chords  simultaneity successionfor a more
