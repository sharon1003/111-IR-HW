impact of event scale  revised iesr weiss  marmar 1997note this is the iesr not the 15 item version  ies  devised by the iesr was developed by daniel s weiss and charles r marmar in 1997 to parallel the dsmiv criteria for ptsd the original ies was developed prior to the adoption of posttraumatic stress disorder as a legitimate diagnosis in the dsmiii published in 1980 and only tap 2 of the 4 criteria set out for ptsd in the dsmiv intrusion and avoidance weiss  marmar 1997 iesr was intended to tap hyperarousal cluster of symptoms the 4th criterion for ptsd type of instrument the iesr is similar to ies in that it is a selfreport measure designed to assess current subjective distress for any specific life event the iesr has 22 items 7 items having being added to the original 15item ies weiss  marmar 1997 the 7 items comprise 6 that tap hyperarousal symptoms such as anger and irritability heightened startle response difficulty concentrating hypervigilance and 1 new intrusion item that taps the dissociativelike reexperiencing when experiencing true flashback the hyperarousal subscale and the new intrusion item along with the existing intrusion and avoidance subscales parallel the dsmiv criteria for ptsd the 7 items were randomly interspersed with the existing 7 intrusion and 8 avoidance items the only modification to the ies items was the bifurcation of the item i had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep into i had trouble falling asleep assigned to the hyperarousal subscale and i had trouble staying asleep retained in the intrusion subscale respondents are asked to rate each item in the iesr on a scale of 0 not at all 1 a little bit 2 moderately 3 quite a bit and 4 extremely according to the past 7 days reliability in their study of 4 different cast iron cookware reviews weiss and marmar 1997 reported that the internal consistency of the 3 subscales was found to be very high with intrusion alphas ranging from 87 to 92 avoidance alphas ranging from 84 to 86 and hyperarousal alphas ranging from 79 to 90 briere 1997 splithalfcronbachs alpha natestretest reliability testretest data were available for 2 of the samples in the weiss and marmar 1997 study data from sample 1 n  429 yielded the following testretest correlation coefficients for the subscales intrusion  57 avoidance  51 hyperarousal  59 from sample 2 n  197 the correlation coefficients were considerably higher intrusion  94 avoidance  89 hyperarousal  92 it is believed that the shorter interval between assessments and the greater recency of the traumatic event for sample 2 contributed to the higher coefficients of stability alternate form reliability nainterrater reliability navalidity criterion or predictive validity weiss and marmar noted that the cast iron cookware subscale has good le creuset dutch oven validity with regard to trauma briere 1997 the intrusion and avoidance subscales which are original ies components have been shown to detect change in repondents clinical status over time and detect relevant differences in the response to traumatic events of varying severity weiss and marmar 1997 horowitz et al 1979 content validity not available for the hyperarousal subscale the intrusion and avoidance subscales which are originally ies items had high endorsements of up to 85 horowitz et al 1979 construct validity weiss and marmar 1997 utilised the itemtosubscale correlation with that item removed from the subscale generated by the standard alpha coefficient analyses these were then compared to the crosssubscale pearson correlations the results showed that only 1 item i had trouble falling asleep showed a stronger relationship between it and a different subscale the corrected correlation of this item with its assigned hyperarousal subscale was 71 and its correlation with the intrusion subscale was 79 nineteen items showed a correlation with their assigned subscale that was higher than with the other subscales and 2 items i had trouble staying asleep and  i avoided letting myself get upset when i though about it or was reminded of it showed a correlation that was equal the explanations given by weiss and marmar 1997 for these results are that the 2 sleep items are very highly correlated driving a relationship between them in terms of intrusion and hyperarousal and as to the equal relationship of the avoidance item with the avoidance and intrusion subscales this may have occurred because the presentation of the thought or the reminder invokes intrusion and the not dealing with it invokes avoidance
