nomadic invaders invading from the north while han chinese were used to being occupied even by foreign dynasties such as the mongol yuan dynasty the foreign occupiers were always absorbed into the great ocean of chinese culture and eventually disappeared the british were the first people who came from far away who did not have a border with china and defeated chinese forces decisively on chinese territory while britain had a few key technologies which were ahead of the chinese and were just embarking on industrial mass production with the industrial revolution it is not as if the gap was so huge that the chinese could not have caught up with a few decades of study and hard work as the japanese did during the meiji restoration the biggest differences were that the british were an outwardlooking expansionist power with an ideology and welltrained and experienced military which had come off of winning wars all over the world except in north america this new secular ideology or religion was called free trade after winning the napoleonic wars the royal navy was the single most powerful and dominant navy in the 19th century no one else even came close in contrast the qing court was an inwardlooking empire with a huge domestic population which was confident that the rest of the world had nothing china wanted or needed the states which china dealt with were all smaller and were usually suzerain states which sent tribute to beijing every year in return for their tribute these local rulers were allowed to largely rule as they wished without any foreign interference from beijing the qing court was not as completely helpless as some western historians make it out to be in the 1750s the manchu bannermen of the qing dynasty exterminated about 500000 members of the dzungar khanate in the dzungar genocide opening up central asia to chinese control and domination this victory convinced the chinese emperor qianlong who ruled for 62 years that there was no point in meeting with the macartney embassy to beijing in 1793 this set the stage for the qing court to commit its most basic mistake before the first opium war it did not send any missions to europe and the americas to find out what was happening in those parts of the world this meant that beijing did not have the most basic information about the british until after the first opium war in 1840 in britain the east india company which was the first large multinational trading company had made many rich but the british home market was too small for the continued expansion of the east india company and they needed to expand their markets opium grown in india was the answer to these traders dreams this dream of private wealth was wrapped up by the british government in the ideology of free trade which britain had embraced following the repeal of the corn laws and the royal navy was tasked with blasting open the doors of the qing court following the first opium war all the weaknesses of the qing dynasty were revealed for everyone to see the taiping rebellion broke out which cost 20m lives this was followed by the second opium war and the piecemeal annexation of chinas coastal cities under the treaty ports agreements then the japanese annexation of taiwan in 1895 in 1898 the hundred days reform was promoted then soon crushed in 1900 there was the boxer rebellion in 1912 the last qing dynasty emperor puyi abdicated after the xinhai revolution which resulted in the founding of the republic of china in 1937 japan perceiving that china was weak and anxious to prevent the rise of a powerful neighbor invaded china after first setting up the japanese client state of manchukuo in 1931 in 1949 the peoples republic of china was founded after 30 years of domestic political chaos and bad economic policies china embarked on its policy of reform and opening up in 1979 which continues until the present day the first opium war was a tremendous shock to the chinese state for the next 150 years the chinese wrestled with several basic questions how could china modernize without losing its character and sovereign independence would china have to follow western political models in order to become a modern state how could china maintain unity and not become subject to invasion and exploitation by foreign powers could china catch up with and beat the west at its own game the chinese communist party was organized in order to answer these questions and has provided one effective model for modernization which has affected 13b chinese the chinese needed an authoritarian party to stand up to foreign invasion and aggression while maintaining internal discipline and the cpc was the result now china is prosperous and is very much an outwardlooking power looking for foreign markets for its goods and services one could argue that it is almost as if china and britain have switched roles when we compare it to the period around 1840 further reading why do many chinese believe that western democracy is a plot to make china weak128k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date
