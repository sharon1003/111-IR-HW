how early can i hit the gym after my rhinoplasty07242012 by anil r shah mdmany patients seeking rhinoplasty are very aware of their appearance very commonly they ask “when can i go back to working out”if you fall into the 496 of americans that do exercise daily it is very fundamental for you to read on so you’re at the gym do you make a beeline for the treadmill the weight and resistance machines the ellipticals ab crunchers cyclers stairmaster or how about if you’re me and bypass all of those and go for the gym mats to stretch and practice yoga all of these no matter how insignificant you may think any activities may be have a crucial impact on the healing process of your nose in general most patients are able to return to activity after one week patients can exert 25 effort the first week 50 effort the second 75 the third week and can resume 100 of activity by the fourth week now i’m not saying after one week you’re able to hop right in that kickboxing ring and turn into mohammad ali but you can start off by doing agile workouts such as aerobics this would include exercises that won’t raise your heart rate like walking and even doing tasks such as mowing the lawn doing laundry and shopping according to the oregon health and science university starting off slow will prevent things such as nose bleeding swelling and throbbing weightlifting is the number one cause of postop nose bleeding patients should avoid lifting objects even small children over ten pounds and limiting vigorous sexual activity in this initial phase by the second week you can leisurely work your way into carrying on with your normal workout activities but still abstaining from contact sports and aggressive exercises like heavy weight lifting activities such as light treadmilling and stationary biking would be ideal but try your best not to put excessive bouncing on your nose after all we don’t want your nose falling off nowfinally by the third week if you feel confident enough in your healing process to begin lifting light weights you can go ahead and generate those muscles once again contact sports and heavy weight lifting are still to be abstained from for a minimum of 6 months depending on the type of procedure you have had everybody’s road to recovery is different some patients might have a more speedy restoration while others have a more gradual restoration either way it is absolutely vital that you do not exert yourself beyond what your body can handle if you experience swollenness bruising numbness or any sort of pain you should refrain from physical activity and perhaps even contact your doctor facebook twitter google share filed under blog
