transfer i tunes playlists and song ratings this post is part of our multipost wizard on how to transfer your i tunes music library if you have already moved your actual i tunes music files to your new computer either by reading the post move your i tunes music to a new computer with home sharing or by other means then you are ready to start transferring your i tunes playlists and song ratings otherwise check out our transfer i tunes wizard to determine what solution works best for you like many things in life there is more than one way to do this this post tells you about the free – albiet somewhat complicated – way that requires a little bit of hacking with an xml file if you are a windows user and would rather spend a few bucks on some handy software to save yourself some time and frustration – then we suggest you read using software to transfer i tunes music and playlists instead export the libraryxml file from your old computer file  library  export library… now get this file over to your new computer somehow it should be small enough that you can email it to yourself export the libraryxml file on your new computer after you’ve transferred over all of your songs open both libraryxml files and examine them use a basic textediting program like text edit mac or notepad windows don’t use microsoft word because it will mess things up you should see a file path to an actual song file in each of them find the file path that leads up to the filename on the libraryxml file from your new computer so if it’s cusers usernamemy20musici tunesi tunes20mediabob20dylan bringing20it20all20back20home0120subterranean20homesick20bluesmp3 then the important part is cusers usernamemy20musici tunesi tunes20media do a findreplace on the file paths in your old computer’s libraryxml file the replace command is in notepad at edit  replace… and in text edit at edit  find  find… you’re going to want to “find” the file paths that are in your old computer’s libraryxml and “replace” them with the file paths from your new computer’s libraryxml file for example if you’re transferring from a windows xp computer to a windows 7 computer you are probably going to “find”cdocuments and settings usernamemy20documentsmy20musici tunesi tunes20media and “replace” it with cusers usernamemy20musici tunesi tunes20media a little explanation on what is happening here the libraryxml file on your old computer holds all of that important info you’re interested in such as song rating playcount and playlists it keeps these records along with the location of the file by doing this findreplace we are keeping all of that information but changing the information that locates the actual file – so i tunes will know where it is so now select all of your music files press your “delete” or “backspace” key you’ll get a warning dialog box saying something like “are you sure you want to remove the selected items from your i tunes library”click on “remove” we know this is scary to do but – provided you follow the next instructions – it’s only deleting i tunes’ records of the files not the files themselves click on “keep files” this way you’re only deleting i tunes’ records of the files not the files themselves we’ll restore i tunes’ records for these files in the next step import your modified libraryxml file into your new computer’s i tunes library file  library  import playlist… locate your modified libraryxml file and click “choose” i tunes will now import all of that data you had about your music files ratings and playlists and will also have to correct file paths for those files it will probably take several minutes for i tunes to import everything you should now have all of your playlists song ratings and play counts transferred over to your new computer it’s that…easy keep in mind that there is also a software solution for windows users for this process which we explain in detail in our post using software to transfer i tunes music

running 3 hold down the key that says option or alt on your keyboard when starting i tunes 4 select choose itunes library and locate your old i tunes folder 5 select the old i tunes folder thats itmike peiman • 2 months ago yes this still provides the quick and easy and effective solution thank you note as another commenter mentioned on windows 81 hold down shift key guest • 2 years ago amazing genius so simple and fast thanks a milalberto viesca gómez • 2 years ago dude thanks a lot i was killing myself with longass tutorials that helped for nothing helen bailey • 2 years ago genius i have spent hours trying to work out how to do it and this is so simple thank you so much mo z pierce • 3 years ago i used the shift key with windows 81 awesomeit was a snap the editing of the xml did not work for me and was time consumingwish id looked at the comments first thank youbilal • 4 years agothis worked thank you guest • 8 years ago if you need to move only stars so there is an easy way1 create 5 smart playlists for each star rating 2 select all songs in each playlist and add to comment field something like 1 star 2 stars etc 3 transfer files 4 now on a new computer create next 5 smart playlists by rule comment  or comment have inside  1 star 2 stars etc 5 select all songs in each playlist and starred them thats itdingo • 7 years agoartysx  that is freakin brilliant i have been looking for a couple of days now and this worked wonderfully i didnt think that after transferring the comments and grouping type of info would carry over but it did this is so simple hidden in plain view thanksandy block • 4 years ago i have to agree this is incredibly simple and brilliant i found this original page because i am moving my library and everytime i import my old 5star playlists it creates duplicate line item references to the same songs in the main itunes library there are not actually two copies of the files in existence but there are duplicate references to them in itunes when i import playlists this has occurred regardless of if if copy files to itunes library is selected in preferences this approach using the comments field is nice because you are not importing any playlists in the new library but just rather recreating your originals conceptually this should prevent any issues with duplicate references to the same file in the new itunes library im going to give this approach a shot thanks for posting cora • 7 years ago thanks for this blog i followed each step but only about half of my music imported correctly that is to say all of my music is on my new computer but when i imported the libraryxml file only about half of the music was found i know how to manually enter the rest of the music in but its around 1000 songs and most of them are assigned to multiple playlists so its going to take a while any idea why this might have happened and how to fix it jrlooking • 6 years ago this looks like a sensible approach but other than the paths you mention there is one clear difference in the xml files keylibrary persistent idkeystring00e5070af8cecf30string which one do i use your process would copy over the old one but have the new paths
