it technology av healthcare theater or education and want to change careers are you interested in using your technical experiences to help train healthcare professionals check out this 1 hour webinar provided by lance baily founder of healthy simulationcom about how to start a career as a sim tech43 best practices for medical simulation hiring the goal with hiring for your simulationbased positions is to not necessarily find candidates with the most simulation experience nor even the most medical experience but rather the person who has demonstrated the most passion for the position no matter how strong the core of your simulation program is we are talking about a technology and methodology that will continue to evolve and disrupt your training program thus finding individuals who are comfortable with change and go to work everyday looking to “learn something new” will far far better serve your program specifically looking to hire a medical simulation technician read this practical guide great interview questions when hiring a sim tech for hiring individuals to run your medical simulation lab technology managing  operating simulation programs42 how to build a medical simulation program website  as a medical simulation champion you know how tricky it can sometimes be to explain to friends family or nonhealthcare professionals what is is you exactly do in the sim lab as a new educational methodology the integration of healthcare simulation technology is still only somewhere between “early adopter” and “early majority” on bell’s technology adoption lifecycle curve so as you probably know working in simulation usually means you are also responsible for educating others about simulation thus no matter how big or small your simulation program is staff should communicate with higher institutional leadership about the importance of an online website41 how to add multimedia  social media to strengthen your simulation program website  in this article we touch on how to add the visual stimulus of multimedia and social platform integrations can provide further benefits to your program’s website the benefits and utilization of photography digitally produced

minute promotional video included here are links to production tutorials and video examples so that your program can do the same39 how to add background noise to medical simulations  by providing more artificial background noise to our environment we can increase the ‘feeling’ of entering the ed or being on a screaming ambulance the closer our simulations match the real world the better our learners will be able to deal with the additional stressors they will be facing in the most basic terms adding distracting or ‘feelingbased’ background noise can help learners better “practice how we play”38 sim manager product demo video  interview  sim manager is a cloudbased software service that requires an ongoing subscription fee automatically updated since there are no onsite hardware needs

identify key drivers for designing simulation scenarios  wendy van ittersum md faap pediatric hospitalist from children’s hospital cleveland clinic provided a one hour workshop on “key drivers” wendy was kind enough to share her presentation from the event which covered the uses of key driver forms wendy reminds us that key drivers are “an effective tool for breaking down complex questions or improvement goals and structuring them into smaller addressable pieces” this workshop examined tools that can clarify simulation needs and interventions and demonstrated fishbone and key driver diagrams to identify explore and graphically display all possible causes related to a problem or condition after the scenarios completes be sure to consider how to evaluate effectiveness of simulation34 sim base creates implementation handbook for healthcare simulation and ictbased learning  sim base is a two year project funded by the european union which brings together simulation champions and technology providers from within the territory to collaboratively expand the implementation of simulation training techniques last year they released an implementation handbook for healthcare simulation and ictbased learning training programs which is also available in spanish33 how to overcome camerashy simulation learners  simulation asks a lot from learners much more than just acting professionally and performing well they must also knowingly enter and maintain legitimacy of an unknown and fabricated environment all of which must be done under the watchful eye of peers and supervisors or faculty and sometimes that watchful eye is the only element putting learners over the edge so if we do not relax the anxiety that some learners have about being video taped they will only ever provide whatever mental commitment is left after the “you are on camera” thought process continues to occur and then we aren’t utilizing simulation to the full potential of the learner the lab the facilitator or the program so how to cure the camera shy in this same vein how does improv help clinicians think on their feet theater games help to reduce the sense of threat posed by recognizing that uncertainty is just how things are and to look at uncertainty as a necessary dimension to the creative process we accept and embrace uncertainty so that we can create – a creative space is empathic aware building on what is given and expansive32 designing prehospital medical simulation scenarios  the team at southwestern ambulance nhs foundation trust swast has been evaluating various methods to decrease the numbers of failures within student paramedic practical examinations and have for some years developed strategies for enhanced student experience and performance this

material including guides for facilitators and technicians through the staging and learning process29 tacit knowledge from simulation adds to situational awareness  richard b gasaway ph d fire chief ret shared a recent post on his website “situational awareness matters” about the benefits of “tacit knowledge” what is tacit knowledge richard explains “tacit knowledge is the collection of life’s experiences education and training that reside outside conscious awareness it’s the knowledge one possess that helps guide intuition a vital component to making highstress highconsequence split second decisions28 simulation in healthcare education a best evidence practical guide  dr barry issenberg director of the gordon medical simulation center at the university of miami miller school of medicine and coauthor of amee guide 82 “simulation in healthcare education a best evidence practical guide part2″ reminds us here of the importance of considering the practical implementation of medical

it comes to learning or experiencing the world around us whether you want to drive an 18wheel truck a 40ton locomotive fly a 747 jumbo jet run a hospital evolve a biological bacteria or even build a city – there is an endless stream of video games to do all that and more knowing that technology will continue to dramatically change the classroom i believe it is only a matter of time before video games are utilized in many to most educational centers for career training24 a black belt in simulation what can healthcare education learn from martial arts  martial arts like dancing can not be fully learned via powerpoint while sitting in a classroom while the mind was learning the body itself was obviously the instrument of skills performance in healthcare a lecture on starting cpr after recognizing tunnel vision of teammates seems very simple for students to grasp but like when fighting a real opponent high stakes stressful situations bring intense adrenaline which will hijack normal operating thought protocols so theoretically understanding adrenaline is one thing but experiencing and dealing with it first hand is entirely another23 moulage simubleed by spectra takes moulage

healthcare  halldale media‘s 2013 world aviation training conference and expo event took place in orlando florida with over 1000 pilots flight attendants mechanics students and vendors in attendance i have produced what i consider to be a ‘mustview’ video and article covering the event which more than demonstrated the parellels between aviation simulation training and healthcare simulation training being the first simulation training conference i have attended outside of the healthcare sector i was very impressed to witness an industry which has wholeheartedly accepted simulation absent from the event were sessions dedicated to convincing users about the need to invest in simulation training programs instead keynote speakers addressed the latest data findings pointing to unexplored training gaps such as lithiumion laptop battery fires and autopilot engaged highaltitude stall recovery protocol changes this is a mustwatch for medical simulation champions5 flipping classrooms – teaching in the digital age  while flying this week i picked up southwest’s spirit magazine to find one of the most powerful articles i have ever read in my life called “flipped out” by jennifer miller the article wonderfully demonstrates a concern i have had since my own experience of k12 learning that memorizing knowledge for passing tests was an outdated model of education why because response’s by teachers similar to “because you won’t always have a calculator” has proven to be wrong as we all carry them on our phones many teachers want to emphasize independent thinking but primaryschool curriculums are still largely geared toward “teaching to the test” according to dr gary small a neuroscientist at ucla and author of i brain surviving the technological alteration of the modern mind this model is long outofdate as a society he says “we’re no longer memorizers but gatherers”4 simulab centra line man training proven to reduce infection rate  hospital costs  this video covers the use of the centra line man at the feinberg school of medicine simulation technology and immersive learning center in the video and transcript below dr jeffrey h barsuk associate professor in medicine
