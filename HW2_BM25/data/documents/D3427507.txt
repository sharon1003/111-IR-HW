from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search a selection of early 20th century locomotive types according to their whyte notation and their comparative size whyte notation from a handbook for railroad industry workers published in 1906 1the whyte notation for classifying steam locomotives by wheel arrangement was devised by frederick methvan whyte 2 and came into use in the early twentieth century following a december 1900 editorial in american engineer and railroad journal the notation counts the number of leading wheels then the number of driving wheels and finally the number of trailing wheels groups of numbers being separated by dashes 3 other classification schemes like uic classification and the french turkish and swiss systems for steam locomotives count axles rather than wheels in the notation a locomotive with two leading axles four wheels in front then three driving axles six wheels and then one trailing axle two wheels is classified as 462 contents  hide 1

links method  editarticulated locomotives  editarticulated locomotives such as garratts which are effectively two locomotives joined by a common boiler have a  between the arrangements of each engine thus a double pacific type garratt is a 462264 for garratt locomotives the  sign is used even when there are no intermediate unpowered wheels eg the lms garratt 260062 this is because the two engine units are more than just power bogies they are complete engines carrying fuel and water tanks the  sign represents the bridge carrying the boiler that links the two engines simpler articulated types such as mallets have a jointed frame under a common boiler where there are no unpowered wheels between the sets of powered wheels typically the forward frame is free to swing whereas the rear frame is rigid with the boiler thus a union pacific big boy is a 4884 four leading wheels one group of eight driving wheels another group of eight driving wheels and then four trailing wheels duplex locomotives  editthis numbering system is shared by duplex locomotives which have powered wheel sets sharing a rigid frame suffixes  editno suffix means a tender locomotive t indicates a tank locomotive in european practice this is sometimes extended to indicate the type of tank locomotive t means side tank pt pannier tank st saddle tank wt well tank tt means a tank locomotive that also has a tender in europe the suffix r can signify rack 060rt or reversible 060tr the latter being bicabine locomotives used in france the suffix f indicates a fireless locomotive 040f this locomotive has no tender other suffixes have been used including ng for narrowgauge less than 1435 mm  4 ft 8 1⁄ 2in  and ca or ca for compressed air running on compressed air from a tank instead of steam from a boiler internal combustion locomotives  editin britain small diesel and petrol locomotives are usually classified in the same way as steam locomotives eg 040 060 080 this may be followed by d for diesel or p for petrol and another letter describing the transmission e for electric h hydraulic m mechanical thus 060de denotes a sixwheel diesel locomotive with electric transmission where the axles are coupled by chains or shafts rather than side rods or are individually driven the terms 4w 6w or 8w are generally used thus 4w pe indicates a fourwheel petrol locomotive with electric transmission for large diesel locomotives the uic classification is used limitations  editthe main limitation of whyte notation is that it does not cover nonstandard types such as shay locomotives which use geared trucks rather than driving wheels the most commonly used system in europe outside the united kingdom is uic classification based on german practice which can define the exact layout of a locomotive naming  editin american and to a lesser extent british practice most wheel arrangements in common use were given names sometimes from the name of the first such locomotive built for example the 220 type arrangement is named planet after the 1830 locomotive on which it was first used this naming convention is similar to the naming of warship classes common wheel arrangements  editthe most common wheel arrangements are listed below in the diagrams the front of the locomotive is to the left arrangement locomotive front is to the left whyte classification name  of units produced nonarticulated
