the dominant cultural political philosophical and economic consensus 4 andor comments on social issues and conflicts conscious hip hop is not necessarily overtly political but the terms conscious hip hop and political hip hop are sometimes used interchangeably the term nationconscious rap has been used to more specifically describe hip hop music with strong political messages and themes 5 themes of conscious hip hop include afrocentricity religion aversion to crime  violence culture the economy or depictions of the struggles of ordinary people conscious hip hop often seeks to raise awareness of social issues leaving the listeners to form their own opinions rather than aggressively advocating for certain ideas and demanding actions 4history of political and conscious hip hop  editorigins and early development  editbefore the emergence of political hip hop the black power movement and the emphasis on black pride arising in the mid1960s and blossoming in the early1970s inspired several commentaries that incorporated black power ideological elements songs expressing the theme of black pride include james brown s say it loud im black and proud 1969 and billy paul s am i black enough for you 1972 the protorap of gil scottheron is an early influence on political and conscious rap though most of his earlier socially conscious and political albums fall within the jazz soul and funk genres following ronald reagan ’s election as president in 1980 conditions in innercity africanamerican communities worsened and hiphop political commentators began to increasingly address worsening social problems such as mass unemployment police brutality incarceration inadequate public schools political apathy and oppression 6 one of the first socially conscious hiphop songs was how we gonna make the black nation rise by brother d with collective effort 7 the first majorly successful hip hop song containing conscious rap was grandmaster flash and the furious five s  the message  an influential political and conscious hip hop track decrying the poverty violence and deadend lives of the urban poor of the time furthermore the complex sociopolitical issues before hip hop and during all of its stages severely influenced its birth and direction 8gangsta rap  editmain article gangsta rap early gangsta rap often showed significant overlap with political and conscious rap 9 pioneers in the gangsta rap genre such as icet n w a ice cube and the geto boys blended the crime stories violent imagery and aggression associated with gangsta rap with sociopolitical commentary using the now standard gangsta rap motifs of crime and violence to comment on the state of society and expose issues found within poor communities to society as a whole 10 these early gangsta rap artists were influenced in part by the bleak and often revolutionary crime novels of iceberg slim as well as hiphop groups such as public enemy and boogie down productions groups that mixed aggressive confrontational lyrics about urban life with socialpolitical commentary and often radical political messages the controversial debut album straight outta compton by n w a released in 1988 brought gangsta rap to the mainstream but it also contained harsh social and political commentary including the confrontational track  fuck tha police  icets work would sometimes focus on other topics for example he rapped about free speech on his third album and about drunk driving domestic violence and nelson mandela on his fourth album 11after his departure from the group n w a in 1989 ice cube embarked on a solo career and released sociopolitical and conscious rap with gangsta rap elements in his 1990 debut album amerikkkas most wanted and the companion ep kill at will the 1991 album death certificate followed by the 1992 album the predator 12 ice cubes first two albums were produced by the hiphop production team the bomb squad known for their work with the sociopolitical rap group public enemy furthermore ice cube produced and appeared on the controversial and radical political rapgangsta rap album guerillas in tha mist by da lench mob in the wake of the 1992 los angeles riots 12 though ice cube would continue to sporadically insert political and social commentary into his music throughout his career he once again focused on conscious and political rap with his 2006 album laugh now cry later 12 and 2008s raw footage featuring the single  gangsta rap made me do it  a song dealing with the perceived correlation between music and global issues ie the iraq war school shootings etc underground rap  editmain article underground rap the artists who consistently produce conscious rap are largely underground 13 14 however mainstream artists are increasingly including elements of conscious hiphop in their songs 15 there are hundreds of artists whose music could be described as political or who identify as political rappers see the list of political hip hop artists page for a partial list 16political artists  editmain article list of political hip hop artists examples of conscious and political hiphop music throughout the decades include whodini s growing up

rapper common s discography main source s watch roger do his thing and much of 2pac s discography including changes hip hop in politics  edithip hop s outreach to the political world is widespread the response that hip hop has received from mainstream politics has been vast and has resulted in the spread of ideas opinions and the formation of an informal dialogue surrounding largely controversial topics from the onset of hip hop in the 1980s throughout the 1990s the culture was either ignored or criticized by politicians on both sides in the 1990s there was one cultural idea that seemed to have bipartisan support that rap music was a symptom of the destruction of american values 17 this opinion however fails to recognize the historical oppression and injustices experienced by blacks and other minority groups which rap music and the hip hop scene sought to bring attention to in 1992 vice president dan quayle called on interscope records to withdraw 2pacalypse now because it was a disgrace to american music the catalyst for quayles outrage was an incident when a texas youth shot a state trooper and referenced the album as his motivation 17 in 2pacalypse now rapper tupac shakur raised issues of institutional racism teen pregnancy and police brutality 18 he tells a fictional story of how a police officer slams him on the ground for no cause but before he gets arrested the police officer is shot his lyrics read how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me today hiphop music has grown to be such a large part of mainstream culture that the washington post wrote the politicians guide to how to be down with hip hop  19 which draws reference to the use of hip hop culture in politics the criticism of hip hop that was considered patriotic or even moral one generation ago can make a politician seem out of touch especially with younger voters 19 politician mike huckabee was viewed as being out of touch when he referred to beyoncé as mental poison in his book god guns grits and gravy 20 in 2008 during barack obamas democratic primary campaign against thenrival hillary clinton he referenced jay z by doing his brush the dirt off your shoulder motion in a rally and the audience erupted with support the embrace of hiphop has not occurred on party lines republican senator marco rubio is a vocal fan of tupac and gangsta rap rubio said in some ways rappers are like reporters you had gang wars racial tension and they were reporting on that 17 the 2016 republican party nominee for president donald trump has also leveraged hiphop to his advantage he occasionally quotes that rapper mac miller wrote a song called donald trump and that it has over 100000000 views 19ideology and views of political rappers  editamerica  editantiracism black liberation and nationalism  editas hiphop is a music genre dominated by africanamericans political rappers often reference and discuss black liberation in particular the fivepercent nation an islamic group that focuses on black liberation theology has a high membership of popular rappers and has had an integral influence on hip hop culture 21 there are numerous hip hop songs expressing antiracist views such as the popular the black eyed peas song  where is the love  however artists advocating more for radical black liberation have remained controversial artists such as public enemy tupac shakur ice cube game and kendrick lamar have advocated black liberation in their lyrics many  who refer to these artists as black nationalists while this may be true there are few or no explicit references to black nationalist visions in their lyrics in recent years killer mike and kendrick lamar have released songs criticizing the war on drugs and perceived prison industrial complex from an antiracist perspective hip hop music continues to draw attention to and support of the struggles of minority groups in a modernist method of communication that attracts a young crowd of activists kendrick lamar has also been credited with creating discussions regarding blackness through his music 22antipoverty class struggle and socialism  editparticularly with the advent of gangsta rap many hip hop artists happen to come from underclass backgrounds aforementioned artists such as tupac shakur ice cube and killer mike have made just as much reference to class oppression as racial oppression other political rappers such as public enemy the dope poet society dead prez the coup paris and immortal technique have advocated explicitly communist views —mostly leaning to maoism — whereas some rappers such as lupe fiasco and the lesserknown emcee lynx p o s and sole have advocated anarchist positions political references have long been made in hip hop culture some proving to be effective in spurring constructive discussion and others such as the coup s originally planned album cover for party music —which depicted the destruction of the world trade center to signify the fall of capitalism—receiving negative criticisms although the album art was designed before the september 11 attacks and was changed prior to its november 2001 release 23conspiracy theories  editconspiracy theories have been referenced in hip hop lyrics for some time elements of the fivepercenter philosophy that has fundamentally influenced hip hop culture revolve around conspiracy theories artists such as professor griff jedi mind tricks and hopsin have become infamous for their support of new world order illuminati and satanist conspiracy theories often alleging mainstream hip hop artists such as jayz are involved in such conspiracies other political rappers such as tupac shakur have been heavily critical of conspiracy theories  citation neededviews on religion  editrappers often reference their religious views however outside of fivepercenters and black muslims they rarely translate into political views killer mike however has been heavily critical of organized religion in many of his more political songs 24 chicagoborn rapper kanye west s life of pablo album release is another that offers an outlet for religious expression and selfassessment rap and hip hop music are outlets for whatever creative inner dialogue their creators wish to express and religious beliefs are no exception libertarianism  editpolitical rapper krsone identifies as a libertarian and has voiced support for ron paul 25big boi has also identified as a libertarian and stated he intended out kast s  b o b  as a libertarian antiwar song 26 despite this he has voiced support for social democrat bernie sanders during the 2016 u s presidential election 27dallas rapper eric july is known for his outspoken libertarian views expressed in his lyrics as a solo rapper as well as a member of the rap metal bands back wordz and fire from the gods and has received praise from glenn beck and fox news 28worldwide  editon a global scale hip hops public reputation and exhibition is varied for instance canadas most prominent political hip hop act is the dope poet society who are known for antiracist and antiwar activism as well as denouncing both liberal and conservative politicians their politics could be described as thirdworldism or black internationalism for example in bombay to zimbabwe lead rapper professor d states from bombay to zimbabwe i study sharply bob marley marcus garvey mahatma gandhi black panther party  29 possibly on purpose these influences seem ideologically contradictory in some ways eg for instance marleys subtle socialism vs garveys anticommunism and nonviolence vs violence but taken together they represent different approaches to the shared goal of linking antiracist and anticolonial struggles in the americas and the rest of the world professor d and the dope poet society also seem to represent this ideology on their album by featuring american political rappers like dead prez and others with rappers from around the world including nigeria and columbia other examples of hip hop around the world offer opposite perspectives for example lowkey and iron sheik have expressed antizionist views in their music whereas golan and subliminal have expressed prozionist views 30 in france some political artists such as suprême ntm the female rapper casey or assassin are well known since the early1990s today rappers like kery james la rumeur rocé or médine are influential their lyrics speak about colonialism poverty french history and sometimes conspiracy theories political hip hop scenes  editlatino political hip hop scene  editpolitical rappers of
