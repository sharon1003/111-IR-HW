home  symbol meanings symbol meanings gay lesbian rainbow pride symbols what do they mean the rainbow flag has become the easilyrecognized colors of pride for the gay community the multicultural symbolism of the rainbow is nothing new  jesse jacksons rainbow coalition also embraces the rainbow as a symbol of that political movement the rainbow also plays a part in many myths and stories related to gender and sexuality issues in greek native american african and other cultures use of the rainbow flag by the gay community began in 1978 when it first appeared in the san francisco gay and lesbian freedom day parade borrowing symbolism from the hippie movement and black civil rights groups san francisco artist gilbert baker designed the rainbow flag in response to a need for a symbol that could be used year after year baker and thirty volunteers handstitched and handdyed two huge prototype flags for the parade the flags had eight stripes each color representing a component of the community hot pink for sex red for life orange for healing yellow for sun green for nature turquoise for art indigo for harmony and violet for spirit the next year baker approached san francisco paramount flag company to massproduce rainbow flags for the 1979 parade due to production constraints  such as the fact that hot pink was not a commerciallyavailable color  pink and turquoise were removed from the design and royal blue replaced indigo this sixcolor version spread from san francisco to other cities and soon became the widelyknown symbol of gay pride and diversity it is today it is even officially recognized by the international congress of flag makers in 1994 a huge 30footwide by onemilelong rainbow flag was carried by 10000 people in new yorks stonewall 25 parade the rainbow flag has inspired a wide variety of related symbols such as freedom rings and other accessories there are plenty of variations of the flag including versions with a blue field of stars reminiscent of the american stars and stripes and versions with superimposed lambdas pink triangles or other symbols the bisexual pride flag the pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only gay and lesbian the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only straight and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes bi the key to understanding the symbolism in the bi pride flag is to know that the purple pixels of color blend unnoticeable into both the pink and blue just as in the real world where most bi people blend unnoticeable into both the gaylesbian and straight communities the pink triangle is easily one of the more popular and widelyrecognized symbols for the gay community the pink triangle is rooted in world war ii times and reminds us of the tragedies of that era although homosexuals were only one of the many groups targeted for extermination by the nazi regime it is unfortunately the group that history often excludes the pink triangle challenges that notion and defies anyone to deny history the history of the pink triangle begins before wwii during adolf hitlers rise to power paragraph 175 a clause in german law prohibiting homosexual relations was revised by hitler in 1935 to include kissing embracing and gay fantasies as well as sexual acts convicted offenders  an estimated 25000 just from 1937 to 1939  were sent to prison and then later to concentration camps their sentence was to be sterilized and this was most often accomplished by castration in 1942 hitlers punishment for homosexuality was extended to death each prisoner in the concentration camps wore a colored inverted triangle to designate their reason for incarceration and hence the designation also served to form a sort of social hierarchy among the prisoners a green triangle marked its wearer as a regular criminal a red triangle denoted a political prisoner two yellow triangles overlapping to form a star of david designated a jewish prisoner the pink triangle was for homosexuals a yellow star of david under a superimposed pink triangle marked the lowest of all prisoners  a gay jew stories of the camps depict homosexual prisoners being given the worst tasks and labors pink triangle prisoners were also a proportionally large focus of attacks from the guards and even other inmates although the total number of the homosexual prisoners is not known official nazi estimates were an underwhelming 10000 although homosexual prisoners reportedly were not shipped en masse to the death camps at auschwitz a great number of gay men were among the nonjews who were killed there estimates of the number of gay men killed during the nazi regime range from 50000 to twice that figure when the war was finally over countless many homosexuals remained prisoners in the camps because paragraph 175 remained law in west germany until its repeal in 1969 in the 1970s gay liberation groups resurrected the pink triangle as a popular symbol for the gay rights movement not only is the symbol easily recognized but it draws attention to oppresion and persecution  then and now in the 1980s actup aids coalition to unleash power began using the pink triangle for their cause they inverted the symbol making it point up to signify an active fight back rather than a passive resignation to fate today for many the pink triangle represents pride solidarity and a promise to never allow another holocaust to happen again like the pink triangle the black triangle is also rooted in nazi germany although lesbians were not included in the paragraph 175 prohibition of homosexuality there is evidence to indicate that the black triangle was used to designate prisoners with antisocial behavior considering that the nazi idea of womanhood focused on children kitchen and church black triangle prisoners may have included lesbians prostitutes women who refused to bear children and women with other antisocial traits as the pink triangle is historically a male symbol the black triangle has similarly been reclaimed by lesbians and feminists as a symbol of pride and solidarity the leather pride flag is a symbol for the leather community which encompasses those who are into leather levis sadomasochism bondage and domination uniform cowboys rubber and other fetishes the flag was created by artist tony de blase and first displayed on may 28 1989 at the mr leather contest in chicago although the flag is often common in the gay community it is not a gayonly symbol reportedly gay leather aficionados might also modify a rainbow flag to have a black stripe instead of a violet one however this version might be confused with the victory over aids version of the rainbow flag as they are identical the bear pride flag is a symbol used by some bears gay men marked by an abundance of hair on their face chest and body bears also tend to be older and perhaps larger or chubby there does not seem to be one single symbol that represents bears in general rather there are many symbols that have been adopted by local clubs bars and other bear groups the colors of the flag represent the various types of bears in the culture the transgender pride flag was created by monica helms in 1999 and was first shown at a pride parade in phoenix az us in 2000 the flag represents the transgendered community and consists of five horizontal stripes two light blue two pink and one white in the center ms helms describes the meaning of the transgender flag as followsthe stripes at the top and bottom are light blue the traditional color for baby boys the stripes next to them are pink the traditional color for baby girls the stripe in the middle is white for those who are intersex transitioning or consider themselves having a neutral or undefined gender the pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it it is always correct signifying us finding correctness in our lives the aids awareness ribbon or red ribbon is commonly seen adorning jacket lapels and other articles of clothing as a symbol of solidarity and a commitment to the fight against aids the ribbon project was conceived in 1991 by visual aids a new yorkbased charity group of art professionals that aims to recognize and honor friends and colleagues who have died or are dying of aids visual aids encourages arts organizations museums commercial galleries and aids support groups to commemorate those lost to aids to create greater awareness of aidshiv transmission to publicize the needs of persons with aids and to call for greater funding of services and research inspired by the yellow ribbons honoring american soldiers of the persian gulf war the color red was chosen for its connection to blood and the idea of of passion  not only anger but love like a valentine as stated by frank moore of visual aids worn by host jeremy irons the ribbon made its public debut at the 1991 tony awards and soon became a popular and politically correct fashion statement for celebrities and other awards ceremonies because of this popularity some activists worry that the ribbon has become simple lip service to aids causes in one particular incident the first lady barbara bush wore a red ribbon while sitting in the audience with her husband but when she stood at the presidents side during his speech her ribbon was conspicuously missing however the ribbon project remains a powerful force in spreading awareness of aids and stressing the need for further action and research of the disease the sincerest hope for the ribbon project is that it will one day no longer be needed inspired by the red ribbon the pink ribbon became the symbol for breast cancer awareness although like aids breast cancer is certainly not an issue limited to the gay community the statistics of breast cancer are historically higher in women who do not bear children consequently for some lesbians breast cancer awareness and prevention is a particularly important issue gender symbols are common astrological signs handed down from ancient roman times the pointed mars symbol represents the male and the venus symbol with the cross represents the female double interlocking male symbols have been used by gay men since the 1970s double interlocking female symbols have often been used to denote lesbianism but some feminists have instead used the double female symbols to represent the sisterhood of women these same feminists would use three interlocking female symbols to denote lesbianism also some lesbian feminists of the 1970s used three interlocking female symbols to represent their rejection of male standards of monogamy also in the 1970s gay liberation movements used the male and female symbols superimposed to represent the common goals of lesbians and gay men these days the superimposed symbols might also denote a heterosexual aware of the differences and diversity between men and women a transgendered person might superimpose the male and female symbols in such a way that the arrow and cross join on the same single ring the astrological sign of mercury is traditionally the symbol of transgendered peoples in greek mythology hermes the greek version of the roman god mercury and aphrodite the goddess of love had a child named hermaphroditus that child possessed both male and female sexual organs hence the term hermaphrodite also rituals associated with the worship of aphrodite are believed to have been highly sexual involving castration transvestism and homosexual relations in the symbol itself the crescent moon at the top is supposed to represent the masculine and the cross at the bottom represents the feminine the ring represents the individual with the male and the female balanced at either side the lambda symbol seems to be one of the most controversial of symbols in regards to its meaning there are several differing opinions as to why the lambda was chosen as a gay symbol and what it really means however most sources agree on a few things the lambda was first chosen as a gay symbol when it was adopted in 1970 by the new york gay activists alliance it became the symbol of their growing movement of gay liberation in 1974 the lambda was subsequently adopted by the international gay rights congress held in edinburgh scotland as their symbol for lesbian and gay rights the lambda became internationally popular but where history ends speculation begins no one seems to have a definitive answer why the lambda was originally chosen as a gay symbol some suggest that it is simply the greek lowercase letter l for liberation others disagree citing the use of lambda in physics to denote energy the energy we have when we work in concert or wavelength are gays and lesbians on a different wavelength lambda may also denote the synergy of the gay movement the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts the lambda also may represent scales and balance and the constant force that keeps opposing sides from overcoming each other  the hook at the bottom of the right leg signifies the action needed to reach and maintain balance the ancient greek spartans regarded the lambda to mean unity while the romans considered it the light of knowledge shed into the darkness of ignorance reportedly ancient greeks may have also placed the lambda on shields of gay men and their lovers who were among the fighting elite of the greek army whatever the exact meaning and origin the lambda originally embodied a fairly militant connotation today the symbol generally denotes lesbians and gay mens concerns together although the lambda was never intended to be linked to any specific gender or orientation such as other symbols may be historically this is not so in the early 1970s the los angeles gay community created a flag with a lavender lambda on a simple white background they hoped the flag would catch on to other cities but their hopes were not realized because some saw the lambda as a male symbol only the labrys is a doublesided hatchet or axe commonly used in ancient european african and asian matriarchical societies as both a weapon and a harvesting tool greek artwork depicts the amazon armies of europe wielding labrys weapons amazons ruled with a dualqueen system in which one queen was in charge of the army and battle and the other queen stayed behind to administer the conquered cities amazons were known to be ferocious and merciless in battle but once victorious they ruled with justice today the labrys is a lesbian and feminist symbol of strength and selfsufficiency in addition the labrys also played a part in ancient mythology demeter the goddess of the earth used a labrys as her sceptor rites associated with the worship of the demeter as well as hecate the goddess of the underworld are believed to have involved lesbian sex what does lgbtqi mean l  lesbian g  gay b  bisexual t  transgender q  queer  questioning i  intersex
