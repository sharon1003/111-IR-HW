sunflower cell sunflower cell introduction to my project for my creative writing assignment i chose to do a plant cell the plant cell i chose was a sunflower i chose the sunflower because to me sunflowers are a good representation of plants they are majestic and are a pretty sight to look at introduction to plant cells plant cells include a cell membrane a nucleus ribosomes cytoplasm and cytoskelton rough er smooth er golgi apparatus endoplasmic reticulum lysosomes vacuoles mitochondria a cell wall and chloroplasts cell membrane the cell membrane surrounds the cell this membrane acts like a barrier for the cell meaning that it allows only certain things to pass in or out of the cell but not everything each organelle inside a eukaryotic cell is also surrounded by a membrane these membranes serve as a selective barrier for the organelles each of these membranes like the cell membrane are also made up of lipids nucleus the cell’s nucleus is large and usually close to the center in the cell the nucleus contains most of the cell’s genetic information including its dna which arranges the structure and function of the cell inside the nucleus the cell’s dna is packed together into chromosomes some cells only have one nucleolus inside the nucleus while others have multiple cytoplasm and cytoskeleton cytoplasm is the thick fluid that fills up a cell and surrounds all of the organelles it is a mixture of water and dissolved salts ions and organic molecules with new and improved microscope technology scientists discovered a network of fibers throughout the cell which are called cytoskeleton the fibers of the cytoskeleton give the cell shape anchor many of the organelles in place and direct the movement of organelles ribosomes ribosomes are where protein synthesis occurs within a cell these small organelles are made in the nucleolus and are found in two main locations within a cell free ribosomes are found separated within the cell’s cytoplasm while bound ribosomes are found attached to another organelle called the rough endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes are made up of rna and protein molecules whether a ribosome is connected or free its job is to synthesize proteins genetic information is copied from the cell’s dna in the nucleus and carried by messenger rna to the ribosomes this is where the construction of large protein molecules occurs these proteins are then released to the areas that require them cells that need to produce a lot of protein have a greater number of ribosomes than other cells locations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 cell membrane nucleus cytoplasm and cytoskeleton ribosomes endoplasmic reticulum rough er smooth er golgi apparatus lysosomes vacuoles mitochondria cell wall chloroplasts rough er the rough endoplasmic reticulum appears rough because its surface is covered by small ribosomes these ribosomes synthesize proteins and the membrane of the rough er keeps those proteins separate from the rest of the cell in addition to making and storing proteins the rough er makes its own proteins and phospholipids to add to its membrane endoplasmic reticulum the endoplasmic reticulum also known as the er is a maze of membranes so long that it is more than half of the total membrane found in the cell it is divided into two distinct sections that differ in structure and function smooth er the smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not have any ribosomes on its membrane its specific functions vary depending on the specializations of the cell where it is located the smooth er participates in various things including the construction of lipids the deconstruction of carbohydrates and the detoxification of substances that may otherwise be harmful to the cell golgi apparatus the golgi apparatus is made up of stacks of membrane sacs transport vesicles carrying proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum enter the golgi apparatus to be modified and stored vesicles that bud off of the endoplasmic reticulum attach to the golgi apparatus’s membrane the membrane and contents of the transport vesicle become incorporated into the golgi apparatus where the protein contents are then modified and stored at the other end of the golgi apparatus new vesicles will form and be sent off to carry materials to other places in the cell as needed lysosomes a lysosome is a membrane sac that contains enzymes these enzymes are used to digest or break down large molecules into smaller molecules to be used by the cell lysosomes and the enzymes they contain are both made in the rough er and are then transferred to the golgi apparatus a cell contains a variety of lysosomes each containing different enzymes that break down a specific type of macromolecule vacuoles vacuoles are membraneenclosed sacs that serve a variety of storage functions food vacuoles store food and nutrients that pass through the cell membrane while water vacuoles store water minerals and ions vacuoles and vesicles are both membraneenclosed sacs but vacuoles are usually larger mitochondria a mitochondrion is enclosed in a layer of two membranes the inner layer has folds in the membrane called cristae while the outer layer is smooth the folds in the inner membrane provide an area where important reactions occur allowing each mitochondrion to do more work mitochondria are often called the powerhouse of the cell the chemical reactions that break down the nutrients release energy to power the cell one of the most important reactions that occur in the mitochondria is called cellular respiration nearly all eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria some have one single mitochondrion but more often cells have hundreds or even thousands of mitochondria the number of mitochondria in a cell relate to its metabolic activity or the amount of energy it needs cell wall a cell wall is one component of plant cells that is not found in animal cells a cell wall surrounds the cell membrane and provides an additional layer of protection for plant cells due to its makeup a mixture of cellulose polysaccharides and imbedded proteins the cell wall is able to help keep the shape of the cell and helps to prevent too much intake or loss of water chloroplasts chloroplasts are found in plant cells but not in animal cells they are green in color because they contain the green pigment chlorophyll chloroplasts are enclosed by a double membrane and contain a system of membranes arranged in stacks of flattened sacs this is where reactions occur chloroplasts are important because they convert energy from sunlight into chemical energy the cell can use this process is called photosynthesis chloroplasts use energy from the sun to make glucose which is an important energy source for plants and animals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 rough er with ribosomes sunflower cell example chloroplasts vacule cell wall full transcript more presentations by megan jempson ma vie by megan jempson ma
