furnace blower fan on 100 of the time  good or bad or it depends posted by tj ewing on november 20 2010 at 422pm in hvacback to hvac discussions i was at a dinner party last night and two guests described how their hvac reps told them to run their furnace blowers 100 of the time the hvac reps reasons for the recommendation as relayed by the dinner guests were 1 continuous running reduces the wear and tear on the blower motor that cycling on and off causes thereby avoiding an earlier motor replacement2 circulating the air around the home provides better balanced temperatures throughout the home and3 continuous air flow would provide cleaner air due to the continuous filtering we live in northern michigan and are a heating dominate climate i am curious to hear from the hvac professionals about what they recommend to their clients and why at the moment i dont buy the above arguments and feel those customers end up paying more in energy costs for little benefit however i do understand there is no disputing tastes when talking about perceived comfort also if anyone knows of a good source or any research done on this issue i would like to see a more in depth analysis if its out there note neither home has an erv hrv or other mechanical ventilation other than intermittent bath and kitchen fans both are natural gas forced air furnaces any discussion on this subject thankstjtags hvac iaq energy motors like0 members like this share tweet views 264373
