the math behind web analytics mean trend minmax standard deviation in the second installment of this series we will leverage excel to take over where google analytics left us the math behind web analytics the basics basic charting in excel the very first thing to do is to show the data as a simple line graph for this post i simply used visits to my blog in january of 2011 after some minor visual adjustments we end up with something like this figure a simple excel charting figure b time series visitsthere are already some striking things peaks  valleys corresponding to weekdays and weekends and a week apparently performing better than others now we can easily apply some basic statistics on our time series mean the mean wikipedia is often referred to as the average which in reality is the arithmetic mean this is very simple math add all the numbers and divide by the number of data points look at figure c  what can you tell about the red line crossing the whole graph in a time series like daily visits for a month honestly we cant tell much yet only averages are reported by most web analytics tools  so please dont even bother saying the average number of visits this month was xfigure c showing mean trend min  max and control limits learning point the average is rarely a good indicator in a time series such as those found in web analytics because it is influenced by extreme values known as outliers wikipedia at best in the case above one might want to calculate the mean for weekdays and the mean for weekends as a rule of thumb if you have less than 30 data points use the median figure d descriptive statistics median and mode the median wikipedia is the middle value the mode wikipedia on the other end is the value appearing the most frequently again in a time series where the spread of values the standard deviation explained below is large those descriptive statistics wikipedia figure d are usually of little interest min  max the min and max values are well the maximum and minimum values in a time series those could be qualified as anecdotes  we could be thrilled weve got so much traffic on a single day or deceived by a poorly performing day but knowing that has absolutely no value if we cant explain why in the time series used in this example the min value is 93 visits on saturday january 1st what can we tell about that obviously people were busy doing something else than visiting my blog what happened during the 4th week around january 25 i shared my views about our little web analytics community and recounted my contributions in both cases we have very plausible explanations and the min  max values were useful only because they made us ask why trend to me the linear trend wikipedia shown as a dotted line in figure b is one of the interesting modeling stats because it marks the begining of our regression analysis wikipedia capabilities  our ability to explain the whys and this therefore that basically it can help us do some predictive analytics albeit very simple remember y  mx  b that is the position of a point on the y axis the visits depends on a factor of x the day plus a starting baseline i can tell based on historical data that i should get approximately 350 visits next tuesday standard deviation if we do max  min we get the range wikipedia another descriptive statistic interesting at best whats much more interesting is the standard deviation wikipedia  the variability of the data as weve seen the average isnt of much use because it is largely influenced by outliers standard deviation gives an appreciation of the spread of values around the mean or if you prefer the variation in a distribution of values why is this important figure e control limits at  15 sigma first because standard deviation will be used to set control limits wikipedia figure e  which in turn will be useful to define our tolerance and targets covered in a later post while control limits are typically set to  3 times the standard deviation from the mean  i have found  15 times for a total of 3 to provide a better and easier indicator of values going below or above our historical track record shown as the grayed area in figure b basically it gives us an easy way to set alerts when our metric might be going out of whack secondly a large variation is an indication of an unstable process think conversion rate or low reproductibitiliy anecdotal campaign success or if you prefer a larger standard deviation reduces our ability to predict the value of y given a certain x basically as analysts we want to explain the past but we also want to provide insight on how to fix issues and seize opportunities  we eventually want to be able to predict outcomes of our recommendations coming up normal distribution histogram and boxplots in the next installment well look at what is an histogram as well as normal distribution and their impact on our analysis also although nifty spinning 3dshadowedshinyflash graphs are impressive well look at box plots elegant simplicity yet powerful and underused visualization tool what do you think of this series so far what would you like to see
