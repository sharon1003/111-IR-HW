in a long time28 september 2012  by nzalewski – see all my reviews i know there are a lot of us out there that claim overall movie fandom and to me its not measured by how many movies you own or how many youve seen in most cases its what a movie invokes after you watch it after seeing the trailer and being overly anxious i finally watched the revenant and to say it blew my mind would be an understatement to pigeon hole it as just a horrorcomedy doesnt really do it justice either d kerry prior has taken a great concept and through the superb storytelling and visual aesthetics has brought this terrific movie full circle the end really justifies all that the characters would be put through you really buy into actors chris wylde and david anders as friends and the conversations feel very real i have been telling everyone i know about this movie because i think it is one that can be enjoyed across genres and needs to be seen11 of 12 people found this review helpful was this review
