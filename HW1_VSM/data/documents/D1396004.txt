after which ventricular relaxation ventricular diastole begins 1the systole  ˈ s ɪ s t əl iː  is that part of the cardiac cycle during which some chambers of the heart muscle contract after refilling with blood 2 the term systole originates from new latin via ancient greek συστολή sustolē from συστέλλειν sustellein to contract via σύν syn together  στέλλειν stellein send the use of systole to contract is very similar to the use of the english term to squeeze the mammalian heart has four chambers the left atrium above the left ventricle lighter pink see graphic which two are connected through the mitral or bicuspid valve and the right atrium above the right ventricle lighter blue connected through the tricuspid valve the atria are the receiving chambers for the circulation of blood and the ventricles are the discharging chambers when in late ventricular diastole the atrial chambers contract they send blood down to the larger lower ventricle chambers when normal flow is completed the ventricles are filled and the valves to the atria are closed the ventricles now perform systole isovolumetrically which is contraction while all valves are closed—ending the first stage of systole the second stage proceeds immediately pumping oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aortic valve and aorta to all body systems and simultaneously pumping oxygenpoor blood from the right ventricle through the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery to the lungs thus the pairs of chambers upper atria and lower ventricles contract in alternating sequence to each other first the two atria feed blood simultaneously into the ventricles which two contracting together then pump blood out of the heart to the body systems including the lungs for resupply of oxygen cardiac systole is the contraction of the cardiac muscle in response to an electrochemical stimulus to the hearts cells  cardiomyocytes  cardiac output co is the volume of blood pumped by the left ventricle in one minute the ejection fraction ef is the volume of blood pumped divided by the total volume of blood in the left ventricle 3contents  hide 1 types of systole11 atrial systole111 right and left atrial

see also5 references6 external links types of systole  editatrial systole  editthe cardiac cycle at beginning of atrial systole the left red and right blue ventricles begin to fill during ventricular diastole then after tracing the p wave of the ecg the two atria begin contracting systole pulsing blood under pressure into the ventricles atrial systole occurs late in ventricular diastole and represents the contraction of myocardium of the left and right atria the sharp decrease in ventricular pressure that occurs during ventricular diastole allows the atrioventricular valves or mitral and tricuspid valves to open and causes the contents of the atria to empty into the ventricles the atrioventricular valves remain open while the aortic and pulmonary valves remain closed because the pressure gradient between the atrium and ventricle is preserved during late ventricular diastole atrial contraction confers a minorfraction addition to ventricular filling but becomes significant in left ventricular hypertrophy or thickening of the heart wall as the ventricle does not fully relax during its diastole loss of normal electrical conduction in the heart—as seen during atrial fibrillation atrial flutter and complete heart block —may eliminate atrial systole completely contraction of the atria follows depolarization represented by the p wave of the ecg as both atrial chambers contract—from the superior region of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum—pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular valves at the start of atrial systole during ventricular diastole the ventricles are normally filled to about 70 – 80 percent of capacity by inflow from the atria atrial contraction also referred to as the atrial kick contributes the remaining 20 – 30 percent of ventricular filling atrial systole lasts approximately 100 ms and ends prior to ventricular systole as the atrial muscle returns to diastole 4the two ventricles are isolated electrically and histologically tissuewise from the two atrial chambers by electrically impermeable collagen layers of connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton the cardiac skeleton is made of dense connective tissue which gives structure to the heart by forming the atrioventricular septum —which separates the atria from the ventricles—and the fibrous rings which serve as bases for the four heart valves 5 collagen extensions from the valve rings seal and limit electrical activity of the atria from influencing electrical pathways that cross the ventricles these electrical pathways contain the sinoatrial node the atrioventricular node and the purkinje fibers exceptions such as accessory pathways may occur in this firewall between atrial and ventricular electrical influence but are rare cardiac rate control via pharmacology is common today for example the therapeutic use of digoxin beta adrenoceptor antagonists or calcium channel blockers are important historical interventions in this condition notably individuals prone to hypercoagulability abnormality of blood coagulation are at decided risk of blood clotting a very serious pathology requiring therapy for life with an anticoagulant if it cannot be corrected right and left atrial systoles  editthe atrial chambers each contains one valve the tricuspid valve in the right atrium opens into the right ventricle and the mitral or bicuspid valve in the left atrium opens into the left ventricle both valves are pressed open during the late stages of ventricular diastole see wiggers diagram at the pqrs phase at right margin then the contractions of atrial systole cause the right ventricle to fill with oxygendepleted blood through the tricuspid valve when the right atrium is emptied—or prematurely closed—right atrial systole ends and this stage signals the end of ventricular diastole and the beginning of ventricular systole see wiggers diagram the time variable for the right systolic cycle is measured from tricuspid valveopen to valveclosed the contractions of atrial systole fill the left ventricle with oxygenenriched blood through the mitral valve when the left atrium is emptied or closed left atrial systole is ended and ventricular systole is about to begin the time variable for the left systolic cycle is measured from mitral valveopen to valveclosed atrial fibrillation  editmain article atrial fibrillation atrial fibrillation represents a common electrical malady in the heart that appears during the time interval of atrial systole see figure at right margin theory suggests that an ectopic focus usually situated within the pulmonary trunks competes with the sinoatrial node for electrical control of the atrial chambers and thereby diminishes the performance of the atrial myocardium or atrial heart muscle the ordered sinoatrial control of atrial electrical activity is disrupted causing the loss of coordinated generation of pressure in the two atrial chambers atrial fibrillation represents an electricallydisordered but well perfused atrial mass working in an uncoordinated fashion with a comparatively electricallyhealthy ventricular systole the compromised load caused by atrial fibrillation detracts from the overall performance of the heart but the ventricles continue to work as an effective pump given this pathology the ejection fraction may deteriorate by ten to thirty percent uncorrected atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates approaching 200 beats per minute bpm if this rate can be slowed to a normal range say about 80 bpm the resultant longer filltime within the cardiac cycle restores or improves the pumping capability of the heart the labored breathing for example of individuals with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation can often be returned to normal by electrical or medical cardioversion ventricular systole and wiggers diagram  edita wiggers diagram showing various events during systole here primarily displayed as ventricular systole or ventricular contraction  the very short interval about 003 second of isovolumetric or fixedvolume contraction begins see upper left at the r peak of the qrs complex on the electrocardiogram graphline  ejection phase begins immediately after isovolumetric contraction—ventricular volume red graphline begins to decrease as ventricular pressure light blue graphline continues to increase then pressure drops as it enters diastole a wiggers diagram of ventricular systole graphically depicts the sequence of contractions by the myocardium of the two ventricles ventricular systole induces selfcontraction such that pressure in both left and right ventricles rises to a level above that in the two atrial chambers thereby closing the tricuspid and mitral valves—which are prevented from inverting by the chordae tendineae and the papillary muscles now ventricular pressure continues to rise in isovolumetric or fixedvolume contraction phase until maximal pressure d pdt  0 occurs causing the pulmonary and aortic valves to open in ejection phase in ejection phase blood flows from the two ventricles down its pressure gradient—that is down from higher pressure to lower pressure—into and through the aorta and the pulmonary trunk respectively notably cardiac muscle perfusion through the hearts coronary vessels doesnt happen during ventricular systole rather it occurs during ventricular diastole ventricular systole is the origin of the pulse right and left ventricular systoles  editthe pulmonary or pulmonic valve in the right ventricle opens into the pulmonary trunk also known as the pulmonary artery which divides twice to connect to each of the left and right lungs in the left ventricle the aortic valve opens into the aorta which divides and redivides into the several branch arteries that connect to all body organs and systems except the lungs by its contractions right ventricular rv systole pulses oxygendepleted blood through the pulmonary valve through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs providing pulmonary circulation simultaneously left ventricular lv systole pumps blood through the aortic valve the aorta and all the arteries to provide systemic circulation of oxygenated blood to all body systems the left ventricular sytole enables blood pressure to be routinely measured in the larger arteries off the left ventricle of the heart lv systole is volumetrically defined as the left ventricular ejection fraction lvef similarly rv systole is defined as the right ventricular ejection fraction rvef higher than normal rvef is indicative of pulmonary hypertension the time variables of the ventricular systoles are right ventricle pulmonary valveopen to valveclosed left ventricle aortic valveopen to valveclosed electrical systole  editmain article electrical conduction system of the heart the sinoatrial node is the hearts natural pacemaker issuing electrical signalling that travels through the heart muscle causing it to contract repeatedly in cycle it is situated at the top of the right atrium adjacent to the junction with the superior vena cava 6 intact the sa node provides continual electrical discharge known as sinus rhythm through the atrial mass the signals of which then coalesce at the atrioventricular node there to be organized to provide a rhythmic electrical pulse into and across the ventricles through sodium potassium or calciumgated ion channels the continual rhythmic discharge generates a wavelike movement of electrical ripples that stimulate the smooth muscles of the myocardium and cause rhythmic contractions to progress from top to bottom of the heart as the pulse moves out of the upper atria into the lower ventricles it is distributed throughout a muscular network to cause systolic contraction of both ventricular chambers simultaneously the actual pace of the cycle—just how fast or slowly the heart beats—is cued by messages from the brain reflecting the brains responses to conditions of the body such as pain emotional stress level of activity and to ambient conditions including external temperature time of day etc 7mechanical systole  editelectrical systole opens voltagegated sodium potassium and calcium channels in cells of myocardium tissue subsequently a rise in intracellular calcium triggers the interaction of actin and myosin in the presence of atp which generates mechanical force in the cells in the form of muscular contraction or mechanical systole the contractions generate intraventricular pressure which is increased until it exceeds the external residual pressures in the adjacent trunks of both the pulmonary artery and the aorta this stage in turn causes the pulmonary and aortic valves to open blood is then ejected from the two ventricles pulsing into both the pulmonic and aortic circulation systems 8mechanical systole causes the pulse which itself is readily palpated felt or seen at several points on the body enabling universally adopted methods—by touch or by eye—for observing systolic blood pressure the mechanical forces of systole cause rotation of the muscle mass around the long and short axes a process which can be observed as a wringing of the ventricles physiological mechanism  editsystole of the heart is initiated by electrically excitable cells situated in the sinoatrial node these cells are activated spontaneously by depolarization of the electrical potential across their cell membranes which causes voltagegated calcium channels on the cell membrane to open and allow calcium ions to pass through into the sarcoplasm cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells calcium ions bind to molecular receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum see graphic which causes a flux flow of calcium ions into the sarcoplasm calcium ions bind to troponin c causing a conformational ie structural change in the troponintropomyosin protein complex causing the myosin head binding sites on factin filamentous proteins to be exposed which causes muscle contraction to occur the cardiac action potential spreads distally or outwardly to the small branches of the purkinje tree via the flux of cations through gap junctions that connect the sarcoplasms of adjacent myocytes the electrical activity of ventricular systole is coordinated by the atrioventricular node which is a discrete collection of cells that receives electrical stimulation from the left and right atria and can provide an intrinsic albeit slower heart pacemaker activity the cardiac action potential is propagated down electrical pathways through the bundle of his to the purkinje fibres this electrical flux causes coordinated depolarisation and excitationcontraction coupling from the apex of the heart up to the roots of the great vessels clinical notation  editwhen blood pressure is stated for medical purposes it is usually written with the systolic and diastolic pressures separated by a slash for example 12080 mm hg this clinical notation is not a mathematical figure for a fraction or ratio nor a display of a numerator over a denominator rather it is a medical notation showing the two clinically significant pressures involved systole followed by diastole it is often shown followed by a third number the value of the heart rate in beats per minute which typically is measured jointly with blood pressure readings see also  editwiggers
