landscaping basics columbine flowers are you hawkish or dovish by david beaulieu updated 041717share pin email david beaulieu taxonomy botany of columbine flowers plant taxonomy classifies columbine plants in general as aquilegia for instance aquilegia canadensis is the red columbine but there are a number of different species and cultivars see below this flower is in the buttercup family columbine plants are herbaceous flowering perennials qualities of columbine plants some of the different types columbines come in many colors some are even bicolored these perennials can have red yellow white blue pink salmon or purple blossoms they are airy plants with attractive foliage cloverlike when young their height will vary depending upon growing conditions and upon the particular type in question but on average they reach around 2 feet in height taller when in full bloom by a similar width they bloom in late spring to early summer and selfseed readily if you do not deadhead them what makes the flowers of this genus so interesting is the presence on most but not all kinds of socalled spurs what do these spurs look like in the photo provided take a look at the right side of the flower do you see those long narrow strips running horizontally those are the spurs other than a canadensis types include all are coldhardy to usda zone 3 a alpina blue flowers a vulgaris var stellata black barlow one of the darkest blooms a vulgaris clementine salmonrose salmoncolored blooms that lack spurs and look like the blossoms on a doubleflowered clematis a vulgaris magpie

there are columbine flowers native to many lands a canadensis for instance is native to the woods of eastern north america it is a wildflower often remarked upon by hikers for its bluishgreen foliage but there are types native to the western united states to europe and to asia as well there are plenty of exceptions but  partial shade  is the standard recommendation for columbine plants grow them in welldrained ground and try to mix some compost into the soil often living on rocky ledges in the wild the drought resistance displayed by such columbine flowers as a canadensis makes them good candidates for xeriscaping problems outstanding characteristics for this perennial the leaves of columbine plants often bear the doodling of leaf miners the larvae of a kind of insect but the damage usually is not serious and gives the foliage a sort of randomly  variegated  look that may be appealing to some gardeners if this is your opinion there is no need to take action against the leaf miners there are plenty of insects that do greater damage to plants in your landscaping that you should concentrate your pestcontrol efforts on instead if you really feel the need to control leaf miners keep an eye out for the first signs of doodling once you spot any just inspect the leaves for the larvae and crush them with your fingers other than this minor issue the perennial is subject to few problems for gardeners who truly dislike the doodling done by leaf miners this pest problem is nonetheless more than offset by the positive characteristics of the plant because columbine has colorful flowers it gives your yard a lot of interest in spring but of greater or equal value is the odd shape of columbine flowers besides their trademark spurs columbine flowers nod their heads down and their centers sometimes take on a honeycomb look another good feature is that columbine is among the easytogrow plants uses in landscaping how to care for the plants once established columbine plants are droughttolerant perennials this makes them perfect for rock gardens or woodland gardens their attractive foliage suits them to use as edging plants they have also frequently been used in cottage gardens  columbine flowers are said to resemble jesters caps and their effectiveness at attracting hummingbirds will certainly put bird watchers in a merry mood when you bring your plant back from the garden center remember to plant it so as to keep it at the same depth in the ground as it was in its pot a deeper planting could result in crown rot if you are installing multiple plants spacing will generally be 12 feet care for these perennials largely comes down to the question to deadhead or not to deadhead if you do not deadhead the resulting seed production will sap the strength of your columbine plants and they will decline and die out in about three years but there is a tradeoff columbine flowers are great reseeders not deadheading will result in plenty of replacements if on the other hand you do not wish for your perennial to spread then you have a second reason to deadhead another care tip you can use to help your columbine to perform at its best is to mulch the plants so as to conserve water in summer interesting facts origin of the common name latin name the scientific name aquilegia the genus name comes from the latin word for eagle aquila it is easy to understand this word origin the spurs can remind one of the outstretched talons of an eagle or hawk the hawkish origin of the scientific name is however somewhat at odds with the origin of the common name columbine from the latin columba  which refers to doves apparently some find a resemblance in the inverted columbine flower to five doves nestled together landscaping basics spanish bluebells
