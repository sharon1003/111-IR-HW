the nazi nicknamed the angel of death stood before him with a stick pointing it to a line to the left or right as each person approached him wolnerman then 13 noticed that the old young and sickly

from the camp and what a life all these years he has acutely understood the slim margin between death and life it affected every day the way he worked and the spoiled food he couldnt throw away because he couldnt bear to waste it in the concentration camp they didnt talk much because they didnt know what was going on in the world or even know what day or year it was we had no mind you had mind like cow wolnerman said in his broken english the only thing we could think was bread bread bread “they saved my life i never forgot this”david wolnerman they got two slices a day if a boy took the bread of another a shovel handle was held to his throat he said because stealing bread was like a death sentence to the theft victim he worked in the crematorium and gas chambers and watched them throw the live ones in the oven he loaded cement blocks on trucks and he prayed he listened to boys tell of their castrations and watched people die like flies he wondered about his mother back in modrzejow poland only about 30 miles from auschwitz his father had died three months before the war and when the nazis came he was told that to save his family he must report to the work camp he would later find out that his mother hannah brother abraham and sister gertrude died in concentration camps inside he could really think only of survival he moved from one camp to another — birkenau to theresienstadt to dachau and others — and once a lice infestation grew so bad that he contracted typhus at one point with no food or medicine or water he was waiting to die in a wooden bunk without straw beside another sick boy one day a nazi ss soldier appeared at the bunk lifted up the boy and threw him out the window i thought he was sleeping wolnerman said but i had been lying next to a boy that was dead for two weeks somehow — by gods grace he thinks — he survived holocaust survivor remembers all nazis werent badhis group in camp followed the counsel of an older boy who one day turned to them all with a question what would you do if the germans said you could have all the bread you want but we will shoot you after you eat it every boy said then give me bread and shoot me  wolnerman recalled because i never thought id be free in later years he often thought about the older boy who had become a father figure to him because he was wise to the ways of the camp he said he would eat the bread too he was freed by american soldiers on april 29 1945 he was only 80 pounds he said the soldiers gave them rations and the boys shoveled them down and threw up all night their digestive systems so unaccustomed to food he settled in a displaced persons camp outside munich and every day he went to a group of catholic nuns for breakfast he asked for bread and was given five spoons of oatmeal the next day he asked for bread and was given six spoons of oatmeal each day their stomachs were readied for more food lost friedmann portrait tells holocaust survival talethey saved my life i never forgot this wolnerman said i was like a brother to them later in life two nuns from africa were brought to my house and they came back to have coffee and cookies and pray with me and my wife i never forget the nuns every day for five years i go to nuns during his five years in postwar germany he met his wife jennie at the displaced persons camp she had survived the concentration camp because a female nazi guard took a liking to her and brought her a bowl of soup every day which she shared a spoon at a time with her fellow prisoners he said the guard even offered her a chance to leave but she wouldnt abandon her friends as his recovery continued for two years one day he met another survivor who was an old friend of his brothers i dont believe in god anymore the man told wolnerman who was surprised because he thought the man would one day be a rabbi where was god when they were throwing away the kids alive 5 months old 1 year old i believe in god more than i ever did
