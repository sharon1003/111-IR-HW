dna structure image by madprime via wikimedia commons a closer look at the chemical structure of dna includes the four nitrogenous bases adenine a thymine t guanine g and cytosine c dna also includes sugars and phosphate groups that make the phosphatedeoxyribose backbone if you think of the structure of dna as a twisted ladder the rungs of the ladder are made from the nitrogenous bases these bases pair up to make each step of the ladder they also only pair up in a specific way a always pairs with t and g always pairs with c this is very important when it is time to duplicate all or part of the dna to make a copy the dna only needs to unzip the bases into single strands each single strand then pairs with the correct complimentary base to create a new doublestranded piece of dna dna shape the most common dna shape illustrated by artists and scientist looks a lot like a twisting ladder scientist call this a double helix dna also folds and coils itself into more complex shapes the coiled shape makes it very small in fact it is small enough to easily fit inside any of our cells this is a pretty amazing feat when you find out that the dna from one cell if unfolded would stretch out to a length of six feet dna does more than store information it is also able to make copies of itself to do this it first has to unzip the nitrogenous bases all the pairs of at and gc are separated the dna then has two single strands at this point new pairs are made along with a phosphate backbone to create two new copies of dna the copies will match because only a pairs with t and g pairs only with c additional images by nih
