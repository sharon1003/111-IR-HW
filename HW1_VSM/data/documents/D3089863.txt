found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this i honestly cannot see why anybody would like this rubbish over the original whereas the 1971 version sparkled with innocence charm and magic this monstrosity will leave you feeling violently ill and internally disturbed by the time the closing credits roll let me begin by saying i dont personally enjoy tim burtons style and didnt like the dark influence he brought to this film depps wonka is perhaps the creepiest character ive ever watched in a movie unlike gene wilders eccentric yet loving wonka he openly expresses his disgust and hatred towards the children one need only watch the scene in which a shrunken mike teavee is nearly stabbed by a viciousfaced oompaloompa or the one in which veruca salt is dragged screaming into the garbage chute while wonka pretends he cannot find the right key to let mr salt into save his daughter to understand wonkas cruelty in the original wonka seemed merely disappointed and bored during the childrens accidents and he always kept his head he knew no harm would befall the young troublemakers here we see wonka laughing dancing and cheering as the oompa loompas sing about children being turned into chocolate and eaten the scenes of the four naughty childrens punishments were incredibly disturbing and the jokes about cannibalism just made me cringe at the stupidity of it all charlie bucket who should have been the main character was a disappointment throughout most of the film he seems rather expressionless and bored unlike the genuine and honest boy played by peter ostrum in the original movie the 1971 charlie had a dream he wanted more than his povertystricken life he strived to help his family out of tight situations he wasnt perfect but he was a believable character and thats what made him so lovable he was just like us all this charlie doesnt seem to care about anything he seems perfectly happy with his life and hardly seems to care about getting a golden ticket the other children are equally disappointing violet beauregarde manages to pull off her characters fairly well but even so she had little to work with the songs in the original were hopeful and inspiring such as the charming candy man and ive got a golden ticket the heartwarming cheer up charlie and the magnificent pure imagination in this new versionthe only songs we get are a cheesy welcome song in which childlike puppets explode and melt into ghoulish wraith like figures plus the nauseating oompaloompa filth the emotional 1971 ending with wonka charlie and grandpa goe in the elevator has been replaced with wonka refusing the other buckets to enter the factory becoming a hobo and eventually reuniting with his abusive dentist father  in a short review with a maximum of 1 000 words i simply cant do justice to the badness of this movie so ill leave it at this the old movie has a positive and uplifting message that will bring tears to even the coldest eye this one crushes the viewer down into the dust while screaming its message into their face so unless you enjoy stupid jokes children in despair and nauseating songs dont waste any money on this soulless emotionally disturbing piece of filth 1 10this film is just wrong and horrible steve h 4 july 2006warning spoilers89 out of 119 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this first of its important to say that i am a roald dahl fan and indeed a fan of the original 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory what that film and the work of roald dahl have in common is charm warmth eccentricity etc this tim burton film does not share in any of it having sat and forced myself to watch the entire film hoping something good would happen i was left feeling nothing but empty i enjoyed most of tim burtons work and was rather excited about this film when it was announced the trailers never gave away too much and i kept on hoping right up until the credits rolled so whats so bad about it then my first massive problem with the film is the reactions from the children through the film were they sedated during filming watch the scene where they tear down the chocolate river in the boiled sweet boat does one of them even scream in delight are they not amazed they are on a boat made from candy on a river of flowing chocolate most of the time they stand there looking like they would rather be somewhere else how are we supposed to believe in the wonder of this amazing factory if the kids there arent even impressed too much blue screen work perhaps means the poor actors had nothing to be amazed at my second not quite as massive problem with the film is burtons muse johnny depp perhaps their relationship is getting stale but depps performance as willy wonka was nothing but irritating less eccentric more pathetic the creepy grey skin luminous teeth puppy dog eyes and hushed voice all add up to a character that i was bored of in the first 5 minutes after seeing him the ridiculous back story of his childhood was totally superfluous and added nothing to the film its like burton really wasnt trying why does wonka love candy hmmmm maybe his father was a wicked dentist who wouldnt let him eat it i could get christopher lee to play him get on to casting wonka was supposed to be a man with years and years of experience behind him a weathered eccentric not an excitablesedated puppy point number 3 the music perhaps the worst score to a film i have ever heard danny elfman shame on you ok so they wanted to bring the songs up to date but jeez the music is just bad the incidental music is bad also its all bad 4 the oompa loompas this really made me sad really sad so in the revised book they are like miniature cavemen in the 1971 film they are crazy psychedelic dwarfs in this film they are one man one dwarf burton employed him in big fish he did ok there but he is so wrong for the part of an oompa loompa and why does he have to play all of them another gimmick that i suspect burton really didnt waste any time over coming up with his expressionless face might have worked as a sad clown but the cheeky oompa loompas i think not there were a few god points the authenticity minus the stupid flashbacks i loved seeing the candy boat in all its glory the fudge mountain  an actual glass elevator rather than the weird gold thing in the 1971 film but who really cares about all these things when not one person in the film seemed to be impressed by it did the crew record dry run rehearsals by accident  by the way the original elevator of the book didnt have rockets on the side it used sky hooks and was powered by sugar but kids would just laugh at that right it was nice to see charlies dad regardless of the fact he is of no importance to the film the sets were ok but lacked any real wow factor basically if you took burtons script chucked out all the nonsense hired a new director kept the sets and gave them a bit more wow and hired a new sound guy and told everyone to smile and have a laugh it wouldnt be that bad but that didnt happen mores the pity ok so one day say 30 years from now i will make it again its the only way i can resolve my issues with this disaster in short if you are a roald dahl fan and like the 1971 film do not watch this honestly i regret ever seeing it nothing could be sweeter alexis griffin84 12 july 2005growing up my favorite book was easily charlie  the chocolate factory roald dahls magical tale of a young boys adventure in the strange factory was spellbinding though i never had a problem with the original willy wonka move with gene wilder despite how unfaithful it was it was still a cute and heartwarming movie i was doing backflips when i heard tim burton quite possibly my alltime favorite director would helm a new version of the movie first and foremost johnny depp is perfect as willy wonka what people dont really pick up from the first movie is that wonka was intended to be well crazy he was eccentric and freaky the way he allowed the rotten children to get what they deserved and protected his factory like it was his child gene wilder portrayed wonka more like a fatherlyfigure and really was just too nice depp pulls out all of the stops as a new willy wonka though there are times that any audience member will get just a bit freaked out what i loved most about the movie was how faithful it was to the book everything that was mentioned from the chocolate palace to the hair toffee was taken directly from the book i was incredibly impressed this is definitely a movie for everyone especially those of us who hold the original tale in our hearts wonka chocolate bars for all 409 out of 589 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no

delight dont expect a bleak remake of the amusing and rather psychedelic 1971version it is in every way a genuine tim burtonmovie stacked with beautiful imagery wacky humor and bizarre characters but at the same time faithful enough to the spirit of the novel roald dahl wouldve been proud it also features outstanding performances by the entire cast johnny depp gives us a strange almost creepy willy wonka freddie highmore is a perfect charlie the grandparents are lovable and wacky and the five other children and their parents are amusingly irritating and last but not least an excellent

helpful yes no report this this is a horrible horrible version of this movie where in the hell in the book does wonka talk to his father and the part where wonka denies charlie the factory because he wants to bring his family absolutely ridiculous wonka is supposed to be an inspiration not a jerk who has a magical moment with his father the characters are just completely screwed up why on earth would this remake even be considered good my next problem oompa loompas where did this freakin idea come from this movie may have been considered good only if you have never seen one the original movie two you have never read the book and three you have never seen a johnny depp movie all around a horrible movie never waste you time renting this 1 102005 a film tragedyflyingcandy 9 february 2007warning spoilers52 out of 69 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this this movie was simply awful i am waiting for someone anyone to point out that johnny depp was just terrible the first twenty minutes in a grandiose fashion leads us to a giant man named willy wonka who can put the world on its toes by putting gold tickets inside five candy bars then when you meet wonka hes nothing johnny depp is as pale as a sheet im not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth but his acting hes doing an imitation of jim carrey doing an imitation of michael jackson his wonka not believable at all the kids are just bad rich and bad you get the whole hollywood push of rich kids are evil while poor kids are perfect meanwhile what about the children of hollywood actors and producers and directors are they exempt because their parents are artists instead of capitalists i dont get it i just dont get it i really dont get this at all this movie was so terrible the songs were horrid one oompa loompa playing them all of them was cheap and lame and the songs made me hide my head in disgust and there is a segment where burton pays tribute to stanley kubricks 2001 and its all but blasphemous to people like me who literally worship classic films in the original gene wilder was believable he really seemed like the character he was the character but depp as usual was simply performing horrible horrible one of the worst movies i have ever seen a c g i overkill 9 10burton does it again ed bloom 5 july 2005i have seen charlie  the chocolate factory last night and though i usually dont care very much in giving my opinion the journey m burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released i have been a tim burton fan for more than a decade now i grew up with his films but what i have been through yesterday his really unique i actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day fans of his first period with all the lonely and desperate characters wont like it for sure since mars attacks  and more specifically since big fish burton decided to tell things differently his vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films  now the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays a world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it reality but a world worth living in and thats what charlie  the chocolate factory is all about it all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film the sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with cgi and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute since the film was proudly made with real sets real oompas loompas real squirrels the main title looks inappropriate its not that important but its a tim burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title hopefully danny elfman is there with a crazy mix of the edward scissorhands and spiderman the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers a true musical rollercoaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film after that its just emotions all kinds of them laughs many the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds tears of joy we all know charlies gonna find that ticket but when he does you just cant refrain your heart to beat faster mercy the way burton depicts the social misery of the buckets family is really touching amazement the wonka factory and its many rooms is true wonder one the most achieved design burton ever offered us and many mores very much like the book even though it seems simple and childish you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you dont have the time it just never stops i realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness johnny depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here i wont compare with gene wilder since i dont know the first film very well pretty unknown flick here in europe and those comparisons should stop anyway depp makes of wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesnt know much about common courtesy and doesnt really care anyway he built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and hes pretty proud of it he just doesnt want those weird a word he likes youve all seen the tv spots and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on yet so depps wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors as burton does everything he can to make you hate augustus vercua violet and mike at the moment you first see them you get instantly closer to wonka when you noticed he feels the same in addition to that john augusts vision of wonkas past including an always perfect cameo by christopher lee offers the character a real depth you didnt expect danny elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film while his score is already classic burtonelfman work with some interesting experiments the main themes are splendid the songs he wrote for the oompas loompas are just so funny hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices those songs dont intend to stay with you for months it would have been hard as theyre based on dahls lyrics that doesnt allow broadway impulses theyre just offbeat numbers playing with many references in so many styles oingo boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when itll come out itll bring them back 15 years ago what can i tell you more  mc dowells sets are amazing pescuccis work is impressive as well as rousselots beautiful cinematography some oscar nominations should fall here as for the ending without revealing it augusts additions are really touching and fit perfectly to burtons new approach even though the final shot tempers the family theme that he developed through the film its still burton not disney burton makes you feel good because he feels good and what im writing here will ring a bell when youll see the movie i dont know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films it really moved to see that he found a certain peace charlie and the chocolate factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with big fish he lost his father he became one hes getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film thats why i could call this film the edward scissorhands of his new period those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions thank you m burton thank you very much 484 out of 725 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this3 10not bad but not good either dena2 15 july 2005warning spoilers154 out of 222 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this i know im in the minority here but i wasnt jumping up and down about this movie i loved the book as a child and loved the original film with gene wilder for its own original contributionsperhaps im biased still i have always admired tim burton and johnny depps work and had been looking forward to this new interpretation of roald dahls book this film was indeed more true to the book than the 1971 versionthe squirrel room the jungle scene the children leaving the factory perhaps a little wiser for the wear however the character development of the 1971 version was much better than hereyou were actually given an opportunity to like or dislike each character including willy wonka i did think that johnny depps portrayal of wonka was more true to the book than gene wilders willy wonka is supposed to be quite childish and eccentric however i thought that this films preoccupation with being true to the book caused it to overlook what is more important which is to establish the intentions of each character at least in the 1971 version its pretty clear what each characters intentions areeven if establishing some of these intentions requires a conspiracy involving slugworth and though i havent read the book in a very long time i do not remember any details being given as to willy wonkas childhood i thought these were unnecessary distracting and a waste of time this energy could have been better spent on the childrens character development in my opinion this is after all supposed to be a story for and about children the oompa loompas its true that they are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version ie very small people and not midgets with orange skin and green hair however though the songs they sing here are true to the book they are less charismatic than those of the 1971 film and sometimes seem over the top also i didnt like that they were all clones of each other i think that was a poor choice finally i was appalled with the endingthis ties in with my previous comments re willy wonkas childhood it changed the whole idea behind the story itself which is supposed to be from my perspective that people can overcome their hardships to have a happy and prosperous ending as long as theyre honest selfless and generous this movie changes the whole theme of the story to one that emphasizes the importance of family over any kind of material wealth or prosperity both are perfectly good and legitimate themes but my reading of the book left me with an impression that roald dahl was more concerned with the former theme than the latter accordingly then this movie did not do the book justice in the most important and fundamental way whereas the 1971 film was able to do so despite its shortcomings 1 10just does not hold up to willy wonka and the chocolate factoryrzg2 10 november 2005warning spoilers120 out of 171 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this this movie was simply awful willy wonka lacked the warmth humor and wit that was shown by gene wilder in the original the use of one person as the oompa loompas comes off as cheap production whether it was or not the changes made even subtle ones such as the order or events between charlie finding the money and getting the last ticket and the introduction of the elevator just seem off one of the most memorable moments is left out which is the fizzy drink that makes charlie and uncle joe float around the oompa loompa sequences are horrible the main characters fail to connect with the viewer as they did in the original i could go on and on but will just end by saying this movie is proof that new technology different actors producers and directors do not always equal a better experience save your time and your money buy and watch the original my 5 year only daughter even prefers it over the new 1 10wonkatrastrophe clownbird 20 july 2005warning spoilers224 out of 342 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this tim burton kept saying he wanted to make a version much more faithful to the source material which leaves me wondering why he didnt theres the awful and unnecessary and counterproductive back story showing wonkas childhood which is nothing more than an excuse for burton to bring in one of his horror movie heroes from childhood christopher lee while completely killing any sense of mystery wonka might otherwise possess i like johnny depp but his wonka had zero warmthand was just plain creepy and random  one minute hes snippy andor oblivious to the kids the next hes paternal offering charlie some nourishing hot chocolate because he looks like he could use it and because its a line from the book wonka in the book is a spritely little gentneither gene wilder nor johnny depp are really much like him much less so depp but wilders interpretation always has that twinkle in his eye  you know hes a little eccentric but hes always in control the kids in this version are all pretty good but wonka himself yikes give me gene wilders version over creepy johnny depps michael jackson take any day the oompaloompa musical numbers blew the first one in the chocolate room was okay but overall i had a hard time understanding most of the lyrics it was all just raucous noise come on elfman you can do better than that wonka telling charlie he cant bring his family to live with him in the factory was insane first of all it makes wonka look even more like a freaky pedophile second of all  how on earth is that faithful to the book this is the second time in recent memory ive heard of a producerdirector wooing the widow of a beloved childrens book author and then she deciding that her dead husband would love this new bigscreen version of his source material somewhere dr seuss is consoling roald dahl 3 10tim and johnny disappointcnol12000 27 july 2005warning spoilers41 out of 57 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this if the only justification for this being a great movie is that it is true to the book then it shouldnt have been made at all tim burton has successfully digitized and sterilized the chocolate factory universe and in so doing has destroyed a wonderful piece of pop culture no longer will orangefaced greenhaired oompa loompas populate my imagination and nightmares no longer will i wonder just what in the world an american boy was doing living in a ramshackle house in a nondescript bavarian town and no longer will i wonder what drove gene wilders wonka to be such a lovable sadist or just exactly what drugs he popped before taking that insane boat ride in short the imagination of the original film is gone replaced with a shallow bloated bigbudget disappointment when the film was first announced i was ecstatic that johnny depp and tim burton would be taking it on i thought only johnny would have the skills to successfully reinvent the enigmatic wonka and only burton or maybe david lynch would be able to make the disturbing oompa loompas even more disturbing the film fails in both respects visually depp does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of wonka his buggy sunglasses velvet coat and top hat were faithful both to wilders wonka and the whimsical nature of the character himself but depps acting andor the material he was working with fell flat in the few lines of dialogue that actually fit into the context of the scene depps delivery was synthetic and provided no insight into the character perhaps this was intended but for me it backfired if they wanted me to loathe the character it worked by contrast gene wilders take left no doubt about his distaste for children  think of his wonderful eyerolling while saying no please stop  or his true reversal when he finally finds a child of virtue  you did it charlie i knew you would his performance is nuanced and genuine depps is taut and plastic where is the playful and inventive dialogue like oh you should never never doubt what nobody is sure about and so much time and so little to do wait a minute strike that reverse it now to the oompa loompas those little orange buggers have been scaring the hell out of me ever since i saw the original as a child i couldnt wait to see burtons twisted take when the movie was announced then i heard that the loompas would be played by one actor deep roy and digitally reproduced i began to worry my worries were well justified when i saw the film and the oompas had become a cloned and shrunken version of roy with only latex jumpsuits to lend any suggestion of the bizarre the musical numbers were equally disappointing glitzy fastpaced and well choreographed they nevertheless pale in comparison to the catchy and unforgettable originals with their doompadeedoos  on a par with the ohheeohhs of the wizard of oz for great movie choruses sung by guys with brightlycolored faces in fact i dont think there was one line in any of the new movies songs that i actually could understand and since the musical numbers added so much to the story in the original i definitely felt something was missing this time burton has always been a master at creating otherworldly environments that incorporate just enough anachronisms and bizarre elements to keep you guessing whether the story is supposed to be set in our universe or not he does another admirable job of it here from the opening credits with their depiction of a rube goldbergesque chocolate machine to the imaginative nut sorting room burton uses his talents well to create a rich landscape however i think he fell short in a few spots his take on the augustus gloop and violet beauregarde incidents is identical to the original but with less dialogue and the only new element in the mike teevee scene is the cute homage to 2001 a space odyssey and other cinema classics i think a director like burton could have gone to town so to speak with this material and still stayed faithful to the book another element of the film that i found irritating were the flashbacks to wonkas youth and other departures from the main story such as the origin of the oompa loompas the biographical material on wonka not only eliminated some of the mystery surrounding the character but it was tired and predictable to suggest that his eccentricities were the result of his troubled relationship with his father gee  their subsequent reconciliation at the end of the movie was a real shocker once this was revealed and how how how mr burton could you tackle the subject of the vicious indigenous creatures of loompaland without talking about those rotten vernicious knits bad remakes and needless sequels are not only poor cinema they detract from their predecessors unfortunately i think burtons film will have just that impact on willy wonka and the chocolate factory perhaps i need to read the book again something i havent done since my childhood to appreciate this movie for its faithfulness to dahls vision somehow i dont think that will make me like it any better though after all when we now see homer in simpsons episode dabf03 ask to see the oompa loompa because hes freaky will it strike the same chord i think not 1

was actually excited to see this movie i wasnt expecting anything i was just intrigued to see another tim burton film the pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a tim burton film truly fantastic but like watching a model trying to ponder physics the beauty is only skin deep where was the heart in this movie the acting the dialog the people all fell short of human behavior small example a child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand i want it daddy wheres the yelling the screams has no one ever seen a tantrum additional example the parents seemed hardly upset with their childrens misfortune as a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were attacked by anything much less squirrels the ompa loompa problem i loved them actually tiny creepy and what a great story on how they were found they were great until they broke into a bad britney spears song and dance what the  was that flashback problem i loved johnnys character quirky and fun nevertheless the flashbacks didnt add much at all to anything and they were executed in the worst ways ive ever seen sorry i was having a flashback they are far better ways to have had those worked honestly the t v kid was he really so horrible i mean yes he was obnoxious but it doesnt take tv to do that in fact didnt tv just make him smart is it so awful that he figured out how to find the bar with the ticket t v didnt turn his mind to mush it made him the smartest kid who was just annoying and stubborn the ending horrible horrible horrible i dont even want to talk about it 2 10another tragic remake tiger80 8 november 2005warning spoilers43 out of 61 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this just like so many other remakes of great films this is one that fails miserably on so many levels first of all johnny depp does not display near the wit nor the charisma that gene wlider did in the original you actually see willy wonka before the big day arrives which takes some of the mystery out of the character none of the characters are really enjoyable like in the first film they seem to lack any real emotion or style the special effects are overkill for the overtone of this story it is almost like walt disney meets timothy leary if you are a fan of the original steer clear of this abomination 6 10i cant shake longings for wilder and tangerine faces twopiecesofchristina 17 july 2007director tim burton has come a long way since his first job as an animator for disney in the early 1980s he made several animated shorts none of which were deemed suitable for children  an early indication of burtons dark outlook however his hard work and talent did not go unnoticed his subsequent directorial work on beetlejuice 1988 batman 1989 and batman returns 1992 cemented his role as an experimental and visionary directorproducer nobody else therefore was surely more suitable to adapt dahls muchloved novel and nobody else was surely daring enough to attempt a remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 directed by mel stuart that enduring classic starring gene wilder as wonka burtons repeated use of depp in previous films edward scissorhands ed wood and sleepy hollow to name just three indicated him to be an obvious and it could be argued perfect choice to cast as wonka depp is by far the best thing about this film his characters whole persona  the costume and body language the tone of his voice his pithy lines delivered in a contemptuous and yet charming manner are all presented in such a way to add up to a well deserved challenge to wilders crown but does he steal it id say he doesnt for someone that grew up with roald dahls novels and film adaptations wilder is wonka trying to ignore my obvious bias i believe depp does put up a good fight and perhaps if the parents of the four terrible children had shown more spark or been actors of a higher calibre his comic moments would have had much more impact burtons other muse helena bonham carter is miscast as charlies mother her lines are delivered distractedly and with the air of someone very aware of her status in the film industry thankfully her role is quite minor and doesnt impact negatively upon the film freddie highmore is fairly insipid yet not offensive in his role of charlie the same description can be applied to david kelley who plays his grandpa joe with the exception of augustus gloop whose role is comparatively minor the four ticketwinning children do not live up to expectations or standards set in the 71 mel stuart version they simply serve to mildly irritate and disappoint particularly veruca and violet but i doubt anyone could match julie dawn cole the original veruca a certain amount of furore has surrounded deep roy the 4ft 4 tall actor who plays every single one of wonkas allsinging alldancing oompa loompas he also plays wonkas therapist and in a tongueincheek moment appears briefly on the closing sequence where he is revealed to be the narrator the effects used to reproduce roy as every single oompaloompa i believe detract from the film when viewing scenes surely its preferable to be absorbed and involved than to be distracted by special effects and wondering howwhy did they do that additionally roys scenes are the only ones to feature music  there is no wonka or grandpa joe breaking into song and dance in this adaptation all we get here are the oompaloompas didactic lyrics which unfortunately are drowned out by belowpar sound editing in an unprecedented move burton and screenwriter james august have given wonka a history christopher lee who is sadly underused in this film plays his father and we get to find out exactly why wonka is such an enigma i wont reveal the outcome short of saying its pretty unsatisfying and takes away wonkas mystery  the very thing that makes him appealing claims have been made that this adaptation follows dahls novel much more closely than the 1971 version of which it does  everything is followed almost to the letter unfortunately the wonkafather storyline clearly undermines any attempt the film has made to stay true to dahls novel  should dahl had wished there to be a father figure he would have included that in his book however certain artistic license is always taken when adapting books and plays to the big screen and this creativity is needed to keep images and story lines fresh and to prevent any static grounding as regards the imagery of the film well its a burton film and true to form we arent disappointed typically we enter and leave the film during gentle snowfall the poor buckets house leans pitifully to one side and almost makes you shiver when charlie climbs into bed underneath a gaping whole in the roof colour is suitably hued down apart from certain scenes in the factory where the vibrant colours bring the songs and sets to life  the chocolate room and the boat ride come alive and the television room almost blinds the only fault i could find and it is minor is that at certain points of the chocolate room scene the chocolate river where augustus gloop meets his untimely suction looks more like brown water than creamy chocolate apart from the aforementioned poor sound editing of the featured songs audio here is of a top standard sound effects are clear no dialogue is gone unheard and the musical score is in keeping with the tone of the film verdict  its easy to be overpicky when comparing a film not only to a novel but also to an earlier much loved and highlyestablished film adaptation however faults notwithstanding this is watchable fare that should appeal to all ages is it a classic no 17 out of 22

report this this movie version stunk yes i know it was more to the book but having johnny depp come on dont get me wrong i do like johnny depp hes had his share of good and bad movies but this another bad one i dont think he can get any worse than crybaby anyways i do believe they could have done better for the role of willy wonka much better you can really tell this was a tim burton movie the coloring the acting and the sets how about that house seemed like one small touch to it and it would just fall like a deck of cards how can charlie really sleep with the roof open like that yea i know it is a fantasy book the oompa loompa scenes were terrible it was interesting that the same guy played all of the oompa loompas but the dance scenes were just plain awful just another part which downgraded this movie but back to the fact that he played all of the oompa loompas would it have hurt to get more than one person to play the parts at least in the mel stuart version they got a bunch of them to play the parts and some of them couldnt speak english ok time for the good parts tough to do i would give this movie an 8 for the special effects the glass elevator for instance traveling throughout the factory and even through the town with rockets nice so having the choice of the mel stuart version which got away from the book a lot but good actors or this new tim burton which stuck to the book but bad choice of actors i would still pick the mel stuart version in a second sorry roald dahl 1 10just not righthuntsberry 30 september 2005warning spoilers28 out of 39 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this im not sure if this is a spoiler or not but my opinion i was really looking forward to seeing this i like johnny depp and i loved the original i was very disappointed in this for several reasons 1 i thought it was going to be a part ii and not a remake why remake something that was already great why not make a movie as charlie himself grown up and running the factory 2 depp is quirky in a freaky irritating kind of way often resembling michael jackson in a strange way 3 they ruined all the great songs that were in the original with completely new completely irritating please turn the  off its killing me kind of songs 4 kudos to the one guy who played all the oompa loompas again pretty strange looking and very digitized i like the originals much better instead of exact clone of one 5 they changed the idea of a lot of the scenes completely no badgolden egg for example no everlasting gobstoppers 6 my kids didnt like it much either and looked kind of disturbed after the show 3 10wheres the funrbugden 21 october 2006warning spoilers20 out of 27 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this although this movie stays close to the book its much darker than the book or the original despite the original including a scene with a chook getting its head chopped off depp is a strange wonka he has no interest in children and only became a chocolatier as revenge to his fathers abhorration of sweet things because he was a dentist depps wonka is much darker than wilders portrayal and its one that probably caused nightmares the oompa loompas are played by one person who is cgi cloned a thousand times hes not even cute having the same oompa loompa is repetitive and annoying some variety wouldve been nice the songs they sing take the lyrics directly from the book but arent as catchy as the originals songs i do like the different genres of music used though the children are just as annoying as youd expect them to be freddie highmore is wonderful as charlie although he doesnt come across as the centre of the movie as one might expect the demise of each child is the highlight of each segment and really moves the film along nicely where the film strays from the book are the parts that annoy me the most violet being overly competitive seems out of place and the subplot with wonka and his father is silly it has no place in the film and delays the inevitable ending which everyone already knows delaying it with an outofplace subplot is completely pointless and unnecessary so why dont i like the movie its too dark wonka is a happy loving hyperactive character depps wonka meanders through his factory like a robot and the occasional amusing comment when hes not having flashbacks to his demented childhood give it a miss and see the original better still read the bookdepp fails to match wilderjimj409 5 september 2006warning spoilers14 out of 18 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this let me begin by stating that i am a johnny depp fan i generally find his performances to be excellent and count his portrayal in blow among my very favorite in cinema history that said he fails here i dont know if it was due to improper or misguided action of the director or if he chose his own tone and manner for the wonka character but depp fails miserably in this film using the roald dahl novel as a guideline depp is nothing like the understated drywitted implacable and imperturbable mr wonka using the original film from 1971 as a guideline depp cant hold a candle to gene wilders performance which while overstated at least resembled the character intended by dahl when he wrote the book in the first place johnny seems to be going for some sort of postabused mentally tweaked boyman some have said that the portrayal reflects michael jackson if so why wonka isnt sinister nor does he come off as a character hiding a brutal truth which is how depp plays him here unfortunately he becomes the focal point of the movie and the main character is kicked to the curb shortly after his introductory sequence following charlies find of the golden ticket he becomes an ancillary character with few lines and michael jackson takes over and ruins the film really he ruins it i found it unenjoyable and actually began to resent depps every appearance with a weariness this is no wonka this is burton and depps idea of what neverland would have been like if michael jackson chose to make chocolate there rather than exhibit exotic animals between kiddie rides the usual burton mosaic of backdrop works well and the musical scenes with the oompa loompas are highlights although i found myself harboring nostalgic thoughts for the original oompas as i enjoyed these new rockedup songs well done just much much different a sidenote i love that mike teavee challenges wonkas notion that a candybar being teleported is a far cry from an image being transmitted that drove me nuts when i was a little kid good for you for calling him out mike i also love that veruca salt meets her match by the paws of many squirrels as in the book rather than being dumped down the egg hatch as in the 1971 version of the film overall i disliked depps portrayal so much that despite the excellent imagery and the many highlights i wont watch this again and recommend it only to those who are interested in comparing it to the far superior 1971 effort 1 10speechless well not quiteweescottishlassie 23 september 2005warning spoilers50 out of 76 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this ahem where do i start when seeing this movie the first thing that struck me was the exciting music at the beginning which reminded me a bit of harry potter the opening scene was absolutely riveting showing the wrapping of bars of chocolate i almost fell off my sit because i was so intrigued the beginning of the film surpassed itself in making us realize by about 2 minutes of it that it was going to be absolutely dreadful the real fun began when we met willy wonka i wont say who he reminded me of anyone whos seen the film would know and i dont want to spoil the pleasant surprise for those of you who havent yet had the honour the oompaloompa dances were possibly the worst things i have ever seen who choreographed them i want to meet this insane idiot it literally made me want to puke they had an eerie kind of synchronization which was so unnatural that it was scary i admit to finding the first dance slightly amusing but by the time id got to the 4th i was just staring at the screen in disgust words of warning dont go and see this sad excuse for entertainment see the original 1 10do yourself a favour and go rent the originalmusitron1 16 july 2005warning spoilers105 out of 170 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this absolutely awful sorry its the truth i wanted it to be good too the original is brilliant a timeless piece of pop culture but what tim burton did to this film ok picture fred durst avril lavigne the spice girls and the new kids on the block covering sgt peppers lonely hearts club band drunk that is really how bad this film is my biggest problem with the film is that they left out charlies sin i mean no fizzy lifting drinks cmon one of the things that humanized the original charlie the polite and thoughtful one amongst a pastiche of brats is that charlie too broke the rules and reasonably invoked wonkas wrath charlies innate good nature eventually redeems him also for darwins sake cut out the music painful is the only word i can conjure to describe it i will admit that i have not read the dahl novel so i do not know if the original included all the drudgerous background on wonka however the constant flowkilling flashbacks slows the pace of the movie to a crawl and normally depps acting can carry any role but this script and character rendering were just terrible perhaps the background information on wonka should have been one big chunk in the beginning of the movie because spacing it out has no buildup value at all also worst voice on a depp character well ever there really was nothing to redeem this pieceofcrap moneysucker i cant believe i actually wasted 12 to see it between this the stepford wives and godzilla i have lost all faith in the movie industry 1 10not very good tigerbrother 3 august 2005warning spoilers55 out of 85 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this my wife  i went to see this today 3rd august2005 we were really looking forward to it because of all the media hype and the trailer looking great to be honest we both love the original move with gene wilder 1971 i also read the book many years ago and enjoyed that as well this version we felt was such unadulterated rubbish that we walked out after an hour we felt that johnny depp was useless as the character as he came across way too young  after all it was supposed to be over 20yrs since grandpa joe worked there  willy didnt look a day over 35 which would have meant that he was but a teenager when he opened the factory deep roy did a good job at acting as the oompa loompas although the musical scenes were so crap it begs belief that tim burton actually wasted the money doing those scenes i think that using a primarily british cast was a new twist about the only things in our opinion that had improved over the 1971 version was the visual effects  these were excellent and giving some background to some of the characters was also a good idea overall given that we could only bear to watch the first hour i would say dont waste your money  go and rent the 1971 version from the local video store 8 10burton studied the books original illustrations fred 18 july 2005if tim burtons out there i just want to thank him for bringing the spirit of the books original illustrations to the screen he even matched the facial expressions to the drawings especially in the case of charlies family charlie himself looks like one of the drawings and the bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that burton is as visual as any movie director can be recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator im talking about the illustrations from the 1960s the difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of crosshatching i imagine the older illustrations are still available especially in a hardcover but youll need to search the net i dont know how he did it but he got the facial expressions of charlies family and of mike teaveas father down perfectly he also absorbed dahls sense of humor the opening fifteen minutes or so in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one really get roald dahls sense of the ridiculous i think burtons addition of wonkas childhood story fits well although ill agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in dahls spirit even in the resolution however burton maintains sly humor it is wellacted by everybody id like to say that julia winter who plays veruca salt has turned in a truly wellobserved comedic performance depp converts the novels jaunty precise wonka into a quirky one but it works well because as in the novel wonkas endearing traits contrast with the fact that hes a tyrant roald dahl gets a rap for his cynicism and this movie softens his message a bit dahl is a bit like orwell both of them point out that man given power will exploit his fellow human beings charlie and the chocolate factory the movie is not quite as dark as the book but it comes very very close 109 out of 178 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this3 10the gene wilder version was much better wild vector 27 july 2005warning spoilers20 out of 28 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this they took most of the fun and wit out of this movie compared to the 1971 version with gene wilder in this one willy wonka is a depressing weird loser instead of a wise prankster he had none of the charm or appeal of gene wilders willy all the characters were better in the 1971 movie except maybe violet who had a little more going on this time however her transformation into a blueberry is overdone and just looks like the computer fx it is the oompaloompas are without personality and their songs are mostly unintelligible the choreography was okay but i couldnt help thinking those cgi guys sure did a lot of work on that stick with the 71 version the songs alone make it far superior to this corporate computerized makeover the 2005 version definitely wont be remembered in 30 years 4 10wonkas new candy sweet or sourlrbrosky 28 november 2005warning spoilers13 out of 17 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this charlie and the chocolate factory is not another version of the 1971 movie it has nothing to do with the former movie and is supposed to be adapted from road dahls novel however the new movie takes a cute and imaginative childrens book and begins to twist it into a weird disturbing and slightly aggressive movie if the movie had dove into the idea and had created a dark movie i would have respected the 2005 movie much more yet the movie was spineless the center of a tugofwar match between the darkside and childrens fantasy charlie and the chocolate factory could have been an amazing adventure for both children and children at heart or it could have been an amusing film for those who enjoy dark humor the films portrayal of willy wonka was that of a mysterious young man with a darkside this could have created a great canvas for a movie in which wonka acts according to his personality however the film just flipflops from a cheesy and generic scene of a spoiler warning happy ending to a stirring character pulling his audience into a dark disturbing world if this movie would have firmly chosen a path it would have been an excellent movie this movie can be enjoyable to children or to adults yet does not greatly appeal to either age group if the movie had been created to create a land of pure imagination children of all ages would rave about the film for years to come if it had been created in order for a peculiar audience to ponder over the movie could have created a dark enough movie to be mused over however this film wasnt brave enough to choose its own category therefore cant be completely enjoyed by many solid minds 1 10eeheehee im willy wonkaisabelle vanhouver 5 february 2013warning spoilers9 out of 11 found this helpful was this review helpful yes no report this what what the deuce what the diddly deuce did i watch tim burtonyoure married to helena bonham carter youve made several gothiccutesy movies which while decidedly not my style are not bad why did you have to put your cold spidery hands on my darling charlie and the chocolate factory why charlies not a bad actor his parents although rather predictably cast are cute in that dingybritishzanytimburton way the humor at first is pretty funny im not in love but im not screaming in agony either and then johnny depp comes and then johnny depp comes and then johhny comes and oh dear god im breathless with horror he smirks he simpers he minces he speaks in a soft breathy braindead sort of voice which seems like a really poor interpretation of michael jackson hes apparently the son of a psychopathic dentist who refusd to let him eat candyas a result of which he grows up to be a highly effeminate suspiciously pedophileish creeper who giggles for the camera and doesnt give a darn about the children with whom hes dealing in short hes quite possibly the worst willy wonka anyone could ever be ranking right up there with the hypothetical interpretation by kristen stewart somewhere out there dahl is banging his head against his coffin personally im a fan of the original sure it changes a few details of the book sure the oompa loompas are green and orange and creepy sure the infamous boat scene is acidtrippy and psychedelic but the heart is there gene wilder in my view played wonka brilliantly he was a man of mystery a man of twinkling eyes and dry humor and unaccountable twists and turns a man both fearful and wonderful to behold by the way johnny dry wit does not equate to you smiling vapidly at the children and lisping i dont really care hes peculiar yes but hes also wacky and whimsical and boyish at heart and he cares for charlie perhaps depps portrayal cared for charlie but he gave the impression of said caring being entirely the wrong way i dont understand why at the end wonka doesnt allow charlie to bring his family with him to the factorythat rather defeats the purpose of the book all in all this is a shiny new remake which emulates its main character cold and glassy and completely dissatisfying ps the oompa loompas seriously and the music completely ruins the mood and
