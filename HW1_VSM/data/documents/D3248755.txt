exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to for example a particular exploited function in memory aslr randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack heap and libraries contents  hide 1 history2 benefits21 effectiveness211 reducing

links history  editthe linux pa x project first coined the term aslr and published the first design and implementation of aslr in july 2001 as a patch for the linux kernel it is seen as a complete implementation providing also a patch for kernel stack randomization since october 2002 1the first mainstream operating system to support aslr by default was the open bsd version 34 in 2003 2 3 followed by linux in 2005 benefits  editaddress space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses for example attackers trying to execute returntolibc attacks must locate the code to be executed while other attackers trying to execute shellcode injected on the stack have to find the stack first in both cases the system obscures related memoryaddresses from the attackers these values have to be guessed and a mistaken guess is not usually recoverable due to the application crashing effectiveness  editaddress space layout randomization is based upon the low chance of an attacker guessing the locations of randomly placed areas security is increased by increasing the search space thus address space randomization is more effective when more entropy is present in the random offsets entropy is increased by either raising the amount of virtual memory area space over which the randomization occurs or reducing the period over which the randomization occurs the period is typically implemented as small as possible so most systems must increase vma space randomization to defeat the randomization attackers must successfully guess the positions of all areas they wish to attack for data areas such as stack and heap where custom code or useful data can be loaded more than one state can be attacked by using nop slides for code or repeated copies of data this allows an attack to succeed if the area is randomized to one of a handful of values in contrast code areas such as library base and main executable need to be discovered exactly often these areas are mixed for example stack frames are injected onto the stack and a library is returned into the following variables can be declared entropy bits of stack top entropy bits of mmap  base entropy bits of main executable base entropy bits of heap base attacked bits per attempt of stack entropy attacked bits per attempt of mmap  base entropy attacked bits per attempt of main executable entropy attacked bits per attempt of heap base entropy attempts made total amount of entropyto calculate the probability of an attacker succeeding we have to assume a number of attempts α carried out without being interrupted by a signaturebased ips law enforcement or other factor in the case of brute forcing the daemon cannot be restarted we also have to figure out how many bits are relevant and how many are being attacked in each attempt leaving however many bits the attacker has to defeat the following formulas represent the probability of success for a given set of α attempts on n bits of entropy isolated guessing address space is rerandomized after each attempt systematic brute forcing on copies of the program with the same address spacein many systems can be in the thousands or millions on modern 64bit systems these numbers typically reach the millions at least hector marcogisbert and ismael ripoll showed in 2014 how to bypass the aslr in 64bit systems in less than one second under certain circumstances 4 for 32bit systems at 2004 computer speeds which have 16 bits for address randomization shacham and coworkers state  16 bits of address randomization can be defeated by a brute force attack within minutes 5 it should be noted that the authors statement depends on the ability to attack the same application multiple times without any delay proper implementations of aslr like that included in grsecurity provide several methods to make such brute force attacks infeasible one method involves preventing an executable from executing for a configurable amount of time if it has crashed a certain number of times android 6  nonprimary source needed and possibly other systems  which implement library load order randomization a form of aslr which randomizes the order in which libraries are loaded this supplies very little entropy an approximation of the number of bits of entropy supplied per needed library appears below this does not yet account for varied library sizes so the actual entropy gained is really somewhat higher note that attackers usually need only one library the math is more complex with multiple libraries and shown below as well note that the case of an attacker using only one library is a simplification of the more complex formula forl number of libraries loadedβ number of libraries used by the attacker β1 l1β 1l 1these values tend to be low even for large values of l most importantly since attackers typically can use only the c standard library and thus one can often assume that interestingly however even for a small number of libraries there are a few bits of entropy gained here it is thus potentially interesting to combine library load order randomization with vma address randomization to gain a few extra bits of entropy note that these extra bits of entropy will not apply to other mmap  segments only libraries reducing entropy  editattackers may make use of several methods to reduce the entropy present in a randomized address space ranging from simple information leaks to attacking multiple bits of entropy per attack such as by heap spraying  there is little that can be done about this it is possible to leak information about memory layout using format string vulnerabilities format string functions such as printf use a variable argument list to do their job format specifiers describe what the argument list looks like because of the way arguments are typically passed each format specifier moves closer to the top of the stack frame eventually the return pointer and stack frame pointer can be extracted revealing the address of a vulnerable library and the address of a known stack frame this can completely eliminate library and stack randomization as an obstacle to an attacker one can also decrease entropy in the stack or heap the stack typically must be aligned to 16 bytes and so this is the smallest possible randomization interval while the heap must be pagealigned typically 4096 bytes when attempting an attack it is possible to align duplicate attacks with these intervals a nop slide may be used with shellcode injection and the string  binsh  can be replaced with  binsh  for an arbitrary number of slashes when attempting to return to system the number of bits removed is exactly for n intervals attacked such decreases are limited due to the amount of data in the stack or heap the stack for example is typically limited to 8 mb 7 and grows to much less this allows for at most 19 bits although a more conservative estimate would be around 8– 10 bits corresponding to 4– 16 kb 7 of stack stuffing the heap on the other hand is limited by the behavior of the memory allocator in the case of glibc allocations above 128 kb are created using mmap limiting attackers to 5 bits of reduction this is also a limiting factor when brute forcing although the number of attacks to perform can be reduced the size of the attacks is increased enough that the behavior could in some circumstances become apparent to intrusion detection systems implementations  editseveral mainstream generalpurpose operating

kernel provide more complete implementations the exec shield patch for linux supplies 19 bits of stack entropy on a period of 16 bytes and 8 bits of mmap base randomization on a period of 1 page of 4096 bytes this places the stack base in an area 8 mb wide containing 524 288 possible positions and the mmap base in an area 1 mb wide containing 256 possible positions various linux distributions—including adamantix alpine linux hardened gentoo and hardened linux from scratch —come with pa xs implementation of aslr by default positionindependent executable pie implements a random base address for the main executable binary and has been in place since 2003 it provides the same address randomness to the main executable as being used for the shared libraries the pie feature is in use only for the network facing daemons  citation needed – the pie feature cannot be used together with the prelink feature for the same executable the prelink tool implements randomization at prelink time rather than runtime because by design prelink aims to handle relocating libraries before the dynamic linker has to which allows the relocation to occur once for many runs of the program as a result real address space randomization would defeat the purpose of prelinking kernel address space layout randomization kaslr bringing support for address space randomization to running linux kernel images by randomizing where the kernel code is placed at boot time 15 was merged into the linux kernel mainline in kernel version 314 released on 30 march 2014 16 when compiled in it can be disabled

locations of the heap stack process environment block and thread environment block are also randomized a security whitepaper from symantec noted that aslr in 32bit windows vista may not be as robust as expected and microsoft has acknowledged a weakness in its implementation 24hostbased intrusion prevention systems such as wehn trust 25 and ozone 26 also offer aslr for windows xp and windows server 2003 operating systems wehn trust is opensource 27 complete details of ozones implementation are not available 28it was noted in february 2012 29 that aslr on 32bit windows systems prior to windows 8 can have its effectiveness reduced in low memory situations similar effect also had been achieved on linux in the same research the test code caused the mac os x 1073 system to kernel panic
