horrified by what happened at this location first of all our waiter was very rude and very inattentive we got dirty silverware with bits of food still stuck on it also no one cleared our dirty plates away we had to wait almost to the end of our meal to get our plates cleared we asked for our check separate and the waiter brought it together and to top it all off my friend got food poisoning from the house salad there i am so disappointed that i told my friend that this was a great restaurant this location sucks i wouldnt recommend going here was this review helpful yes  1 recommends

they always compensate by either getting u better food or they take money off of your bill we absolutley loveeeee it great job avon texas roadhouse p s the managers are awsome too was this review helpful yes  1 recommends yippeekiyeaover a year ago favorite restaurant evah – it seems that it is often more usual than not to find a restaurant lacking in food quality good service and great atmosphere or at least 1 of the 3 my daughter  i were seated right away by the hostess we were greeted by our server sean  he was very quick to get us our drinks  answer any questions we had he was very personable  professional without being too overbearing we ordered our meals  i opted for the smokehouse burger with a dinner salad instead of the fries my dinner salad was the best i have ever had in a restaurant the greens were fresh  crispy blue cheese dressing tasted home made croutons were crispy but not the type you could break a tooth over lol  the cheese was a nice addition it was more than i was expecting for a house dinner salad when our meals arrived everything was hot fresh tasty burger cooked just the way i ordered it my daughters steak  ribs were awesome too she commented it was the best sirloin steak she ever had i told our server sean that this was my first visit  i was very impressed with the food  service id been a waitress for several years and am quite discerning he was very gracious  brought the manager to introduce me to i asked the manager about the prime rib i had almost ordered it but im usually less than pleased by the prime rib in restaurants he actually brought me a thin slice of it to sample it was a shock to me that he went out of his way to do this you know what i loved the taste of it it had a mild smokey flavor  i think i will get it on our next visit all in all our dinner was so enjoyable  id be hard pressed to choose if it was because of the service or the food because both were above  beyond what i have come to expect of a restaurant i truly felt like a vip thank you very much  we will be back often was this review helpful yes  0 recommends eric grossmanover a year ago texasthemed barbecue chain provides carnivores with

favorite place to gowas this review helpful yes  0 doesnt recommendscorbinover a year ago poor service – on three occasions my family of six has arrived early to beat the crowds and get seated we have been forced to wait one to two hours because of the mind set that we are just too large a family we actually watched an hour and a half of tables fill up before being seated we were told that a something free would be brought to our table to find that it did not happen no one even said they were sorry after being foolish enough to allow our seven year old son to force us throught this practice we now have put our foot down we will never go backwas this review helpful yes  0 doesnt recommendmyaefflerover a year ago horrible restaurant – the food is mediocre the service is terrible and the atmosphere leaves something to desire its crowded loud and you usually wait for an hour for a steak that isnt cooked properly served by a waitress with an attitude find another steakhousewas
