kitchen paint colors popular posts pin share 124kare you on instagram i am i love to share sneak peeks and behind the scenes videos on my instagram stories come join me some girls love fashion and everything to do with clothes and shoes but this girl right here my heart goes pitter patter over paint swatches yep that’s right paint colors the other day i was talking about how i love certain paint colors and such and my husband turns to me and says “i do not understand feelings about paint colors”well it’s totally my language so i am going to dive into making sure you know how to find your own feelings for paint colors i love picking paint colors and making sure they speak to me and make my heart sing currently i’m choosing between two colors for my kitchen yes i painted it stratton blue benjamin moore when we moved in and so many people love it but i feel like it’s too dark since i painted the cabinets white i’m now sampling palladian blue benjamin moore and sea salt sherwin williams let’s take a look at them in a couple of rooms…office reveal with palladian blue from bower power – stunningmaster bedroom with sea salt from life on virginia street – so peaceful and calm i posted my choices on facebook and instagram over the weekend and it was fun to hear everyone weigh in on the subject i’m pretty sure which one i’m going to choose but before i tell you let’s talk about how to choose a paint color for your home so that you don’t have to repaint or live with a color you don’t just love y’all i’ve gone over this before but let me reiterate it again when it comes to painting your walls you must sample a color preferable more than one on your walls first before you commit i have done that will all of my wall colors since i painted my main living area and it makes all the difference and if you don’t want to paint the walls then paint a piece of poster board and hang it up on the wall here’s why …you cannot tell the true color of a paint swatch without putting it on your wall it will change with the lighting throughout the day – and so many other factors so what may look so beautifully gray on the card you hold in your hand may look completely blue or purple or brown or green or any other color on the wall i think you get the point put it on the wall when we moved into this house the walls and cabinets in the kitchen were all beige i needed a color on the wall pronto or else i was going to lose my mind so i found some beautiful kitchens on pinterest and one of them had stratton blue on the walls i loved that color and i also fell in love with the lighter shade wythe blue so i went to the paint store and picked up stratton blue for my kitchen and wythe blue for my dining room i didn’t try anything out first i just painted thankfully the dining room with wythe blue was a home run it’s my favorite color in the whole house and paired with the tall ceilings lots of natural light and wainscoting it works beautifully the stratton blue was nice but many times i wished i’d painted it wythe blue too if i had tested them out first i probably would have chosen differently palladian blue vs sea salt when i finally painted the cabinets white a couple months ago the wall color was just too dark for me even though i loved it paired with white cabinets in the pretty inspirational pictures  i know some people like the contrast but i just don’t so the obvious choice would be something similar to stratton blue but lighter palladian blue fit that bill it’s a shade lighter than wythe blue and i just knew it would be perfect if i operated in my old ways i would have gone to the store bought paint and painted the kitchen but it would have still been too dark and i would have lived with it even though i didn’t love it 100 no big deal but why be a little off when you can be spot on when sampling a paint color on the wall i like to try at least 2 colors but 34 colors is even better i was sure that palladian blue was the color i wanted but on a whim i got a sample of sea salt too looking at the paint cards i knew i’d choose palladian blue as soon as i had painted them on the wall i knew i would choose palladian blue but as i’ve lived with the swatches on the wall for 24 hours i think i’ve changed my mind i have seen them in all lights of the day and night sometimes i’ll cover up one color and just look at the other color when palladian blue is the only one showing it still just seems to saturated but when sea salt is showing it seems just perfecti am 99 certain that sea salt is the right choice what i know you’re thinking i’m just being fickle for the fun of it but i want the color that i love not just that i like palladian blue is still too dark for my walls sea salt is less saturated has more gray in it and i think it’s going to compliment revere pewter in my living room just perfectlyonce again what seemed like a futile exercise saved me from making the wrong paint choice and sometimes it just confirms what i already knew but i’d rather be 100 sure than get half a room painted and wish i could change it i can’t wait to get it all painted and share the resultshow do you choose paint colors
