3 examples of parsing html file in java using jsoup html is core of web all the page you see in internet are html whether they are dynamically generated by java script jsp php asp or any other web technology your browser actually parse html and render it for you but what would you do if you need to parse an html document and find some elements tags attributes or check if a particular element exists or not from java program if you have been in java programming for some years i am sure you have done some xml parsing work using parsers like dom and sax but there is also good chance that you have not done any html parsing work ironically there are few instances when you need to parse html document from core java application which doesnt include servlet and other java web technologies to make the matter worse there is no http or html library in core jdk as well or at least i am not aware of that thats why when it comes to parse a html file many java programmers had to look at google to find out how to get value of an html tag in java when i needed that i was sure that there would be an open source library which will does it for me but didnt know that it was as wonderful and feature rich as jsoup it not only provides support to read and parse html document but also allows you to extract any element form html file their attribute their css class in jquery style and also allows you to modify them you can probably do anything with html document using jsoup in this article we will parse and html file and find out value of title and heading tags we will also see example of downloading and parsing html from file as well as any url or internet by parsing googles home page in java what is jsoup library jsoup is an open source java library for working with realworld html it provides a very convenient api for extracting and manipulating data using the best of dom css and jquerylike methods jsoup implements the whatwg html5 specification and parses html to the same dom as modern browsers like chrome and firefox do here are some of the useful features of jsoup library  jsoup can scrape and parse html from a url file or string jsoup can find and extract data using dom traversal or css selectors jsoup allows you to manipulate the html elements attributes and text jsoup provides clean usersubmitted content against a safe whitelist to prevent xss attacks jsoup also output tidy htmljsoup is designed to deal with different kinds of html found in the real world which includes proper validated html to incomplete nonvalidate tag collection one of the core strength of jsoup is that its very robust html parsing in java using jsoup in this java html parsing tutorial we will see three different example of parsing and traversing html document in java using jsoup in first example we will parse an html string which contents all tags in form of string literal in java in second example we will download our html document from web and in third example we will load our own sample html file loginhtml for parsing this file is a sample html document which contains title tag and a div in body which contains an html form it has input tags to capture username and password and submit and reset button for further action its proper html which can be validated ie all tags and attributes are properly closed here is how our sample html file look like  doctype html public w3cdtd html 401 transitionalen httpwwww3orgtrhtml4loosedtd  html  head  meta httpequiv  contenttype  content  texthtml charsetiso88591   title  login page  title  head  body  div id   login  class  simple   form action  logindo   username   input id   username  type  text    br  password   input id   password  type  password    br  input id   submit  type  submit   input id   reset  type  reset   form  div  body  html html parsing is very simple with jsoup all you need to call is static method jsoupparse  and pass your html string to it jsoup provides several overloaded parse  method to read html file from string a file from a base uri from an url and from an input stream you can also specify character encoding to read html files correctly which is not in utf8 format here is complete list of html parse method from jsoup library the parse string html method parses the input html into a new document in jsoup document extends element which extends node also text node extends node as long as you pass in a nonnull string youre guaranteed to have a successful sensible parse with a document containing at least a head and a body element once you have a document you can get the data you want by calling appropriate methods in document and its parent classes element and node java program to parse html document here is our complete java program to parse an html string an html file download from internet and an html file from local file system in order to run this program you can either use eclipse ide or you can just use any ide or command prompt in eclipse its very easy just copy this code create a new java project right click on src package and paste it eclipse will take care of creating proper package and java source file with same name so absolutely less work if you already have a sample java project then its just one step following java program shows 3 examples of parsing and traversing html file in first example we directly parse an string with html content in second example we parse an html file downloaded from an url in third example we load and parse an html document from local file system in first and third example we use parse method to get a document object which can be queried to extract any tag value or attribute value in second example we use jsoupconnect  with which takes care of making connection to url downloading html and parsing it this method also returns document object which can be used for further querying and getting value of any tag or attributeimport javaio file  import javaio ioexception  import orgjsoup jsoup  import

good thing about jsoup is that it is very robust jsoup html parser will make every attempt to create a clean parse from the html you provide regardless of whether the html is wellformed or not it can handle following mistakes  unclosed tags eg  p  java  p  scala to  p  java  p   p  scala  p  implicit tags eg a naked  td  java is great  td  is wrapped into a  table  tr   td  reliably creating the document structure html containing a head and body and only appropriate elements within the head thats all about how to parse an html document in java jsoup is an excellent and robust open source library which makes reading html document body fragment html string and directly parsing html content from web extremely easy in this article we learned hot to get value of a particular html tag in java as in fist example we extracted title and value of h1 tag as text and in third example we learned how to get value of an attribute from html tag by extracting css class apart from powerful j query style html body  get elements by tag  h1 text  method which you can use to extract any html tag it also provides convenience methods like documenttitle  and elementclass name  method to quickly get title and css class have fun with jsoup and we will see couple of more examples of this api soon further reading introduction to spring mvc 4restful services in java using jersey java web
