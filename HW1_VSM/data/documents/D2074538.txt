is something called the gastrocolic reflex  the colon basically enhances its propagation of food to the rectum and prepares for evacuation its one of the mechanisms to keep the gi tract moving at the correct pace this reflex is modifiable by psychogenic mechanisms all this to say since it happens only in restaurants but not at home there is a behavioral component to it strange as it may sound you need to figure out what it is about restaurants that accentuates your gastrocolic reflex are you nervous in restaurants are you going to very fancy restaurants are you taking clients out there or someone youre trying to impress things to think about btw if the symptoms start occuring at home as well or you see blood or start losing appetiteweight see your gastroenterologist gi guy 45 replies
