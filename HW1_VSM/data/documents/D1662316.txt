tibial plafond fracture basics description tibial plafond or pilon fractures a subset of ankle fractures are intraarticular fractures of the distal tibia involving varying degrees of articular and metaphyseal injury fig 1 the word â€œpilon comes from the french root meaning pestle or rammer conveying the idea that the talus drives into the tibial articular surface the distal tibia also is known as the plafond roof over the talus thus these fractures also are called plafond fractures these highenergy oftendevastating injuries often are associated with marked softtissue injury can be associated with substantial neurovascular compromise can be associated with other lower extremity spinal pelvic abdominal thoracic or cranial injuries are associated with the population at risk for highlevel trauma ie young malespractitioners should be even more vigilant about open injuries and vascular or tissue compromise in elderly or debilitated patients multiple classification systems exist but the ruedi and allgower system is the most commonly used type i nondisplaced or minimally displaced intraarticular fracture type ii displaced intraarticular fracture with minimal comminution type iii displaced fracture with marked comminution the ruedi and allgower 1 classification system has clinical and prognostic implications type i can be treated with splint or cast immobilization good prognosis types ii and iii require surgical intervention associated with a more guarded prognosis fig 1 tibial plafond fracture epidemiology incidence these rare injuries are associated with highenergy trauma anecdotally the incidence has been increasing with the advent of the automobile airbag risk factors individuals at risk for highlevel trauma eg young males alcohol abuse drug useindividuals who work at heights etiology highenergy injuries motor vehicle accident fall from height highenergy axial loading is the common denominator some lowenergy eg skiing injuries associated conditions patients are at high risk for associated pelvic spinal abdominal thoracic or cranial injuries diagnosis signs and symptoms history severe pain swelling inability to bear weight physical exam1st perform a complete trauma assessment with a primary survey of airway breathing circulation and then a secondary survey of the head neck chest abdomen spine pelvis and all extremities per the atls protocol evaluate softtissue status including swelling fracture blisters open fracture perform a careful neurovascular examination monitor for compartment syndrome use the wrinkle test swelling is decreased and ready for surgery when the skin wrinkles with pinching tests lab order appropriate tests for the level of injury hematocrit type and crossmatch urine and stool check for blood as indicated all preoperative laboratory tests necessary for age group level of injury and institution imaging plain radiographs ap lateral and mortise views of the ankle ap and lateral views of the foot tibiafibula some surgeons find that radiographs of the opposite extremity assist in reconstruction in severe cases if displacement or comminution is present a ct scan can be helpful for surgical planning differential diagnosis ankle fracture talus fracture tibial shaft fracture calcaneus fracture midfoot fracture forefoot fracture treatment general measures the soft tissue often is the limiting factor as well as the major cause for complications type i nondisplaced fracture responds well to closed therapy including a wellpadded splint ice elevation nonweightbearing the splint can be converted to a cast when swelling begins to subside types ii and iii displaced fractures require surgical intervention are associated with poor results and multiple complications debate continues on whether to perform open reduction with internal fixation or external fixation with or without limited internal fixation the current trend is toward external fixation with limited internal fixation because of its equivalent clinical results and lower complication rate treatment may use a staged approach initial treatment with an external fixator is important to prevent limb shortening limited percutaneous fixation may provide some fracture fixation after softtissue swelling has decreased the fixator may be removed and the fracture may be plated with severe injuries primary arthrodesis rarely has a role p455weightbearing is delayed until fracture union no matter what mode of therapy is used the time frame often is 34 months but it can be shorter for type i fractures treated nonsurgically activity fractures should be splinted and the limb kept elevated nursing always evaluate the neurovascular and softtissue status compartment syndrome checks special therapy physical therapy physical therapy to address ankle rom leg strengthening and gait after fracture healing medication patients require pain medication in the acute setting surgery in general most plafond fractures are treated using a staged surgical protocol staged treatment using initial external fixation followed by later internal fixation has decreased complication rates especially those related to softtissue healing external fixation a spanning fixator is placed using calcaneal transfixion pins and tibial halfpins a ringed fixator may be used with thin wires the fibula must be brought out to length if the lateral skin is not too swollen the fibula should be fixed with a plate the tibial articular surface should be aligned with traction and ligamentous taxis limited percutaneous fixation should be considered to reduce the fracture further the external fixator allows the soft tissues to heal for later definitive plating and bone grafting open reduction and internal fixation softtissue swelling must be resolved before an open approach to the distal tibia which may require waiting several weeks an anterior approach often is necessary to expose the fracture and allow precise reduction reconstruct the distal tibial articular surface with lag screws bone graft the tibial metaphyseal defect stabilize the distal articular surface to the proximal tibia contoured plates are available that fit the medial or lateral surface of the tibia modern plates allow for percutaneous subperiosteal placement and the use of locking technology followup prognosis highenergy pilon fractures have a

icd9cm8238 tibial plafond fracture patient teaching patients are counseled on the risk of posttraumatic arthritis and the risk of longterm pain and disability faqq is a pilon fracture more severe than an ankle fracture a yes a pilon fracture is a highenergy fracture affecting the weightbearing articular surface of the ankle patients are at high risk for longterm ankle pain and dysfunction q should all pilon fractures be treated with open reduction and internal fixation a no skin integrity is the overriding concern if the ankle is very swollen open reduction should be delayed and the ankle
