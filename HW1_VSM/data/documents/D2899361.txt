anyone trying to succeed as a mobile notary should consider these activities have worked for me and the many notary entrepreneurs i have mentored through my business at your service mobile notary1 know your ‘why’ and write a plan take the time to document your mission with a business plan this will be your guide for making future decisions about how you run your business and what you are willing to do or not do each time you market advertise network etc it should take you closer to achieving your “why” your plan should include basic business requirements such as hours of service specialties expected expenses how your service fulfills a niche that other notaries do not and what your goals are this too will give you direction in building a successful business2 find a coach or mentor depending on your circumstances you may need a notaryspecific mentor a small business expert a life coach etc you can find a notary mentor by asking on social media such as the nnas linked in discussion groups be sure to choose wisely especially if you pay for the service check their credentials to verify that they have the expertise in the area you need if you’re seeking a notary mentor

finding complementary nonnotary services in addition social media savvy is important do they have a seasoned website that generates leadsrevenue3 diversify many mobile notaries put all their energies into getting loansigning assignments but this is risky it’s better to build a solid revenue stream through a suite of services — especially if they have staggered income cycles consider what other notary specialties or services beyond notary work that complement the service you provide different receivables cycles help keep cash flow steady nsaloan signings are typically 30 – 45 days after completion of job while general mobile notary work direct to consumer is paid at completion of job are there assignments that require a specific skill set or qualifications beyond being a notary that would differentiate you from other notary services4 consider strategic alliances don’t automatically view other notaries in your market as competition instead finds ways to make them strategic partners in order to broaden your reach do they have skills or offer services that you do not ie offer bilingual services or work 247 or are attorneys and vice versa this even applies to retail businesses for example if you refer clients who do not need mobile service to your local parcel shipping store the store will refer clients who need notary services after normal business hours to you another way to build strategic alliances is by networking with local professional and business associations interest groups and charitable organizations this is not necessarily about getting direct work instead it’s about building relationships with people in your community who can spread the word about your services in other words turn them into your marketing team it will take you from being a stranger to the inner circle and that is who we do business with those we know and like5 identifyevaluate your client base as you look for new clients remember not all clients are the right fit for example customers who offer assignments that do not produce a profit for you means you won’t stay in business long customers such as signing services and title companies who pay long after the work has been completed should be evaluated for credit worthiness how many jobs will you do while previous work has not yet been paid research clients on notary registries linked in sites yelp and other sources for recommendations or warnings do they fit your fee structure remember as an independent contractor you determine your costs and what your profit margin will be make sure you know what your bottom line is then monitor measure adjust if the prospective client does not meet your requirements let them go it is better to have fewer revenuegenerating clients than 50 who lead you to bankruptcy that’s doubly true of clients that do business in a way that goes against your own philosophy or raises compliance concerns always keep an eye on your “why” in other words regularly ask yourself if you are meeting your mission then make adjustments as needed laura biewer owns at your service mobile notary in modesto california she also teaches seminars for the national notary association and is
