fit and finish of the rv is horrible they didnt cut the trim pieces they broke them off and nailed them into place my previous rv was a skyline ecocamp considered to be very low end but the quality of work was much superior to the keystone outback there are several things that are designed poorly but the worst is the closets they are so short that all your shirts wrinkle just hanging what on earth were they thinking there is plenty of room below the closet if they extended them 68 it would be a whole different experience i bought from camping world i have not been pleased with the service so far 5 calls within the first 2 weeks of ownership to just get someone to the work done they promised when i bought the great thing about this camper it is much warmer than my last one they did insulate it well and that has been a very fun experience compared to my last rv it pulls very well but so did my previous one the layout is great in the kitchen area but the bathroom is really small not sure why again there is room but they just didnt seem to use it no toilet paper holder in the bathroom no towel rack seems like they just cut crap to save money and let you fix it i agree its just

times in it and have enjoyed it each time the biggest complaint i have with our camper is the mattress that came on the queen size bed passport should be embarrassed to put this mattress in one of their campers after sleeping on it for our three camping trips i ordered a new mattress and disposed of the old mattress in the county dump when i unzip the mattress to look inside the mattress was stuff with what appeared to be packing material there was no support to this mattress i would recommend the camper with the understanding when you purchase it you are doing so knowing you will have to

were they drill a hole for the incoming water supply and you can also see they never put insulation or any foam board in the walls not sure why maybe because keystone does not care its not quality

support bought ours in february 2017  it was a show trailer there are two 371s for 2017  the early model and the xedition ours is the early model and is the fourth rv we have owned i wasnt happy with the dark colored exterior as it causes issues in the sun but happy wife happy life she loves it and we were able to find many matching accessories the floor plan is excellent  it certainly checks all the boxes for making my wife comfortable with a toy hauler previous toy haulers are spartan in this price range not having many amenities or comforts to just being a shed for toys on wheels the 371 was the standout at the rv show pricefeatures being the criteria from the 6jack hydraulic leveling to the appcontrol you seem to get far more than the asking price would indicate what could be better but that is where it ends as others have said if you plan to buy a toy hauler  particularly one of these  prepare for some work not only will you be presented with rushed design and poor engineering but you will find many hidden flaws that quickly come to light when you use it the first problem i had was with the lippert hydraulic system quick connect plugs on the fill tank one was leaking and it took many tries with lippert to find out that the connectors should have been removed by the dealer and the lines capped off got that done no more leak 4 hydraulic caps saved the day 8 and i did it at the show we noticed the bathroom door was loose on the hinges it was fixed by the dealer before delivery but after a 1200mile trip it had come off two of the hinges and beat the ceiling and some moldings seems the door is solid wood weighing about 3040 pounds and is held on by bifold door hinges that could only take about 10 it is now sporting 7 hinges and will get a piano hinge if necessary it should have been mortised with real residential hinges the television mount bracket was screwed into 14 luan instead of the blocks behind the panel it came off luckily soon after we returned home or we would have lost a 47 tv i found the blocks with a stud finder and had to cut the arm 3 shorter if it comes loos again i will bolt some 34 plywood to the mount you hit your head on the cabinets in the bedroom and the door to the garage i guess the person who designed the interior was 45 tall the rear bathroom is the proper height to solve this we put little duck stickers where you can hit your head the humor helps the bumps there was a pound of sawdust in all the ductwork which had to be vacuumed up after it all blew out many parts were put in places they did not go or had no logical use there were flaws in all the paneling and moldings which had to be fixed with a stain marker and eyeliner be prepared to deal with these and many other problems when you make a decision to buy a 371 and probably others if you are not handy you will wait months for repairs or be sorely disappointed all this written i still love the trailer and would definitely recommend it to a handy friend

camper has a horrible water leak out of the return air vent in the rear den the list continues the living room slides in and the top trim rubs the half bath wall and has already ruined the wallpaper

warranty  support we have had numerous problems with this camper we bought it in oct 2016 in november we had a storm and it leaked so bad in the bunk room that i had to put out theee pots to catch the water the next problem was the trim on the bedroom cabinets they are not made of real wood anymore they are covered by an adhesive backed paper when the cabinets were made the person covering them did not take the time to make sure the paper was properly applied the paper is sticking straight up on the top of the cabinet and there are bubbles all underneath thpaper im sure in a years time all of it will be peeling the next problem there are two bunks with no way to get on them other than to climb on the tv cabinet or on top of the recliners how long would they hold up to kids climbing up on them keystone is so cheap that they cant even offer us a ladder the next problem the black and grey water tanks were marked wrong which caused the first several flushes to be done with the black water real nice huh next problem the freezer does not stay at freezing temp it takes two days to freeze a tray of ice the next problem two window shades did not work dealer did order those but we had to install them ourselves bc we live in this camper and annoy take it in to dealer and leave it for weeks to be fixed the next problem the washer and dryer hookups were put in a cabinet that will not open far enough to put a washerdryer in it this was caused by poor design the cabinet doors will not open due to slide out trim the next problemthe door knob on the bedroom door has fallen off three times turns out the screws put in to hold the knob together do not fit they are too smalland easily slide in and out of the screw holes the awning motor is starting to make a horrible sound as the awning is retracted like it is in a bind so i guess that will be another problem before its over i owned a montana before this one a 2005 model i do not know what has happened since 2005 but the quality of

quality floor plan driving  towing factory warranty  support my wife and i bought a new 2017 montana high country in oct 2016 we traded in a 2005 montana fifth wheel the 2005 was a nice solid built camper very comfortable but we were going to be living in a camper for a while with 3 pets so we decided we needed something bigger because the 2005 had been a good camper we trusted keystone and did not even consider a different brand big mistake keystone quality and service has gone downhill and we will never buy another one we had the new camper for 45 weeks when a storm came thru my wife got up in the middle of the night and found a big leaking problem from the ceiling in the bunk room the floor the couch and the carpet under the couch were all wet we had to put 3 pots out to catch water as i stated earlier we are living in this camper so taking it in for repairs is not easy we have to find somewhere to stay that allows pets and then theres the hassle of packing everything up well it just so happened we were going to be going home for most of the month of december so the local dealership we bought the camper fvan on told us that would be a good time to bring it in and leave it that that would give them plenty of time to fix it there wereare several other issues with the camper as well as the leak such as 2 sets of window shades would not work the trim on the bedroom cabinets which are apparently not solid wood anymore but are covered by a wood appearing adhesive paper did not stick when installed and is peeling up and has bubbles all underneath the refrigerator was not staying at 32 degrees therefore taking two days to freeze a tray of ice and keeping food semi frozen there was a toilet issue in the small bathroom where water leaked around the seal the black and gray water tanks are mislabeled so when you drain the black tank you are really draining the gray tank and vice versa the bunk beds have no ladder to get up on the beds with so kids have to climb on the cabinet with the tv on one side or on the recliners on the other side there are hookups for a washer and dryer in a cabinet in the living room the problem is the way the slide out is designed the cabinet doors will not open all the way so the only way you could put a washer and dryer in would be to remove the cabinet doors and then leave them off to be able to get in to them that would look really nice in your living room huhthere is also a kitchen cupboard cabinet door that will not fully open for the same reason we are talking about a 70000 camper here we took the camper to the dealership here that we bought it from again they told us it would be ready when we got back in a month when we picked it up it was pretty apparent that the only thing they had done was clean a duct or vent out to fix the leak however we again had wet carpet a week later they did not touch the trim there still is no ladder and they told us the parts fir the shades did not come in however strangely the parts came in two days after we picked it up i will say it did rain here yesterday and the camper did not leak that time they are now telling us that we have to bring the a per back in again to get it fixed we called keystone and told them the problems and explained we are living in this camper we asked could they send someone here to work on it or have the dealership where we bought it send someone we are only 8 miles from the dealership the answer was no they could care less that we are inconvenienced by the poor quality of their product we bought this camper in good faith that keystone would stand by their product and be there if there were any problems this is no way to treat loyal customers i have referred them to friends before because i believed in them so take my advice look the other way when you are looking for a new camper there are a lot of other nice campers out there that i am sure treat their customers like they should be treated do your homework read up on reviews and you will see that im only one of many that have had problems with them its very sad because the camper has a lot of appeal darrell church florida did you find this

claims than camping trips in 3 months i just cant after bringing it home the first issue we had was one of the slide brackets had ripped the screws that attach the l brackets to the slide and the exterior siding away we hauled it back to the dealer where we bought it and it sat for 3 weeks before we heard it had finally got approval from keystone for warranty they made temporary repairs so we could use it and they will fix it when parts come in in 68 weeks we got our maiden trip in without any hiccups and we were looking forward to our up coming trip to an out of state park the first weekend of may the time has come for our 2nd trip and the weather was not in our favor cold wind and rain with wind guest up to 30mph and no full hookup at the state park i opted to fill the fresh water tank to help with lower center of gravity while towing and help with the guest we made it all of 10 miles on our 140 mile trip before the fresh water tank fell out of the bottom of the underbelly tearing up all the insulation wires hoses and was being drug down the road wedged between the highway and front axle on trailer at this time i do have to say the customer service i received from keystone after calling them to look for any sort of roadside assistance was above what i had expected and she was in contact thru email with me the whole time i was stranded she had called multiple local dealers that were not keystone dealers to try to help me out of the bind i was in i had got ahold of the service manager at the dealer we purchased the rv from and he sent 2 techs out to get it road worthy and agreed to haul the camper back for repairs i have nothing bad to speak about the service i received from the manufacturer nor the dealer but with the quality ive seen from this keystone product i dont know how keystone is still in business i would strongly recommend finding a good dealer before buying any rv but i would more so recommend looking at other brands other

keystone cougar 33res and we love it the dry weight is 7700 lbs and my 2014 ford f150 xlt 35 ecoboost truck with a tow package pulls it easily one suggestion on the f150 is that you need to buy 10 ply tires for your truck and weight distributing bars the trailer has a kingsize bed and dual acheat at 36 ft it has plenty of room and the rounded ceiling gives plenty of extra headroom for my 62 frame if i wanted to be hypercritical i would wish for a bigger shower and a prewired cable hookup outside it is wired for antenna outside but not cable one other amenity would have been nice namely an

and have had a great experience with it the king size bed is so nice in the heat of summer the dual ac would freeze you out if you so desired at 7780 dry weight our f150 ford ecoboost had no problems pulling the trailer i would recommend investing in 10 ply tires to eliminate any sway once we had the tires installed it pulled with ease we get about 10 mpg on the road the exterior is asthetically appealing to the eye in the interior it is a beautiful design the arched roof eliminates the closed in feeling found on some flat roof interior designs in the kitchen you will find a spacious refrigerator and functional island the fireplace and entertainment system is placed at the end of the travel trailer so you want be distracted by people walking in front of it the design is well thought out and practical the only mild criticisms would be that the shower is a bit small and the outside wiring is antenna ready but not cable ready overall i would recommend the keystone cougar

september 2016 we purchased a 2017 montana high country 310re we uncovered it a few weeks ago march 2017 discovering roof issues trying to keep this short as possible my review consists of their actual response to not honor the warranty and our response which they have completely ignored our dealer is shocked by their response and is also stuck trying to help us keystone responseas discussed and relayed via phone we have fully reviewed your case file and photos provided keystone does respectfully decline participation in the request of replacing your roof this will be our final determination regarding your case this is a warranty exclusion outlined in your owners manual which i have attached to this email and summarized below keystone will not be responsible or liable for incidental or consequential damages of any kind or nature that result from any defect in the recreational vehicle the disclaimer of consequential damages is not dependent upon the warranty fulfilling its essential purpose please note keystone does not recommend aftermarket products for their units any failures or issues that may arise or are related to or from an aftermarket product will not be warranted we do appreciate the opportunity to review your request our response  wow thats all i can say is wow the warranty doesnt cover defects of a trailer that left the factory with waves uneven plywood and areas of the plywood lifting off of the frame there are also areas of staples coming up and no flashing to protect the rubber roof from the plywood we have read and found information from those who didnt find these defects until they discovered leaks in their travel trailer i guess we should just be happy we found this mess before any leaks occurred but according to the statement below keystone also states it will not cover any aftermarket product so if we repair on our own in order to keep the trailer from leaking this will void the entire warranty this is all very confusing we thought warranties were made to cover defects we never would have dreamed to look for fine print such as this in an owners warranty manual we thought maybe some of the minor issues we had with our previously owned 2013 outback we purchased brand new because we found more time to start camping again were because it was smaller and considered more of a midline quality travel trailer about 12 years ago we purchased brand new and were the proud owners of a montana mountaineer we really enjoyed that trailer but time didnt allow us to use it much and we regretfully sold it so we thought by spending our hard earned money quite a bit i might add to again purchase a better quality top of the line montana high country we would not have many problems this purchase of the montana high country in addition to our previous purchases shows how much faith we had in keystone our plans were even to purchase the ultimate top of the line montana in a few years as our retirement home i guess since we never encountered any major issues before we have been disillusioned in thinking that keystone cares anything about their customers mr jackson we are just sick over this we purchased this trailer at the end of september 2016 and have only been out in it twice before putting it away for the winter we are not trying to pull one over on your company or get something we dont deserve we just want

the negative are the initial tv broke when we tried to get it fixed they looked up the manufacture date and it was 6 months earlier then when we even bought the trailer so they did not honor it really we have had a couple of growing pains that were expected one that we noticed more so after using it a number of times last year was that there really is not a lot of space between the end of the bed mattress and the wall an extra 4 or 5 inches would be great the other issue is that there have been a number of times when we would not receive either radio or tv reception even when we have gotten great reception in our truck i understand that an external antenna will help that problem question why would they not have an external antenna already if you have a radio and tv in the trailer other

and hills smooth on the turns and a great suspension the best is the easy set up the overall quality inside is great only thing i have to say wrong about it is that there is lot of unused hidden spaces that can be used for more storage inside the unit as well as the lack of counter space to work on but that was expected when we purchased it otherwise we love the current floor model everything on the unit worked perfectly of course with traveling 11000km round trip in a month we expected a few things to happen and they did break in period the 1 year manufacture warranty has covered everything that need to be fixed or repaired so far and we also add the extend warranty package to help us through its future use our unit has had a full haul on the different type of highways and i

frame to be repainted with undercoating i noticed several instances where it appeared that the frame was rusted and not cleaned prior to painting which kept the paint from actually sealing and protecting the metal also when we were staying in the first week i noticed one of the tanks grey 2 was never indicating its level upon chasing the wires from the control box in the underbelly to the

it is my first rv and i was wowed by the bling whoever installed the finish trim should be fired as they were nail happy but not very smart and i guess the same person did the nail putty as it is also poorly done i also have white caulk covering up something but the wall paper is beige the riser on the stairs is coming off since it wasnt nailed properly and the finish is scuffed on the cherry treads the fireplace wont shut off so i have to turn off the breaker when i leave for work the heated floor in the bathroom scorched the flooring so im lucky i was home and smelled it before it burned me out the control panel for the auto leveler went bad and it took 2 months to get a replacement the tank heaters quit working entirely so im lucky im in california for now the hardware on the sliding closet doors wont allow the doors to close completely unless i force them you have to manually light the oven on your knees as it doesnt have a starter like the stovetop the very expensive 18 cu ft side by side fridge constantly frosts up the slides leak cold air a lot so you go through a lot of propane unless you buy an electric heater to subsidize the fireplace if you like to be warm and of course i would have to pay to move my rv to a dealer and live in a hotel to get any of this fixed i would look at another manufacturer if i was more informed by the way all of this has gone bad in the

to have it looked at the dealership we took it to had to fix the tape in the duct work and some other things and thought that it was fixed we took it out that weekend to try it out it was not any better we took it backthey thought it needed a new unit they called coleman they said they would send a new ceiling assembly to fix it it definitely helped the air circulation as it just goes through the duct work now instead of the assembly vents our dealership told us there are several problems with the setup of this unit they do not sell this particular unit at their dealership they told us for starters that there are only two vents in the living room and one in the kitchen but its closer to the living room area this camper has high ceilings and the skylight in the kitchen area puts out a lot of heat it could burn you when the sun is on the island we purchased some foam insulated pillows to put in the skylight to keep the heat out they told us that if we were camping when its really hot we will need at least 50 amp to run both ac units and then several fans will need to be running to keep the air moving because of the lack of vents the slideout ceilings in the living room were tested with a gauge and it was running 100 degrees with the living room ac running there are not many electrical outlets in this camper to run all of these fans the location of the thermostat is too high on the wall in the hallway to the bedroom not all the storage areas outside have lights and the only light on the outside is the awning light and light under the step when i first got my camper home the trim in the kitchen above the stove was already falling down i had to nail it up as it would not stay up with glue now after getting it home the trim in front of the closet in the bedroom is loose and i will probably have to fix it also i am going to talk to keystone about possibly putting in another vent in the kitchen to help cool it and see if they will pay for it as it is a design

the central vacuum built in also the correct trac suspension was a great feature when we purchased the unit i guess you dont notice all the things that were wrong with it until you actually use it first thing we noticed was how horrible the workmanship was poor construct ability like nothing is square around the doors like the pantry and bathroom the molding around front door coming off the wallpaper throughout the unit was coming off the underbelly was sagging and was not fully enclosed like was indicated we purchased aluminum siding which i shouldnt have i should of stuck with fiberglass it just felt cheaper and it just moved a lot in the wind when being towed like around the wheel well area our first time out we were using the clean out which did not work so we scheduled an appointment to take in and have all these issues fixed which were corrected somewhat the trailer spent about 3 and a half weeks there before we got it back the weekend of the 4th of july we had a trip scheduled in las vegas nevada which is an 8 to 9 hour trip as we were towing we had to stop constantly and put molding around the tire fender kept coming off because was not put on correctly we finally arrived in las vegas in an rv park with full hook ups to find out the electric heater did not work we had to use propane also our couch was sinking in and we could not use the couch our air conditioner did work thank god but woul not shut down after reaching temp we would have to manually shut down we have been plagued with problems from the start if i had known we were going to run into this much problems on a brand new unit i would of stayed with the unit we traded in we owned another keystone bullet different model we absolutely had no problems with that unit which we owned for 3 years thats why we went with keystone again in my opinion keystone has gone down in quality and workmanship at least with this particular model i would probably save yourself lots of grief and stay

open and use a wrench to manually crank it in then took it to camping world for the warranty repairs took 3 weeks but keystone covered it turned out to be a short in the wiring they informed me glad we werent full timing it this so far is the biggest problem there are a lot of small items eg kitchen sink faucet leaked and bubbled up the counter top around it i replaced the defective faucet and there were a couple cabinet issues pantry shelving fell down but considering the time frame for warranty work i opted to fix myself heres the dealif you want a perfect camping trailer it aint gonna happen there will always be problems when you expose any unit to an earthquake and a hurricane for 6 hours a day towing at 70mph and bouncing on crappy roads  do that for weeks on end and really think about it due diligence people dont buy anything without a ton of research anyway we previously owned a premier bullet 19 by keystone and had no problems at all i mean nothing thats why we stayed with

noticed water damage the day i accepted delivery and was told the unit had just had fabric protection installed and that was the cause after returning the unit for additional quality issues eg toilet not holding water refrigerator not working properly etc the dealer noticed the roof transition was pulled loose as a result major water damage occurred to the mattress bedding etc an additional issue occurred with the 7pin cable it is too short i have a 2015 nissan pathfinder with the 7pin jack on the passenger side of the bumper the trailer 7pin cable pulled loose on my first trip upon pointing this out to the dealer service advisors they simply rerouted the cable and said that is all that was needed after i picked up the trailer following fix of previous quality issues i had a near wreck with a 18 wheeler and once i got to my destination discovered the cable had again pulled loose and the cable head destroyedthus i had no turn signals or brake lights i went to a local dealer while on

under warranty due to poor design it includes double quad steps to get insideout located toward the front and another the rear but the last step going into the trailer has to large of a distance causing it to be unsafe and if your 512 or shorter you will most likely have issues getting into the trailer from the 4th step because its to big of a step into the kitchen pantry has a horrible design the shelves have fallen after a 2 hour drive we have been thru 3 sets of shelves and are now taking our food inside our truck or extra vehicle needed to take food and passengers and montanas customer service just advises us to call where we bought it from but dont get me started on the horrible repair department at the dealership so now we are hounding keystone montanas customer service for a fix and they dont show any signs that they care about their horrible designs since you have already bought their 96000 trailer the bathroom you must walk all the way into the bathroom to the far wall to locate the onoff switch any other trailers or houses for that matter you find the onoff switch just inside the room so you can reach and turn on for safety measures why bother turning the light on since you have already made it all the way inside the bathroom hopefully without tripping over anything and where are you suppose to place your bath towels while in the shower or out the toilet or the counter also the couch seat cushions are too soft to sit on comfortably there needs to be some kind of substance to a cushion beside the outside cushion material you shouldnt bottom out weighting only 120 pounds so plan on taking them to an ulpostry store to fix correctly the backup camera was also wired wrong it was wired for constant power instead of the backup lights where it

sent me the correct door once it arrived and i put it in myself which was no big deal i know several people with campers rvs toy haulers etc they all require maintenance they all have issues but this is my second fuzion and i would do it again if you are going to move your camper be prepared to work on it some thats just the way it is any brand and if you arent diligent about maintenance youre

great on quality room storage upgrades and price we loved the upgraded leather furniture that we purchased the fifth wheel came with a 50 led tv in the living room which made our leisure time wonderful if we were inside the kitchen area is extensive with an island and the huge 4 door refrigerator if you cant find enough room in that refrigerator then i dont think anything will suit there is plenty of room in the kitchen for storage and the stoveoven combo is great plus there is a microwaveconvection oven also the bathroom features a large walkin shower and the storage in the bathroom is great and the sink cabinet has a dorian countertop similar to the kitchen area the bedroom has a king size bed and cedar lined closets with drawers in one that pull out there is also a 32 led tv

the 5th wheel but because of the difficulty in dealing with keystone we used our rig one time last fall and took it in for warranty work the dealership had it for 3 months waiting for minor things like a bedspread that had been damaged at the dealership a door handle that had come lose etc minor things we couldnt use it through the winter so when we finally got it back it sat until this past spring when we took it on a trip we had a minor accident with it and damaged the side we took it to a repair shop and they have had it for two more months and have been fighting keystone who wont deal with repair shops wont get warranty work done in a timely manor and are generally impossible to work with i would advise anyone who is in the market for a 5th wheel or trailer to avoid getting anything from keystone their products are nice no question but their customer service is as poor as it gets we have had our rig about a year and have been able to use it twice most of the time it has

livability overall quality floor plan driving  towing factory warranty  support when we bought this trailer we were told a few things all things we need in a trailer my husband is a traveling mlt so we cant have a stationary home 1 it is a 4season trailer false our pipes froze repeatedly last winter even though it didnt get that cold or stay very cold for very long at a time even with a heated water hose and insulation for the sewage hoses everything froze at least 3 times in the span of a month 2 its a pretty solid trailer and everything is in working order now this one was something i was wary of because it seemed pretty inexpensive for a 3bed travel trailer so i made sure they tested everything before we took it off the lot unfortunately everything that has broken since we purchased it has been broken more than once and the first things that broke did so in the first 3 months air conditioner continuously threw breakers every time it ran for longer than about 5 minutes which is about how long it runs when its set to cycle so it would run once then throw a breaker the furnace was about the same way it would run for a while then suddenly shut down whats dangerous about that is when the furnace is heating it can be a fire hazard in this trailer because it gets really hot if it suddenly shuts down the fan shuts off toonot cooling it fast enough and increasing the chances for a fire the master bed is structurally unsound the base of the bed collapsed within a month the end of the bed has a storage area and the lid is the foot of the bed its on hydraulic hinges and they lasted about 3 weeks before any questions are asked we hadnt done anything vigorous in it we had slept in it but the bed started sagging it never really got fixed as it was we removed the hinges and bolstered the frame ourselves the head of the bed the wall is curved unfortunately it came to us with a huge gap between the paneling and the cabinet above the bed it is also very drafty throughout the winter we had to stuff some insulation up there to keep from freezing and that only kinda worked the pipes under the trailer burst at one point in the summertime and we had to poke a hole in the underbelly to drain it im pretty certain they didnt do anything to it to fix it we now have a deluge in our trailernot our kitchenour trailer it is still leaking whatever they did to fix it either didnt work or they didnt do anything to it to top things off i cant even show you the damages weve had since we got this thing because the website wont allow me to upload any pictures kathleen dahl

rocker switch does not auto stop when the awning is extended so the awning rolls either clockwise or counterclockwise the access cupboard door to the electronics the screws have fallen out so the door no longer closes the night shades have fallen down while parked since repaired the water heater when switched to propane sounds like it is ready to explode and numerous other items the bedroom area is really hot during heated days because there is no circulation one of the drawbacks i found is there isnt a ladder to access the roof or the slide how do you check the slide for debris or lubricate the antenna without carrying a separate ladder the exterior pass thru is barely large enough for the water hose and accessories i seriously would rethink about purchasing a springdale i was thinking about

with a new awning repair time was four weeks we went out for the second time last week first week in may 2016 and the valve on the toilet started leaking and the toilet fills to the rim with water the air conditioner sounds like it is going to explode the biggest thing that is wrong about this trailer is that the bathroom door opens into the bathroom right up against the toilet if you had a medical emergency in the bathroom while sitting on the toilet you could not get the door open due to some one blocking the opening i have found out that the summerland line is the lowest end for keystone so

fixed on my own as it would be more expensive in gas to drag it to the nearest dealer the board separating the water tank and electric cord cubby was not even mounted 34 screws on the exterior came out and fell off within the first month ptrap gasket for the sink was not installed correctly from the factory so the sink leaked the table sides starting separating in the first 6 months the bumper end caps both fell out within a month or two metal bits fell into our food as they did not clean out the range fan after drilling out the some metal i had to take the screen off and vacuum it out currently the trailer wiring has gone bad as it keeps blowing fuses in my 2015 tundra there is a short somewhere that will likely take days to sort out if i can even get to the wiring overall i would rather have my money back and purchased a more expensive much better built model likely from a different company i am getting tired of having to fix something in this trailer every time i use it ben

rating livability overall quality floor plan driving  towing i have owned 5 recreational vehicles in the last 20 years i have owned three different manufacturers i have owned to keystone fusion products my first keystone project was a pretty decent vehicle except for all of my decals rotted off in 2 12 years i traded off by 2007 fusion for 2014 fusion and the quality of workmanship on this unit has been less than desirable from day one ive had nothing but brake problems suspension problems electrical problems and now ventilation problems in the addict the most current issue is due to sloppy workmanship attention to detail needs to be greatly improved by this manufacture in the last five years california has suffered droughts this year weve received a normal amount of water when they installed the roof and install the venting on the roof they neglected to cut away the excess material in the vent holes prior to installing vents in the addict which has caused condensation and damage in the interior of my 70000 trailer i will purchase a nother keystone product as long as i live i have contacted manufacture by email telephones to no response my only alternative is to contact attorney and sue them for the value of my unit it is my opinion that congressional laws need to be put in place so there will be some standard of construction and force the rv industry to give a 36 month warranty unlimited miles i have spent thousands of dollars in repairs because of the walk of quality work from this manufacture sincerely mitchell mitchell gulbranson california did you find

peeling back in the wind as we were driving down the road we stopped at a dealer where we were told this is not uncommon with keystone as well as our dealer at home take note the manufacturer only warranties the roof 1 year we discovered our extended warranty did not cover it at all our insurance adjuster also said it was not covered as it was a manufacturer defect as the membrane was only 15 inches under the front molding and it should have been more this repair costs 9500 we appealed to the manufacturer to fix the roof as we had a letter from both dealers and our insurance saying this was a defect keystone is not customer friendly and has no integrity secondly we had a tire blowout and aaa told us our tires were dated 2012 on our 2014 alpine jewel masters arizona did you find this

quality floor plan driving  towing i bought this piece of trash in chesapeake virginia the quality of construction is the worst i have seen i wish i could put pictures on here to show what the issues are but all i can do is talk about it just going try and keep calm when im writing this because i have been wanting to do this for sometime and i dont want miss anything 1 furnace 15 degrees temp difference from front of trailer to back no air blowing out the floor vents in the back living area no filter for the air and it is open to the belly where no one cleaned up after they installed things continues to blow dirt around and there is no excess to the furnace techs came out from the dealer and removed and rerouted some duct work took about 10 feet of excess duct out of the system still no change 2 heated belly space every spot where wires or hoses went through the frame was not sealed up this is heated space went through 2 tanks of propane in a week i also have problems with drafts and bugs coming in from these holes in the frame so much for clean air 3 the gates for the grey tanks and black water tanks do not function correctly hard to pull out and to close black water tank gate will not close all the way the stupid vents they have under the sinks and counters to vent for the waste tanks have malfunctioned a number of time and i have had to leave the trailer a number of times to let the trailer air out 4 water control valve has broken dealer gave me a new one did not install it 5 leveling jacks keep leaking down had to tighten up many fittings myself and they still leak down 6 propane hoses connecting to the tanks leak replaced them already 7 slid has leaked talked to a few dealers about that and they said i needed toppers put on my slides more money to spend on this thing they said it is normal to have leaks there i call bs after investigating the construction of this trailer i found that the only thing that keeps rain and water from coming in at the slides is two soft rubber seals roof material comes to the fascia that touches the wall on the inside there is a small metal trim that holds the roofing down slide sags in the middle and water works its way under the seals and over the metal trim bam water soaked inside 8 the windows were not sealed when they were installed single pane and i know there can be a draft coming from the drain vents i used the window film that you install and heat shrink it to fit the windows works good found the draft coming in around the window trim after i looked into that i found out there was no seal around the windows 9 the microwave was not installed level 10 the linoleum floor was not glued down and is rippling up 11 the walls on the slides feel like there is no insulation in them they are not solid 12 crown molding is coming down 13 the door was not sealed when it was installed 14 rubber seal on some of the slides are to short and when its raining and the wind blows it leaks in around the floor of the slide the quality of this trailer is a shame i spent a lot of money on this trying to simplify my life after a divorce and live in this trailer full time i am sure i missed a few things the one thing i am sure of is that i will never buy another keystone product i know what i mentioned here is not an isolated incident with an upset owner i met an older couple that bought a smaller alpine but a year newer than mine and they have the same problems as i do it also pisses me off that they dont even have a place to put a contact number so they can call you to talk about your issues
