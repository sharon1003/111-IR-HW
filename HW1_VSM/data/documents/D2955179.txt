education science physics how gravity affects the acceleration of an object on an inclined plane how gravity affects the acceleration of an object on an inclined plane related book physics i for dummies 2nd edition by steven holzner you can use physics to determine how gravity affects the acceleration of an object as it moves along an inclined plane when you’re on or near the surface of the earth the pull of gravity is constant it’s a constant force directed straight down with magnitude equal to mg where m is the mass of the object being pulled by gravity and g is the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravityg  98 meterssecond 2  322 feetsecond 2acceleration is a vector meaning it has a direction and a magnitude so this equation really boils down to g an acceleration straight down toward the center of the earth the fact that f gravity  m g is important because it says that the acceleration of a falling body doesn’t depend on its mass f gravity  m a  m g in other words m a  m g because a  g a heavier object doesn’t fall faster than a lighter one gravity gives any freely falling body the same acceleration downward  g near the surface of earth assuming that no other forces such as air resistance are present plenty of gravityoriented problems in introductory physics involve inclined planes or ramps gravity accelerates objects down ramps — but not the full force of gravity only the component of gravity acting along the ramp accelerates the object that’s why an object rolling down a steep ramp rolls quickly the ramp slopes sharply downward close to the direction of gravity so most of the force of gravity can act along the ramp to find out how much of the force of gravity accelerates an object on a ramp you have to break the gravity vector into its components along and perpendicular to the ramp racing a cart down a ramp check out the figure here a cart is about to roll down a ramp the cart travels not only vertically but also horizontally along the ramp which is inclined at an angle theta say thatand that the length of the ramp is 50 meters how fast will the cart be going at the bottom of the ramp you know the length of the ramp so if you can find the cart’s acceleration along the ramp you can calculate the cart’s final velocity
