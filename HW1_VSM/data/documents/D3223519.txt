recruiter to see this and offer me a job thanks31 comments topic closed1 2 3 next »aug 28 01hi i just noticed your post i too have been interested in working in ireland what i have found out from colleagues is that nurses there do more of the cna type of responsibiliites such the dr does not want you to do the assessment etc i have written to an irish hospital who said they would recruit me this is something i may do anyway as a long term visit to my families roots i am of irish decent you can find web sites on irish hospital recruters i think there is another type of nclex for international nursing as you probably know the economy is booming but i have heard nursing wages are very low one article i read sited the nurses there enjoy the patient care ratios and find the job rewarding good luck to youmar 6 02let me help you both i worked in ireland and not through an agency i went to dublin to visit a friend and went to the irish nursing board they gave me a package which

email address feb 16 08i say the person who says salary in ireland is lowwww i object having been a celtic tiger in the present years ireland nurses are the worlds 2nd highest paid nurses next to japan rewarding because we only have 6 patient in a day and basically we are onto team nursing patient are less lemanding and of course not suing the nurse unlike the american patient i dont see myself being sued by a freak patients afterall the efforts and care it is a hostility of society a disgraced behaviour be the people who overloved freedomit is the stupidity of patientswell why i say this its because patient should be happy that they are being cared for in return they should be respectful to nurse not suing themit is a cultural situation irish are generous kind and with sense of humuri love them and no one ever have complaint me and it is not the culture in this irish society feb 16 08quote from lhw4102i say the person who says salary in ireland is lowwww i object having been

look at the dates of the posts that you are referring to they are from 2001 and 2002 i seriously do hope that there has been an increase in pay since that time and nurses in japan are not the highest paid by any means and ca actually has ratio laws where they cannot have over five patients to begin with you may wish to do some reading on these forums to find out what is actually happening around you feb 24 08can a filipino nurse with a few months of experience work in ireland i am frustrated right now because i already passed my cgfns nclex and ielts yet america wont issue immigrant visas this time what should i do its just frustrating that after working hard to pass those exams i end up uncertain about my hope of working in the usa feb 24 08quote from oneproudigorotcan a filipino

just frustrating that after working hard to pass those exams i end up uncertain about my hope of working in the usa you will still need to go through the process with the irish nursing board which can take a few months but there is no guarantee that you can find an employer willing to help with a work permit maybe worth contacting some hospitals in ireland but be aware eu does ask that countries employ own citizens then eu before the rest of the world so may have difficulties plus you may have a contract to sign which may have conflict with the us httpwwwnursingboardieenhomepageaspx feb 24 08add to what anna has posted and you will still need to go thru their licensing process as well as immigration process to be able to work there and they essentially will hire those from their own country and then those that hold a eu passport over anyone else so unless you have years of experience in an area that they require help in it is now going to be very hard to be sponsored for a visa that will permit you to work there i am sure that you have seen several posts by filipinos that are now there but they went over there several years ago and things have changed as far as visas best of luck to you mar 21 08hi i applied for registration with an bord altranaisunfortunately i must undertake a period of adaptation and assessment if you could help me find a hospital or agency who will

ireland for years now as a nurse in a nursing home i already worked here in the philippines as a staff nurse for a year now and by the end of this year shes planning to take me with her would it be
