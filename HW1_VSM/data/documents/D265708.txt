how the most skilled communicators respond when listening the most skilled communicators match their responses to the situation in discussions with the people you manage it helps to differentiate the coaching situations from the counseling situations coaching is providing advice and information or setting standards to help your employees to improve their skills and their performance counseling is helping subordinates recognize and address problems involving their emotions attitudes motivation or personalities the most common mismatch of response types to situations is the tendency a lot of us havemyself includedto give advice or deflect in a situation where counseling is appropriate when you are counseling reflecting and probing are usually more appropriate responses than advising or deflecting reflecting  as mentioned above when we listen we should show the other party that what they are saying to us is being heard since we can think at about four times the speed that speakers can speak our brains have a lot of capacity that can be used to process the meaning of whats being said reflecting is paraphrasing back to the speaker what they said one of the things a lot of us find when we try to use this technique is that its real a challenge we dont want to just parrot back what was said we want to paraphrase it takes creativity to think of appropriate ways to paraphrase what weve heard reflecting can take other forms than paraphrasing back to someone what was just said for instance a listener can summarize what he or she heard and also take the conversation a step further by asking a question for clarification or elaboration one of the things we often notice when we reflect during a conversation is that the meaning we have ascribed to what weve heard has missed the speakers intended meaning when speakers hear us reflect they get a chance to correct any misunderstanding that we have that proves that this technique does truly clarify communication for most of us it takes a lot of practice before we become natural and effective at reflecting our first few efforts may sound forced phony patronizing or as one of my mba students put it moronic however that doesnt mean we should give up learning how to reflect probing  in addition to reflecting the most skilled communicators responses in counseling situations involve a lot of probing probing means asking for additional information not all questions you might ask will be effective avoid questions that challenge what has been said because that will put the speaker on the defensive eg how could you have thought that in addition a question that changes the subject before the current subject is resolved isnt effective communication effective probing is nonjudgmental and flows from what was previously said good probing questions ask for elaboration clarification and repetition if for instance an important question you asked wasnt answered deflecting  deflecting responses shift the discussion to another topic when we deflect from what weve been told rather than acknowledging it we can unintentionally communicate that we havent listened and that we arent interested deflecting shows that were preoccupied with another topic many of us deflect unwittingly by sharing our personal experiences when we should be focusing on the other party think about this from the speakers perspective you dont feel like youve been heard when you share a concern with someone and they respond by telling you about themselves the responder gives you the impression that they arent even listening and that they just want to talk about themselves sometimes we mention our own experiences as a way of saying that we can relate to the speakers experiences our intention is to say your not alone but when we tell our stories we risk sending a message that we arent listening and dont care dont be a topper the kind of person who can tell a story to top any story that theyre told we all know a topper dont we in a small way toppers communicate that they are superior thats not supportive this is not to say that sharing your experiences is never a helpful on the contrary mentors often help their protégés by relating their own experiences as a way to reassure their protégés that their concerns are normal and that their problems are solvable but in counseling situations be careful to use deflecting only at appropriate times speakers may not know that you have heard and understood what they have said if you deflect by moving on to another topic or shifting the focus to yourself or your own experiences advising  it can be insulting to give advice to someone who has shared his or her problems with you i used to work for a guy who would ask me daily how are things going on the days when i would groan about a problem i was wrangling with his response would be to suggest what i should do about it that really bothered me i value selfreliance and i like solving puzzles so i dont like someone telling me how to solve my problems maybe im hypersensitive but i actually felt like that manager didnt respect my ability to solve my own problems i wanted the selfsatisfaction for finding the solutions myself and i wanted him to respect my problemsolving abilities his communication style didnt support that im sure the advice my manager was giving me was well intended nevertheless i didnt want to hear it so i stopped telling him what was bothering me if he would have just listened instead of advising i would have shared more and we would have built a stronger bond instead his advising caused me to clam up and it undermined his ability to understand what i was going through perhaps i was being too sensitive nevertheless reactions like mine are common enough that you will want to be careful to avoid giving unsolicited advice if you want to be an effective listener in fact deborah tannen has found that this problem is particularly common between men and women in the workplace 5 women often discuss their problems and concerns with men just as a means of developing interpersonal bonds when men respond by giving advice they may believe they are being helpful to their female counterparts but if no advice is solicited then providing it is a little presumptuous and it actually undermines the opportunity to further develop a cohesive bond with that female coworker i as a man have a real problem keeping my advice to myself when someone is telling me about a problem theyre having i can barely control the impulse to tell them what they should do but i ought to know that people usually dont want my advice on average people probably ask me for my advice about two or three times a monththats it all the other times i give advice it is just because i like to when i give my unsolicited advice ive stopped listening and started to dominate the dialogue imagine how frustrating that is for my wife and my students if youre like me and you like to give advice try fighting the urge as long as you can just reflect what youve hear and probe for additional information then when you think the time is right to provide your words of wisdom say something like let me know if youd like some advice ive got some thoughts about that you might be surprised by how few people take you up on that offer
