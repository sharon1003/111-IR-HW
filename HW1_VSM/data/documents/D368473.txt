is your turmeric effective how to pick a turmeric curcumin extract that works and get it at a great price with all the media craze surrounding turmeric we decided it was time to write an in depth analysis of its benefits and what you want to look out for when buying an effective turmeric extract since its first feature on the world’s most famous tv doctor’s show supplement manufacturers have been crawling out of the woodwork to create their ‘version’ of turmeric with wild claims as to its actual benefits as each new company bursts into the market with their own ‘proprietary formula’ it becomes harder to separate fact from fiction premium product from worthless imitation we decided it was time to analyze them ourselves to find out which products were subpar which were flatout lying about what was even in their pills and which if any might actually be worth a try as we rounded up all of the big brands in the industry we could see straight off the bat which companies were only there to make a quick buck most turmeric extracts do not contain what’s actually on the label in addition we found that most companies who claim to have a standard of 95 curcuminoids actually have much less this is disheartening and makes it difficult for the consumer to know what manufacturers are lying and which are telling the truth it’s hard to believe but most companies slap on a label that says ‘turmeric’ often without even mentioning how much turmeric extract is in each pill or without actually including the amount they claim what did we research with hundreds of manufacturers out there we wanted to figure out what to look for and how to overcome our concerns regarding dietary supplements we started the process by making a list of the main concerns we have over buying a good turmeric product it’s not going to be effective the truth is there are a lot of products that don’t work at all typically this is because they don’t contain the right ingredients or the right proportions a lot of interested consumers don’t realize how exact a science creating an effective supplement really is it’s going to be too expensive to afford as we conducted our research we found that a lot of companies sell turmeric supplements for 100 or more who wants to risk that kind of money on what could just be snake oil salesmanship the company i buy from might just be exploiting another fad how can you tell when a manufacturer is just trying to cash in on the latest diet most of those companies are all gimmick and no substance how do you know that the company you choose to buy from is giving you the real deal finding high quality turmeric extracts so how can you identify the legitimate products through all the smoke there are a few key factors to look for that can all but guarantee the product is genuine1 third party monitoring independent monitoring companies track each company’s reputation and customer satisfaction one of the most important qualities for a supplement manufacturer is their reputation look for a company with a solid reputation backed by third party monitoring2 risk free money back guarantee go with a company that guarantees their product and offers your money back if you aren’t satisfied if the company is not willing to put their money where their mouth is that means they don’t believe in their own product3 third party testing different than third party monitoring third party testing verifies the quality of each company’s products third party testing is really expensive for manufacturers since it can actually disqualify entire shipments of pills but when companies don’t have independent quality control there is no guarantee that their products are what they claim to be turmeric brands research your time and money is valuable and we don’t want you to waste either one so we did the research on most of the top turmeric products available we studied each product to determine which consistently had not only the right ingredients but also the right proportions we disqualified the ones with unnecessary synthetic fillers and those whose contents differed drastically from pill to pill but we didn’t stop there after all numbers and percentages are only part of the story we went on to seek out real customers who had used the products we tested we asked them for testimonials and compared them with our notes and then compiled this information to give you a list of the best products on the market what our research uncovered a good turmeric extract should contain at least 95 standardized curcumin a 1000mg daily dose and no additional ingredients most brands did not pass the above criteria some of the turmeric companies included the right ingredients but had too little standardized curcuminoids which is the key compound in turmeric they use much less than what was used in the clinical studies that led to optimum health improvement other companies filled their supplements with cheap fillers binders and other synthetic ingredients almost all of them avoided quality control testing the brands we did pick we stand by we are confident that these products can help you achieve your goals our turmeric top

selection is life extension super biocurcumin this product contains the pure turmeric extract with 95 curcumin which was recommended in clinical studies however it does have additional ingredients in its formula and does not provide the recommended 1000mg daily dosage it is important to consider that additional ingredients can sometimes greatly affect your results despite falling short of the recommended dosage our research showed that the extract it does contain is of good quality since the company itself has a good track record and most consumers i spoke to were pretty satisfied with it i still consider this to be a solid product just remember that it has a few slight disadvantages if you don’t mind taking a pill containing additional ingredients and a slightly lower dosage and without piperine then this product could be right for you keep in mind that their website often shows that they are in short supply or out of stock take a closer look and decide for yourself…rating ok 3 pick solaray turmeric one daily this product is made by a company called solaray and they are also offering a turmeric extract product however there is one very important category in which they fall short – the active ingredient this product does not provide the full recommended daily dosage of 1000mg which was recommended by the clinical studies there are also not very many reviews for this product the bottle itself will definitely catch your eye but without consistent positive consumer reviews on the website purchasing this product might be a bit risky our own tests showed that it was a good product but we all know that supplements don’t always work the same way for everyone we would recommend choosing a product that offers you the full recommended daily amount of 1000mg pure turmeric extract even though solaray turmeric one daily does seem to be a good quality extract the fact that it does not contain the full recommended daily dosage of turmeric extract as its active ingredient and relatively few customer reviews knocked it down to the 3 spot that said if you don’t mind taking a chance this product might work for you take a better look at the actual product…
