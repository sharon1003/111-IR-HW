and honey or maple syrup use for sweet potato fries you can use to warm up appetizers before serving useful for baking green or red peppers and winter squash halves you can use for oven drying they can be used under a smaller pan to catch drips with sides they are called bakers sheet pans a half sheet is 13 x 18 x 1 they have increased stability and more sides to grab on to some have encapsulated steel rims to prevent warping they come in plain and with a nonstick surface a nonstick surface can start to flake off over time some nonstick ones also have air insulation between the two aluminum layers to promote even baking stick to the plain baking mats a silicone baking mat prevents cookies and appetizers from sticking and helps in cleanup silpat is the recognized brand name for these also called cookie sheet liners they come in a variety of sizes and shapes also for use in the microwave if small enough and in the freezer can be cut to size easy to clean just rinse and some soap when finished can roll up for storage the cheaper ones get more negative reviews cooling rack if you do go for cookies you would also need a cooling rack the top seller is a collapsible 3tier rack with narrowly spaced steel wires and nonstick coating muffin pans for nut flour muffins egg muffins mini crustless quiche and pemmican cakes you have a choice of full size and mini 218 diameter the mini ones take more effort to clean but make a more practical sized pemmican muffin nonstick ones make the most sense but the surface could wear out with use there are now silicone muffin pans which i have not used but will soon with silicone one can simply pop the muffins out and not have to pry them out with a knife the cups in the blue silicone 6 cup pan are deeper than in a metal pan too deep to fully fill for pemmican roasting pan with rack also called a french roaster you need something to put a roast in the oven you cant slow cook everything and some like a leg of lamb wont fit in the slow cooker my first roasting pan was thin stainless steel that warped and juice could easily burn and no rack the rack popularity is more recent i now have a stainless steel one with thick aluminum core and a nonstick rack the common size is 16inch across some are a little more chestnut roasting pan this is the classic way to cook chestnuts you need an open flame to use this one eg a gas stove barbecue grill or fireplace they are unfinished steel they need to be oiled to keep from rusting alternatively for less an open top grilling basket should work just as well or better and wont rust chestnut roaster superstone the classic way to roast chestnuts in the oven also microwave is to use a stoneware pot it keeps enough moisture in the roaster to keep the chestnuts moist but still enables you to get the flavor of roasting instead of boiling 4 deep 712 outside diameter not currently available at amazoncom try cybercucina  basting  marinating baster i have a basic glass baster that i use i cant imagine having a opaque metal one and not knowing how much has been drawn into the baster on the bestselling tovolo clear dripless baster pictured at left the botton is angled to more efficiently suck up the liquid it comes with an extra tip and a useful cleaning brush there are no negatives basting brush there are two distinct types of basting brushes ones for pastry and ones used for cooking on the stovetop or on the grill barbecue basting brushes are also sold as part of a barbecue tool set bristles these days are silicone in the past they were boar bristle the silicone are safe to clean in the dishwasher also available are basting mops with either removable cotton heads for cleaning or silicone oil sprayer an alternative to brushing on oil is spraying it on these are a way to get a pure olive oil spray on baking pans use when grilling vegetables both on the grill and in the oven use on the grill spray on cookie sheets for sweet potato fries coat oven roasted fish and chicken spray on salads misting action doesnt last long before having to pump it up again after time dispersion quality declines due to clogging you need to follow instructions reliability has improved over the years the prepara oil mister lets users create flavored infused oils in a spray bottle that wont get clogged with herbs or spices you can make paleo marinades see many at paleo marinade recipes often the liquid is acidic using a citrus juice or wine to tenderize tougher cuts of meat oils herbs and spices are used to add further flavor marinator this is a poor mans version of the previous entry and the marinating accessory that can be added to ones tilia foodsaver see storing vacuum sealer below by creating a vacuum in this case a partial vacuum as that is all you can do by hand you can marinate food in minutes instead of hours or days some people dont like the bowl design with a hump in the middle marinade injector any poultry meat or game benefits from being basted from the inside out pictured is the best selling marinade injector which is made of plastic and stainless steel however it can crack for more durability get one that is all stainless steel blenders also see mandolines  slicing food chopper  countertop blender for frozen desserts sauces and small quantities of flour from nuts wide jars are better for chunky things look for one that crushes ice at any speed can turn small pieces of jerky into powder but it is not ideal if you look at the amazoncom reviews you will find that all have reliability problems i have a kitchen aid 5speed and despite sporatic use powdering jerky it died on me and they swapped it for a reconditioned one for a reasonable amount hand blender also called immersion blender or stick blender large commercial ones existed long before consumer models paleo mayonnaises are limited so homemade paleo mayo is an option this is less to clean than a food processor they are great not only for mayo and dressings but good for making almond milk fruit shakes thickening soups and sauces right in the pan by pureeing vegetables can grind nuts to make nut flour and nutbutters good for steak tartare and grinding the meat for pemmican also use to grind together raisins and nuts to make fruitnutballs i used to use mine when rendering suet but now instead i run the suet through my meat grinder before rendering vitamix this is the ultimate heavy duty blender people that have them swear by them there are two paleo things that you can do with a vita mix that you cant with a regular countertop blender liquify raw vegetables and make a smooth nut milk with no filtering they are noisy you can also buy a container that has a blade for dry materials nonpaleo people would use it to grind grains i tried using the dry container for jerky it did no better than a decent blender and the dry container option costs more than a meat grinder which is the best for grinding jerky if you are into using blenders and can afford one go for it casseroles a casserole is a large deep dish used both in the oven and as a serving vessel clay pot cooking clay pot cooking is a technique of cooking food in an unglazed clay pot which has been soaked in water so as to release steam during the cooking process this technique has a long history stretching back at least to ancient roman times and is commonly used in several cuisines in europe and southeast and east asia the food loses little of its moisture because it is surrounded by steam creating a tender flavorful dish no oil needs to be added with this cooking technique the pot is mainly used to cook meat like pork roast chicken or stew in an oven nutrients are not leached out into any water  wikipedia clay pot cooking they also work in the microwave you must follow the instructions there are two types readily available the romertopf has no glazing anywhere and is the primary one the schlemmertopf has a light glaze on the inside of the bottom pot this allows meals to be prepared with the addition of fats or oils and the ability to cook meats and sides together foods brown with the lid on prebrowning is not necessary and basting is eliminated also easy cleanup dutch oven a thickwalled usually cast iron cooking pot with a tightfitting lid dutch ovens have been used as cooking vessels for hundreds of years they superbly retain the heat they sat above the coals now they have smooth bottoms for use on the cooktop or in the oven and a porcelain enamel coating see history at wikipedia dutch oven le creuset has been the well known brand for this but it is terribly expensive glass casserole dishes one should not microwave in plastic it has been shown that plastic wrap should not touch food as the food will absorb the chemicals you can still use it as a cover when you microwave just make sure it doesnt sag and touch the food you will see claims that some plastics are microwave safe but why chance it a glass vessel with lid is perfectly safe i find the 112 quart size in the pyrex line to be the ideal size to reheat food the lid can be used on an 8 frying pan and is the cheapest solution for that i have several i like knobs on the lids pyrex 112 quart casserole i currently have a 2quart pyrex and a 3quart no longer made i can use the 3quart for mixing pemmican though this pyrex 4quart mixing bowl would be much better marinex 06 quart casserole i once had a 1quart pyrex casserole unfortunately it is no longer made for a small size i now have several marinex 237ounce small round casserole with lid they stack nicely they are made of borosilicate glass which is the heat resistant glass that pyrex was made of but no longer is they will only hold 19 ounces of liquid the stated size includes the domed lid

bottles with wide openings you can also get a set for smaller openings cleaning brush grill the grill daddy is the bestselling cleaning brush it has a water reservoir that creates steam when you put the grill on low it is pictured at left brush bristles usually are stainless steel though some are brass the tbrush for reaching into grate corners between rods and along edges has become popular there are scrapers and brushscraper combinations some have longer handles than others some are oversized and there is one motorized one that requires 8 aa batteries amazoncom has the grill cleaning tools split to find see search grill cleaning brush bestsellers grill brushes bestsellers grill scrapers  compost pail if you have an outdoor composter for garden and yard waste you should also collect vegetable waste in the kitchen most of the pails have a charcoal filter to absorb odors a few are ceramic but they are fragile heavy to carry and harder to wash you want stainless steel and one not too small buy a 15 gallon dish cloth this has traditionally been a heavy 100 cotton in a waffle weave i use one when hand washing more than an item or two or if the item is very large sometimes to wash the counter top the problem in buying from amazoncom is they are sold in sets of 12 thats like a lifetime supply or spread the others around as gifts for double the price there are now microfiber dishclothes  kitchen towels i keep two towels in my kitchen a terry cloth hand towel for drying my hands and a cottonlinen blend to dry whatever ive hand washed in the sink besides not wanting to contaminate the washed item with what was on my hands i want the kitchen one to be lintfree looking to write this entry i find many lintfree towels but they are all 100 cotton or microfiber textile what happened to the linencotton blends linen is more absorbant searching at amazoncom i only found many designs by armani one pictured at left for classic designs and also 100 linen go to elegant linens  muffin pan cleaning brush useful to remove any suet or egg cupcake residue on metal muffin pans it wont damage nonstick coating brush head is 2inches in diameter not for mini sized pans this is quality product for the institutional market vegetable cleaning brush vegetable brushes come in different bristle stiffnesses i use a mushroom brush to clean my eggs i buy my eggs from a farmer that does not wash them not washed they last longer most people use these brushes for cleaning carrots beets mushrooms etc the bestselling oxo is too stiff for eggs or mushrooms cooking from the outlet also see eggs boiling electric egg cookers and garlic roasted garlic express and grilling indoor tabletop grill and microwaving microwave  slow cooker aka “crock pot”useful many consider this a must have in a paleo kitchen can start before you go to bed or in the morning you want one with a removable sleeve then you can prepare it the evening before and put in the refrigerator before going to work you simply put it in the base and start it up and much easier to clean an option on one is a probe that will shift to a keep warm mode when the meat is done but this is not useful for tough meats as it is temperaturebased and will shut down too soon a slow cooker is the best way to cook pulled pork slow cookers work best if they are at least half full dont buy one that is too big n b long cooking times with acidic foods can lead to hydrolysis of proteins countertop ovens a slice toaster has no use for us now that grainbased breads arent eaten but you can use a toasteroven as a small oven or broiler when you dont want to use your large oven or when you need an extra oven or to keep foods warm toasteroven these basic ones are very reasonably priced you have a choice of a timer or continuous on toasteroven convection much fancier than the basic is a toasteroven with convection they are much more expensive but you get faster cooking loads of features and a fancy digital display they are efficient so you save on energy costs the pictured one gets high ratings at amazoncom turbo oven convection these use infrared heating and a convection fan to cook food fast and evenly no cold corners cooks roasts and vegetables to perfection no need to thaw frozen meat can be used to bake grill roast or steam temperatures up to 500°f the glass cooking container is sealed no need to add oil you watch it cook saves energy compared to a conventional oven the basic models have mechanical controls and the upgrade models have digital controls included is a clean mode it is hard to compare sizes some include extender ring and some charge extra all the reviewers love the ovens the only complaints are reliability related on some lesser brands the reliability complaints overwhelm electric skilletfrying pan the thermostat allows for long unattended cooking good for chicken dishes roasting frying grilling and making casseroles good for one or two people basically they are good for anything that you can do in a stove top frying pan and more glass lid lets you see whats cooking temperature control goes from warm to 400°f also very useful for serving food on a buffet if you are in a dorm room or traveling by yourself there are a mini electric skillets  food steamer electric steamers designed specifically for vegetables steam begins very quickly letting cooking start immediately you want to be able to see into the reservoir it should have auto shutoff some have keep warm modes safe on dishwasher top rack people rave about the bestseller and how you can “set it and forget it” one person suggests using distilled water to prolong the life of the heating coil your old rice cooker would also work or buy inexpensive steamer inserts for your regular pots induction cooktop buying one of these is a way to get an extra burner they have superb low heat control you want the maximum 1800 watts prices have come way down note that these are induction cookers these hotplates only heat the center 5 to 6 inches so with wide pans plan on extra stirring and you must use magnetic cookware i checked with a magnetic i have practically none people in my situation can get started with an induction cookware set  hot pots  electric kettles electric kettles are now mostly sold with a cordless induction base they boil water very fast they shut off automatically and have keep warm settings an electric kettle would be useful for tea when there is no microwave around some people take them when traveling the water boiler style is useful when serving hot beverages at a party meeting or other large gathering they have microcomputerized temperaturecontrol systems electric mongolian hot pot the hot pot is a communal cooking and serving pot that was traditionally used for making a soup broth in which thinly sliced bite size pieces of lamb or beef are cooked wikipedia has pages on hot pot cooking and shabushabu a japanese variant of hot pot to make any recipes you find paleo you would have to adapt and remove any soy sauce the units have variable temperature control and see through tempered glass cover some also have a bbq grill electric pressure cooker now pressure cooking isnt exactly a paleo way of cooking but then neither is using electricity pressure cooking used to be a scary thing you did on the top of the stove today there are many high tech digital electric cookers that have become multipurpose with settings for pressure cooking browning simmering sautéing and warming people that use pressure cookers like that they are fast they also save energy the only complaints are when they dont work people are still buying the stove top pots they arent saving much money but they can get a bigger size and known reliability deep fat frying a way to cook a piece of chicken though not very paleo or useful in a paleo kitchen without potatoes though paleo athletes eat sweet potatoes and this would work fine for them while the cooking time is quick the time needed to heat up the oil is not to be paleo coconut oil palm oil beef tallow and macadamia nut oil are recommended for oils in large quantity see paleo food mall fats  oils with the proper oil the result is paleo but it is only practical in a production type environment like a restaurant deep fat fryer a regular unit deep fat fryer turkey to fry a turkey for a special occasion there is the masterbuilt butterball professional series indoor electric turkey fryer it requires about 2 gallons of oil rotisserie oven a motor driven spit broils meat fish and poultry to perfection sealing in juices and draining fats some are combined with a convection oven for faster roasting they take up a lot of counter space though there are a couple of vertical ones that take up less they are hard to clean they take a long time it is hard to tell when done and people that have them rarely use them maybe get one in an outdoor grill instead cookware mixing bowls without baking mixing bowls have less uses in a paleo kitchen you do need them for salad dressings marinades egg beating meat prep and nut flour confections they are often sold in sets they are made in a variety of materials melamine silicone stainless steel clear glass opaque glass ceramics copper and wood ceramic is best for bread dough so skip for paleo copper bowls are expensive and are superior for egg whites clear glass mixing bowls have the advantage of when mixing dry ingredients you can see from the outside if there are any missed spots clear glass is attractive to serve from and glass ones optionally come with lids glass and ceramic are heavy i like clear glass except for the super biggest and then stainless steel wood mixing bowls are used for salads and bamboo is becoming popular for this at amazoncom you can find general mixing bowls via a search and a bestsellers list you can buy bowl covers for storing in the refrigerator pressure cooker now pressure cooking isnt exactly a paleo way of cooking but the time savings is appealing and the food retains more of its nutrients and flavor chicken cacciatore the basic pressure cooker dish cooks in 8 minutes – faster than a microwave it has been converted to paleo here steal this meal pressure cooker cacciatore sticky bowl gripper designed to grip mixing bowls securely down to a flat surface no sliding it frees up the arm that normally has to hold the bowl works on any smooth surface steamer cookware for steaming my vegetables i simply use a folding steamer basket similar to pictured at left in a wide pot i chop up my asparagus and cook the bottoms longer if one has a rice cooker from ones rice eating days it may also steam vegetables bamboo steamers also exist foods can impart a flavor into the bamboo use one each for meats fish and vegetables normally you use lettuce foil or a plate to not put the food directly on the bamboo there are also electric food steamers  sauce pans a saucepan is a simple cooking vessel with a single long straight handle it is intended primarily for surface cooking of liquids they come in a variety of materials my preference is stainless steel with a core of either copper or aluminum good heat distribution and never a problem putting them in the dishwasher or giving them a hard scrub the pictured cuisinart chefs classic line is the bestselling of this construction type at amazoncom it comes in four sizes and with stainless steel lids some other brands have glass lids which could be nice amazoncom splits theses over two different searches saucepan glass lid and sauce pan glass lid  stock pot 16 quart a stockpot will have two handles the pictured by faberware is the one that i have and use for applesauce rendering suet and making harvest time soup for the freezer you can put 16 pounds of cut apples in it and still have room to stir i figure if im going to go through the cleanup hassle i should do a large batch when i was rendering a very large amount of suet and needed multiple pots i called my neighbors to borrow a pot and none had one this big you will see at amazoncom all the many reviews rave about this pot other size stockpots can be found at amazoncom on two different searches stock pot and stockpot and a stockpot bestsellers list which ignores some items found on a search tea kettle the top selling tea kettles all whistle i dont use one the only thing i need boiling water for is tea and by microwaving it in a mug i get the mug ceramic efficiently heated at the same time electric kettles come in pitcher and water boiler style see electric kettles  corers also see peelers  apple when making applesauce i slice my apples and then with a paring knife slice the core out there is very little apple wasted most people apparently prefer to use an apple corer of course a corer is necessary for baked apples which can be made paleo the pictured oxo is recommended by cooks illustrated and is the bestseller corers that simultaneously slice are also popular but it is harder to remove the core at the center and they get many more negative reviews than this simple one avocado slicer  pitter mostly sold as a slicer only on the dual purpose ones the nylon loop is used to remove pits use the wire end to slice and scoop fruit they eliminate the mess and prepare avocadoes without damaging the fruit they work best when the fruit is ripe cherry and olive pitter this is also called a cherry stoner i dont know about olives but if you want to serve fresh cherries some sort of pitter is a must and even more so if you dehydrate cherries the handheld ones for a few dollars are useless the one i have is an older style of the leifheit cherrymat cherry stoner with container pictured at left for institutions there are units that will remove 10 cherry pits in two effortless motions of your hand but require three people to operate masterfully fruit and vegetabler removes stem and seeds from pear and apple halves for presentation and baking removes seeds from cucumbers and zucchini halves for stuffing dishwasher safe mango splitter when i tried getting the seed out of a mango i had a hard time it was way too slippery to hold you learn how the seed is oriented then this slices the fruit cleanly in half leaving almost nothing behind on the seed what is left on the seed you can eat off some suggest slicing the end off to see the orientation of the seed most amazoncom reviewers rave about the gadget the problems are if the fruit is overly ripe it smushes the fruit without cutting though i would think slicing the end off first would solve this and the largest sized mangoes have seeds that are too big for it strawberry huller when ive hulled strawberries i used a 3 paring knife twisted the berry and cut a cone around the stem it takes a little time a friend simply slices them straight across all but one of the many amazoncom reviews rave about the pictured item i bought one it really does make this task much much easier as an extra benefit one reviewer points out that it also works on cherry tomatoes when you want to stuff them zucchini use to core zucchini to stuff them using a paleo stuffing made with ground nuts replacing any grains cutting board cutting boards they come in many styles you have thin flexible mats that can be purchased in different colors to code by use you have boards made out of a variety of plastics some that will warp and you have the classic wood boards traditionally a hard wood like maple or cherry but these days bamboo is all the rage due to its beauty durability stronger than maple and earthfriendliness the best wood ones are end grain and the top maker of classic ones is john boos pictured at left is a small high end one with a high end price for general usage i have a small plastic one that is easy to pick up to scrape the onions or whatever into where i want it the flexible ones can also be picked up and the food easily poured where you want it if you have a large board get a bench scrape shovel next entry bench scrape shovel by rachel ray tools in my dream kitchen i have thought about having an end grain wood butcher block cutting board embedded in my countertop but how would i get the food off it this solves that problem all of the amazoncom reviewers love it the only negative is someone was hoping they could chop with it you cant you have a choice of orange or blue also called a prep taxi dehydration dehydrator a must for homemade jerky and pemmican can also dry fruit and herbs inexpensive ones without thermostats are 30 but i consider a thermostat a must healthier and tastier to dry at a low temperature the round ones are expandable up to 30 trays the one i have and highly recommend is the excalibur 2900 it is the one used by serious dehyraters the square trays are easier to fill than round with a hole in the middle i dont see a need for a timer if you dry at a low temperature the time will be long and need not be exact also see paleodiet dehydrators section pickle press japanese style make your own pickles in a matter of hours you season sliced up vegetables watery ones like onions cucumbers cabbage radishes turnips with spices and salt and press the liquid out with this press here are some recipes in english you can search the web and amazoncom will offer up a couple books the pressed product makes a good munchy this press requires a large batch to optimally work and you dont want to be adding extra salt to your diet salad spinners both large and small use a large one for salad and the small one for herbs and drying off rinsed blueberries which you rinse in the spinner basket i like my triumphs which have small knobs that you turn in a circle but i dont see them anymore at one time people were down on the hoan but i dont see them either eggs boiling egg timer for soft and hard boiled eggs based precisely on temperature not losely by time placed in pan with eggs timer reacts to heat and darkens as eggs cook adjusts for number of eggs amount of water altitude calibrated to indicate soft medium hard and stages inbetween reviewers rave about the item and call it a must have you just have to get used to no audible signal when done egg cups for serving and eating softboiled eggs they are either porcelain or stainless steel some have integrated plates to hold the shell pieces some are whimsical with chicken feet egg spoons for softboiled eggs they fit comfortably inside an egg without breaking the shell the pictured ones are very thin stainless steel and priced accordingly there are others including olivewood for scooping spices or looseleaf teas and plastic scroll down for the antique ones egg toppers for softboiled eggs these are supposed to cleanly cut the tapered ends off the egg so you can eat out of the shell can leave shell shards another style only cuts a groove so when you peel it cracks the shell in a nice line around reviews are mixed egg piercer for hard boiled eggs just unlock place on a table press the fat end of the egg down on it to make the hole in the shell the eggs wont crack the attached magnet keeps it handy a piercer is included with the electric egg cookers electric egg cookers faster than the hassle of boiling water on the stove some are automatic based on temperature sensing some have timers most also poach in addition to making hard or soft boiled eggs but the poaching is less successful some hold up to 7 eggs for boiling less for poaching all include piercing pin this is an energy efficient way to cook eggs you arent heating up a large amount of water and then tossing it away complaints tend to be reliability related egg slicers they are either countertop or hold in your hand with the later you squeeze right onto the salad all use wires to slice the egg some claim also for mushrooms for easy sautéing however the mushrooms must be soft and its harder to get right on some you press once for perfect round or oblong slices rotate and press again for chopped egg for salads they take some effort to clean hand wash and dry reviews are all over the place eggs coddling coddlers for cooking eggs gently or lightly cooked the eggs can be partially cooked mostly cooked or hardly cooked at all the inside of the cup is first greased in order to flavour the egg and allow it to be removed more easily a raw egg sometimes with additional flavourings is then broken into the coddler which is then placed in a pan of nearboiling water for 78 minutes note that coddled eggs are not boiled more at wikipedia coddled egg the traditional grease has been butter a paleo alternative would need to be a tasty fat like pork as flavoring the eggs is one of the reasons you coddle eggs some people buying these coddlers cant appreciate their delicateness eggs frying omelet pans usually nonstick but plain stainless steel exists most look similar to other skillets but have sloping sides to slide the omelet around calphalon dominates the top of the bestsellers some have covers some are two half moon shaped pans hinged together you start cooking the mixture on both sides when almost done fold short side over to put mixtures together for final cooking all the stove top ones of this design get terrible reviews the microwave one like this listed below is liked egg shaker for up to three scrambled eggs the shape in center separates and beats the eggs most people find that a fork in a mixing bowl works well for beating eggs when above four eggs or if you dont want to see any blobs of white a spring coil egg whisk may be used or use a food chopper 3cup egg containment rings when frying eggs stay cool knock down handle silicone rings conform to the bottom of pan to reduce egg ooze out perfectly shaped eggs are generally only needed for nonpaleo sandwiches egg separator they make it simple to separate eggs they hold the yolk while the white drips through most rest across or clip on the edge of a bowl or mug longer handles will stretch across larger bowls some include recepticles you have a choice of plastic or stainless steel people like them the only problems are when the yolk is too big for some of the smaller ones and eggs which have the white strongly connected to the yolk can pull the yolk through the side slits personally i cant see why one would separate eggs the yolks are the best part egg cracker from reading the reviews there are some people that have problems cracking eggs and they get shell bits mixed in this is for them as shown on tv it does work you gently slam an egg down on a razor blade also shown on tv and sold at amazon is a scissortype contraption that holds eggs of a certain size and sometimes works avoid it eggs microwaving there are three popular ways of cooking eggs in the microwave you need to experiment to learn your cooking times all are dishwasher safe microwaves can make hard or soft boiled eggs hundreds of people like this one but some people manage to blow up their eggs you can find pictures of the mess people find the convenience to be worth the infrequent explosion i find seven of these scattered in this search of microwave boiled egg cooker  poached eggs nonstick surface makes for easy cleaning they come in a range of sizes you may need to poke the yokes and whites with a fork before cooking to keep explosions to a minimum they are also helped by a half a teaspoon of water under and on top of eggs before cooking omelets holds up to 4 eggs at a time you can eat right out of the pan or slide onto a plate you start cooking on both sides then flip to combine eggs poaching to poach an egg the egg is cracked into a small bowl and then gently slid into a pan of simmering water and cooked until the egg white has mostly solidified but the yolk remains soft  wikipedia poached egg the following egg poachers are not really poaching an egg but the term has been expanded to include them egg poach pods flexible silicone pods that float on the boiling water can also be used for baking and molding when done remove from water with slotted spoon and flip pod inside out easy cleaning in dishwasher egg poachers specialized metal stove top pans have been around for a while they are basically double boilers with one to six depressions with fixed or removeable pods pods are often nonstick fish also see seafood forks and oyster forks in the next section and grilling baskets in grilling  fish bone tweezers great for removing fish bones that were left in the fillets that you got from the grocery store can also use to remove fruit stems some are awfully expensive the first one listed is reasonable and is shipped by amazoncom cedar cooking planks they can be used to bake in an oven or grill on a bbq they come in a variety of woods other than cedar use for seafood meat poultry vegetables or fruit you have a choice of a large size on which an entire salmon fits or personal sizes one interlocks to create the size needed you soak them before using if grilling then place on hot grill until it smokes then use most people use these for grilling and not the oven crab mallet i recommend using seafood shears but much more paleo and fun is to crack crab legs and lobster claws with a wood mallet the force of the blow results in a shell thats cracked without being smashed fish poacher used to gently cook fish in a broth for the most tender results see recipes they also can be used for asparagus though it also has its own asparagus cookware all of the ones that are under 50 get comments about flimsiness there is also a fish poacher bestseller list but in typical amazoncom fashion many found on a search do not appear on the bestseller list and many on the bestseller list are not poachers fish scaler catching fish would be a paleo activity and so would scaling them scales can fly around can do inside a bag the big norms magic fish scaler has floating heads which lift off and catch scales preventing unnecessary messes some are double meaning flip it and you then have a knife without picking up another tool i dont see the point unless on a boat and you want to minimize the tools shrimp peeler  deveiner there are several styles of shrimp deveiners in plastic and aluminum the bestselling oxo good grips has sharp square teeth to cut the shells it only works on large or jumbo shrimp others devein and push the shell up mashing the shrimp and breaking the underside others have knives along the top to cut the shell some also butterfly the shrimp and there are countertop units see shrimp butler video probably better than any of these deveiners is using a curved seafood shears and cutting the shell as the vein is being pushed out entry to be expanded after equipment testing forks  picks also see grilling skewers carving fork for meat there are hundreds of carving forks they break down into two types long straight tings and short curved tings within each group they must function almost the same cheaper forks will be stamped and the more expensive ones will be forged long straight ones have to be forged they anchor more firmly curved forks work well for lifting and you get a better carving sight line with the hand further back curved forks are very useful on the stovetop breaking up something in a pan if you plan to use it in front of other people and you want to impress i suggest a set with very paleo looking stag horn handles see entry for knives carving sets pictured at left is the cheapest in contrast check out the most expensive which sells almost as well at the high end many variations are available the wüsthof classic line down at the pages bottom has seven straight forks and two curved forks ice pick one could argue that ice isnt paleo but when you have a need for an ice pick there is no substitute no other tool unless you take the awl out of your tool box will do i have a beautiful one with a square tapered teak handle and holster alas the company that made it is no longer around i suggest stainless steel though the carbon steel ones would keep their point longer many have hammer handles for chipping large blocks of ice and a holster is protective if you plan to toss it in a drawer there is also the ice chipper which has a half dozen ice picks in a row and gives you more control over the chipping poultry lifters use to remove your heavy bird or roast from the pan onto a cutting or serving surface they are especially useful when the meat is heavy the sharp 514 prongs pierce meat easily while the sturdy handles afford a confident grip they can also be used as skewers when roasting vegetables and small pieces of meat made of stainless steel dishwashersafe salad tongs all paleo books recommend eating salads if you mix your salad or are serving multiple people you need something to get it out of the bowl you have a choice of materials wood plastic and stainless steel and a choice of style hinged at end hinged in middle separate pieces seaford forks  spoonsbone marrow spoons i hunted high and low for bone marrow spoons all i was able to find were pictures of silver ones made back in the 17th and 18th centuries apparently no one makes them these days the closest i could find were seafood forks with spoons at the other end some also come packaged in sets with crackers for crabs and lobsters at least for large lobster claws a shears designed for seafood is easier see below  snail  oyster forks you use snail tongs to hold the snail and the fork to get it out of the shell the forks could also have use as bone marrow forks tongs kitchen with them you can flip and serve meat toss salads serve vegetables and turn a pan around in the oven they come in a variety of styles a 9 is a useful length without being clumsy the ones with nylon heads can melt silicone heads are okay a locking mechanism is useful for storage the one i use the most is a scissor style to lift things frying pans also see eggs frying omelet pans  allclad coppercore allclad is the favorite of serious cooks these are awfully expensive for someone starting a kitchen when i started my kitchen i had hand me down cast iron frying skillets then i went to regular stainless steel ones then to a single basic allclad with an aluminum bottom but the dishwasher will eat away at the aluminum now for frying i have a few allclad coppercores cheaper than at amazoncom you can buy factory irregulars at cookware  more which is where i bought mine cast iron skillet they are the best for browning these days they come preseasoned with soy oil formula and ready for immediate use wash with a stiff brush and hot water no soap they come in various sizes and in flat griddle style if you are cooking many paleo pancakes nonstick frying pan the only thing i use nonstick pans for is cooking eggs and even then i use a small amount of coconut oil i have been a fan of tfal they are fairly priced it makes no sense to buy expensive nonstick pans and these can withstand being put in

works only for chopping garlic and herbs you press the knob and the blades rotate for even chopping chop ingredients in enclosed cup or remove base and chop directly on a cutting board cleaning requires disassembly and at least rinsing off all the pieces can go in dishwasher the fullsize oxo chopper also handles garlic well but not foods that are any bigger garlic peeler a quick way to peel

to cook flat bacon to use in sandwiches i use one to hold ground meat flat as white castle discovered decades ago steam lifts the patty this keeps it down the crenelated surface of the ground meat already puts it at a disadvantage you want to maximize the meat surface area in contact with the frying surface to maximize the maillard zone where heat causes reactions among sugars and proteins that turn the meat brown yielding molecules with an appealing flavor they are all cast iron and need to be kept from moisture the negative comments are from people that simply washed them and were

smokers that use a water pan to help speed cooking and can also help flavor the meat if you add flavorings to the water for smoking ribs and pork or beef roasts and even the occasional turkey recommended is a charcoal smoker with a water pan smoke at a fairly low temperature for anywhere from 610 hours depending on how thick the meat is you will get more flavor in the meat using charcoal then placing foil packets of water soaked wood sawdust or chips on the coals in the electric or gas smokers the sawdust is put into a metal pan over the burner and smoulders away giving the smoke flavor but not the flavor you get when some of the fat and juices from the meat hit the hot charcoal to smoke a lot of meat you need a smokehouse the sausage maker has pages on smokers smokehouses and

are many amazoncom reviews they are clustered at the top and at the bottom pros with a removable bowl it is much easier to clean than the oval krups but still better to hand wash it works for spices but leaves them a little coarse especially if they are dry or light it does grind flaxseeds grinds leather hard citrus peel into dust for soap cons the number one complaint is reliability the motor burns out easily you cannot run it continuously for a long time brief pulses will get the job done few grind nuts successfully except for pecans the nuts get stuck in the blades and the blades will not turn does not well work for moist items does not grind cinnamon sticks or whole nutmeg does not make peanut butter grain mill if you buy a grain mill to handle nuts you need a burr grinder because

the thumbnail for high quality image the best in depth description of knife construction types of knives and sharpening can be found at types of kitchen knives the only knives you really need are a paring knife and a chefs knife but others are useful to have boning  fillet knives ideal for separating meat poultry or fish from the bone with precise control knives with increased blade curvature allow for cutting with less effort boning knife the blade needs to be thin to bend around bones and joints flexibility of the blade can vary stiff blades are good for beef and pork and bigger cuts of meat for chicken a slightly flexible blade allows cutting around the flexible cartilage and through joints a very flexible boning knife is used for fish a shorter blade length gives you more control but a longer blade is needed for bigger bones this is not a popular knife but they sure are handy when you want to get all the meat off the bone trimming knife short boning knives are available for small birds like quail or to trim barbecued ribs fish fillet knife this spearpoint style has an extra thin flexible blade the narrow slicer allows for thin and even cutting around bones the blade bends easily to help skin and bone fish use for delicate fish or preparing carpaccio this style comes in several sizes and a couple blade widths and handle sizes fillet knife used to separate the fish fillet from the skin and skeleton this is similar to a boning knife but longer and thinner bigger fish require a longer blade to reach across the blade upsweep on especially the longer ones will be greater than on boning knives a curved blade is optimized for slicing or slashing the larger cutting area makes it popular for skinning cook knives chefs knife or cooks knife or french cook knife i prefer a 6 the 8 is popular also 10 12 and even 14 are available blades will be wide these knives are designed for dicing and chopping operations the blade is curved you rock the blade with one hand

meats it combines the features of a chefs knife with the versatility of a vegetable cleaver the straight edge produces a precision cut some have a granton edge that produces a cut with air pockets that allows food to release easier from the blade meats will cut very thin similar and more popular than this is the santoku knife listed next santoku knife a japanesestyle knife that combines cleaver features with a chefs knife compared to the chefs the santoku has a wider blade that is thinner in thickness shorter in length and curves up very gradually at the end providing a straighter cutting edge the knife will be well balanced with a thinner blade than a chefs knife the santoku can cut more smoothly and precisely through dense vegetables the knives are used for chopping slicing and dicing foods into narrow or fine pieces this knife will also butterfly boneless chicken breasts optional alternating hollows on the blades sides prevent food from clinging and make paper thin slices the blade shape is called sheeps foot ceramic knives are available and popular for this style cleavers there are two noninterchangeable types of cleavers cleavers meat also called meataxes they have not very sharp thick blades for splitting bones you need a block to chop on they work great for chopping chicken up into indistinguishable pieces cleavers vegetable or chinese cleavers are like a

vegetables all will have a slight blade curvature to allow rocking the best selling global 512 vegetable knife gets a perfect rating decorating knife use to cut a variety of garnishes carrots cucumber zucchini etc i cant see our paleo ancestors caring about whether it is a straight or crinkle cut but with baked good decorating not paleo you might want to express your creativity in vegetables a cheaper version is sold as a crinkle or corrugated cutter  paring knives traditionally used to pare fruits and vegetables where you are holding the food to be cut they are available in five styles often sold in sets of the three most popular a better gift would be an assembled but matched set of all five paring spear point blade this is the blade shape for most paring knives a 4 spearpoint is my all purpose knife my 3 is better for actual paring ceramic knives are available for this style paring sheeps foot blade also called straight vegetable knife the straight cutting edge is more accurate and the knife is easier to control as you put your fingers on the back edge ideal for smaller chopping and mincing tasks it produces a clean cut this style is also available with a hollow edge pictured at left that creates pockets of air which prevent extra thin or soft slices from sticking to the blade often bought as part of a set paring birds beak blade aka peeling knife the concavity is good for garnishes peeling cleaning or shaping any fruit or vegetable with a rounded surface can slice soft fruits such as nectarines plums or peaches peels skins or blemishes can cut

in meats for stuffing paring serrated this is for cutting citrus and other fruit peels it can also be used for sectioning grapefruit and other small cutting chores such as coring serrated knives a serrated blade is useful for foods with a tough skin and soft interior like ripe tomatoes a 5 is what you need for this no larger serrated knives are needed in a paleo kitchen the largest ones are used for breads midsize ones are used for bagels hardrolls or salami serrated tomato knife your choice is forktip or not i have done fine without such a tip a curved blade will make cutting easier but less precise serrated utility knife 5inch this is what i have and use for tomatoes a straight blade will allow you to cut with more precision on the wüsthof classic page this is called a sausage knife slicing  carving knives these need to be long enough to permit smooth slicing action across the meat this allows for thin and even cutting of large roasts and turkeys their straighter edge gives more precision a pointed tip is used to cut around a bone or it can have a rounded tip for slicing boneless ideal flexibility depends on the meat a slicer used for ham and fish would have a more flexible blade than a knife used for slicing poultry the slicing knife comes in all lengths as these get shorter there are called a carving knife and then a sandwich knife carving set the blade is designed for slicing and carving cooked meats especially hot roasts the blade is less flexible than the other slicing knives the pointed tip helps in cutting meat away from the bone pictured is the wüsthof classic which appears twice in the bestseller list with and without a case see carving fork entry above for discussion of carving fork types ham slicer 10inch while processed meats like ham are not paleo this knife excels with the larger cuts of meat smoked salmon fruit and vegetables the hollow granton edge creates pockets of air which prevent extra thin or soft slices from sticking to the blade the straight edge allows for precision cuts with raw meats stickiness this knife should work well for thin slicing meat for jerky salmon slicer the flexible blade helps to cut paperthin slices of smoked salmon they are 1112 in blade length on some the hollow granton edge creates pockets of air which prevent extra thin or soft slices from sticking to the blade slicing knife 12inch long you do need at least one long knife around in case a fullsize watermelon needs to be sliced yanagiba or yanagi knife this is the most popular type of the sashimi and sushi knives this was designed to produce razorthin slices of raw soft fish and meat characteristics of the knife are a very long blade with a slightly curved belly these are singlebevel knives that are sharpened on only one side which makes these knives razorsharp and gives a cleaner cut the blade road is generally on the side for righthanded people and the reverse side is hollow ground to create an air pocket between the blade and the food this knife can be honed only with a whetstone you have a choice of stainless steel or the traditional carbon steel white or blue the carbon steel ones will hold their edge longer but must be dried off after using carbon steel are much easier to sharpen length varies from 8 to 13 330mm longer is better suggested is at least 106 270mm the longer blade allows for more of a cut on a single pull stroke useful when cutting thick slabs of raw meat prices start reasonably and go into the thousands to see what is available beyond the bestseller link above you have to do a yanagiba knife

work for a fullsize watermelon or if you will be cutting a lot of fullsize watermelons this is a relatively inexpensive alternative the sheepsfoot blade prevents accidental poking sharpening steel a steel is all i use on my knives to keep them sharp they are actually honing steels and not sharpeners unless you get a diamond “steel” a steel will realign your metal knife edge but will not put a new edge on it if used regularly you wont have to sharpen which removes metal to create a new edge there is debate as to whether expensive steels are any better than cheaper a steel will often be included in knife sets the wüsthof gourmet is a top seller and is included in the consumer reports recommended set for less is the oxo good grips and for more is the wüsthof classic steel steels are not for use on ceramic knives carving sets and steak knives the most paleo looking carving sets and steak knives are ones with stag or horn handles there dont appear to be many made these days but there are

where needed several shredder cones are included for thick slices and ripple cuts reviewers like these units except when they break strawberry slicer you can use an eggmushroom slicer for slicing strawberries but these dedicated ones work better with the pictured handheld slicer you slice over a bowl plate or salad works for mushrooms too blades wont break or stretch like wire type egg slicers toprack dishwasher safe a small countertop version gets less favorable reviews spiral carrot curlers use to create vegetable garnishes for appetizers salads and casseroles prettifying food may increase its acceptance by the kidscarrot curler just like sharpening a pencil you create ribbons of carrots cucumber squash and zucchini for garnishing there is also a grand version for creating flowers from larger vegetables like parsnips daikons or taro root reviewers universally rave about them twin curl cutter on the search you will also see a twin curl cutter you bore this into a carrot and the two circular blades produce twin curls it can be time consuming and the reviews arent greatspiral slicer use this for hard veggies like sweet potato carrots diakon etc food needs to be rather wide and soft enough for the plastic screw to bore in vegetable spiralizer  slicer by world cuisine called a spirooli from a paleo perspective this gadget is the best way to make raw zucchini noodles to use as a spaghetti substitute then you sauté them makes fancy spiral vegetable or fruit garnishes for salads comes with three sets of blades works well with sweet potatoes the main negative is the when slicing you dont slice a 38 cylinder in the foods center so not much gets sliced from small diameter vegetables like carrots and radishes for them see the spiral carrot curler above measuring

split up bags of frozen fruit evenly then i know exactly how long to defrost in the microwave one feature that my escali doesnt have and i recommend seeking is to weigh in pounds and fractions of pounds you buy by the pound when you get home you may want to check the sellers weight mine only has grams ounces and pounds  ounces to get fractions of pounds i have to weigh in grams and divide by 454 i confirmed that the best selling eat smart precision pro pictured at left has this useful feature it measures in 01 ounce increments the oxo only measures to 18 ounces which is less fine pocket scale the pictured scale is the second bestselling scale at amazon after the one pictured above i use it to weigh my loose tea leaves now that i use a brewing basket to brew my tea i found you really cant measure tea consistently by looking at its volume some loose teas are small flakes some are large leaves which are lightweight and some premium teas are tightly curled in little balls and those weigh the most put the basket on before turning the scale on and it will start at 00 this is a very inexpensive gadget and can be used to get an order up to the 25 minimum for free shipping measuring cup you used to have to hold up a glass measuring cup to be able to read the scale on the side or bend down to read it sitting on the counter then someone had the brilliant idea of adding an angled scale in a plastic cup where it could be read by looking down in the cup while filling they are available in sizes from 1 cup up to 4 cups and in sets for the more traditional the glass measuring cups are still available and come in larger sizes than the angled plastic some of them come with a 4position lid which allows you to sift pour strain and sprinkle and in smaller sizes a beaker alternative is also available they will have thinner walls and a wider mouth measuring cups i rarely use these my cooking is fairly simple and i dont bother to measure but if you are more ambitious than i and are preparing the recipes found at the paleo food website you will need some some sets go up to six or seven sizes and become expensive that seems like overkill but in both plastic and stainless steel the sets with the most cups are the bestseller measuring spoons like the measuring cups sets with many sizes exist one with eight sizes includes smidgen pinch and dash for small sizes such small sizes are very unpaleo drop 164 tsp smidgen 132 pinch 116 dash 18 and tad 14 our paleo ancestors certainly didnt measure with such precision the popular oxo has only four spoons it lacks an 18 tsp a good enough approximation is half filling the 14 tsp or pick a set with five narrow spoons as pictured at left are useful for using in regular spice jars i would find double ended ones harder to figure which one you want stainless steel wont have any static electricity issues that plastic may have the ones i use are straight across the front and shovel shaped they are perfect for getting the spice off the bottom of my spice tins  thermometers freezerrefrigerator you should have a couple of these around to monitor the temperature in your refrigeration compartments the ideal refrigerator temperature range is 36°f to 40°f with the crisper around 38°f the normal temperature range in the freezer should be between 0°f to 10°f thermometers infrared these are downright fun to play with this is like the one i have you aim the laser beam at an object and it displays the surface temperature check out the temperature of anything food safety people use these i use mine to check the temperature of the suet while im rendering it when the moisture has been removed and the temperature starts to rise also good for measuring the surface temperature of a pan they also have automotive troubleshooting uses thermometers meat instant an instant one is adequate to check how the meat is doing some of them digital ones with a high top temperature can also be used to measure the fat temperature when rendering

problem the once pictured at left is fast and gets the best reviews for barbecuing many come in the form of a fork thermometer some have presets and indicating lights but paleo barbecue can be close to raw so no need for fancy temperature taking thermometers meat remote polder was the first to come out with a remote probe thermometer where you set the desired temperature and an alarm goes off when it is reached now there are wireless models where the alarm will sound where you are with the remote and not in the kitchen these make much more sense to me while i dont have one i would have to get such as i hang out two floors away from my kitchen they are especially useful when smoking meat thermometers oven check the accuracy of your ovens thermostat your oven temperature can vary in different parts of the cavity and it can vary as the thermostat cycles on and off one problem with most oven thermometers is the thermometer is inside the oven and may be difficult to read through the door there is one at amazoncom with a probe and remote reading but all reviews state that it is crap and a p o s timer timers used to be simple you turned the dial and it ticked down the time those still exist more popular these days are digital ones which get you tothesecond accuracy you can get ones with multiple timers some count up after expiring some clip on your belt some have magnets on the back some have audio and vibration modes i have a small one i picked up a couple decades ago and the stick polder timerstopwatch model with a lanyard they have two features that made them attractive to me 1 you can directly key in the time 2 they dont just sound once but continuously until you turn them off if it just sounds and you are busy you might forget meat prepping also see

you can ask the butcher to slice it but bargains these days are at places with little service and if you want grassfed meat you may have to mail order it estate and garage sales are good places to look prices range all over the place inexpensive ones dont cut well or last very long small commercial style are 300 and up ive given up on them and i simply hand slice my meat while it is partially frozen if you want the best solution for slicing raw meat get a yanagiba knife  meat tenderizers you can make a cheap cut of steak tender like an expensive cut there are two main types of tenderizers on the market and some unusual others you have the multiblade ones that pierce the meat and the hammers to pound the meat all of them get very high ratings the link here is to all types in bestselling order multiblade style the multiblade tenderizers have razor sharp blades that cut through connective tissues that make meat tough tiny heat canals are created without changing shape or appearance of the meat resulting in faster penetration of marinades it also reduces cooking time complaints are few if it falls apart it is impossible to reassemble if your cutting board is hard you can bend pins which are costly to replace and one stopped using it after reading that bacteria can get pushed into the meat and you must then cook it more thoroughly this should not be an issue with the more paleo grassfed meat hammer type these often have two surfaces a tenderizer surface is textured for optimum use and a smooth side for pounding you can take a piece of meat and turn it into a thin cutlet or pound chicken breasts to a uniform thickness which makes cooking faster and even the end with points helps tenderize steak by breaking up some of the muscle fibers which also allows your marinade to permeate you may also employ this tool to crush nuts or ice patty press when i make my own sausage i make patties they cook faster than links a cylinder has little contact with a hot pan and is not an efficient form to cook you will also need patty parchment paper despite what you see in pictures of only one sheet between patties i found to keep the patties from sticking to each other you need a sheet on each side a single sheet would work if you froze the patties one layer deep on a tray before stacking mine looks similar to the one pictured at left and makes patties 412 wide but the max is only 38 thick the white plastic fox run will make them 8ounce if you fill to the brim though it is only 4 in diameter others are adjustable to make the patties thicker the progressive international

scoop and squeeze can also use as a fruitmelon baller can be used to dish up pet food pros meatballs are more consistent in size thus cook at the same time keeps fingers clean cons meat can stick badly fingers can get sore as small unfitted bows are uncomfortable sausage stuffer attachments are available to use the meat grinder to stuff with a grinder you have to grind mix then regrind into a

idiots ladle i prefer an oval shape as it makes it easier to pour into narrow containers or into a food mill i use mine when making applesauce i dont see many oval ones at amazon i dont see the point of nylon ones maybe as i dont believe in nonstick cookware except for cooking eggs in a frying pan mixing spoons high temperature nylon is nice not to bang around inside the mixing bowl serving spoon you have a choice of stainless steel and high temperature nylon slotted spoon i use one like this to stir the applesauce suet and soup when in my 16 quart stockpot spatula when growing up spatulas they became hard rubber and were flat they have improved now they are a soft silicone rubber and many curve in like a spoon you need this to get the last of the cooked apples into the food mill and then the last of the milled sauce into a container and for anything else that is thick and wont easily pour out in the pictured set the largest is the only size i use also available are narrow uses for use in a jar turner the only nonstick pan i use is a frying pan for fried eggs hence the only utensils that i have that are plastic are turners when i started my household some four decades ago i acquired a turner with no name but most likely made by ekco since then i have bought another dozen none of them are as good as that original one one the handle is so heavy that if you leave in a small frying pan it flops out some dont have a straight leading edge making it hard to spread around the oil some dont have a sharp enough leading edge to easily get under the egg many are too large and cumbersome to slip in and get under a single egg without twisting the pan or moving your hand around some have blades that are too stiff it needs some flex to bend under the egg some dont have slots without them the surface friction is increased making it harder to slide under i have not tried the pictured turners i will buy them and try im leary of their long lifting surface and how they will get under the eggs that are on the near side of the pan at least im right handed so these wont be backwards for me wooden wooden spoons are widely used for mixing purposes especially in fragile containers the advantage of a wooden spoon is you can leave it in the pot and it wont get hot and you can more easily frequently stir the softness of the wood is kind to the pans cheap ones easily split even if not left in the pot apparently maple is better a downside is they have to be hand washed wait there is a new contender on the market bamboo they are inexpensive durable and they can go

strainer it is a sauce maker for creamy applesauce smooth tomato sauce and with accessories berries pumpkinssquash and grapes like a food mill but is cylindrical with an auger skin and seeds are discharged separately without waste top of the line is the squeezo ive never used one due to their expense i cant see buying one lemon juicer i pan fry all fish and most meats in onions garlic and olive oil then add lemon juice at the end i use a porcelain lime juicer that i picked up locally and is no longer available it is small but big enough for the juice of a half lemon i then pick out the seeds with a spoon this keeps the pulp but would be tedious if doing more than a half lemon there are many ways of getting the juice out of a lemon you have the juicer that either collects the juice using posts to hold back the seeds and pulp or strains it into another bowl there is a basic hand reamer then you have the squeezers the pictured one is the bestseller and gets high marks in the press though many comments note that if put in the dishwasher the enamel will start to flake off there are also smaller lime juicers and squeezers  pot strainer this is for people that boil their vegetables i usually steam them just place the strainer over the edge of the pot and drain the liquid keeping the vegetables in the pot also called a pour off sieve they come in two styles with a handle for use with a saucepan and larger ones with two side tabs to use with a stockpot in stainless steel or plastic strainer set these look like the strainers i bought decades ago when setting up my kitchen at the time it was very difficult to buy strainers of this quality kitchen utensils were all kind of cheap since then kitchen items have gone upscale i dont use them very often these days instead i use my chinois small colander and brewing basket brewing tea from a paleo pointofview it would be best to not consume caffeine but lets be realistic green tea is unprocessed and would be the most paleo not coffee which is a fruit seed that is inedible raw buying loose tea is much cheaper than buying bagged tea and if making the tea at home it is not a hassle to put the tea in an infuser or basket and stick in a mug of hot water heated in the microwave tea infuser i have several of the infuser pictured at left note that this has some limitations to allow room for the leaves to expand this only holds one teaspoon of flaked tea a single serving it is too small if you have premium fullleaf tea with leaves that are curled into a ball you can stir a few times to get good circulation amazoncom stocks this as an addon item to buy it you have to also buy enough other items to reach the 25 free shipping threshold finum brewing basket ive switched to using a mediumsized finum brewing basket mainly as the mesh is finer than the tea infuser and keeps the sediment out having sediment at the bottom of your cup will turn the tea bitter if you take a while to drink it the basket also is necessary for my imperial oolong which is full leaves tightly curled in little balls there are also stainless steel baskets i picked plastic as it has a much lower mass and dunking a basket into the heated water will reduce the temperature some the tea leaves will float on top and there is no circulation you can can lift out the basket to create some i now measure my tea with an inexpensive pocket scale torch these are usually used for caramelizing sugars browning meringue or melting cheese on onion soup gratinée none of these are paleo but a paleo person can use one to skin tomatoes crisp meat and sear the outside of red meat bacterial contamination shouldnt be a problem with grassfed meat but it is with grainfed if the meat hasnt been ground any contamination will be on the surface only that would need to be seared to make it safe butane torch lightweight torch designed for kitchen use they include an ignition mechanism you refill these with standard butane fuel as sold for lighters butane reaches 2500°f a propane torch as found in a workshop works just as well but it is much heavier to hold than a butane one that was designed for kitchen use unless you get a hose torch the pictured one has onoff trigger igniter for onehanded operation propane can reach 3600°f buy supplies paleo food mall food delivered to your home free recipes the paleo food cookbook
