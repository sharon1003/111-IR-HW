measuring rds on with highdefinition oscilloscopes r ds on of mosfets is a key parameter for determining the conduction loss in switchedmode power supply applications and is therefore of special interest when a switching mosfet is off it has a high draintosource voltage but when it is turned on the voltage drops to just a few hundred millivolts a highresolution oscilloscope is needed to measure these low voltages probe compensation and correct probing are also vital for accurate r ds on measurements your task to calculate the r ds on of a mosfet operating in inverse mode the drain current and the draintosource voltage need to be measured however due to the high draintosource voltage in the offstate and peaks during switching it is difficult to measure the relatively small draintosource voltage in the onstate with the typical 8bit resolution of standard oscilloscopes in addition poor probe compensation and incorrect probing techniques can significantly distort the signal resulting in incorrect measurement results even when the oscilloscope offers the necessary dynamic range tm solution with the rs ®rtors ®rte digital oscilloscope the rs ®rtok17rs ®rtek17 software option and the right probing techniques it is possible to measure the draintosource voltage for rds on under high dynamic range conditions thanks to digital lowpass filtering a vertical resolution of up to 16bit is achieved reducing the noise and increasing the signaltonoise ratio the user can limit the bandwidth selectable bands from 1 ghz to 10 k hz 10bit to 16bit this makes it possible to see small signal details such as the draintosource voltage in switchedmode power supply applications that would otherwise vanish in noise application the right probing technique and probing compensation for accurate measurements when measuring signals with highfrequency components a key aspect in probing is to keep the “loop” formed by the probing connections signal pin and ground connection as short as possible the springloaded tip of the rs ® rtzp10 passive probe together with springtype ground contacts provides a safe contact with minimal noise and interference coupling on the measured signal it is therefore possible to directly probe the mosfet pins and body accurate probe compensation is also very important for highresolution measurements a poorly compensated probe introduces measurement errors resulting in an inaccurate reading which can also influence differential measurements as suggested here for measurements where none of the mosfet pins are grounded an active differential probe has to be used the rs ® rtzd10 1 ghz active differential probe proves particularly useful here as it comes with an additional 101 attenuator that extends the probe’s voltage range to 70 v dc46 v ac peak analyzing very small signal details in the high definition mode the rs ®rtok17rs ®rtek17 high definition option offers users a very flexible way of increasing the resolution of an rs ® rtors®rte digital oscilloscope the software option uses digital filtering to increase the oscilloscope resolution a maximum resolution of 16bit is possible enabling detailed analysis even under extremely high dynamic range conditions the high definition mode can be quickly set up in just a few steps press the “mode” button on the “acquisition” tab press “option mode” and select “high definition”adjust the bandwidth as needed the resulting resolution is automatically shown the selected bandwidth should be as low as needed in order to obtain sufficient resolution but as high as possible to minimize signal distortion due to filtering the ideal measurement bandwidth has to be determined case by case avoiding offset problems when calculating rds onmeasuring at such different voltage levels requires additional steps to get the correct result the offset accuracy of oscilloscopes no longer suffices to simply divide the draintosource voltage across the mosfet by the drain current to calculate r ds on and when rogowski probes are used to measure the current through the drain pin of the mosfet only the ac component of the drain current can be measured the resulting current measurement on the oscilloscope will therefore have a dc offset this problem is solved by taking advantage of the fact that the drain current exhibits a constant or nearly constant slope for a certain time interval while the mosfet is in onstate this suggests using a differential method to calculate r ds on in high definition mode adjust the vertical scale of the oscilloscope such that the maximum draintosource voltage including peaks does not exceed the input voltage range of the oscilloscope otherwise overload and saturation effects will degrade the accuracy of draintosource voltage measurement use the zoom mode to display the draintosource voltage so that the slope of the draintosource voltage is clearly visible enable averaging of waveforms to get rid of any remaining unwanted noise or interference measure the slope of the draintosource voltage to get δu dmeasure the slope of the drain current of the mosfet in the same time interval as δu d to get δi dcalculate r ds on by dividing δu d by δi dthe screenshot illustrates the measurement using waveform averaging in high definition mode with 50 mhz bandwidth which increases the vertical resolution to 16bit the deeply zoomed waveforms are very clearly displayed summary the rs ®rtok17rs ®rtek17 high definition option makes it possible to measure signal details that would be lost in the noise of typical 8bit oscilloscopes it is possible to measure parameters like r ds on in switchedmode power supply applications where the measured signal exhibits a high dynamic range care has to be taken to use the right probing techniques and accurate probe compensation as both can introduce significant errors in the measurement result it is recommended to verify the result of such high dynamic measurements by performing the measurement under various conditions to make sure that the measurement is accurate download application card
