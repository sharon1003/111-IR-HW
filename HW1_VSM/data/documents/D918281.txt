maintenance hemodialysis therapy for chronic kidney disease ferric pyrophosphate citrate is not intended for use in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and has not been studied in patients receiving home hemodialysis for the treatment of irondeficiency anemia in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis who are receiving supplemental epoetin alfa therapy note in patients with irondeficiency anemia receiving hemodialysis and supplemental epoetin alfa therapy sufficient intravenous iron should be administered to maintain a serum ferritin of greater than 200 ngm l and transferrin saturation tsat greater than 20 the administration of iv iron is not routinely recommended if serum ferritin exceeds 500 ngm l dosages in excess of iron needs may lead to accumulation of iron in iron storage sites serum iron concentrations greater than 300 mcgd l may indicate iron poisoning note serum iron concentrations should be interpreted cautiously in the 24 hours following sodium ferric gluconate complex administration as many laboratory assays will falsely overestimate serum or transferrinbound iron by measuring iron still bound to the sodium ferric gluconate complex additionally when assessing iron overload use caution when interpreting serum ferritin concentrations in the week following sodium ferric gluconate complex administration during clinical studies serum ferritin exhibited a nonspecific rise which persisted for 5 days intravenous dosage expressed as elemental ironadults initially 125 mg iv administered either by iv infusion over 1 hour or iv injection over at least 10 minutes during each dialysis session most patients will require a minimum cumulative dose of 1 g of elemental iron divided and administered over 8 sequential dialysis sessions to replete iron stores however dosage requirements should be based on individual patient assessment and condition patients with serum ferritin below 100 ngm l or tsat less than 18 may need repletion doses of sodium ferric gluconate complex greater than 1 g to achieve optimal hemoglobin response patients may continue to require regular therapy with sodium ferric gluconate complex at the lowest dose necessary to maintain target hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations and acceptable laboratory parameters of iron storage doses of 625 mg iv elemental iron twice weekly weekly or every 2 weeks has maintained iron stores and reduced the dose of epoetin alfa according to the manufacturer single doses exceeding 125 mg iv may be associated with a higher incidence andor severity of adverse reactions eg hypotension nausea vomiting abdominal pain diarrhea dizziness dyspnea urticaria chest pain paresthesia and peripheral swelling although single doses of 250 mg iv to 500 mg iv have been

ferric gluconate complex ferric pyrophosphate citrate is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or any of its components sodium ferric gluconate complex should only be used in patients with a clear and confirmed need for parenteral iron therapy potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions characterized by cardiovascular collapse cardiac arrest bronchospasm oral or pharyngeal edema dyspnea angioedema urticaria or pruritus which could result in death have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with ironcarbohydrate complexes parenteral sodium ferric gluconate complex ferrlecit and iron sucrose venofer complexes are less likely to cause hypersensitivity reactions than iron dextran and may be used as alternative therapy in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to iron dextran in a postmarketing singledose safety study of 1097 patients 1 patient experienced a lifethreatening hypersensitivity reaction to sodium ferric gluconate complex furthermore the incidence of drug intolerance or suspected allergic reaction to sodium ferric gluconate complex occurred in 28 of patients with a history of prior iron dextran hypersensitivity including the patient with the life threatening reaction vs 08 of patients without such a history in addition 28 of patients in this study were also receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor the incidence of drug intolerance or suspected hypersensitivity reaction in patients taking an ace inhibitor was 16 vs 07 in those patients not taking an ace inhibitor a test dose was initially recommended prior to administration of ferrlecit however the fda has removed this requirement for a test dose upon reviewing postmarketing safety data for ferrlecit serious anaphylactoid reactions require appropriate resuscitative measures cardiac disease geriatric hypotension cardiovascular adverse effects may also occur with sodium ferric gluconate complex and do not necessarily indicate hypersensitivity flushing and hypotension are more common following rapid intravenous administration see dosage for recommended administration rates for iv injection and iv infusion sodium ferric gluconate complex is administered commonly to patients receiving dialysis many patients experience transient hypotension during hemodialysis patients with preexisting cardiac disease may have exacerbation of cardiovascular symptoms if adverse effects occur following sodium ferric gluconate complex administration data in patients aged  65 years old are limited while geriatric patients do not appear to respond differently to this drug than normal adults the manufacturer has recommended cautious initial dosing in the elderly population intramuscular administration the only approved route of administration for sodium ferric gluconate complex is intravenously there is no information regarding intramuscular administration ferric pyrophosphate citrate is not intended for use in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis it has not been studied in patients receiving home hemodialysis hemochromatosis hemoglobinopathy hemosiderosis do not administer sodium ferric gluconate complex ferric pyrophosphate citrate to patients with evidence of iron overload eg patients with hemochromatosis unnecessary or prolonged administration of iron may lead to iron overload and consequently the possibility of exogenous hemosiderosis patients with hemoglobinopathy and other refractory anemias that might be erroneously diagnosed as iron deficiency anemias are at particular risk for such iron overload the type of anemia and the underlying cause or causes should be determined before starting therapy with parenteral sodium ferric gluconate complex since the anemia may be a result of a systemic disturbance such as recurrent blood loss the underlying cause s should be corrected if possible patients receiving exogenous iron therapy require periodic monitoring of hematologic and hematinic parameters ie hemoglobin hematocrit serum ferritin and transferrin saturation to avoid iron overload hepatic disease some patients with chronic hepatic disease may also have hemochromatosis or moderate iron overload in hepatic tissues the liver is one of the main storage sites for iron and advanced chronic liver disease may result in excess storage iron in the liver use sodium ferric gluconate complex ferric pyrophosphate citrate with caution in patients with hepatic disease pregnancy use sodium ferric gluconate complex or ferric pyrophosphate citrate in pregnant patients only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus sodium ferric gluconate complex is classified as fda pregnancy category b there are no adequate or wellcontrolled human studies with sodium ferric gluconate complex in pregnancy sodium ferric gluconate complex was not teratogenic at doses up to 100 mgkgday 300 mgm2day in mice and 20 mgkgday 120 mgm2day in rats these iron doses were 4 and 15 times the recommended human dose of 125 mgday 77 mgm2day on a body surface area basis and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus no data are available regarding maternal toxicity sodium ferric gluconate complex injection products contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative although there are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants studies to assess the effects of sodium ferric gluconate complex on fertility were not conducted there are no available data on the use of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in pregnant women to inform a drugassociated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in animal studies with ferric pyrophosphate citrate developmental toxicity was observed when animals were administered maternally toxic doses that were higher than the maximum theoretical amount of iron administered to humans breastfeeding use caution when administering sodium ferric gluconate complex injection to a breastfeeding woman while iron is excreted into breast milk the iron content of breast milk is not readily affected by the iron content of the maternal diet or the maternal serum iron concentration therefore iron use is usually compatible with breastfeeding if the lactating mother needs treatment for iron deficiency however sodium ferric gluconate complex injection products contain the preservative benzyl alcohol when present in maternal serum benzyl alcohol is likely to cross into breast milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant benzyl alcohol has been associated with gasping syndrome in neonates and lowbirth weight infants although a normal therapeutic dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex delivers a much smaller amount of benzyl alcohol than has been associated with gasping syndrome the potential for serious adverse events from exposure to benzyl alcohol especially in a neonate or lowbirth weight infant should be considered there is no information regarding the presence of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in human milk the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mothers clinical need for ferric pyrophosphate citrate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ferric pyrophosphate citrate or the underlying maternal condition benzyl alcohol hypersensitivity children infants neonates safety and effectiveness of the use of sodium ferric gluconate complex has not been established in infants or children  6 years of age administration of iron to premature infants can increase the risk of developing hemolytic anemia because these infants may have a low serum vitamin e concentration in general iron supplementation should not begin in premature infants until adequate vitamin e is supplied in the diet human breast milk and modern infant formulas usually supply adequate vitamin e sodium ferric gluconate complex should be avoided in patients with benzyl alcohol hypersensitivity and should not be used in neonates because of the presence of benzyl alcohol as a preservative in the product in neonates benzyl alcohol may cause a gasping syndrome neonates have a decreased capacity to conjugate pamino benzoate and benzoic acid benzoic acid accumulation in neonates may cause significant morbidity sodium ferric gluconate complex has been shown to be safe and effective in children aged 6 to 15 years two dosages of sodium ferric gluconate complex 15 mgkg or 30 mgkg were administered to 66 irondeficient pediatric hemodialysis patients aged 6 to 15 years for 8 sequential dialysis sessions two weeks after the last dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex was administered both groups of patients demonstrated significant increases in hemoglobin 08 mgd l for the 15 mgkg group and 09 mgd l for the 30 mgkg group p  003 compared to baseline for both groups in addition both groups demonstrated significant increases in hematocrit transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups contraception requirements reproductive risk ferric pyrophosphate citrate may be associated with reproductive risk fetal harm discuss contraception requirements with

iron or vitamins supplemented with 10 mg of elemental iron reduced extent of cefdinir absorption by 80 and 31 respectively if oral iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after the iron supplement the effect highly ironfortified food primarily ironfortified breakfast cereals on cefdinir absorption has not been studied further concomitantly administered ironfortified infant formula 22 mg elemental iron6 oz has no significant effect on cefdinir pharmacokinetics therefore cefdinir oral suspension can be administered with ironfortified infant formula however several case reports describe nonbloody reddish stool discoloration in infants being treated with cefdinir who were also receiving ironfortified infant formulas this reddish color may occur as a result of the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between ferric ions and cefdinir or one of its metabolites parents of infants receiving cefdinir should be

lactationpregnancy use sodium ferric gluconate complex or ferric pyrophosphate citrate in pregnant patients only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus sodium ferric gluconate complex is classified as fda pregnancy category b there are no adequate or wellcontrolled human studies with sodium ferric gluconate complex in pregnancy sodium ferric gluconate complex was not teratogenic at doses up to 100 mgkgday 300 mgm2day in mice and 20 mgkgday 120 mgm2day in rats these iron doses were 4 and 15 times the recommended human dose of 125 mgday 77 mgm2day on a body surface area basis and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus no data are available regarding maternal toxicity sodium ferric gluconate complex injection products contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative although there are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants studies to assess the effects of sodium ferric gluconate complex on fertility were not conducted there are no available data on the use of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in pregnant women to inform a drugassociated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage in animal studies with ferric pyrophosphate citrate developmental toxicity was observed when animals were administered maternally toxic doses that were higher than the maximum theoretical amount of iron administered to humans use caution when administering sodium ferric gluconate complex injection to a breastfeeding woman while iron is excreted into breast milk the iron content of breast milk is not readily affected by the iron content of the maternal diet or the maternal serum iron concentration therefore iron use is usually compatible with breastfeeding if the lactating mother needs treatment for iron deficiency however sodium ferric gluconate complex injection products contain the preservative benzyl alcohol when present in maternal serum benzyl alcohol is likely to cross into breast milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant benzyl alcohol has been associated with gasping syndrome in neonates and lowbirth weight infants although a normal therapeutic dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex delivers a much smaller amount of benzyl alcohol than has been associated with gasping syndrome the potential for serious adverse events from exposure to benzyl alcohol especially in a neonate or lowbirth weight infant should be considered there is no information regarding the presence of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in human milk the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mothers clinical need for ferric pyrophosphate citrate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ferric pyrophosphate citrate or the underlying maternal condition mechanism of actionnormal erythropoiesis depends on the concentration of iron and erythropoietin available in the plasma both being decreased in renal failure exogenous administration of erythropoietin increases red blood cell production and iron utilization contributing to iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients a therapeutic response to treatment with sodium ferric gluconate complex ferric pyrophosphate citrate is dependent upon the patients ability to use the iron use of iron is influenced by the cause of the deficiency as well as other illnesses that can affect normal erythropoiesis proteinenergy malnutrition can prevent the incorporation of iron into the erythrocyte regardless of the quantity of iron stored only when lean body mass expands will iron be used iron therapy alone does not increase red blood cell production administration of iron will only improve anemia associated with iron deficiency there is some concern that intravenously administered iron is not used appropriately by the body and little is available for use in the bone marrow both animal and human data indicate the bulk of intravenously administered iron is sequestered in the reticuloendothelial system ie liver spleen which could lead to hepatosplenic hemosiderosis an increase in iron storage without associated tissue damage parenterally administered iron predominantly accumulates in the kupffer cells of the livers macrophage system leading to less harm than excess body iron stored in the parenchyma this information is associated with injectable iron products containing dextran polysaccharides ironcontaining proteins and enzymes are important in oxidationreduction reactions especially those of the mitochondria iron is a component of myoglobin and several hemeenzymes including the cytochromes catalase and peroxidase iron is an essential component of the metalloflavoprotein enzymes and the mitochondrial enzyme alphaglycerophosphate oxidase ironcontaining proteins and enzymes are important in oxidationreduction reactions especially those of the mitochondria furthermore iron is a cofactor for enzymes such as aconitase and tryptophan pyrrolase iron deficiency not only causes anemia and decreased oxygen delivery it also reduces the metabolism of muscle and decreases mitochondrial activity iron deficiency can also lead to defects in learning or thermoregulation thus iron is important to several metabolic functions which are independent of its importance to erythropoesis pharmacokineticssodium ferric gluconate complex is administered intravenously ferric pyrophosphate citrate is added to a bicarbonate dialysate for hemodialysis therapy iron therapy dosage is individualized according to patient goals for serum iron levels iron storage parameters eg ferritin transferrin saturation and serum hemoglobin concentrations iron toxicity may occur with excessive or unnecessary iron therapy systemic iron is stored in compounds called ferritin and hemosiderin which are used for future use in the production of hemoglobin the absorption of iron depends upon the route of entry the tissue that first clears parenterally administered iron from the bloodstream determines the bioavailability if the reticuloendothelial system clears iron only small amounts will be available over time to the bone marrow transferrin accepts iron from the intestinal tract or from sites of storage or hemoglobin destruction iron is then transported in plasma bound to transferrin and distributed to the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis to the reticuloendothelial system for storage to all cells for enzymes containing iron and to placental cells to meet fetal needs transferrin eventually becomes available for reuse there is no destructive metabolism of iron because it takes place in a closed system in normal adults ninety percent of metabolized iron is conserved and reutilized repeatedly very little iron is excreted in normal healthy adults some daily loss of iron occurs through normal skin hair and nail loss and gi losses menstruating women have an increased loss as do other persons with loss of blood in vitro experiments with both diluted and undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex demonstrate that less than 1 of the iron species within the compound is dialyzable sodium ferric gluconate complex approximately 80 of drug bound iron was delivered to transferrin as a mononuclear ionic iron species within 24 hours of administration in each dosage regimen direct movement of iron from sodium ferric gluconate complex was not observed mean peak transferrin saturation did not exceed 100 and returned to near baseline by 40 hours after administration of each dosage regimen ferric pyrophosphate

over 12 hours intravenous route sodium ferric gluconate complex multiple sequential single dose intravenous pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 14 healthy irondeficient patients patients were randomized to receive undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex intravenously by slow iv infusion either 125 mg infused over 1 hour or 625 mg infused over 05 hour five days after the first stage each subject was rerandomized to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex intravenously by rapid iv infusion either 125 mg infused over 7 minutes or 625mg infused over 4 minutes cmax concentrations varied by dosage and rate of administration the highest cmax 190 mgl was observed in the group who received 125 mg by rapid iv infusion the initial volume of distribution of 6 l corresponds well to calculated blood volume the terminal elimination halflife was approximately 1 hour ranging from 085 hours for the 625 mg rapid iv infusion 4 minutes group to 145 hours for the 125 mg rapid infusion 7 minutes group total clearance was 302—535 lhour the auc for sodium ferric gluconate complex varied by dose from 175 mghl for patients receiving 625 mg to 356 mghl for patients receiving 125 mg the rate of administration did not cause variation in the terminal elimination halflife clearance or auc other route sintravascular route ferric pyrophosphate citrate the pharmacokinetics of serum iron was investigated in healthy volunteers administered 25 5 75 and 10 mg ferric pyrophosphate citrate intravenously over 4 hours or 15 mg and 20 mg intravenously over 12 hours after correcting for the basal iron levels the auc and cmax of baselinecorrected serum iron increased in a dose proportional manner in a study that assessed the impact of different dialysis conditions on iron delivery in patients administered ferric pyrophosphate citrate via hemodialysis a reduction of the blood and dialysate flow rates qbqd of 200400 m lmin vs  350  600 m lmin resulted in a 33 decrease in the median cumulative iron delivered back to top
