middle cerebral vein inferior cerebral vein sphenoparietal sinus structure  editthe sinus may be joined by several anastomoses across the midline the cavernous sinus receives blood via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins through the superior orbital fissure and from superficial cortical veins and is connected to the basilar plexus of veins posteriorly the internal carotid artery  carotid siphon  and cranial nerves iii iv v branches v 1 and v 2 and vi all pass through this blood filled space infection from the face may reach the cavernous sinus through its many anastomotic connections with severe consequences the cavernous sinus drains by two larger channels the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses ultimately into the internal jugular vein via the sigmoid sinus also draining with emissary vein to pterygoid plexus function  editeach cavernous sinus one for each hemisphere of the brain contains the followingvertically from superior to inferior along the lateral wall of the sinusoculomotor nerve cn iiitrochlear nerve cn ivophthalmic nerve the v 1 branch of the trigeminal nerve cn vmaxillary nerve the v 2 branch of cn v external to but immediately adjacent to the lateral wall of the sinus 1unlike the nerves listed above the abducens nerve cn vi does not run within the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus rather it runs through the middle of the sinus alongside the internal carotid artery these nerves with the exception of cn v 2 pass through the cavernous sinus to enter the orbital apex through the superior orbital fissure the maxillary nerve division v 2 of the trigeminal nerve travels through the lower portion of the sinus and exits via the foramen rotundumhorizontally from medial to lateralinternal carotid artery and internal carotid plexus  see also

wall contents from superior to inferior cat are the horizontal contents from medial to lateral 2the optic nerve lies just above and outside the cavernous sinus superior and lateral to the pituitary gland on each side and enters the orbital apex via the optic canal venous connections  editit receives tributaries from superior and inferior ophthalmic veins sphenoparietal sinus superficial middle cerebral veins the veins of exit are to the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses as well as via the emissary veins through the foramina of the skull mostly through foramen ovale  there are also connections with the pterygoid plexus of veins via inferior ophthalmic vein deep facial vein and emissary veins clinical significance  editit is the only anatomic location in the body in which an artery travels completely through a venous structure if the internal carotid artery ruptures within the cavernous sinus an arteriovenous fistula is created more specifically a carotidcavernous fistula  lesions affecting the cavernous sinus may affect isolated nerves or all the nerves traversing through it the pituitary gland lies between the two paired cavernous sinuses an abnormally growing pituitary adenoma sitting on the bony sella turcica will expand in the direction of least resistance and eventually compress the cavernous sinus cavernous sinus syndrome may result from mass effect of these tumors and cause ophthalmoplegia from compression of the oculomotor nerve trochlear nerve and abducens nerve ophthalmic sensory loss from compression of the ophthalmic nerve and maxillary sensory loss from compression of the maxillary nerve a complete lesion of the cavernous sinus disrupts cn iii iv and vi causing total ophthalmoplegia usually accompanied by a fixed dilated pupil involvement of cn v v 1 and variable involvement of v 2 causes sensory loss in these divisions of the trigeminal nerve horners syndrome can also occur due to involvement of the carotid ocular sympathetics but may be difficult to appreciate in the setting of a complete third nerve injury 3because of its connections with the facial vein via the superior ophthalmic vein it is possible to get infections in the cavernous sinus from an external facial injury within the danger area of the face in patients with thrombophlebitis of the facial vein pieces of the clot may break off and enter the cavernous sinus forming a cavernous sinus thrombosis from there the infection may spread to the dural venous sinuses infections may also be introduced by facial lacerations and by bursting pimples in the areas drained by the facial vein 4potential causes of cavernous sinus syndrome include metastatic tumors direct extension of nasopharyngeal tumors meningioma pituitary tumors or pituitary apoplexy aneurysms of the intracavernous carotid artery carotidcavernous fistula bacterial infection causing cavernous sinus thrombosis aseptic thrombosis idiopathic granulomatous disease  tolosahunt syndrome
