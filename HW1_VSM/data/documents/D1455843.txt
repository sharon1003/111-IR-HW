it in his family and didn’t cause it to himself with bleaching creams as some claim his grandfather had it too you can see it on his cheek mj said it was in his family and he was telling the truth it started since he was a kid it developed faster on his hand and that was why he started to use the billie jean glovethen as he grew so did his vitiligo definite proof he suffered from it his autopsy report confirms he had vitiligo  number 2 down here how he looked without make up on update 1 michael jackson wasnt the first black entertainer with vitiligo arthur wright a black singer and dancer suffered from vitiligo and turned completely white just like michael jackson his story was published in 1978 in the ebony magazine here are some other vitiligo patients darcel de vlugt luke davis his dermatologist and make up artist speak about it the main reason i added this information is because a lot of people claim that vitiligo can’t turn you fully white and that mj used the disease as an

psychologist and social worker writing about michael jackson answered may 10 2017 · author has 322 answers and 6137k answer views originally answered why michael jackson was obsessed with white skin michael jackson was not obsessed with white skin these thoughts are typical of the kinds of rumors that can be very hurtful to his family and legacy michael jackson was a very proud black man he loved the natural color of his skin and the only reason that it appeared to turn whitish was because he was trying to cover up two skin diseases that had plagued him since his early twenties vitiligo and lupus both of these diseases can be disfiguring to the sufferer and are greatly worsened by sunlight and stress that is why he always carried an umbrella with him or wore a hat in the sun when michael first noticed the diseases he tried to cover up the lightened or red blotches with dark makeup this worked for a short while but as the diseases progressedespecially the vitiligohe realized that this was futile imagine being a star in his position and coming down with an illness that caused unpigmentation to occur all over your face hands and body he was already plagued by a crazy media frenzy and knew that this illness was just the kind of fact that would be strewn over every tabloid in existence in 1993 michael did a very special interview with oprah and admitted for the first time that he was suffering from vitiligo and thats what caused his skin to appear that he was lightening it he worked very closely with a dermatologist and makeup artist and found a way to match the natural color of his skin to the lighter blotches the result made it appear as though he was “turning white” later in 1993 he was accused of molesting a young boy and the vitiligo actually helped to prove his innocence the police insisted on taking humiliating photographs of his genital area to see if the boys description of certain vitiligo blotches matched the reality of his body not one description matched i suppose anything can have a silver lining if you look hard enough in conclusion i would just like to say that it is dangerous to make assumptions not based in fact anyone can make up anything they want to but you have to delve farther into a subject to find the truth because of this i am glad you asked the question you did but i wish that you hadnt already assumed that michael jackson was “obsessed” with white skin it would have been a much better question if you had just asked why michaels skin started to appear lighter as he got older in this way you wouldnt be perpetuating a nasty sounding false rumor you would instead help to educate the public on a topic of great importance for all sufferers of these type of skin disorders488k views · view upvoters quora user answered jan 31 2014originally answered did michael jackson really have a skin disorder that made his skin change colour or did he deliberately do something to become white im writing this as an answer because there is a bunch of material on michael jackson  in the documentaries that released post hisdeath statements from his surgeons doctors and family during several interviews  that explains the origins of his issues and leaves some mysteries unanswered i will try to address each point raised that makes it seem like he obviously had race issues first vitiligo its not an easy disease to have and doesnt leave you with many options once it strikes ive seen tons of people that suffered from it in india where i live and where it is quite common in certain pockets and had most of their skin basically go pinkish and those are the lucky ones michael jackson just turned out to have enough money to tweak it to white instead of staying a standout pink as advanced as plastic surgery is i dont think its possible to inject someone with melanin which is what gives people their colour and have it spread uniformly so going white  by bleaching  was to my knowledge the only option he had p s so i dont think the comment just as easily have chosen to darken the white spots in frank kai pettaways answer is fair its not exactly like selecting the paint for your living room walls second restructuring his face he hated his nose in particular and looks in general because he resembled his father at least thats what he saw in the mirror he had repeated nose jobs to narrow his nose so that it wont resemble his fathers broad one and then some more because the repeated surgery made the structures supporting his nose weaker and weaker necessitating more surgery third and this points to even deeper image issues is that when he went to his doctor for the surgeries he reportedly used a statue of nefertiti or cleopatra i dont remember which as the model i dont know what this does for the race angle but to me this shows that he cared more to look like a beautiful woman than a handsome caucasian i mean  the cover of bad  look at it fourth continuing with the image issues he faked his voice all the time he was in public for 30something years his natural voice was gruff and manly he spoke that way in private with his brothers but outside he would always talk with that nasal whine i dont know whether he wanted to sound like the childstar he once was or like the beautiful woman he wanted to be but neither of these speak race identity to me this is a sad story to recount but michael jackson sounds like a man who grew to stardom way too young and got attached to that stardom the wrong way i think he believed that the stardom was attached to his voice and tried to keep his voice at the same childlike tenor that first brought him success even an impossible 30 years after his last childhood album he saw the flood of billboards magazine covers and photos his own face constantly reminding him of his father making him hate himself feel ugly and he had to eliminate that cue the infatuation with nefertiti and the like the point is michael jacksons life is a case study of several issues interacting with his unfortunate broken psyche to create the string of pretenses and falsehoods that his life had become dismissing all the issues with a single race explanation is only too easy but like most things that are that easy its not necessarily true398k views · view upvoters your response is private is this answer still relevant and up to date kat

do something to become white yes he really did the autopsy report confirmed he suffered from vitiligo treatment often involves the depigmentation of the rest of the original skin colour which can remain in blotches to even out the skin tone so he probably also did something to become white as you put it he remained proud of his race and colour and reiterated the fact many times during his life his children have indicated they were brought up to respect their heritage i think the fact he found it so hard to talk about and tears came to his eyes when he admitted he had the disorder in 1993 in

factor he had to go one way or the other to not look afflicted but theres something someone told me back in the 80s when he had first burst on the scene with this new look i mean not just the lighter skin but the plastic surgery that narrowed his features and made him look more european id always thought he was such a cute kid and the change appalled me i made a disparaging remark about it my friend who was black and in the music business said he understood what he was doing he didnt elaborate so i was intrigued by the cryptic comment and remembered it around the same time i had neighbors white with a little girl about four who had a big crush on michael jackshon all the time she was talking about michael jackshon everything was michael jackshon her mother an exhippie who got married in her bare feet thought it was adorable i read into the subtext that she thought it was cool and amazing that her daughters first association with someone black was so positive and adoring like good god the world has moved on its axis so this change in his appearance also totally coincided with his commanding a much wider audience we can talk about him being color struck and wanting to look white and that being an indication of selfhatred im sure with how abusive his dad was he was totally at risk for that but he turned that troubled expression into a successful conquest of the white world lol
