now i am no where near an expert on beef my husband kind of is he makes the best steaks i have everhad but that’s a whole other post…but i do know how to make a tender roast and considering friendshave asked me how before and the fact that i remember when i didn’t know how…i thought it might make a good post…one of the most important parts of a great roast is marbling the more marbling the better you see it moisturizes the meat from the insideaside from injection it ‘s the easiest way to ensure a moist roast try to find something above moderate you need to decide what you would like in in your roast and combine it in a 9x13 pan i usually throw in56 cubed potatoes a handfull of baby carrots a quarter of a white onion cut into strips a couple of cloves of garlic plenty of salt pepper and seasoning salt34 beef bullion cubes water ½ pan full and the secret “naughty” ingredient a stick of butter sliced up on top cover the top with tin foil to seal in the moisture then cook it on a low temperature for as long as possible the longer the better…i usually try to cook it for around 3 hrs at 250300 degrees f you can cook at a higher temp if you need to for less time or a lower temp for a longer timebut please make sure that it is all the way done before eating you can smell it when it is done it will pull apart easily having a nice brown color on the inside next you need gravy…empty the juices that the roast created into a pan strain them through a strainer if you preferadd some water approximately 2 parts water can be part milk if you prefer helps make it creamier 1 part juices in a glass measuring cup add½ c cold water¼ c flour whip it with an egg beater until well combined pour it into the mixture of juices beat with the egg beater until well combined again add seasonings salt pepper garlic powder and onion powder to taste cook over medhigh heat stirring constantly until boiling turn the heat down boil and stir for one minute until thickened remove from the stove serve over the meat and vegetables immediately see it looks a lot harder than it is…play around with it add different spicesmy brotherinlaw even uses onion soup mix…yumlet us know if you come up with any great new flavors…enjoy and have and awesome dinnershare snippets with your friends morefacebook twitter pinterest google
