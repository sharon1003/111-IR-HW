away im really sick  tired of all the bird dropping on our cars in front of our house the pigeons come everyday  sit on the powertelephone lines  whatever they are   poop on are cars all the time what can i do besides not parking in front of my house i was thinking about buys a plastic owl  mounting it on our front tiny balcony  everyday maybe even a couple of times a day changing the direction it faces or moving it from side to side so the birds dont just see it as a new place to stand but do birds even fall for these plastic birds of pray id get a hawk or what ever works remove advertisements

seen that kills pigeons flying rats is kitchen grease especially chinaman grease the pigeons land in the grease around the exhaust fan and get stuck they die of starvation so if you shot them with an air rrifle you would be doling them a favor11022011 1142 am  5bud cline tileguy join date mar 2006posts 10705 rewards points 558view bud clines albumhttpwwwabsolutebirdcontrolcombsferalpigeon11022011
