preview of the day ahead merck receives fda approval of prevymis™ letermovir for prevention of cytomegalovirus cmv infection and disease in adult allogeneic stem cell transplant patients business wire november 9 2017kenilworth n j business wiremerck  co inc  mrk  known as msd outside the united states and canada today announced that the u s food and drug administration fda has approved prevymis™ letermovir oncedaily tablets for oral use and injection for intravenous infusion prevymis is indicated for prophylaxis prevention of cytomegalovirus cmv infection and disease in adult cmvseropositive recipients r of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct cmv is a common and potentially serious viral infection in allogeneic hsct recipients cmvseropositive patients who undergo an hsct are at high risk for cmv reactivation any level of cmv infection is associated with increased mortality in hsct patients in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial supporting approval significantly fewer patients in the prevymis group 38 n122325 compared to the placebo group 61 n103170 developed clinically significant cmv infection discontinued treatment or had missing data through week 24 posthsct treatment difference 235 95 confidence interval 325 to 146 p00001 the primary efficacy endpoint allcause mortality in patients receiving prevymis was lower compared to placebo 12 vs 17 respectively at week 24 posttransplant in this study the incidence of bone marrow suppression in the prevymis group was comparable to the placebo group the median time to engraftment was 19 days in the prevymis group and 18 days in the placebo group prevymis is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids increased pimozide concentrations may lead to qt prolongation and torsades de pointes increased ergot alkaloids concentrations may lead to ergotism prevymis is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with cyclosporine significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis the concomitant use of prevymis letermovir and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions some of which may lead to adverse reactions prevymis or concomitant drugs or reduced therapeutic effect of prevymis or the concomitant drug consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during prevymis therapy review concomitant medications during prevymis therapy and monitor for adverse reactions associated with prevymis and concomitant medications“our findings demonstrate that letermovir is a significant and welcomed advance in the prevention of clinically significant cmv infection and lowers mortality in this highly vulnerable patient population” said dr francisco m marty associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school and attending physician in transplant and oncology infectious diseases at danafarber cancer institute and brigham and women’s hospital in boston the recommended dosage of prevymis is 480 mg administered once daily initiated as early as day 0 and up to day 28 posttransplantation before or after engraftment and continued through day 100 posttransplantation if prevymis is coadministered with cyclosporine the dosage of oral or intravenous prevymis should be decreased to 240 mg once daily prevymis is available as 240 mg and 480 mg tablets which may be administered with or without food prevymis is also available as 240 mg and 480 mg injection for intravenous infusion via a peripheral catheter or central venous line at a constant rate over one hour“prevymis is the first new medicine for cmv infection approved in the u s in 15 years” said dr roy baynes senior vice president head of clinical development and chief medical officer merck research laboratories “prevymis continues merck’s longstanding tradition of bringing forward important new therapies to address serious infectious diseases we are proud to add this breakthrough medicine to our existing offerings for physicians and patients”prevymis is expected to be available in december the list price wholesaler acquisition cost per day for prevymis tablets is 19500 and for prevymis injection is 27000 wholesaler acquisition costs do not include discounts that may be paid on the product the cardiac adverse event rate regardless of investigatorassessed causality was higher in patients receiving prevymis than placebo 13 vs 6 the most common cardiac adverse events were tachycardia reported in 4 prevymis patients and 2 placebo patients and atrial fibrillation reported in 3 prevymis patients and 1 placebo patients these adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in severity the rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10 of prevymistreated hsct recipients and at a frequency at least 2 greater than placebo were nausea 27 vs 23 diarrhea 26 vs 24 vomiting 19 vs 14 peripheral edema 14 vs 9 cough 14 vs 10 headache 14 vs 9 fatigue 13 vs 11 and abdominal pain 12 vs 9 the most frequently reported adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea occurring in 2 of prevymis patients and 1 of placebo patients hypersensitivity reaction with associated moderate dyspnea occurred in one patient following the first infusion of iv prevymis after switching from oral prevymis leading to treatment discontinuation story continues clinical data supporting prevymis letermovirto evaluate prophylaxis with prevymis as a preventive strategy for cmv infection or disease in transplant recipients at high risk for cmv reactivation the efficacy of prevymis was assessed in a multicenter doubleblind placebocontrolled phase 3 trial in adult cmvpositive recipients r of an allogeneic hsct patients were randomized 21 to receive either prevymis at a dose of 480 mg once daily adjusted to 240 mg when coadministered with cyclosporine or placebo study drug was initiated after hsct at any time from day 028 posttransplant and continued through week 14 posttransplant patients were monitored through week 24 posttransplant for the primary efficacy endpoint with continued followup through week 48 posttransplant the primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of clinically significant cmv infection through week 24 posttransplant defined as the occurrence of either cmv endorgan disease or initiation of anticmv preemptive therapy based on documented cmv viremia and the clinical condition of the patient the noncompleter equals failure approach was used where patients who discontinued from the trial prior to week 24 posttransplant or had a missing outcome at week 24 posttransplant were counted as failures among the 565 treated patients 34 were engrafted at baseline and 30 had one or more factors associated with additional risk for cmv reactivation the most common primary reasons for transplant were acute myeloid leukemia 38 myelodysplastic syndrome 16 and lymphoma 12 fewer patients in the prevymis group had clinically significant cmv infection by week 24 posthsct compared to the placebo group 18 vs 42 respectively through the week 14 posthsct treatment period 8 of patients in the prevymis group and 39 of patients in the placebo group experienced clinically significant cmv infection clinically significant cmv infection was defined as cmv endorgan disease or initiation of preemptive therapy based on documented cmv viremia and the clinical condition of the patient efficacy results were consistent across high and lowrisk strata for cmv reactivation prevymis demonstrated significant benefit compared to placebo in time to clinically significant cmv infection through week 24 posthsct 189 vs 443 cumulative rate stratified logrank test twosided pvalue 00001 posthoc analysis demonstrated that among prevymistreated patients inclusion in the highrisk stratum for cmv reactivation at baseline occurrence of graftversushost disease gvhd and steroid use at any time after randomization may be associated with the development of clinically significant cmv infection between week 14 and week 24 posttransplant the kaplanmeier event rate for allcause mortality in the prevymis vs placebo groups was 12 vs 17 at week 24 posttransplant and 24 vs 28 at week 48 posttransplant additional selected safety information about prevymis letermovircoadministration of prevymis with drugs that are inhibitors of organic aniontransporting polypeptide 1b13 oatp1b13 transporters may result in increases in letermovir plasma concentrations coadministration of prevymis with midazolam results in increased midazolam plasma concentration coadministration of prevymis with drugs that are cyp3a substrates may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations of coadministered cyp3a substrates

with severe childpugh class c hepatic impairment about prevymis letermovirprevymis is a member of a new class of nonnucleoside cmv inhibitors 34 dihydroquinazolines and inhibits viral replication by specifically targeting the viral terminase complex cross resistance is not likely with drugs outside of this class prevymis is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to cmv dna polymerase inhibitors these dna polymerase inhibitors are fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to prevymis prevymis has no activity against other viruses letermovir has been granted orphan designation for the prevention of cmv disease in atrisk populations in the u s eu and japan and is under accelerated review in the eu and japan under an agreement signed in 2012 merck through a subsidiary purchased worldwide rights to develop and commercialize letermovir from ai curis gmb h  co kg  wwwaicuriscom  about cmv and treatment cmv is a common virus that infects people of all ages many adults in the united states are cmv seropositive meaning they have cmv antibodies in their blood indicating a previous exposure to or primary infection with cmv people with normal immune systems rarely develop cmv symptoms after initial infection with the virus typically remaining inactive or latent in the body for life a weakened immune system may give the virus a chance to reactivate potentially leading to symptomatic disease or a secondary infection due to other pathogens cmv disease can lead to endorgan damage including gastrointestinal tract disease pneumonia or retinitis transplant recipients who develop cmv infection posttransplant are at increased risk for transplant failure and death cmv prophylaxis with certain existing antivirals has been associated with drugspecific effects including myelosuppression and renal toxicity in hsct recipients about merck for more than a century merck a leading global
