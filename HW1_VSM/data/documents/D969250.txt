what is sudden cardiac arrest sudden cardiac arrest sca occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating it is caused by the immediate loss of electrical heart function usually from an irregular and rapid quivering of the ventricles called ventricular fibrillation rarely the abnormal rhythms can resolve on their own usually though these rhythms degenerate to ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in which the heart is quivering or asystole cardiac arrest in which the heart stops beating early emergency treatment with cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr or an automated external defibrillator aed can help restart a stopped heart and allow return of a normal heartbeat to help prevent sudden cardiac death scd although sca is rare in children it can affect anyone even those who are physically fit each year sca claims the lives of over 2000 children and adolescents in the u s and accounts for approximately 35 percent of all deaths in children aged 519 years it is also responsible for 1015 percent of sudden unexpected infant deaths risk factors sudden cardiac arrest occurs more frequently in males than females and in children most commonly occurs between 1019 years of age still it’s important to note that sca may occur in children of all ages even infants some other risk factors include athletic activity twothirds of the deaths caused by sca in children occur during exercise or activity sca is the leading cause of death in young athletes accounting for 75 percent of all athleterelated deaths known congenital heart disease or structural heart abnormalities known abnormal heart rhythms associated with congenital heart disease most commonly these include ventricular arrhythmias or atrial arrhythmias especially the postoperative state or in the presence of a weakened heart known abnormal heart rhythms that are very rapid even with a normal heart for example rapid ventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response undiagnosed cardiac conditions especially those known to be associated with sudden cardiac arrest obesity and hypertension exposure to drugs medications toxins and infectious agents including cocaine inhalants recreational or club drugs and some prescription medications sudden blow to the chest directly over the heart commotio cordis family history of known heart abnormalities sudden death before 50 years of age conditions known to cause sca such as long qt syndrome brugada syndrome catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cpvt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy arvc or other familial cardiomyopathies unexplained fainting or seizures if you have a family history of any of these conditions immediate family members should be checked out for those conditions known to be inherited or caused by a genetic mutation this can help you identify a condition early and possibly prevent sca or scd causes sudden cardiac arrest is usually caused by ventricular fibrillation vf an abnormality in the hearts electrical system vf causes the heart to quiver and blood flow to the body and brain to stop vf is not the same thing as a heart attack a heart attack results from a blockage in a coronary artery and subsequent damage to the heart muscle a heart attack can lead to sca sca may also be associated with a sudden stop of all electrical activity in the heart also called asystole it can also be associated with pulseless electrical activity pea a disorganized electrical activity that does not cause the heart to contract and pump blood sudden cardiac death in childhood is typically caused by different heart conditions than those causing the majority of scd in adults the most common causes of sca in children are structural cardiac abnormalities congenital heart diseases and postoperative repairs coronary artery anomalies or marfan syndromeabnormalities of the electrical system of the heart also known as primary electrical diseases such as long qt syndrome and wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome abnormalities of the heart muscle structure or function such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy arvc or dilated cardiomyopathies acquired heart disease inflammation or infection in the heartmyocarditisarrhythmias including atrial flutteratrial fibrillation ventricular tachycardia vt ventricular fibrillation vf sinus node dysfunction and complete heart block atherosclerotic coronary disease commotio cordis caused by a blow to the chestdruginduced scaconditions causing scd are typically not diagnosed prior to the arrest in many cases these conditions are inherited but family members are unaware of their family history symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest warning signs and symptoms do exist in 3050 percent of cases of scascd but are often ignored or misunderstood if your child has any of the warning signs or symptoms of sca make an immediate appointment with your pediatrician or take your child to the er if they appear distressed in any way warning signs and symptoms may include exercise related chest pain or discomfort unexplained fainting syncope or near fainting especially with or just after activity repeated episodes of unexplained fainting syncopehistory of recurrent fainting or unusual seizuresseizurelike activity especially with or just after activity dizziness or lightheadedness racing heart rate palpitations excessive fatigue or unexplained shortness of breath with exercise recent viral infection with chest pain or change in exercise tolerance history of a heart murmur whose cause has not been determined with certainty history of high blood pressure prior evaluation or treatment for a cardiac condition restriction from activity because of a cardiac issue in more than half of the cases of sca in children death was completely unexpected young people are often unaware of the risk factors and don’t tell adults when they experience the symptoms they may be frightened embarrassed or simply unaware that what they are feeling indicates a potentially fatal problem educating parents children and teenagers about the symptoms and risk factors of sca is one way to help prevent it diagnosis if your general pediatrician suspects your child is at risk for sca she might refer you to a pediatric cardiologist a doctor who specializes in heart problems in children a pediatric cardiologist will listen to your child’s heart and ask questions about the circumstances that led to the symptoms your child’s medical history and the family medical history the cardiologist will read an electrocardiogram ecg or ekg a record of the electrical activity of your child’s heart to determine whether a heart problem may be causing your childs symptoms your child’s cardiologist might order other tests such as an exercise stress test echocardiogram or chest xray you might be sent home with an ambulatory cardiac event monitor or a holter monitor to continuously record your childs heart rhythm for a specific length of time as she goes about her normal activities if your child has experienced one of the warning signs or symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest their pediatric cardiology evaluation may indicate a normal heart needing no further testing it could also result in further testing or follow up evaluations if needed treatment for sudden cardiac arrest sca requires immediate attention if your child suddenly collapses and does not immediately awaken call 911 and start cpr if an aed is available it should be applied the best chance of sca survival is prompt recognition and a planned emergency response with cpr and aed use if sudden cardiac arrest is not treated within minutes to establish a normal heart rhythm a person will die the heart is either quivering or has stopped completely and cannot pump blood effectively blood flow to the brain and body stops and death results if lifesustaining care is not provided chain of survival the chain of survival concept represents the sequence of five events that must occur quickly to optimize a persons chance of surviving a cardiac arrest the five links of the chain immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system early cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr with emphasis on chest compressions rapid defibrillation using an aed can establish a normal heart rhythm to a person suffering a cardiac arrest it is most effective when it is performed in the first few minutes of a cardiac arrest effective advanced life support integrated postcardiac arrest care how cpr works cpr manually pumps blood around the body and maintains the circulation allowing blood with oxygen to reach the body organs and brain until a normal heart beat can be restored handsonly cpr is most effective when performed right after the collapse and when an aed is also applied quickly cpr should continue until emergency medical services ems arrives and takes over unless the affected person has a return of normal circulation either spontaneously or after aed shock and is awake moving and breathing and alert and talking rescue breathing as part of cpr is recommended to be used by trained health professionals how aeds work the heart must be “defibrillated” quickly because a persons chance of surviving drops by 10 percent for each minute a normal heartbeat is not restored when the heart is in sudden cardiac arrest an aed can deliver an electrical shock through the chest which travels to the heart to halt the abnormal ineffective rhythm this enables a normal heart rhythm to resume aeds are safe for use by anyone who has been trained to use them as well as bystanders who follow instructions given by the devices studies have shown that sixthgraders briefly trained in aed use are able to correctly operate the device almost as quickly as emergency medical personnel broad deployment of aeds and increased bystander cpr could prevent as many as 50000 deaths each year in the united states that are caused by sca the current national survival from sca is 810 percent placing aeds in schools is a safe and effective way to increase survival rates to 6474 percent the children’s hospital of philadelphia’s youth heart watch program has a school aed program committed to making aeds available to all children and adolescents

defibrillator in a child or adolescent who has had a sca or is thought to be at risk for having a sca to prevent scd an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is a small computerized device with an energy source for defibrillation or pacing an icd has wires with electrodes on the ends that connect to your child’s heart chambers it can recognize a lifethreatening abnormal rhythm and provide an electrical shock that allows the normal rhythm to resume an icd is implanted following guidelines for children who have sustained a sca and survived or who are thought to be at high risk for such a cardiac event children who have received an icd for either reason may have these icds discharge to prevent scd prevention primary prevention primary prevention refers to methods used to prevent sudden cardiac arrest from occurring reducing the incidence and prevalence of sudden cardiac death requires identification of a predisposing condition and early intervention primary prevention includes evaluation of those with warning signs and symptoms or a positive family history identifying a heart condition or other risk factors allows for early intervention with medication lifestyle alterations and defibrillation devices the children’s hospital of philadelphia’s youth heart watch program performs primary prevention that conducts screenings in the community to identify young people with potentially serious heart problems learn more about the heart health screening study secondary prevention secondary prevention refers to methods used to prevent sudden cardiac death from occurring once someone has experienced a sudden cardiac arrest these methods include cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr use of an automated external defibrillator aed or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
