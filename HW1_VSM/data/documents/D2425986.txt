hands on alcatel fierce xl with windows 10 mobile review less fierce more friendly not yet rated by john mc cann 20160106t2257005z mobile phones what is a hands on review our early verdict the fierce xl with windows 10 mobile is only ever going to appeal to a small audience and while it provides a solid yet basic experience for many it doesnt do enough for solid design low cost slick interface against android version is better tmobile only poor front camera the alcatel fierce xl with windows 10 mobile wont be a handset which sweeps the nation rather itll likely only appeal to a small subset of consumers and alcatel is fine with that its exclusive to tmobile and there are currently over one million customers on the carrier who have a windows phone 7 or 8 device  devices which cant be upgraded to microsofts latest software windows 10 mobile that means there are windows fans with handsets running old software which is where the fierce xl comes in as you may already know alcatel already has an android variant of the phone under the same name out in the us  and the two handsets share a lot of the same specs and price alcatels first windows 10 phone is available to uncarrier customers with tmobiles interestfree financing for 13999 or 0 down 58423 months 567 for 24th month for that you get a 55inch hd display 11ghz quadcore processor 2gb of ram 16gb of internal storage micro sd slot 8mp rear camera and 2mp front facing camera thats not a bad line up of specs considering the price point the bright blue model i got hands on with is reminiscent of the lumia design language not to mention the i phone 5c too and it feels solid in the hand the shiny plastic offers little in the way of grip but its still pretty easy to handle even with its larger screen its a little on the chunky side at 96mm thick but at least the power and volume keys on the right fall nicely under finger at the end of the day its a functional design which is what you want from a budget handset the quadcore processor and 2gb of ram provide a decent slug of power and i found windows 10 mobile to be smooth and responsive with good app load times its not the perfect amount of power though as alcatel has had to drop microsofts continuum functionality from the handset as it doesnt have the grunt to run it continuum is a feature in windows 10 that allows you to use your phone as a windows computer when plugged into a monitor or screen using a special dock  but you wont be doing that with the fierce xl i found the 8mp rear camera was pretty good coping with the questionable lighting at the alcatel stand but the 2mp front camera is something to avoid its horribly grainy which will make your selfies suck if the alcatel fierce xl with windows 10 mobile takes your fancy you can preorder it now with stock arriving at the start of february early verdict for those wedded to microsofts ecosystem but currently stuck on windows phone 7 or 8 the fierce xl with windows 10 mobile is an affordable way to keep your smartphone in line with your computer and xbox those who havent bought into microsofts world however will likely find themselves drawn to the android variant of the handset which can boast a wider range of apps  or to a completely different brand the alcatel fierce xl with windows 10 mobile is only ever going to appeal to a small audience and while it provides a solid yet basic experience for many it doesnt do enough what is a hands on review hands on reviews are a journalists first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it it may be just a few moments or a few hours the important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what its like to use even if its only an embryonic view for more information see tech radars reviews guarantee
