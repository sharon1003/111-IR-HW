introducing the maxillary labial frenulum thoughts on breastfeeding with an upper labial tie if your baby is struggling to latch properly and its all a bit of a mystery it might be worth checking for an upper labial tie currently there isnt much information about upper labial ties and breastfeeding so i have done my best to piece together the research i have found in the hope that someone will find it useful some of the information i have included is from my own experience of feeding my own 4 children all of whom have upper labial ties what is an upper labial tie inside your mouth there is a small fold of tissue which runs between your upper lip and gum you can feel it with your tongue this is called the maxillary labial frenulum or frenum most people have no significant frenulum attachment 1 but sometimes this frenulum attaches further down the gum or runs between the front teeth and attaches behind them causing restricted movement of the upper lip its similar to tongue tie but involving the upper lip and gum instead an upper labial tie can occur on its own or in conjunction with a tongue tie 2 its also possible to have a lower labial tie involving the bottom lip and gum the quickest and easiest way to find out whether a baby has an upper labial tie is to lift up his upper lip and have a lookmost babies will have no significant frenulum attachment 1image reproduced with kind permission from dr lawrence kotlow dds pcsome babies will have a maxillary frenulum which attaches into the gum above the front teeth this is not normally a problem as there should still be enough upper lip mobility in order to achieve a good latchimages reproduced with kind permission from dr lawrence kotlow dds pcin some babies the maxillary frenulum attaches just in front of the anterior papilla thats the small bump of tissue on the upper gum just behind the area where the upper front teeth grow 2images reproduced with kind permission from dr lawrence kotlow dds pcsome babies mine included will have a maxillary frenulum which attaches into the papilla the small bump of tissue just behind the area where the upper front teeth grow and extends into the hard palate behind the front teeth 2images reproduced with kind permission from dr lawrence kotlow dds pcit is very important to understand  the tightness of the frenulum can vary and the degree of tightness can make a major difference as to any consequences  3my childrens dentist dr chris caldwell has the following tip if your baby has an upper labial tie lift up his upper lip stretching the frenulum if the papilla blanches when you do this the upper labial tie is likely to be a significant problem healthcare professionals working with breastfeeding mothers and babies tell me upper labial ties are uncommon is this simply because we arent checking for them my childrens dentist disagrees theyre fairly common though theyre not usually severe enough to cause major problems how might an upper labial tie affect breastfeeding because an upper labial tie restricts movement of the upper lip it may be difficult for the baby to latch effectively to the breast 34 once latched onto the breast the babys upper lip may be tucked inwards resulting in a shallow latch 5 the baby may be a clicky feeder who takes in a lot of air during a feed breastfeeding may be painful for the mother an older babys upper teeth may dig into the breast during a feed causing indentations or damage some babies will be able to breastfeed with an upper labial tie others will have difficulty the ability to breastfeed effectively depends on a range of other factors also affecting the mother eg breast anatomy milk supply and the baby eg oral anatomy all of which may create further obstacles or make breastfeeding easier ideas for improving the latch of a baby with an upper labial tie if your baby has an upper labial tie and you are struggling with breastfeeding seek help from a qualified breastfeeding specialist such as a breastfeeding counsellor or lactation consultant the first step is to work on optimising the babys latch in order to improve milk transfer for some babies this may be all that is needed to breastfeed successfully in the hope that someone somewhere will find this information useful i am sharing ways of overcoming an upper labial tie which worked for me and my babies a baby with an upper labial tie needs to be encouraged to accept the breast more deeply in his mouth after much experimenting with more traditionallytaught breastfeeding holds such as the crosscradle hold  i initially found a variation of a technique called exaggerated attachment adapted from 6 yielded some success cup your breast underneath with your hand if youre using your right hand your right hand cups your right breast use your thumb to tilt your nipple back so it points away from the babys nose this makes the breast under the nipple bulge forwards when the baby gapes his bottom lip and chin should come into contact with the breast first using your thumb quickly roll your nipple forward into the roof of the babys mouth then as you take your thumb away lift your thumb to catch the babys upper lip and gently flick it outwards ive done my best to demonstrate this latching technique below please excuse the change of holds part way through  its hard to get good clear photos of a baby latching on although this technique helped my baby to stay on the breast we still experienced slow weight gain which improved after we learnt breast compressions using a laidback or biological nurturing position marked a major breastfeeding breakthrough for us catherine watson genna bs ibclc suggests that  increasing head extension will allow the infant to grasp the breast sufficiently  4  i have noticed that this is naturally encouraged through selfattachment to the breast in a biological nurturing position biological nurturing coupled with very frequent ondemand feeds resulted in successful breastfeeding for us despite an almost embarrassingly imperfect latch and as my baby grew bigger his ability to latch vastly improved what if im considering having my babys upper labial tie divided because of the way the human face develops in the womb an upper labial tie can occur on its own or in conjunction with a posterior tongue tie if your baby has an upper labial tie and you are debating whether it is the cause of any breastfeeding problems it is worth getting someone to check for tongue tie in some cases dividing the tongue tie may resolve the feeding issues in the uk its not easy to find a practitioner who will divide a babys upper labial tie people who may be able to help you find a practitioner with the skills to divide a babys upper labial tie includea lactation consultant ibclcthe infant feeding coordinator at your hospitala paediatric dentista university dental school it is worth considering that the procedure involved in dividing an upper labial tie is different to tongue tie division and may require general anaesthetic this really does depend on the skills of the practitioner carrying out the procedure some will prefer to use a laser for the division others may be more confident using a scalpel further information about the division of upper labial ties can be found here dr lawrence a kotlow dds pc  articles dr brian palmer dds  frenum presentation dr brian palmer dds  breastfeeding and frenulumsplease note these are nonuk links the decision to divide an upper labial tie is an individual one based on evaluating the severity of the tie whether it is impacting on breastfeeding and whether it is possible to find a practitioner who will divide the tie what is the evidence suggesting that lip tie division is of any benefit to breastfeeding in addition to the websites above i have found just one journal article suggesting that the division of an upper labial tie might benefit breastfeeding it is a case report of one baby whose latching difficulties remained unresolved after a tongue tie division but was able to breastfeed successfully after an upper labial tie division the rest of the evidence is anecdotal spanjer p 2000 what a difference a day makes la leche league 2009 lip tie clipping heidiopolis 2009 breastfeeding update a nurse who knits unsure whether lip tie clipping was helpful 2011 the trouble with frenulums and the last snip becoming daizee not yet clear whether lip tie division was successful 2011 tongue tie qa and micahs first perfect latch the mommypotamus the lack of documented supporting evidence is likely a result of lack of funding to undertake research in this area coupled with a lack of awareness that an upper labial tie can affect breastfeeding and a lack of skills to divide an infants labial tie i wonder how many mothers have ended up bottle feeding as a result of an upper labial tie what could other impacts be of not having my babys upper lip tie divided there are no medical or dental benefits of having a tight  labial frenulum there are many major medical and dental consequences that result from tight frenulums 3 these consequences very much depend on the severity of the tie apart from breastfeeding problems an upper labial tie has been linked withhaving a gap between the two front teeth 24poor lip mobility affecting smiling and speech 2increased dental decay on the upper front teeth 2good dental hygiene is of particular importance for a baby with an upper labial tie although breastfeeding alone may not cause tooth decay  breastfeeding in conjunction with an abnormal maxillary frenulum attachment may be a contributing cause of tooth decay in a breastfeeding infant 7 this may be because the area around the upper labial tie is difficult to clean so food particles remain trapped in the oral mucosa a study undertaken in 1999 found that although human breastmilk did not cause tooth decay adding a small amount of sugar to breastmilk did cause tooth decay 8 therefore it would be wise for children with an upper labial tie to avoid sugary foods which in conjunction with breastmilk might accelerate tooth decay there is some evidence suggesting a link between childhood tooth decay and low levels of vitamin d 9 breastmilk is naturally low in vitamin d so vitamin d supplementation may be a consideration for a breastfed baby with an upper labial tie an upper labial tie can cause dental issues later on so even if you decide against having the procedure done in infancy your childs dentist may suggest dividing the upper labial tie when your child is older tight frenulums rarely go away by themselves 3 however they can sometimes break my eldest child accidentally tore hers on a badlyaimed dinner fork and one of my sons fell and tore his in the skate park my two youngest sons also have severe upper labial ties despite overcoming the obstacle of their upper labial ties without having them divided and breastfeeding them both successfully i probably wont be able to help that momentary feeling of having been just a little bit shortchanged if im told a division is necessary in future last edited 150911references 1 kotlow l 2006 diagnosis

mouth she had a large gap about half an inch between her front teeth and was loosing weight her latch was painful and she was tabled families to thrive at 3 months old it got tighter as she grew wevhad a referal to an ent and in january it was clipped now she has no hint of a gap and great latch i did have to watch her upper lip for a while and flip it for about a week now its only an issue if she latched when tired and is gaining again she is finally 22lbs at 18 months reply anonymous 27 march 2011 at 1928thank you so much for posting this i recently had my 11 month old sonss upper liptie taken care of i saw two lactation consultants several months apart who missed this problem as the cause for my sons shallow painful latch i even carried a print off of dr kotlows article with me to one of the appointments it is fairly easy to see if this is affecting your baby if so be persistent in getting the help you need my sons latch has not improved drastically but it is better than it was this should have been caught much earlier reply anonymous 27 march 2011 at 2049wow this is just what my daughter had then one day i tripped while carrying her and she landed spat on her face and ripped it apart a lot of blood but thinking about it afterwards breastfeeding was much easier and less uncomfortable id always used the technique youd suggested i sort of developed it by myself as the best way to get her attached after the accident she began latching on by herself id never thought that the two things might be related reply sheila 28 march 2011 at 1232my son and i both have this and both have a gap between our front teeth because of it its not severe in either of our cases  i had no problems breastfeeding and he had some problems but im not sure how much could be blamed on the lip tie and how much on the horrible help i got in the hospital he nurses fine now at a year old sometimes his lip does get tucked in  in fact usually  but it doesnt seem to give him trouble nursing shrug ill be more aware of this in my next children and be sure to flip their upper lips out early on reply anonymous 8 april 2011 at 1209omg thankyou for this article my dd has this and i only picked it up after comming across this article on fb no health proffessionals had even checked and we have had bf probs and she has a big gap feel so good knowing the cause but pissed it took me to discover it not her dr or midwife or early childhood nurse they obviously didnt do a very thorough dental check at her 6 month appointment as hers is quite severe thankyou reply anonymous 14 april 2011 at 1245how did the lip tie affect the teething process my little girl 11mths has a severe lip tie she is having an operation under ga in the near future however she is currently teething hand has shown a quite sever reaction to it there is a bout a 6mm gap between her front teeth and my theory is that this gap is shunting the other teeth along under gums and causing the extra pain any advice reply annemarie 19 april 2011 at 2204hi anonymous the only way the lip tie seemed to affect teething with my children was after their upper front teeth came through i noticed that they would dig into my breast progressively not biting  this is different during a feed leaving indentations in my skin it would be a good idea to voice the concerns you have with your childs dentist who would be more qualified to help and advise you regarding dental issues arising from an upper labial tie i hope shes not too miserable with the teething  i hope the op goes well amreplygespenst 7 may 2011 at 1311great post ive bookmarked it and posted the link on my fb my younger daughter had a lip and tongue tie and saw dr kotlow for treatment she was a very pokey eater in the early days which was probably exacerbated by my switching breasts during feedings i have oversupply and block fed w my older daughter  but when a feeding takes 45 minutes its hard to stay on one breast after the laser division around 10 weeks her latch was better and i started block feedings and the bfing experience was much more pleasant and efficient my motherinlaws family has the family teeth  gap between the front teeth and i suspect this is due to a tie my husband has tongue tie lucky daughter got both  thanks mominlaw lol i hope that with the tie divided my daughters adult teeth will be closer together her baby teeth have the gap but i suspect well be regulars at the orthodontist i have noticed she rests her teeth on the breast leaving the gaptoothed dents but older daughter also did this wo a frenum thanks again  spencer reply paula 7 may 2011 at 1530hi im an ibclc and wondering if i can have permission to use some of your information in particular your step by step guide and your photos crediting you of course let me know what you think paulasantilcgmailcom reply katherine 8 may 2011 at 0110great post i have been working with breastfeeding women for 14 years i too would love permission to use your information giving you credit katherine breastfeedingessentialsgmailcom reply beth m 11 may 2011 at 0343now im wondering if this was one of my problems with my daughter now 4 years old breastfeeding was very painful for the first 3 months  i had badly cracked nipples she clicked while feeding and multiple lll leaders and an ibclc couldnt figure out what the problem was i eventually attributed it to flat nipples and oversupply making it difficult for her to latch on correctly my son had some of the same problems definitely flat nipples and oversupply but without the clicking and the problems were solved a lot faster ill have to take a look in my daughters mouth when she wakes up in the morningreply mk 10 june 2011 at 2326my son has this too is funny i didnt know anything about it just didnt think much about it or looking into it thankfully we had no problems anyway a week or so ago someone posted about it in a group and now i see this good info though so glad i saw itreply miriam 13 june 2011 at 1626i knew nothing about this until yesterday and it turns out my 18 month old son has a pretty severe lip tie it runs between his front teeth and he wont let me look further but i would assume attaches to the palate behind the teeth we struggled a lot in the early months with a painful shallow latch and clicking which i attributed to my oversupply and strong letdown many of our symptoms sounded similar to tongue tie but he just does not look like he has a tongue tie at all we both cried and screamed through a lot of nursing sessions with him refusing to latch sometimes for up to 45 minutes before finally getting so hungry he gave in and did his best things improved around 1012 weeks and were ok for a few months until his teeth started coming in and we are back to the same problems at 18 months im sure he would love to nurse more but we are down to twice a day because thats all i can tolerate of his latch even with the above latching technique which is pretty similar to what i eventually figured out on my own i so wish we had had the money to see a good lactation consultant early on because we soldiered through everything on our own and it could have been so much better replythe funnyshaped woman 14 june 2011 at 1238hi miriam thank you for commenting you are not alone i remember feeling exactly the same way when my dentist noticed my eldest 3 children all had lip ties my 3rd child was hardest to breastfeed by quite a long way even though 2 of my other children also have posterior tongue ties we mothers can only ever do the best we can based on the information and support we have at the time  and you have done an amazing job of overcoming this on your own congratulations amreply anonymous 18 july 2011 at 1625after only making it 6 weeks with my daughter now 25 years old and then having the same major issues nursing my now 8 week old son i got very excited when he and subsequently she was diagnosed with an upper labial tie and its pretty thick and very low on the gum terrible latch and lots of pain for mom so now we are stuck with what to do about it ent says wait and see and switch to formula dentist says it can be lasered but it may have little to no effect on the latch and id have to wait almost 4 weeks to find out decisions decisions breastfeeding has been an awful experience with both kids should i wait it out and hope the procedure improves things im very ready to quit like todayreplythe funnyshaped woman 18 july 2011 at 1738hi anonymous so sorry to hear youre having problems with feeding  ive been there the very best thing you can do for your breastfeeding relationship is to seek out a lactation consultant look for the letters ibclc after their name who will be able to check whether your baby also has a posterior tongue tie not always obvious and a high palate as well which sometimes occur alongside a labial tie they will also be able to assist you with moving forward with your breastfeeding relationship if your ent is suggesting switching to infant formula this rather suggests to me that your ent isnt very well informed or supportive about breastfeeding and doesnt want to deal with the problem there is no guarantee that the baby will latch well onto a bottle if he is having trouble at the breast it might solve one problem but create others as im sure you are well aware breastfeeding should be an enjoyable experience so i really feel for you it is worth fighting for that enjoyable experience so if you think the procedure would make a difference its well worth making some noise and getting something done about it after all these professionals are your hired help  if you end up losing your breastfeeding relationship because they arent taking you seriously they havent done their jobs properly to be perfectly blunt about it in the meantime i sincerely hope you find the help and support you need please do contact a breastfeeding specialist and are finally able to enjoy your breastfeeding relationship ill be thinking of you amreply anonymous 6 september 2011 at 1731thank you for posting your hard work on this site i have sent a link through to a tonguetie group because of your emphasis on liptie many parents struggle getting recognition and it helps to add your experiences in their battle to gain medical support reply jolene sg 14 september 2011 at 1454wow youve filled in so many pieces of my story i completely did the roll instyle latch that you described with my oldest child as he could not achieve a good latch we i was fobbed off by my hp about his tongue tie and had not even heard of upper labial tie back then our youngest child also has tongue tie and upper labial tie i had heard of biological nurturing when he was born and for us it made all the difference reply anonymous 14 september 2011 at 1630fascinating and useful for my work with breastfeeding women i had this and though it didnt stop me breastfeeding it did give me a big gap between my teeth it was snipped with local anaesthetic when i was about 8 which solved the gap problem thanks aphreply anonymous 17 september 2011 at 0030do you know where i can get it divided dd has a small tt that was evaluated by ibclc who said it did not need removing she was 10 months old when seen but after seeing this page i had a look and found she has the most severe type of labial frenulum im sure shell need it removed to correct the large gap is it better if done earlier i dont think it is impacting breastfeeding where can i find someone who will remove it reply jamie 18 september 2011 at 0535i want to thank you for this information i have never seen or heard of this before and i have done extensive research on nursing problems since my son had trouble in the beginning and was loosing weight i was convinced that i was selfishly sleeping and neglecting feeding him properly his doctor was no help eventually we over came our problem on our own although he still latches very shallowly sometimes and i feel sore in the mornings when hes been nursing all night i even saw a lactation consultant who couldnt help me and i eventually developed a latching technique similar to the one you picture in this blog i questioned the way his frenulum looked very early on but my husband was convinced that it was normal and i was just reaching for things to blame his weight loss on now that i know this is a problem and i think a pretty severe one although it could be worse im going to take him to a pediatric dentist for a consult i have also shared this link on my facebook and breastfeeding support forum int he hopes that someone will be helped by it before they go through the weeks of guilt and sobbing thank you replythe funnyshaped woman 18 september 2011 at 2239hi anonymous im afraid you havent given me much of a clue where you live so i cant really make a specific suggestion about who could divide the tie for you it might be a good idea to contact the ibclc you saw about the tt originally as they may have contacts who can help you alternatively i make some further suggestions in the article above to help you find someone with the skills to evaluate and divide the tie if necessary i hope that helps amreply anonymous 2 october 2011 at 1940i am so glad that i found this article i live in the u s and have two dd both with very thick labial frenulums nursing was very rough and with my first daughter i switched to formula at 2 weeks from failure to gain weight my second daughter i had the same issues very sorecracked nipples 45 feeding sessions and still failure to gain weight with her we had to supplement formula at 8 weeks and i ended up producing less and less until we had to switch to full time formula i asked the lactation consultant and doctors about this and no one was familiar with it they all said that it would not interfere with nursing i am currently pregnant and on a mission to make this breastfeeding relationship work i am hoping that if this baby has a thick labial frenulum we can get it cut shortly after birth if it is not a major procedure i have contacted a couple of ents and they say they can do the procedure i am just not sure if it is a quick snip or something that will be a little more in depth the nurse at the ent office seemed to think it would be quick has anyone had any experience with having it clipped right after birth thank you again for posting this very helpful reply erin 4 november 2011 at 1455thank you so much for this info i have just heard about this today but looking at all three of my boys ive realized they all have pretty severe labial frenulums do you think theres a correlation between this and reflux my boys all broke their latch quite frequently made clicking noises while feeding and swallowed a ton of air  nothing made this better eliminated dairy chiropractic adjustments change in latchfeeding techniques and now im guessing this is the culprit any thoughts thanks so much such great inforeplythe funnyshaped woman 8 november 2011 at 2108hi erin it might be worth checking your boys for posterior tongue tie also as i pointed out in the article an upper labial tie and a tongue tie can sometimes occur together which might help further explain your boys latching difficulties theres a small but growing group of breastfeeding professionals who believe there is a possible link between tongue tie and reflux however researchbased evidence to prove this link is currently lacking amreply beth 12 january 2012 at 1639wow so glad i found this article my daughter is five weeks old and i have been wondering why her upper lip wouldnt flip out i didnt even realize an upper labial tie was possible however she is gaining weight well and even though she sometimes is a clicky feeder it is not painful for me and she continues to gain weight something for the moms out there to think about before correcting an upper labial tie i have one as well mine is actually the worst one which is the maxillary frenulum i was bottle fed and while i had a small gap in my teeth as a child it went away when my permanent teeth came in and i never had any problems with speech or smiling just something to think about before having a procedure done on your babyreply anonymous 26 january 2012 at 2128hi thank you for this really useful information i only recently found out by chance that my son who is now 22 months has upper labial tie while we was laughing  i cant believe i havent noticed this before breastfeeding for the first 8 weeks was a real hell  cracked nipples and slow weight gain tears  my son was very unsettled on the breast coming on and off all the time i nearly gave up when suddenly my pain started to ease down after 8 weeks i am still breastfeeding and its fine now but his latch has always been very shallow id like to make one comment and ask a question too 1 i saw around 68 different midwivesbreastfeeding consultants 23 health visitors 2 gps and no one checked if he had upper labial tie how can this be possible all this pain for all these women and no one is aware of this issue a few were aware of tonguetie and checked my son for this but the upper lip was ignored i dont think there is any information on this on la leche league either and i will be writing to them too i think checking for this and tongue tie should be part of the standard checks at the hospital once the baby is born 2 are you aware if there are any associated problems with eating solid foods if the child has upper labial tie my son is a fussy eater and i wonder if this could be a problem he doesnt have problems with talking at all though i am taking my son to a pediatrician soon for this problem thank you very much again k london replythe funnyshaped woman 26 january 2012 at 2156hi anonymous thank you for commenting babies are not usually checked for lip ties i think this is because few people know about them this is the only article ive found on the la leche league website regarding lip ties httpwwwlalecheleagueorgnbnbsepoct00p161html i am not aware of any links between lip ties and problems eating solid foods with regard to fussy eaters you may find it useful to read

fantastic everything makes sense and i feel better now about my sons eating i was sort of following his method after speaking to a health visitor and there was definitely change there he also explains really well why breastfeeding on demand is so much more suited to babies and what the disadvantages of scheduled breastfeeding are thank you again ive recommended it to quite a few people now k

my babys upper lip tie and felt so shocked that i had never noticed it before she has always had a wimpy latch with lots of sucking sounds during breastfeeding but after the first month her weight gain was on track so i didnt worry about it but now it makes so much sense no wonder her upper lip never seemed to flair out i feel like such a fool now im trying to find a local doctor or dentist to look at it thanks again reply anonymous 15 february 2012 at 1848my son is 12 months old and has a severe liptie as well as a tonguetie i felt the same way many of these other mothers have he was bottle fed from the start but had a terrible latch was messy and wasted more milk than he ate he also suffered from reflux due to all the air he was taking in as a mother i felt something just wasnt right but no one seemed to notice it but me i was the one who brought attention to his tongue and lip not the pediatrician so we were sent to an ent who now is going to clip both its strange that there is so much info on tonguetie but not on the liptie thanks so much for all your helpful informationreply anonymous 19 march 2012 at 1753thank you so much for this article my daughter is 5 months old and has never been able to breastfeed effectively we have seen lactation consultants a speech therapist and an ent dr and not one of them checked for a liptie the ent said she had a slight tongue tie which he clipped and a slightly high palate after i read this i called his office and scheduled an appt for asap and he is going to check it out i finally feel a bit of hope after almost giving up thank you thank you reply bethika 29 march 2012 at 1810thank you for such an informative post best post out there for information and photos you helped me a lot when i was struggling with this issue we had a subtle tonguetie which getting that clipped helped bring the pain level for me from excruciating to bearable discomfort it was still uncomfortable the upper lip was not out and the slightest touch to my breast would break the latch getting the lip tie clipped was a hard choice to make but was so worth it i felt my letdown for the first time ever after having that procedure done it grew back a little since we had it snipped not lasered but its still workable for us i wanted to post to share my little clue about the easytobreak latch as part of how we figured out what was going on i think he was 15 weeks when we got it taken care of reply helen 6 april 2012 at 0834thank you so much for this blog i have had terrible difficulties breastfeeding both of my children both have upper lip ties and both seem to have posterior tongue ties i say seem to as it is very hard to find anyone to actually assess this properly my son actually had his tt snipped twice but it regrew i managed to keep breastfeeding despite these things but its always been uncomfortable and both of them were really windy feeders and suffered from reflux my son is now 11 months  his feeding had improved but now that his teeth are through it has become quite painful for me again i just cant get him to attach well he doesnt open his mouth wide enough doesnt put his tongue over his bottom teeth and doesnt flare his top lip we are in the difficult position of trying to decide whether to pursue another tongue tie and possibly a lip tie division reply anonymous 19 april 2012 at 0126i just noticed today while my 19 month old was sleeping with her head back on my lap that her upper lip is attached to her gums right between her teeth not sure how far back it goes we never had problems breastfeeding although i would say she was clicky and strongly prefered certain postions she also has no gap between her baby teeth does anyone know if her speech could be affected reply anonymous 2 june 2012 at 0224thank you for this article do you have any recommendations for bottle brands that work best for babies with this problem when my son goes to daycare he will need to take pumped breast milk in a

site and inforeply jessica autrey 12 october 2012 at 0103what a great article thank you for sharing this i want to share it with everyone i had a visit with a wonderful ibclc who pointed out my sons upper lip tie this is my fourth baby and the first i have been able to nurse 100 my first ended up in the hospital at 5 days for dehydration my second started formula after only two days when my nipples were cracked and bleeding and his latch looked fine he would scream and refuse to latch so i just couldnt handle it emotionally my third child i was determined to breastfeed because the first two had formula sensitivities and vomited all the time i ended up using the medela sns to supplement at the breast from 213 months when she could drink regular milk her latch was always pretty terrible though it looked fine to the lactation consultant i always had pain rarely felt letdown and i did have tooth indentations on my breasts after learning about my babys tie i checked the other kids and found the tie in the middle two but i wonder if my oldests tore i also have evidence of a tear in mine and my mom had trouble breastfeeding me i have gone back and forth with the idea of having anything done about this babys tie he is gaining well but his latch is uncomfortable for me and he doesnt stay latched well and swallows lots of air i am trying to stretch it out a bit but i dont know if it will help i hope we can somehow raise awareness of this issue maybe we will find it much more common that is believed and with support more mothers will be able to overcome this obstacle to breastfeed their babies reply anonymous 19 october 2012 at 0300wo w my 2 month old has lip tie i never knew now i understand why he clicks and takes in air does not have a strong latch and i always have to flange his lip out with my fingers thankfully he is getting plenty of milk and gaining weight without problem thank you so much for this information i am going to try the biological nurturing position reply cee bass 9 november 2012 at 0059thank you so so much for this information it makes me quite upset to think that just like one of the many issues i suffered from during my nightmare pregnancy lip tie is yet another condition that is not really recognised here in the uk im really upset on behalf of myself and my 4½ month old son and everyone else suffering as a result of this condition my sons tongue tie was identified and dealt with at three weeks old but not what i now understand to be his lip tie no wonder breastfeeding is still really painful for me after 20 weeks also im wondering if this explains his reflux and to think my own mother who were temporarily staying with is a health visitor and has never even heard of it or doesnt believe its really an issue cant tell which reply stephanie  steven 30 november 2012 at 0724hi im almost positive my son has a lip tie do you have an email i can send you a picture to so you can give me advice id greatly appreciate

i am wondering why no doctor nurse lactation consultant saw this before   i have one breast with inverted nipple she couldnt latch on that one it was a nightmare the pain the bleeding the pumping 15 minute of every hour for 3 days i ended up breastfeeding her on one side only even if it felt like i had milk in the other breast she was always below 25 in weight and waking up hungry at night i tried the sleep training 34 times it didnt really work i just knew that my baby was hungry when i supplemented with formula she vomited i was always wondering why we cannot see her top teeth when she smiles i will call tomorrow around and see if we can get this taken care of thanks again reply warren thompson 4 march 2013 at 0712thank you for such an informative post best post out there for information and photos you helped me a lot when i was struggling with this issue we had a subtle tonguetie which getting that clipped helped bring the pain level for me from excruciating to bearable discomfort it was still uncomfortable the upper lip was not out and the slightest touch to my breast would break the latch cosmetic dentist las vegas reply l lochard 29 august 2013 at 0503thank you so much for taking the time to share this information i really struggled with breast feeding my daughter when we started and we finally were able to succeed with a nipple shield for 10 months we went like this and i had no idea why she would not latch any better then she was we discovered when her teeth started coming in that she had a labial lip tie she would scream bloody murder when we tried to lift her lip to look at it one of her pediatricians said that it had nothing to do with our nursing problems but i disagreed so i asked for a referral i saw an ent and made it pretty clear that i wanted it corrected well my daughter 5 days from her 1st birthday had a labial frenulectomy i was very afraid of what would happen to our nursing relationship after surgery when she came out of surgery i sat down to let her latch on and she took right away with nipple shield still and nursed with a force i had never felt before the last 2 days have been fantastic with nursing the ent said that it was a very good thing we went ahead with this surgery when we did because her band was very thick i know there is not much information out there regarding a lip tie but because of this i have becoming an outspoken voice for it with my lactation consultant she also was very grateful for your article this is something she will now keep an eye out for if a tongue tie is not the issue i am so thankful that her father and i decided to pursue this surgery thank you againreply anonymous 22 october 2013 at 2135thank you for the article my son is 9 moths old now never had weight problems but i had very painful nursing experience  i̇ was sure i was doing everything right but still the latch was weird his sucking was very strong and he nursed for a very prolonged time like 45 minutes each side and since it hurt like hell couldnt take it more than that so i switched sides which i knew i shouldt because of the formilkhindmilk ratio but i couldnt stand the pain because of switching sides at every feed for months he pooped 1014 times per day and always with a lot of gas and froth and i have to say i too developed your technique for estanlishing a latch the pictures above could have been mine  i never realized what the problem was sadly it took me months to link the ult to poor latch cause i had seen it even asked a friend if that seemed normal  she said all children have that  by now my son is doing fine weight gain is above normal my breasts healed ever since we established a somewhat reasonable latch breasfeeding continues so i dont think we need the revision right away
