one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no report abuse tony d50 out of 5 stars great economical thermostat and customer service january 9 2013verified purchase excellent price and received quickly from andy at atwin77383 in a condo with central air and hot water heat had the old honeywell mercury type with 4 wires this hunter 44155c is about 6 bucks more in price to the honeywell rth221 but the hunter has more features instead of 4 daily programs for 7 days this hunter is 4 x 5 and 2 days this hunter also has a span control to increase or reduce cycle it also has a backlite by pressing a button for checking temp in dark had one issue the ac would come on with the heat verified the wiring and called customer service the lady advised me to to change the default setting of hg to he since my hot water heat is controlled by an electric solenoid valve told her id change it and if i still had a problem id call her back spoke to her about one minute after switching to he and checking out the heat and air everything was fine hg is for gas heat he is for electric and also hot water controlled by an electric solenoid excellent troubleshooting and advice
