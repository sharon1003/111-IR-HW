michigan attorney enjoying my old age and winters in bonita springs like many residents i belong to a golf group all of which members are retired often during a round in contrast to discussing individual ailments legal issues become the topic of conversation and generally encompass what i would refer to as basic estate planning one such issue addressed was the utilization of entitling real estate ownership among named grantees with rights of survivorship as a common method of avoiding probate i voiced my opinion that this assumptions was partially correct the first to die would not require probate however assuming no changes in title were made after the first to die the death of that survivor would require probate i have since been appraised that florida has a lady bird proviso which i am not familiar with that may alter my aforementioned opinion i should learn to keep my opinions to myself especially in jurisdictions of unfamiliarity please explain the lady bird proviso answer the lady bird proviso is a relatively recent addition to the florida estate planning arsenal it is technically known as an enhanced life estate deed but is often referred to as a lady bird deed the deed is reputed to have obtained that name because former president lyndon johnson used that type of deed to transfer property to his wife lady bird johnson lady bird deeds are not officially recognized by statute but have been used throughout florida by estate planning practitioners a traditional life estate deed grants someone ownership for his or her life after which title passes to a second person known as the remainderman the person owning the property for life cannot deed it or mortgage it without addressing the interest of the remainderman although the remainderman does not own the property immediately he or she has a vested interest that ripens to ownership on death of the life estate holder for that reason it will be difficult to find any lender willing to lend with a mortgage secured by the property unless the remainderman also joins in the mortgage similarly few would be willing to pay for the right to own a property during whatever is left of the life estate owners lifetime life estate deeds have been used as part of an estate plan by some who want to avoid wills or trusts they are part of a plan under which children or beneficiaries are added as payableondeath beneficiary to financial accounts and retirement plans and ultimately added as remainderman through deed of a life estate to the owner with remainder to the children the traditional life estate deed carried with it problems if the remaindermen die before the life estate owner there would be no remainderman to take title without probate if the property owner did not have a will the property would pass in accordance with floridas intestates laws and might end up in the hands of relatives contrary to what the owner would have wanted the lady bird deed addresses one problem in the lady bird deed the owner reserves the right to convey or mortgage the property without joinder of the remainderman that provides the owner flexibility during the owners life but still an automatic transfer to the remainderman at the owners death the lady bird deed does not solve the problem of no living remainderman because the lady bird does not solve all of the shortcomings in the traditional life estate deed we generally recommend use of a living trust to avoid probate the trust provides that the owner can deal with property in the trust in any way the owner desires during the owners lifetime and provides for distribution at the owners death because the assets are in a trust they do not go to probate and if all of the owners assets are placed in the trust changing the distribution plan is a simple matter of modifying the trust as opposed to modifying a deed to real estate or payableon death designation of various accounts use of a living trust avoids other problems with the lady bird or life estate deed one problem is where the remainderman is less than all of the owners children although lady bird deeds are insurable by title insurers generally where some children are excluded as remainderman title insurers will not generally insured title from those deeds the basis for refusal is that when one child is favored over another suit alleging undue influence is often the result another drawback to the lady bird deed is the possibility that a creditor claim or judgment against a remainderman may cloud the title even before the owner of the life estate dies it might seem that a judgment against the remainderman should only attach when the remainderman actually takes title but title insurance companies in florida believe that such liens attach to the property immediately and therefore will not issue title insurance policies excluding the lien i am unaware of any florida court decision to the contrary the lady bird deed is an option for those wishing to avoid probate it has the benefit of allowing the owner to have full use of the property and retains the right to sell or mortgage but it is not without problems and in most situations a revocable living trust would be a preferable alternative for these reasons discussion with an experienced estate planning attorney is always a good idea as part of the estate planning process by william g
