all but their own that is a major part of s t a l k e r shadow of chernobyl and s t a l k e r call of pripyat and appears in a supporting role in s t a l k e r clear sky  contents  showoverview edit“ this group displays many features of a religious sect its members believe in the existence of a complex alien crystal the monolith located somewhere in the center of the zone most stalkers treat monolith adepts with contempt and consider them as lunatics from its inception the group strives to block all progress towards the center of the zone protecting the monolith from other stalkers rumor has it that the group has a large base deep in the zone but its exact location is known only by the members shadow of chernobyl pda description”a religious cult that is hostile to all but their own the monolithians believe in the power of the wish granter rumored to be an alien artifact hidden in the center of the zone members of this faction devote their lives to protecting the secret of the great crystal ensuring that no one ever reaches the center of the zone a typical monolithian is a former stalker brainwashed by one of the psychic emitters throughout the zone namely the brain scorcher into serving the will of the cconsciousness unflinchingly loyal and ready to sacrifice himself at a moments notice this extreme loyalty is achieved by creating intense religious fanaticism in the mind of the stalker directed towards the monolith while physically they are on par with other stalkers their religious fervor sets them apart and allows them to ignore wounds and continue to fight even after they run out of ammo stories abound of fanatical monolith stalkers after running out of ammo ditch their weapons and attempt to kill the enemy with their bare hands no matter how grievous their wounds 1 2  this same fervor also prevents others from capturing a monolith member – if taken into custody he will commit suicide in any way possible even by smashing his head against the wall 3  major degtyarev examining one of the monolith antenna in the pripyat bookstore the monolith can also uplink themselves to the cconsciousness through something known as a monolith statue a radar antenna covered with garbage to form a statue monolithians kneel in front of it and enter a trance involving head nodding and swaying and will ignore almost anything around them even gunshots the monolith fighter and rarely idle monolith stalkers can be found in the same trance but without the use of the statue possibly attempting to call upon the monolith for guidance effects of mind control edit unfortunately the same mind control that makes them fierce warriors also erodes their humanity strider and the preacher both exhibit a completely flat personality and suffer from a monotone speech impediment and strider himself has a poor grasp of language other rogue monolithians under striders command have difficulty communicating and tend to speak in halting jerky sentences although this is no longer the case once recruited however the case of strelok who fully retained his personality and speech abilities even after being brainwashed by the monolith might imply that monolith soldiers do not instantly lose their humanity on the spot but slowly as the monolith continues to control them or that strelok wasnt brainwashed as completely to better blend into the rest of the stalker population and to be able to use his wits which the monolith soldiers seem to lose partially to better fulfill his assassin role it is interesting to note that all monolith stalkers are immune to the zombifying effects of psiemitters like the brain scorcher and still retain their combat skills in addition in call of pripyat they are immune to emissions even though they will still get to cover when one occurs in call of pripyat monolith stalkers gain a new unknown voice actor monolithian speech is revealed to be highly ritualised referring to each other as brother and relating most situations to the monolith upon sighting an enemy they remark to their brothers about the presence of an enemy of the monolith and do much the same upon killing them any idle talk revolves around the monolith and is as disjointed and monotone as englishspeaking monolithians history edit the monolith clan was originally a group of stalkers united by their fascination with the zone fascination turned to obsession and obsession turned to fanaticism eventually the stalkers became convinced that there is a massive artifact in the center of the zone a monolith and declared themselves its protectors growing increasingly hostile to other stalkers 4 5they disappeared in 2011 just before beginning of clear sky simply picking up all of their belongings and marching through the barrier towards the brain scorcher shortly before an emission no one has heard from them since or so they thought as later in 2011 very aggressive stalkers began storming the barrier 4 5fact is they had been recruited as the guardians of the cconsciousness to repel stalkers since they namely streloks group have and will find ways to reach the center of the zone they are vastly superior guards than the mutants or zombified stalkers since they retain most of their humanity although they are completely under the control of the cconsciousness and will gratefully give their lives without question organization edit monolith patch in clear sky their rank system and organization are almost completely unknown what is known is that the monolith is led by a single leader  charon in 2012 6  while combat operations are overseen in the field by preachers who snipe from atop buildings while chanting phrases out to inspire their men and demoralize the enemy both the leader and preachers take their orders directly from the cconsciousness  the only squad identified by name is crystal a unit whose sole task is protecting the monolith and the sarcophagus 6  cut game data points to two units known as the left and right hands of the monolith armed with ft200m rifles and black kite pistols these may have been ranks honorifics or titles among the monolithians further cut data shows an individual called the komandir another monolithian leader separate from charon with his own model and equipped with a gauss rifle and a black kite cut monolith units also include fighters called regulars and specnaz of which there were several equipment variants equipment edit a monolith sniper with an svd using the early model it is suggested in dialogue with clear sky members in limansk that the monolith faction is extremely well equipped and have huge numbers compared to the other factions putting them on levelfooting with the clear sky faction they use equipment developed by cconsciousness or those acquired from the obliterated clear sky faction they use selfmade armors such as the monolith suit the scientific monolith suit along with a variant of the radiation suit and the exoskeleton as evidenced in shadow of chernobyl these armors are superior to the gear used by other stalkers from the duty freedom and loners factions the monolith throughout the series make use of nearly every weapon available this goes from common weaponry issued to rookies to uncommon and highend weaponry including the rare ft200m that only mercenaries clear sky loners and the monolith have access to finally they produced the deadly gauss gun and are the only known user besides the player of this unique weapon it is unknown where monolithians get their equipment although kirillov suggests they have agents who deal in smuggling with corrupt military members 7 as seen with the gauss gun it can be assumed the faction either has or contracts experienced engineers weapons edit fora12walker p9m

appearances edit clear sky edit live monolith can be first encountered in the army warehouses near a crashed mi24 hind helicopter west of the barrier they are well equiped all use radsuits and sa avalanches and surrounded by a psi field which does heavy psi damage when entered the monolith are uneffected by the psi disruption and can be difficult to take care of due to the lack of cover other monolithians can be found at the barrier and will regularly launch attacks on the loners dutyers or freedomers that guard the barrier it is not possible to engage them at close range as they are protected by the brain scorchers psychic emissions that will kill the player instantly if they stay too deep in the barrier for too long in the final stages of clear sky the primary opposition is the monolith faction itself having repelled all of the other factions attempting to break into the zone center they can be found in limansk the limansk hospital and the chernobyl nuclear power plant and serve as the main opposition for the rest of the game it is here that its first suggested chronologically that monolith bolsters its numbers through the use of emissions and later via the brain scorcher the ending shows the survivors of clear skys raid being brainwashed via television screens including strelok and likely scar as well interestingly what appears to be the corpses of dead monolith soldiers can be found in various areas such as the swamps and the cordon locations edit in clear sky the monolith faction has only three territories under its control the chernobyl npp itself the northern portion of limansk and most of the abandoned hospital where you progress to after limansk they become the main opposition to the player during the final portion of the game but are relatively rare outside of these areas appearing only in small groups in such areas as the army warehouses  shadow of chernobyl edit by 2012 the monolith faction is considered to be the most powerful faction in the zone by far easily as numerous as the armies of duty and freedom with advanced technology that not even the military possesses their army is large enough to be military theater sized as they regularly launch raids from the center of the zone attacking the freedom barrier with forces consisting of occasionally 20 men a relatively expensive strategy in the sparsely populated zone their grip has extended from beyond the npp and they have established a headquarters in pripyat led by a figurehead known as charon a pair of monolith masters at prayer in all likelihood the vast majority of the monolith factions troops are in fact former clear sky members as well as duty freedom military and loners who supposedly lost their lives in the second and third emissions locations edit monolith appears first in the army warehouses area where a platoon sized force of monolithians launch an attack upon the freedom barricade afterwards they take the role as the primary opposition once again often deploying en masse to block strelok from making any further progress by this time theyve established numerous checkpoints within the red forest and garrison the brain scorcher having established a strong wellfortified position within pripyat elite units regularly patrol the city and at the same time still more monolithians protect chernobyl npp itself along with the sarcophagus  call of pripyat edit by 3 months after the brain scorcher was disabled the monolith is slowly losing power – most of monoliths outlying forces have either been destroyed or gained freedom from the influence of cconsciousness one such squad led by strider can be encountered by the player and recruited into one of the other factions – supposedly a first in the history of the zone however the remaining fanatics are still enough of a threat to decimate the survivors of operation fairway live monolithians can be encountered in yanov as part of striders group these are neutral to the player and strider offers a quest that requires them to speak to either shulga or loki to have the survivors recruited into either duty and freedom respectively they first make their appearance as enemies inside the pripyat underground where they launch an ambush on the player and his companions before they can make a break for the surface this is the first appearance of snipers in the entirety of the game taking advantage of numerous vantage points to snipe the player as they attempt to activate backup power to the underground they ambush the player twice once when turning back the power on and snipers appear when the player unlocks the door once the player arrives in pripyat its revealed that monolith itself is slowly losing power but is still a potent enough threat to have decimated the survivors of operation fairway of particular interest is a special weapon sighted in their possession which colonel kovalsky sends a special ops team to confiscate this mission is the first sighting of the monolith preachers who make use of the rare and devastating gauss rifle with the preacher dead the player then takes part in another mission destroying one of the monolith outposts in a bookstore – gunning them down while they pray later the player must wipe out their forces in the yubileiny service center in order to gain access to lab x8 it becomes apparent that while some of them maintain a connection to the monolith namely the preacher and monolith fighter  the majority of them have lost this link and are left at the preachers command afterwards the player is relatively free to explore pripyat though monolith maintains at least two strongholds  the prometheus cinema and the river port they serve as the main opposition during the finale where at least two more preachers make their appearance trying to prevent the survivors of operation fairway from evacuating locations edit unlike shadow of chernobyl monolith no longers patrols the city which is now controlled by loners mutants and mercenaries they initially control the hospital the book store and the yubileiny service center though all three locations are later wiped out by the player afterwards they only respawn in small numbers between 5 and 15 at the river port and the prometheus theater notable members edit charon preacher strider monolith master ranks edit call of pripyat edit rookie edit the less common type of monolithians they rely on a classic monolith suit and use lowgrade weaponry such as akm742us they are very weak but stronger than loner rookies and are much easier to defeat than higher ranked monolithians experienced edit a very common type of monolithian they wear either monolith suits or scientific monolith suits and have access to more assault rifles and other weapons including the trs 301 the chaser 13 and the akm742  veteran edit semicommon they equip almost the same gear as veteran loners there are three types of veterans the first wears the scientific monolith suit and uses the svdm2 sniper rifle the second wears classic monolith suits or radiation suits and uses the sgi5k or the sa avalanche they are just as tough as other veterans as they are able to withstand many shots including a headshot in rare cases expert edit the most rare and dangerous of the monolithians most of them use the faction variant of the exoskeleton and use uncommon highgrade weaponry  namely the gp37 the tunder s14 and the eliminator and a rarer version uses the classic monolith suit and the vintar bc sniper rifle due to their heavy armor and powerful weapons they are dangerous enemies to deal with trivia edit in call of pripyat the monolith is actually neutral to the ecologists in the game code the reason for this is unknown since the monolithians have no contact with the scientists bunker in early builds of shadow of chernobyl the monolith was going to be allied with the bandits the reasons why and what effect on the plot that would have had are unknown gallery edit a

references edit↑ s t a l k e r clear sky stdialogmanager string id dmabout149 this place is enchanted with some really shitty magic buddy all we do is go round in circles looking for our missing friends but so far we aint found nothing but monsters if you get to higher ground you can sometimes hear fragments of their radio comms but its impossible to make any sense of them and that aint the half of it how do you explain the appearance of monolithians from beyond the barrier i saw one of them once he was wounded his eyes were glazed over and he was mumbling the same words over and over defend the monolith i dont think he could feel pain cause he wouldnt stop trying to grab my buddys throat until we emptied a few clips into him what do they want what made them come back after the emission i aint got nothing but questions friend↑ s t a l k e r clear sky stdialogmanagerxml string id dmcoolinfo40 after the monolithians started flooding back from beyond the barrier we had the idea to catch one alive and find out how to get through the scorcher and into the center of the zone man it took a lot of lives and even more ammo but we did it this guy took half a clip right in the chest but he was still pretty lively grunting struggling and trying to grab at our leader we asked him nice and we asked him rough but he didnt tell us shit just kept screaming defend the monolith over and over i figure something must have happened to them on the other side so we didnt really find out how to get past the scorcher but then again if theyre coming from beyond the barrier there must be a way right what do you think↑ s t a l k e r call of pripyat col kovalsky its useless first of all they fight to the death our boys managed to get one alive when he was stunned by a grenade but it didnt help much we took our eyes off him for a second and he banged his head against the wall so hard that his skull cracked open like an egg ↑ 40 41 s t a l k e r clear sky stdialogsagroprom stirng id agrdutybarmanaround1 buzz well a whole faction has gone missing and its not like they were taken out by people or wiped out by monsters they just vanished warts and all these guys were weird too with a real hardon for the zone they believed that the zone was alive and in its center was a monolith  a wish granter so they declared themselves the protectors of this monolith and then one fine day their whole faction just got up and took off for the center yep right to the wish granter they headed for the scorcher crossed the barrier and noone has seen them since↑ 50 51 s t a l k e r clear sky stdialogmanager string id dmcoolinfo25 i heard a whole faction went missing in the zone you ever heard of monolith well they used to protect the zone from others but they made a move towards the center right before the emission nobody has heard from them since but recently some real aggressive stalkers have been attacking from where the scorcher is killing everyone and asking no questions i know because i saw them myself around the military warehouses and i reckon they might be those same monolithians who disappeared it wouldnt surprise me because their uniforms looked real similar↑ 60 61 s t a l k e r shadow of chernobyl stablebionamexml↑ s t a l k e r call of pripyat lt kirillov yeah we broke into a monolith warehouse the other day and it was full of ammo for every type of weapon you get in the zone i wonder how they get so much weaponry in here im guessing one of the perimeter guards must be selling it to themv • d • e monolith locations army warehouses · red forest · lab x19
