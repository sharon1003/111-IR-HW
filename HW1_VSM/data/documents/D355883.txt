merely napping in your car you don’t have to be away from your tax home for a whole day or from dusk to dawn as long as your relief from duty is long enough to get necessary sleep or rest example 1 you are a railroad conductor you leave your home terminal on a regularly scheduled roundtrip run between two cities and return home 16 hours later during the run you have 6 hours off at your turnaround point where you eat two meals and rent a hotel room to get necessary sleep before starting the return trip you are considered to be away from home example 2 you are a truck driver you leave your terminal and return to it later the same day you get an hour off at your turnaround point to eat because you aren’t off to get necessary sleep and the brief time off isn’t an adequate rest period you aren’t traveling away from home members of the armed forces if you are a member of the u s armed forces on a permanent duty assignment overseas you aren’t traveling away from home you can’t deduct your expenses for meals and lodging you can’t deduct these expenses even if you have to maintain a home in the united states for your family members who aren’t allowed to accompany you overseas if you are transferred from one permanent duty station to another you may have deductible moving expenses which are explained in pub 521 moving expenses a naval officer assigned to permanent duty aboard a ship that has regular eating and living facilities has a tax home explained next aboard the ship for travel expense purposes tax home to determine whether you are traveling away from home you must first determine the location of your tax home generally your tax home is your regular place of business or post of duty regardless of where you maintain your family home it includes the entire city or general area in which your business or work is located if you have more than one regular place of business your tax home is your main place of business see main place of business or work later if you don’t have a regular or a main place of business because of the nature of your work then your tax home may be the place where you regularly live see no main place of business or work later if you don’t have a regular or main place of business or post of duty and there is no place where you regularly live you are considered an itinerant a transient and your tax home is wherever you work as an itinerant you can’t claim a travel expense deduction because you are never considered to be traveling away from home main place of business or work if you have more than one place of work consider the following when determining which one is your main place of business or work the total time you ordinarily spend in each place the level of your business activity in each place whether your income from each place is significant or insignificant example you live in cincinnati where you have a seasonal job for 8 months each year and earn 40000 you work the other 4 months in miami also at a seasonal job and earn 15000 cincinnati is your main place of work because you spend most of your time there and earn most of your income there no main place of business or work you may have a tax home even if you don’t have a regular or main place of work your tax home may be the home where you regularly live factors used to determine tax home if you don’t have a regular or main place of business or work use the following three factors to determine where your tax home is you perform part of your business in the area of your main home and use that home for lodging while doing business in the area you have living expenses at your main home that you duplicate because your business requires you to be away from that home you haven’t abandoned the area in which both your historical place of lodging and your claimed main home are located you have a member or members of your family living at your main home or you often use that home for lodging if you satisfy all three factors your tax home is the home where you regularly live if you satisfy only two factors you may have a tax home depending on all the facts and circumstances if you satisfy only one factor you are an itinerant your tax home is wherever you work and you can’t deduct travel expenses example 1 you are single and live in boston in an apartment you rent you have worked for your employer in boston for a number of years your employer enrolls you in a 12month executive training program you don’t expect to return to work in boston after you complete your training during your training you don’t do any work in boston instead you receive classroom and onthejob training throughout the united states you keep your apartment in boston and return to it frequently you use your apartment to conduct your personal business you also keep up your community contacts in boston when you complete your training you are transferred to los angeles you don’t satisfy factor 1 because you didn’t work in boston you satisfy factor 2 because you had duplicate living expenses you also satisfy factor 3 because you didn’t abandon your apartment in boston as your main home you kept your community contacts and you frequently returned to live in your apartment therefore you have a tax home in boston example 2 you are an outside salesperson with a sales territory covering several states your employers main office is in newark but you don’t conduct any business there your work assignments are temporary and you have no way of knowing where your future assignments will be located you have a room in your married sisters house in dayton you stay there for one or two weekends a year but you do no work in the area you don’t pay your sister for the use of the room you don’t satisfy any of the three factors listed earlier you are an itinerant and have no tax home tax home different from family home if you and your family don’t live at your tax home defined earlier you can’t deduct the cost of traveling between your tax home and your family home you also can’t deduct the cost of meals and lodging while at your tax home see example 1 later if you are working temporarily in the same city where you and your family live you may be considered as traveling away from home see example 2 later example 1 you are a truck driver and you and your family live in tucson you are employed by a trucking firm that has its terminal in phoenix at the end of your long runs you return to your home terminal in phoenix and spend one night there before returning home you can’t deduct any expenses you have for meals and lodging in phoenix or the cost of traveling from phoenix to tucson this is because phoenix is your tax home example 2 your family home is in pittsburgh where you work 12 weeks a year the rest of the year you work for the same employer in baltimore in baltimore you eat in restaurants and sleep in a rooming house your salary is the same whether you are in pittsburgh or baltimore because you spend most of your working time and earn most of your salary in baltimore that city is your tax home you can’t deduct any expenses you have for meals and lodging there however when you return to work in pittsburgh you are away from your tax home even though you stay at your family home you can deduct the cost of your round trip between baltimore and pittsburgh you can also deduct your part of your familys living expenses for meals and lodging while you are living and working in pittsburgh temporary assignment or job you may regularly work at your tax home and also work at another location it may not be practical to return to your tax home from this other location at the end of each work day temporary assignment vs indefinite assignment if your assignment or job away from your main place of work is temporary your tax home doesn’t change you are considered to be away from home for the whole period you are away from your main place of work you can deduct your travel expenses if they otherwise qualify for deduction generally a temporary assignment in a single location is one that is realistically expected to last and does in fact last for 1 year or less however if your assignment or job is indefinite the location of the assignment or job becomes your new tax home and you can’t deduct your travel expenses while there an assignment or job in a single location is considered indefinite if it is realistically expected to last for more than 1 year whether or not it actually lasts for more than 1 year if your assignment is indefinite you must include in your income any amounts you receive from your employer for living expenses even if they are called travel allowances and you account to your employer for them you may be able to deduct the cost of relocating to your new tax home as a moving expense see pub 521 for more information exception for federal crime investigations or prosecutions if you are a federal employee participating in a federal crime investigation or prosecution you aren’t subject to the 1year rule this means you may be able to deduct travel expenses even if you are away from your tax home for more than 1 year provided you meet the other requirements for deductibility for you to qualify the attorney general or his or her designee must certify that you are traveling for the federal governmentin a temporary duty status and to investigate prosecute or provide support services for the investigation or prosecution of a federal crime determining temporary or indefinite you must determine whether your assignment is temporary or indefinite when you start work if you expect an assignment or job to last for 1 year or less it is temporary unless there are facts and circumstances that indicate otherwise an assignment or job that is initially temporary may become indefinite due to changed circumstances a series of assignments to the same location all for short periods but that together cover a long period may be considered an indefinite assignment the following examples illustrate whether an assignment or job is temporary or indefinite example 1 you are a construction worker you live and regularly work in los angeles you are a member of a trade union in los angeles that helps you get work in the los angeles area your tax home is los angeles because of a shortage of work you took a job on a construction project in fresno your job was scheduled to end in 8 months the job actually lasted 10 months you realistically expected the job in fresno to last 8 months the job actually did last less than 1 year the job is temporary and your tax home is still in los angeles example 2 the facts are the same as in example 1 except that you realistically expected the work in fresno to last 18 months the job actually was completed in 10 months your job in fresno is indefinite because you realistically expected the work to last longer than 1 year even though it actually lasted less than 1 year you can’t deduct any travel expenses you had in fresno because fresno became your tax home example 3 the facts are the same as in example 1 except that you realistically expected the work in fresno to last 9 months after 8 months however you were asked to remain for 7 more months for a total actual stay of 15 months initially you realistically expected the job in fresno to last for only 9 months however due to changed circumstances occurring after 8 months it was no longer realistic for you to expect that the job in fresno would last for 1 year or less you can deduct only your travel expenses for the first 8 months you can’t deduct any travel expenses you had after that time because fresno became your tax home when the job became indefinite going home on days off if you go back to your tax home from a temporary assignment on your days off you aren’t considered away from home while you are in your hometown you can’t deduct the cost of your meals and lodging there however you can deduct your travel expenses including meals and lodging while traveling between your temporary place of work and your tax home you can claim these expenses up to the amount it would have cost you to stay at your temporary place of work if you keep your hotel room during your visit home you can deduct the cost of your hotel room in addition you can deduct your expenses of returning home up to the amount you would have spent for meals had you stayed at your temporary place of work probationary work period if you take a job that requires you to move with the understanding that you will keep the job if your work is satisfactory during a probationary period the job is indefinite you can’t deduct any of your expenses for meals and lodging during the probationary period what travel expenses are deductible once you have

march her employer sent her on a 3day trip to washington dc to attend a planning seminar she left her home in new orleans at 10 am on wednesday and arrived in washington dc at 530 pm after spending 2 nights there she flew back to new orleans on friday and arrived back home at 8 pm jens employer gave her a flat amount to cover her expenses and included it with her wages under method 1 jen can claim 2½ days of the standard meal allowance for washington dc 3  4 of the daily rate for wednesday and friday the days she departed and returned and the full daily rate for thursday under method 2 jen could also use any method that she applies consistently and that is in accordance with reasonable business practice for example she could claim 3 days of the standard meal allowance even though a federal employee would have to use method 1 and be limited to only 2½ days travel in the united states the following discussion applies to travel in the united states for this purpose the united states includes the 50 states and the district of columbia the treatment of your travel expenses depends on how much of your trip was business related and on how much of your trip occurred within the united states see part of trip outside the united states later trip primarily for business you can deduct all of your travel expenses if your trip was entirely business related if your trip was primarily for business and while at your business destination you extended your stay for a vacation made a personal side trip or had other personal activities you can deduct only your businessrelated travel expenses these expenses include the travel costs of getting to and from your business destination and any businessrelated expenses at your business destination example you work in atlanta and take a business trip to new orleans in may your business travel totals 900 miles round trip on your way home you stop in mobile to visit your parents you spend 2165 for the 9 days you are away from home for travel meals lodging and other travel expenses if you hadn’t stopped in mobile you would have been gone only 6 days and your total cost would have been 163350 you can deduct 163350 for your trip including the cost of roundtrip transportation to and from new orleans the deduction for your meals is subject to the 50 limit on meals mentioned earlier trip primarily for personal reasons if your trip was primarily for personal reasons such as a vacation the entire cost of the trip is a nondeductible personal expense however you can deduct any expenses you have while at your destination that are directly related to your business a trip to a resort or on a cruise ship may be a vacation even if the promoter advertises that it is primarily for business the scheduling of incidental business activities during a trip such as viewing videotapes or attending lectures dealing with general subjects won’t change what is really a vacation into a business trip part of trip outside the united states if part of your trip is outside the united states use the rules described later in this chapter under travel outside the united states for that part of the trip for the part of your trip that is inside the united states use the rules for travel in the united states travel outside the united states doesn’t include travel from one point in the united states to another point in the united states the following discussion can help you determine whether your trip was entirely within the united states public transportation if you travel by public transportation any place in the united states where that vehicle makes a scheduled stop is a point in the united states once the vehicle leaves the last scheduled stop in the united states on its way to a point outside the united states you apply the rules under travel outside the united states later example you fly from new york to puerto rico with a scheduled stop in miami puerto rico isn’t considered part of the united states for purposes of travel you return to new york nonstop the flight from new york to miami is in the united states so only the flight from miami to puerto rico is outside the united states because there are no scheduled stops between puerto rico and new york all of the return trip is outside the united states private car travel by private car in the united states is travel between points in the united states even though you are on your way to a destination outside the united states example you travel by car from denver to mexico city and return your travel from denver to the border and from the border back to denver is travel in the united states and the rules in this section apply the rules below under travel outside the united states apply to your trip from the border to mexico city and back to the border travel outside the united states if any part of your business travel is outside the united states some of your deductions for the cost of getting to and from your destination may be limited for this purpose the united states includes the 50 states and the district of columbia how much of your travel expenses you can deduct depends in part upon how much of your trip outside the united states was business related travel entirely for business or considered entirely for business you can deduct all your travel expenses of getting to and from your business destination if your trip is entirely for business or considered entirely for business travel entirely for business if you travel outside the united states and you spend the entire time on business activities you can deduct all of your travel expenses travel considered entirely for business even if you didn’t spend your entire time on business activities your trip is considered entirely for business if you meet at least one of the following four exceptions exception 1—no substantial control your trip is considered entirely for business if you didn’t have substantial control over arranging the trip the fact that you control the timing of your trip doesn’t by itself mean that you have substantial control over arranging your trip you don’t have substantial control over your trip if you are an employee who was reimbursed or paid a travel expense allowance and aren’t related to your employer or aren’t a managing executive related to your employer is defined later in chapter 6 under per diem and car allowances a managing executive is an employee who has the authority and responsibility without being subject to the veto of another to decide on the need for the business travel a selfemployed person generally has substantial control over arranging business trips exception 2—outside united states no more than a week your trip is considered entirely for business if you were outside the united states for a week or less combining business and nonbusiness activities one week means 7 consecutive days in counting the days don’t count the day you leave the united states but do count the day you return to the united states example you traveled to brussels primarily for business you left denver on tuesday and flew to new york on wednesday you flew from new york to brussels arriving the next morning on thursday and friday you had business discussions and from saturday until tuesday you were sightseeing you flew back to new york arriving wednesday afternoon on thursday you flew back to denver although you were away from your home in denver for more than a week you weren’t outside the united states for more than a week this is because the day you depart doesn’t count as a day outside the united states you can deduct your cost of the roundtrip flight between denver and brussels you can also deduct the cost of your stay in brussels for thursday and friday while you conducted business however you can’t deduct the cost of your stay in brussels from saturday through tuesday because those days were spent on nonbusiness activities exception 3—less than 25 of time on personal activities your trip is considered entirely for business if you were outside the united states for more than a week and you spent less than 25 of the total time you were outside the united states on nonbusiness activities for this purpose count both the day your trip began and the day it ended example you flew from seattle to tokyo where you spent 14 days on business and 5 days on personal matters you then flew back to seattle you spent 1 day flying in each direction because only 5  21 less than 25 of your total time abroad was for nonbusiness activities you can deduct as travel expenses what it would have cost you to make the trip if you hadn’t engaged in any nonbusiness activity the amount you can deduct is the cost of the roundtrip plane fare and 16 days of meals subject to the 50 limit lodging and other related expenses exception 4—vacation not a major consideration your trip is considered entirely for business if you can establish that a personal vacation wasn’t a major consideration even if you have substantial control over arranging the trip travel primarily for business if you travel outside the united states primarily for business but spend some of your time on other activities you generally can’t deduct all of your travel expenses you can only deduct the business portion of your cost of getting to and from your destination you must allocate the costs between your business and other activities to determine your deductible amount see travel allocation rules later you don’t have to allocate your travel expenses if you meet one of the four exceptions listed earlier under travel considered entirely for business in those cases you can deduct the total cost of getting to and from your destination travel allocation rules if your trip outside the united states was primarily for business you must allocate your travel time on a daytoday basis between business days and nonbusiness days the days you depart from and return to the united states are both counted as days outside the united states to figure the deductible amount of your roundtrip travel expenses use the following fraction the numerator top number is the total number of business days outside the united states the denominator bottom number is the total number of business and nonbusiness days of travel counting business days your business days include transportation days days your presence was required days you spent on business and certain weekends and holidays transportation day count as a business day any day you spend traveling to or from a business destination however if because of a nonbusiness activity you don’t travel by a direct route your business days are the days it would take you to travel a reasonably direct route to your business destination extra days for side trips or nonbusiness activities can’t be counted as business days presence required count as a business day any day your presence is required at a particular place for a specific business purpose count it as a business day even if you spend most of the day on nonbusiness activities day spent on business if your principal activity during working hours is the pursuit of your trade or business count the day as a business day also count as a business day any day you are prevented from working because of circumstances beyond your control certain weekends and holidays count weekends holidays and other necessary standby days as business days if they fall between business days but if they follow your business meetings or activity and you remain at your business destination for nonbusiness or personal reasons don’t count them as business days example 1 your tax home is new york city you travel to quebec where you have a business appointment on friday you have another appointment on the following monday because your presence was required on both friday and monday they are business days because the weekend is between business days saturday and sunday are counted as business days this is true even though you use the weekend for sightseeing visiting friends or other nonbusiness activity example 2 if in example 1 you had no business in quebec after friday but stayed until monday before starting home saturday and sunday would be nonbusiness days nonbusiness activity on the way to or from your business destination if you stopped for a vacation or other nonbusiness activity either on the way from the united states to your business destination or on the way back to the united states from your business destination you must allocate part of your travel expenses to the nonbusiness activity the part you must allocate is the amount it would have cost you to travel between the point where travel outside the united states begins and your nonbusiness destination and a return to the point where travel outside the united states ends you determine the nonbusiness portion of that expense by multiplying it by a fraction the numerator top number of the fraction is the number of nonbusiness days during your travel outside the united states and the denominator bottom number is the total number of days you spend outside the united states example you live in new york on may 4 you flew to paris to attend a business conference that began on may 5 the conference ended at noon on may 14 that evening you flew to dublin where you visited with friends until the afternoon of may 21 when you flew directly home to new york the primary purpose for the trip was to attend the conference if you hadn’t stopped in dublin you would have arrived home the evening of may 14 you don’t meet any of the exceptions that would allow you to consider your travel entirely for business may 4 through may 14 11 days are business days and may 15 through may 21 7 days are nonbusiness days you can deduct the cost of your meals subject to the 50 limit  lodging and other businessrelated travel expenses while in paris you can’t deduct your expenses while in dublin you also can’t deduct 7  18 of what it would have cost you to travel round trip between new york and dublin you paid 750 to fly from new york to paris 400 to fly from paris to dublin and 700 to fly from dublin back to new york roundtrip airfare from new york to dublin would have been 1250 you figure the deductible part of your air travel expenses by subtracting 7  18 of the roundtrip fare and other expenses you would have had in traveling directly between new york and dublin 1250 × 7  18  486 from your total expenses in traveling from new york to paris to dublin and back to new york 750  400  700  1850 your deductible air travel expense is 1364 1850 − 486 nonbusiness activity at near or beyond business destination if you had a vacation or other nonbusiness activity at near or beyond your business destination you must allocate part of your travel expenses to the nonbusiness activity the part you must allocate is the amount it would have cost you to travel between the point where travel outside the united states begins and your business destination and a return to the point where travel outside the united states ends you determine the nonbusiness portion of that expense by multiplying it by a fraction the numerator top number of the fraction is the number of nonbusiness days during your travel outside the united states and the denominator bottom number is the total number of days you spend outside the united states none of your travel expenses for nonbusiness activities at near or beyond your business destination are deductible example assume that the dates are the same as in the previous example but that instead of going to dublin for your vacation you fly to venice italy for a vacation you can’t deduct any part of the cost of your trip from paris to venice and return to paris in addition you can’t deduct 7  18 of the airfare and other expenses from new york to paris and back to new york you can deduct 11  18 of the roundtrip plane fare and other travel expenses from new york to paris plus your meals subject to the 50 limit  lodging and any other business expenses you had in paris assume these expenses total 4939 if the roundtrip plane fare and other travelrelated expenses such as food during the trip are 1750 you can deduct travel costs of 1069  11  18 × 1750 plus the full 4939 for the expenses you had in paris other methods you can use another method of counting business days if you establish that it more clearly reflects the time spent on other than business activities outside the united states travel primarily for personal reasons if you travel outside the united states primarily for vacation or for investment purposes the entire cost of the trip is a nondeductible personal expense however if you spend some time attending brief professional seminars or a continuing education program you can deduct your registration fees and other expenses you have that are directly related to your business example the university from which you graduated has a continuing education program for members of its alumni association this program consists of trips to various foreign countries where academic exercises and conferences are set up to acquaint individuals in most occupations with selected facilities in several regions of the world however none of the conferences are directed toward specific occupations or professions it is up to each participant to seek out specialists and organizational settings appropriate to his or her occupational interests threehour sessions are held each day over a 5day period at each of the selected overseas facilities where participants can meet with individual practitioners these sessions are composed of a variety of activities including workshops minilectures role playing skill development and exercises professional conference directors schedule and conduct the sessions participants can choose those sessions they wish to attend you can participate in this program since you are a member of the alumni association you and your family take one of the trips you spend about 2 hours at each of the planned sessions the rest of the time you go touring and sightseeing with your family the trip lasts less than 1 week your travel expenses for the trip aren’t deductible since the trip was primarily a vacation however registration fees and any other incidental expenses you have for the five planned sessions you attended that are directly related and beneficial to your business are deductible business expenses these expenses should be specifically stated in your records to ensure proper allocation of your deductible business expenses luxury water travel if you travel by ocean liner cruise ship or other form of luxury water transportation for business purposes there is a daily limit on the amount you can deduct the limit is twice the highest federal per diem rate allowable at the time of your travel generally the federal per diem is the amount paid to federal government employees

meals and entertainment if your expenses for luxury water travel include separately stated amounts for meals or entertainment those amounts are subject to the 50 limit on meals and entertainment before you apply the daily limit for a discussion of the 50 limit see chapter 2 example in the previous example carolines luxury water travel had a total cost of 5200 of that amount 3700 was separately stated as meals and entertainment caroline who is selfemployed isn’t reimbursed for any of her travel expenses caroline figures her deductible travel expenses as follows meals and

your meal or entertainment charges aren’t separately stated or aren’t clearly identifiable you don’t have to allocate any portion of the total charge to meals or entertainment exceptions the daily limit on luxury water travel discussed earlier doesn’t apply to expenses you have to attend a convention seminar or meeting on board a cruise ship see cruise ships later under conventions conventions

generally shows the purpose of the convention you can show your attendance at the convention benefits your trade or business by comparing the agenda with the official duties and responsibilities of

expenses including entertainmentrelated meals you must show that the main purpose of the combined business and entertainment was the active conduct of businessyou did engage in business with the person during the entertainment period and you had more than a general expectation of getting income or some other specific business benefit at some future time business generally isn’t considered to

can’t deduct the expenses for the use of an entertainment facility see entertainment facilities under what entertainment expenses aren’t deductible later in this chapter you must consider all the facts including the nature of the business transacted and the reasons for conducting business during the entertainment it isn’t necessary to devote more time to business than to entertainment however if the business discussion is only incidental to the entertainment the entertainment expenses don’t meet the directly related test table 21 when are entertainment expenses deductible general rule you can deduct ordinary and necessary expenses to entertain a client customer or employee if the expenses meet the directly related test or the associated test definitions entertainment includes any activity generally considered to provide entertainment amusement or recreation and includes meals provided to a customer or client an ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in your trade

situations are examples of entertainment in a clear business setting entertainment in a hospitality room at a convention where business goodwill is created through the display or discussion of business products entertainment that is mainly a price rebate on the sale of your products such as a restaurant owner providing an occasional free meal to a loyal customer entertainment of a clear business nature occurring under circumstances where there is no meaningful personal or social relationship between you and the persons entertained an example is entertainment of business and civic leaders at the opening of a new hotel or play when the purpose is to get business publicity rather than to create or maintain the goodwill of the persons entertained expenses not considered directly related entertainment expenses generally aren’t considered directly related if you aren’t there or in situations where there are substantial distractions that generally prevent you from actively conducting business the following are examples of situations where there are substantial distractions a meeting or discussion at a nightclub theater or sporting event a meeting or discussion during what is essentially a social gathering such as a cocktail party a meeting with a group that includes persons who aren’t business associates at places such as cocktail lounges country clubs golf clubs

conventions you are considered to have a substantial business discussion if you attend meetings at a convention or similar event or at a trade or business meeting sponsored and conducted by a business or professional organization however your reason for attending the convention or meeting must be to further your trade or business the organization that sponsors the convention or meeting must schedule a program of business activities that is the main activity of the convention or meeting directly before or after business discussion if the entertainment is held on the same day as the business discussion it is considered to be held directly before or after the business discussion if the entertainment and the business discussion aren’t held on the same day you must consider the facts of each case to see if the associated test is met among the facts to consider are the place date and duration of the business discussion if you or your business associates are from out of town you must also consider the dates of arrival and departure and the reasons the entertainment and the discussion didn’t take place on the same day example a group of business associates comes from out of town to your place of business to hold a substantial business discussion if you entertain those business guests on the evening before the business discussion or on the evening of the day following

included in deductible educational expenses when to apply the 50 limit you apply the 50 limit after determining the amount that would otherwise qualify for a deduction you first have to determine the amount of meal and entertainment expenses that would be deductible under the other rules discussed in this publication example 1 you spend 200 for a businessrelated meal if 110 of that amount isn’t allowable because it is lavish and extravagant the remaining 90 is subject to the 50 limit your deduction can’t be more than 45 50 050 × 90 example 2 you purchase two tickets to a concert and give them to a client you purchased the tickets through a ticket agent you paid 200 for the two tickets which had a face value of 80 each 160 total your deduction can’t be more than 80 50 050 × 160

you an allowance for these expenses in connection with services you perform you provide adequate records of these expenses to your customer or client see chapter 5  in this case your client or customer is subject to the 50 limit on the expenses example you are a selfemployed attorney who adequately accounts for meal and entertainment expenses to a client who reimburses you for these expenses you aren’t subject to the directly related or associated test nor are you subject to the 50 limit if the client can deduct the expenses the client is subject to the 50 limit if you as an independent contractor have expenses for meals and entertainment related to providing services for a client but don’t adequately account for and seek reimbursement from the client for those expenses you are subject to the directly related or associated test and to the 50 limit3—advertising expenses you aren’t subject to the 50 limit if you provide meals entertainment or recreational facilities to

what entertainment expenses are deductible this section explains different types of entertainment expenses you may be able to deduct entertainment entertainment includes any activity generally considered to provide entertainment amusement or recreation examples include entertaining guests at nightclubs at social athletic and sporting clubs at theaters at sporting events on yachts or on hunting fishing vacation and similar trips entertainment also may include meeting personal living or family needs of individuals such as providing meals a hotel suite or a car to customers or their families a meal as a form of entertainment entertainment includes the cost of a meal you provide to a customer or client whether the meal is a part of other entertainment or by itself a meal expense includes the cost of food beverages taxes and tips for the meal to deduct an entertainmentrelated meal you or your employee must be present when the food or beverages are provided you can’t claim the cost of your meal both as an entertainment expense and as a travel expense meals sold in the normal course of your business aren’t considered entertainment deduction may depend on your type of business your kind of business may determine if a particular activity is considered entertainment for example if you are a dress designer and have a fashion show to introduce your new designs to store buyers the show generally isn’t considered entertainment this is because fashion shows are typical in your business but if you are an appliance distributor and hold a fashion show for the spouses of your retailers the show generally is considered entertainment separating costs if you have one expense that includes the costs of entertainment and other services such as lodging or transportation you must allocate that expense between the cost of entertainment and the cost of other services you must have a reasonable basis for making this allocation for example you must allocate your expenses if a hotel includes entertainment in its lounge on the same bill with your room charge taking turns paying for meals or entertainment if a group of business acquaintances takes turns picking up each others meal or entertainment checks primarily for personal reasons without regard to whether any business purposes are served no member of the group can deduct any part of the expense lavish or extravagant expenses you can’t deduct expenses for entertainment that are lavish or extravagant an expense isn’t considered lavish or extravagant if it is reasonable considering the facts and circumstances expenses won’t be disallowed just because they are more than a fixed dollar amount or take place at deluxe restaurants hotels nightclubs or resorts allocating between business and nonbusiness if you entertain business and nonbusiness individuals at the same event you must divide your entertainment expenses between business and nonbusiness you can deduct only the business part if you can’t establish the part of the expense for each person participating allocate the expense to each participant on a pro rata basis example you entertain a group of individuals that includes yourself three business prospects and seven social guests only 4  11 of the expense qualifies as a business entertainment expense you can’t deduct the expenses for the seven social guests because those costs are nonbusiness expenses trade association meetings you can deduct entertainment expenses that are directly related to and necessary for attending business meetings or conventions of certain exempt organizations if the expenses of your attendance are related to your active trade or business these organizations include business leagues chambers of commerce real estate boards trade associations and professional associations entertainment tickets generally you can’t deduct more than the face value of an entertainment ticket even if you paid a higher price for example you can’t deduct service fees you pay to ticket agencies or brokers or any amount over the face value of the tickets you pay to resellers exception for events that benefit charitable organizations different rules apply when the cost of a ticket to a sports event benefits a charitable organization you can take into account the full cost you pay for the ticket even if it is more than the face value if all of the following conditions apply the events main purpose is to benefit a qualified charitable organization the entire net proceeds go to the charity the event uses volunteers to perform substantially all the events work the 50 limit on entertainment doesn’t apply to any expense for a package deal that includes a ticket to such a charitable sports event example 1 you purchase tickets to a golf tournament organized by the local volunteer fire company all net proceeds will be used to buy new fire equipment the volunteers will run the tournament you can deduct the entire cost of the tickets as a business expense if they otherwise qualify as an entertainment expense example 2 you purchase tickets to a college football game through a ticket broker after having a business discussion you take a client to the game net proceeds from the game go to colleges that qualify as charitable organizations however since the colleges also pay individuals to perform services such as coaching and recruiting you can only use the face value of the tickets in determining your business deduction skyboxes and other private luxury boxes if you rent a skybox or other private luxury box for more than one event at the same sports arena you generally can’t deduct more than the price of a nonluxury box seat ticket to determine whether a skybox has been rented for more than one event count each game or other performance as one event for example renting a skybox for a series of playoff games is considered renting it for more than one event all skyboxes you rent in the same arena along with any rentals by related parties are considered in making this determination related parties include family members spouses ancestors and lineal descendantsparties who have made a reciprocal arrangement involving the sharing of skyboxesrelated corporationsa partnership and its principal partners and a corporation and a partnership with common ownership example you pay 3000 to rent a 10seat skybox at team stadium for three baseball games the cost of regular nonluxury box seats at each event is 30 a seat you can deduct subject to the 50 limit 900  10 seats × 30 each × 3 events food and beverages in skybox seats if expenses for food and beverages are separately stated you can deduct these expenses in addition to the amounts allowable for the skybox subject to the requirements and limits that apply the amounts separately stated for food and beverages must be reasonable you can’t inflate the charges for food and beverages to avoid the limited deduction for skybox rentals what entertainment expenses aren’t deductible this section explains different types of entertainment expenses you generally may not be able to deduct club dues and membership fees you can’t deduct dues including initiation fees for membership in any club organized for businesspleasurerecreation or other social purpose this rule applies to any membership organization if one of its principal purposes is either to conduct entertainment activities for members or their guests or to provide members or their guests with access to entertainment facilities discussed later the purposes and activities of a club not its name will determine whether or not you can deduct the dues you can’t deduct dues paid to country clubsgolf and athletic clubsairline clubshotel clubs and clubs operated to provide meals under circumstances generally considered to be conducive to business discussions entertainment facilities generally you can’t deduct any expense for the use of an entertainment facility this includes expenses for depreciation and operating costs such as rent utilities maintenance and protection an entertainment facility is any property you own rent or use for entertainment examples include a yacht hunting lodge fishing camp swimming pool tennis court bowling alley car airplane apartment hotel suite or home in a vacation resort outofpocket expenses you can deduct outofpocket expenses such as for food and beverages catering gas and fishing bait that you provided during entertainment at a facility these aren’t expenses for the use of an entertainment facility however these expenses are subject to the directly related and associated tests and to the 50 limit all discussed earlier expenses for spouses you generally can’t deduct the cost of entertainment for your spouse or for the spouse of a customer however you can deduct these costs if you can show you had a clear business purpose rather than a personal or social purpose for providing the entertainment example you entertain a customer the cost is an ordinary and necessary business expense and is allowed under the entertainment rules the customers spouse joins you because it is impractical to entertain the customer without the spouse you can deduct the cost of entertaining the customers spouse if your spouse joins the party because the customers spouse is present the cost of the entertainment for your spouse is also deductible gift or entertainment any item that might be considered either a gift or entertainment generally will be considered entertainment however if you give a customer packaged food or beverages that you intend the customer to use at a later date treat it as a gift if you give a customer tickets to a theater performance or sporting event and you don’t go with the customer to the performance or event you have a choice you can treat the tickets as either a gift or entertainment whichever is to your advantage you can change your treatment of the tickets at a later date by filing an amended

trade or business you can deduct all or part of the cost this chapter explains the limits and rules for deducting the costs of gifts25 limit you can deduct no more than 25 for business gifts you give directly or indirectly to each person during your tax year a gift to a company that is intended for the eventual personal use or benefit of a particular person or a limited class of people will be considered an indirect gift to that particular person or to the individuals within that class of people who receive the gift if you give a gift to a member of a customers family the gift is generally considered to be an indirect gift to the customer this rule doesn’t apply if you have a bona fide independent business connection with that family member and the gift isn’t intended for the customers eventual use if you and your spouse both give gifts both of you are treated as one taxpayer it doesn’t matter whether you have separate businesses are separately employed or whether each of you has an independent connection with the recipient if a partnership gives gifts the partnership and the partners are treated as one taxpayer example bob jones sells products to local company he and his wife jan gave local company three gourmet gift baskets to thank them for their business they paid 80 for each gift basket or 240 total three of local companys executives took the gift baskets home for their families use bob and jan have no independent business relationship with any of the executives other family members they can deduct a total of 75 25 limit × 3 for the gift baskets incidental costs incidental costs such as engraving on jewelry or packaging insuring and mailing are generally not included in determining the cost of a gift for purposes of the 25 limit a cost is incidental only if it doesn’t add substantial value to the gift for example the cost of gift wrapping is an incidental cost however the purchase of an ornamental basket for packaging fruit isn’t an incidental cost if the value of the basket is substantial compared to the value of the fruit exceptions the following items aren’t considered gifts for purposes of the 25 limit an item that costs 4 or less and has your name clearly and permanently imprinted on the gift and is one of a number of identical items you widely distribute examples include pens desk sets and plastic bags and cases signs display

transportation expenses can be deducted if 1 you have one or more regular work locations away from your residence or 2 your residence is your principal place of business and you incur expenses going between the residence and another work location in the same trade or business regardless of whether the work is temporary or permanent and regardless of the distance illustration of transportation expenses figure b earlier illustrates the rules that apply for deducting transportation expenses when you have a regular or main job away from your home you may want to refer to it when deciding whether you can deduct your transportation expenses temporary work location if you have one or more regular work locations away from your home and you commute to a temporary work location in the same trade or business you can deduct the expenses of the daily roundtrip transportation between your home and the temporary location regardless of distance if your employment at a work location is realistically expected to last and does in fact last for 1 year or less the employment is temporary unless there are facts and circumstances that would indicate otherwise if your employment at a work location is realistically expected to last for more than 1 year or if there is no realistic expectation that the employment will last for 1 year or less the employment isn’t temporary regardless of whether it actually lasts for more than 1 year if employment at a work location initially is realistically expected to last for 1 year or less but at some later date the employment is realistically expected to last more than 1 year that employment will be treated as temporary unless there are facts and circumstances that would indicate otherwise until your expectation changes it won’t be treated as temporary after the date you determine it will last more than 1 year if the temporary work location is beyond the general area of your regular place of work and you stay overnight you are traveling

at a different office in the same city you travel directly from your home to the training location and return each day you can deduct the cost of your daily roundtrip transportation between your home and the training location example 2 your principal place of business is in your home you can deduct the cost of roundtrip transportation between your qualifying home office and your clients or customers place of business example 3 you have no regular office and you don’t have an office in your home in this case the location of your first business contact inside the metropolitan area is considered your office transportation expenses between your home and this first contact are nondeductible commuting expenses transportation expenses between your last business contact and your home

business purposes you ordinarily can deduct car expenses you generally can use one of the two following methods to figure your deductible expenses standard mileage rate actual car expenses if you use actual expenses to figure your deduction for a car you lease there are rules that affect the amount of your lease payments you can deduct see leasing a car later in this publication car includes a van pickup or panel truck for the definition of car for depreciation purposes see car defined under actual car expenses later rural mail carriers if you are a rural mail carrier you may be able to treat the qualified reimbursement you received as your allowable expense because the qualified reimbursement is treated as paid under an accountable plan your employer shouldn’t include the reimbursement in your income if your vehicle expenses are more than the amount of your reimbursement you can deduct the unreimbursed expenses as an itemized deduction on schedule a form 1040 you must complete form 2106 and attach it to your form 1040 u s individual income tax return a qualified reimbursement is the reimbursement you receive that meets both of the following conditions it is given as an equipment maintenance allowance ema to employees of the u s postal service it is at the rate contained in the 1991 collective bargaining agreement any later agreement can’t increase the qualified reimbursement amount by more than the rate of inflation see your employer for information on your reimbursement if you are a rural mail carrier and received a qualified reimbursement you can’t use the standard mileage rate standard mileage rate you may be able to use the standard mileage rate to figure the deductible costs of operating your car for business purposes for 2017 the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car for business use is 535 cents 0535 per mile if you use the standard mileage rate for a year you can’t deduct your actual car expenses for that year you can’t deduct depreciation lease payments maintenance and repairs gasoline including gasoline taxes oil insurance or vehicle registration fees see choosing the standard mileage rate and standard mileage rate not allowed later you generally can use the standard mileage rate whether or not you are reimbursed and whether or not any reimbursement is more or less than the amount figured using the standard mileage rate see chapter 6 for more information on reimbursements choosing the standard mileage rate if you want to use the standard mileage rate for a car you own you must choose to use it in the first year the car is available for use in your business then in later years you can choose to use either the standard mileage rate or actual expenses if you want to use the standard mileage rate for a car you lease you must use it for the entire lease period for leases that began on or before december 31 1997 the standard mileage rate must be used for the entire portion of the lease period including renewals that is after 1997 you must make the choice to use the standard mileage rate by the due date including extensions of your return you can’t revoke the choice however in later years you can switch from the standard mileage rate to the actual expenses method if you change to the actual expenses method in a later year but before your car is fully depreciated you have to estimate the remaining useful life of the car and use straight line depreciation example larry is an employee who occasionally uses his own car for business purposes he purchased the car in 2015 but he didn’t claim any unreimbursed employee expenses on his 2015 tax return because larry didn’t use the standard mileage rate the first year the car was available for business use he can’t use the standard mileage rate in 2017 to claim unreimbursed employee business expenses for more information about depreciation included in the standard mileage rate see exception under methods of depreciation later standard mileage rate not allowed you can’t use the standard mileage rate if you use five or more cars at the same time such as in fleet operationsclaimed a depreciation deduction for the car using any method other than straight line for example macrs as discussed later under depreciation deduction claimed a section 179 deduction discussed later on the carclaimed the special depreciation allowance on the carclaimed actual car expenses after 1997 for a car you leased or are a rural mail carrier who received a qualified reimbursement see rural mail carriers earliernote you can elect to use the standard mileage rate if you used a car for hire such as a taxi unless the standard mileage rate is otherwise not allowed as discussed above five or more cars if you own or lease five or more cars that are used for business at the same time you can’t use the standard mileage rate for the business use of any car however you may be able to deduct your actual expenses for operating each of the cars in your business see actual car expenses later for information on how to figure your deduction you aren’t using five or more cars for business at the same time if you alternate using use at different times the cars for business the following examples illustrate the rules for when you can and can’t use the standard mileage rate for five or more cars example 1 marcia a salesperson owns three cars and two vans that she alternates using for calling on her customers she can use the standard mileage rate for the business mileage of the three cars and the two vans because she doesn’t use them at the same time example 2 tony and his employees use his four pickup trucks in his landscaping business during the year he traded in two of his old trucks for two newer ones tony can use the standard mileage rate for the business mileage of all six of the trucks he owned during the year example 3 chris owns a repair shop and an insurance business he and his employees use his two pickup trucks and van for the repair shop chris alternates using his two cars for the insurance business no one else uses the cars for business purposes chris can use the standard mileage rate for the business use of the pickup trucks van and the cars because he never has more than four vehicles used for business at the same time example 4 maureen owns a car and four vans that are used in her housecleaning business her employees use the vans and she uses the car to travel to various customers maureen can’t use the standard mileage rate for the car or the vans this is because all five vehicles are used in maureens business at the same time she must use actual expenses for all vehicles interest if you are an employee you can’t deduct any interest paid on a car loan this applies even if you use the car 100 for business as an employee however if you are selfemployed and use your car in your business you can deduct that part of the interest expense that represents your business use of the car for example if you use your car 60 for business you can deduct 60 of the interest on schedule c form 1040 you can’t deduct the part of the interest expense that represents your personal use of the car if you use a home equity loan to purchase your car you may be able to deduct the interest see pub 936 home mortgage interest deduction for more information personal property taxes if you itemize your deductions on schedule a form 1040 you can deduct on line 7 state and local personal property taxes on motor vehicles you can take this deduction even if you use the standard mileage rate or if you don’t use the car for business if you are selfemployed and use your car in your business you can deduct the business part of state and local personal property taxes on motor vehicles on schedule c form 1040 schedule cez form 1040 or schedule f form 1040 if you itemize your deductions you can include the remainder of your state and local personal property taxes on the car on schedule

methods you may want to figure your deduction both ways to see which gives you a larger deduction actual car expenses include depreciation licenses lease payments registration fees gas insurance repairs oil garage rent tires tolls parking fees if you have fully depreciated a car that you still use in your business you can continue to claim your other actual car expenses continue to keep records as explained later in chapter 5 business and personal use if you use your car for both business and personal purposes you must divide your expenses between business and personal use you can divide your expense based on the miles driven for each purpose example you are a contractor and drive your car 20000 miles during the year 12000 miles for business use and 8000 miles for personal use you can claim only 60 12000 ÷ 20000 of the cost of operating your car as a business expense employerprovided vehicle if you use a vehicle provided by your employer for business purposes you can deduct your actual unreimbursed car expenses you can’t use the standard mileage rate see vehicle provided by your employer in chapter 6 interest on car loans if you are an employee you can’t deduct any

first place a car in service if in the year you first place a car in service you claim either a section 179 deduction or use a depreciation method other than straight line for its estimated useful life you can’t use the standard mileage rate on that car in any future year car defined for depreciation purposes a car is any fourwheeled vehicle including a truck or van made primarily for use on

property it is in service when it is ready and available for its specifically assigned use a car first used for personal purposes can’t qualify for the deduction in a later year when its use changes to business example in 2016 you bought a new car and used it for personal purposes in 2017 you began to use it for business changing its use to business use doesn’t qualify the cost of your car for a section 179 deduction in 2017 however you can claim a depreciation deduction for the business use of the car starting in 2017 see depreciation deduction later more than 50 business use requirement you must use the property more than 50 for business to claim any section 179 deduction if you used the property more than 50 for business multiply the cost of the property by the percentage of business use the result is the cost of the property that can qualify for the section 179 deduction example peter purchased a car in april 2017 for 24500 and used it 60 for business based on his business usage the total cost of peters car that qualifies for the section 179 deduction is 14700 24500 cost × 60 060 business use but see limit on total section 179 special depreciation allowance and depreciation

total amount you can deduct under section 179 each year after you apply the limits listed above cannot be more than the taxable income from the active conduct of any trade or business during the year if you are married and file a joint return you and your spouse are treated as one taxpayer in determining any reduction to the dollar limit regardless of which of you purchased the property or placed it in service if you and your spouse file separate returns you are treated as one taxpayer for the dollar limit you must allocate the dollar limit after any reduction between you for more information on the above section 179 deduction limits see pub 946 limit for sport utility and certain other vehicles for sport utility and certain other vehicles placed in service in 2017 the portion of the

in this chapter under car used 50 or less for business dispositions if you dispose of a car on which you had claimed the section 179 deduction the amount of that deduction is treated as a depreciation deduction for recapture purposes you treat any gain on the disposition of the property as ordinary income up to the amount of the section 179 deduction and any allowable depreciation unless you establish the amount actually allowed for information on the disposition of a car see disposition of a car later special depreciation allowance you may be able to claim the special depreciation

depreciate your basis in the car the date you place the car in service the method of depreciation and recovery period you will use basis your basis in a car for figuring depreciation is generally its cost this includes any amount you borrow or pay in cash other property or services generally you figure depreciation on your car truck or van using your unadjusted basis see unadjusted basis later however in some situations you will use your adjusted basis your basis reduced by depreciation allowed or allowable in earlier years for one of these situations see exception under methods of depreciation later if you change the use of a car from personal to business your basis for depreciation is the lesser of the fair market value or your adjusted basis in the car on the date of conversion additional rules concerning basis are discussed later in this chapter under unadjusted basis placed in service you generally place a car in service when it is available for use in your work or business in an incomeproducing activity or in a personal activity depreciation begins when the car is placed in service for use in your work or business or for the production of income for purposes of figuring depreciation if you first start using the car only for personal use and later convert it to business use you place the car in service on the date of conversion car placed in service and disposed of in the same year if you place a car in service and dispose of it in the same tax year you can’t claim any depreciation deduction for that car methods of depreciation generally you figure depreciation on cars using the modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs macrs is discussed later in this chapter exception if you used the standard mileage rate in the first year of business use and change to the actual expenses method in a later year you can’t depreciate your car under the macrs rules you must use straight line depreciation over the estimated remaining useful life of the car to figure depreciation under the straight line method you must reduce your basis in the car but not below zero by a set rate per mile for all miles for which you used the standard mileage rate the rate per mile varies depending on the year s you used the standard mileage rate for the rate s to use see depreciation adjustment when you used the standard mileage rate under disposition of a car later this reduction of basis is in addition to those basis adjustments described later under unadjusted basis you must use your adjusted basis in your car to figure your depreciation deduction for additional information on the straight line method of depreciation see pub 946 morethan50use test generally you must use your car more than 50 for qualified business use defined next during the year to use macrs you must meet this morethan50use test each year of the recovery period 6 years under macrs for your car if your business use is 50 or less you must use the straight line method to depreciate your car this is explained later under car used 50 or less for business qualified business use a qualified business use is any use in your trade or business it doesn’t include use for the production of income investment use however you do combine your business and investment use to figure your depreciation deduction for the tax year use of your car by another person don’t treat any use of your car by another person as use in your trade or business unless that use meets one of the following conditions it is directly connected with your business it is properly reported by you as income to the other person and if you have to you withhold tax on the income it results in a payment of fair market rent this includes any payment to you for the use of your car business use changes if you used your car more than 50 in qualified business use in the year you placed it in service but 50 or less in a later year including the year of disposition you have to change to the straight line method of depreciation see qualified business use 50 or less in a later year under car used 50 or less for business later property doesn’t cease to be used more than 50 in qualified business use by reason of a transfer at death use for more than one purpose if you use your car for more than one purpose during the tax year you must allocate the use to the various purposes you do this on the basis of mileage figure the percentage of qualified business use by dividing the number of miles you drive your car for business purposes during the year by the total number of miles you drive the car during the year for any purpose change from personal to business use if you change the use of a car from 100 personal use to business use during the tax year you may not have mileage records for the time before the change to business use in this case you figure the percentage of business use for the year as follows determine the percentage of business use for the period following the change do this by dividing business miles by total miles driven during that period multiply the percentage in 1 by a fraction the numerator top number is the number of months the car is used for business and the denominator bottom number is 12 example you use a car only for personal purposes during the first 6 months of the year during the last 6 months of the year you drive the car a total of 15000 miles of which 12000 miles are for business this gives you a business use percentage of 80 12000 ÷ 15000 for that period your business use for the year is 40 80 080 × 6  12  limits the amount you can claim for section 179 special depreciation allowance and depreciation deductions may be limited the maximum amount you can claim depends on the year in which you placed your car in service you have to reduce the maximum amount if you did not use the car exclusively for business see depreciation limits later unadjusted basis you use your unadjusted basis often referred to as your basis or your basis for depreciation to figure your depreciation using the macrs depreciation chart explained later under modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs your unadjusted basis for figuring depreciation is your original basis increased or decreased by certain amounts to figure your unadjusted basis begin with your cars original basis which generally is its cost cost includes sales taxes see sales taxes earlier destination charges and dealer preparation increase your basis by any substantial improvements you make to your car such as adding air conditioning or a new engine decrease your basis by any section 179 deduction special depreciation allowance gas guzzler tax cleanfuel vehicle deduction for vehicles placed in service before january 1 2006 and alternative motor vehicle credit see form 8910 alternative motor vehicle credit for information on the alternative motor vehicle credit it is available on vehicles that were acquired in 2016 even if they weren’t place in service until 2017 if your business use later falls to 50 or less you may have to recapture include in your income any excess depreciation see car used 50 or less for business later for more information if you acquired the car by gift or inheritance see pub 551 basis of assets for information on your basis in the car improvements a major improvement to a car is treated as a new item of 5year recovery property it is treated as placed in service in the year the improvement is made it doesn’t matter how old the car is when the improvement is added follow the same steps for depreciating the improvement as you would for depreciating the original cost of the car however you must treat the improvement and the car as a whole when applying the limits on the depreciation deductions your cars depreciation deduction for the year plus any section 179 deduction special depreciation allowance and depreciation on any improvements can’t be more than the depreciation limit that applies for that year see depreciation limits later car tradein if you traded one car the old car for another car the new car in 2017 there are two ways you can treat the transaction you can elect to treat the transaction as a taxfree disposition of the old car and the purchase of the new car if you make this election you treat the old car as disposed of at the time of the tradein the depreciable basis of the new car is the adjusted basis of the old car figured as if 100 of the cars use had been for business purposes plus any additional amount you paid for the new car you then figure your depreciation deduction for the new car beginning with the date you placed it in service you make this election by completing form 2106 part ii section d this method is explained later beginning at effect of tradein on basis if you don’t make the election described in 1 you must figure depreciation separately for the remaining basis of the old car and for any additional amount you paid for the new car you must apply two depreciation limits see depreciation limits later the limit that applies to the remaining basis of the old car generally is the amount that would have been allowed had you not traded in the old car the limit that applies to the additional amount you paid for the new car generally is the limit that applies for the tax year reduced by the depreciation allowance for the remaining basis of the old car you must use form 4562 to figure your depreciation deduction you can’t use form 2106 part ii section d this method is explained in pub 946 if you elect to use the method described in 1 you must do so on a timely filed tax return including extensions otherwise you must use the method described in 2 effect of tradein on basis the discussion that follows applies to tradeins of cars in 2017 where the election was made to treat the transaction as a taxfree disposition of the old car and the purchase of the new car for information on how to figure depreciation for cars involved in a likekind exchange tradein in 2017 for which the election wasn’t made see pub 946 and regulations section 1168 i6 d 3 traded car used only for business if you trade in a car you used only in your business for another car that will be used only in your business your original basis in the new car is your adjusted basis in the old car plus any additional amount you pay for the new car example paul trades in a car that has an adjusted basis of 5000 for a new car in addition he pays cash of 20000 for the new car his original basis of the new car is 25000 his 5000 adjusted basis in the old car plus the 20000 cash paid pauls unadjusted basis is 25000 unless he claims the section 179 deduction special depreciation allowance or has other increases or decreases to his original basis discussed under unadjusted basis earlier traded car used partly in business if you trade in a car you used partly in your business for a new car you will use in your business you must make a tradein adjustment for the personal use of the old car this adjustment has the effect of reducing your basis in your old car but not below zero for purposes of figuring your depreciation deduction for the new car this adjustment isn’t used however when you determine the gain or loss on the later disposition of the new car see pub 544 sales and other dispositions of assets for information on how to report the disposition of your car to figure the unadjusted basis of your new car for depreciation first add to your adjusted basis in the old car any additional amount you pay for the new car then subtract from that total the excess if any of the total of the amounts that would have been allowable as depreciation during the tax years before the trade if 100 of the use of the car had been business and investment use over the total of the amounts actually allowed as depreciation during those years for information about figuring depreciation see modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs next modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs the modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs is the name given to the tax rules for getting back recovering through depreciation deductions the cost of property used in a trade or business or to produce income the maximum amount you can deduct is limited depending on the year you placed your car in service see depreciation limits later recovery period under macrs cars are classified as 5year property you actually depreciate the cost of a car truck or van over a period of 6 calendar years this is because your car is generally treated as placed in service in the middle of the year and you claim depreciation for onehalf of both the first year and the sixth year for more information on the qualifications for this shorter recovery period and the percentages to use in figuring the depreciation deduction see chapter 4 of pub 946 depreciation methods you can use one of the following methods to depreciate your car the 200 declining balance method 200 db over a 5year recovery period that switches to the straight line method when that method provides an equal or greater deduction the 150 declining balance method 150 db over a 5year recovery period that switches to the straight line method when that method provides an equal or greater deduction the straight line method sl over a 5year recovery period if you use table 41 discussed later to determine your depreciation rate for 2017 you don’t need to determine in what year using the straight line method provides an equal or greater deduction this is because the chart has the switch to the straight line method built into its rates before choosing a method you may wish to consider the following facts using the straight line method provides equal yearly deductions throughout the recovery period using the declining balance methods provides greater deductions during the earlier recovery years with the deductions generally getting smaller each year macrs depreciation chart a 2017 macrs depreciation chart and instructions are included in this chapter as table 41 using this table will make it easy for you to figure the 2017 depreciation deduction for your car a similar chart appears in the instructions for form 2106 you may have to use the tables in pub 946 instead of using this macrs depreciation chart you must use the depreciation tables in pub 946 rather than the 2017 macrs depreciation chart in this publication if any one of the following four conditions applies to you you file your return on a fiscal year basis you file your return for a short tax year less than 12 months during the year all of the following conditions apply you placed some property in service from january through september you placed some property in service from october through december your basis in the property you placed in service from october through december excluding nonresidential real property residential rental property and property placed in service and disposed of in the same year was more than 40 of your total bases in all property you placed in service during the year you placed qualified property in service on an indian reservation depreciation in future years if you use the percentages from the chart you generally must continue to use them for the entire recovery period of your car however you can’t continue to use the chart if your basis in your car is adjusted because of a casualty in that case for the year of the adjustment and the remaining recovery period figure the depreciation without the chart using your adjusted basis in the car at the end of the year of the adjustment and over the remaining recovery period see figuring the deduction without using the tables in chapter 4 of pub 946 in future years don’t use the chart in this edition of the publication instead use the chart in the publication or the form instructions for those future years disposition of car during recovery period if you dispose of the car before the end of the recovery period you are generally allowed a half year of depreciation in the year of disposition unless you purchased the car during the last quarter of a year see depreciation deduction for the year of disposition under disposition of a car later for information on how to figure the depreciation allowed in the year of disposition how to use the 2017 chart to figure your depreciation deduction for 2017 find the percentage in the column of table 41 based on the date that you first placed the car in service and the depreciation method that you are using multiply the unadjusted basis of your car defined earlier by that percentage to determine the amount of your depreciation deduction if you prefer to figure your depreciation deduction without the help of the chart see pub 946 your deduction can’t be more than the maximum depreciation limit for cars see depreciation limits later example phil bought a used truck in february 2016 to use exclusively in his landscape business he paid 9200 for the truck with no tradein phil didn’t claim any section 179 deduction the truck didn’t qualify for the special depreciation allowance and he chose to use the 200 db method to get the largest depreciation deduction in the early years phil used the macrs depreciation chart in 2016 to find his percentage the unadjusted basis of his truck equals its cost because phil used it exclusively for business he multiplied the unadjusted basis of his truck 9200 by the percentage that applied 20 to figure his 2016 depreciation deduction of 1840 in 2017 phil used the truck for personal purposes when he repaired his fathers cabin his records show that the business use of his truck was 90 in 2017 phil used table 41 to find his percentage reading down the first column for the date placed in service and across to the 200 db column he locates his percentage 32 he multiplies the unadjusted basis of his truck 8280 9200 cost × 90 090 business use by 32 032 to figure his 2017 depreciation deduction of 2650 depreciation limits there are limits on the amount you can deduct for depreciation of your car truck or van the section 179 deduction and special depreciation allowance are treated as depreciation for purposes of the limits the maximum amount you can deduct each year depends on the year you place the car in service these limits are shown in the following tables maximum depreciation

the truck or van the maximum deduction is 7960 car used less than full year the depreciation limits aren’t reduced if you use a car for less than a full year this means that you don’t reduce the limit when you either place a car in service or dispose of a car during the year however the depreciation limits are reduced if you don’t use the car exclusively for business and investment purposes see reduction for personal use next reduction for personal use the depreciation limits are reduced based on your percentage of personal use if you use a car less than 100 in your business or work you must determine the depreciation deduction limit by multiplying the limit amount by the percentage of business and investment use during the tax year section 179 deduction the section 179 deduction is treated as a depreciation deduction if you place a car that isn’t a truck or van in service in 2017 use it only for business and choose the section 179 deduction the special depreciation allowance and the depreciation deduction for that car for 2017 is limited to 11160 example on september 4 2017 jack bought a used car for 10000 and placed it in service he used it 80 for his business and he chooses to take a section 179 deduction for the car the car isn’t qualified property for purposes of the special depreciation allowance before applying the limit jack figures his maximum section 179 deduction to be 8000 this is the cost of his qualifying property up to the maximum 510000 amount multiplied by his business use 10000 × 80 080 jack then figures that his section 179 deduction for 2017 is limited to 2528 80 of 3160 he then figures his unadjusted basis of 5472  10000 × 80 080 − 2528 for determining his depreciation deduction jack has reached his maximum depreciation deduction for 2017 for 2018 jack will use his unadjusted basis of 5472 to figure his depreciation deduction deductions in years after the recovery period if the depreciation deductions for your car are reduced under the passenger automobile limits discussed earlier you will have unrecovered basis in your car at the end of the recovery period if you continue to use your car for business you can deduct that unrecovered basis subject to depreciation limits after the recovery period ends unrecovered basis this is your cost or other basis in the car reduced by any cleanfuel vehicle deduction for vehicles placed in service before january 1 2006 alternative motor vehicle credit electric vehicle credit gas guzzler tax and depreciation including any special depreciation allowance discussed earlier unless you elect not to claim it and section 179 deductions that would have been allowable if you had used the car 100 for business and investment use the recovery period for 5year property your recovery period is 6 calendar years a part years depreciation is allowed in the first calendar year a full years depreciation is allowed in each of the next 4 calendar years and a part years depreciation is allowed in the 6th calendar year under macrs your recovery period is the same whether you use declining balance or straight line depreciation you determine your unrecovered basis in the 7th year after you placed the car in service how to treat unrecovered basis if you continue to use your car for business after the recovery period you can claim a depreciation deduction in each succeeding tax year until you recover your basis in the car the maximum amount you can deduct each year is determined by the date you placed the car in service and your businessuse percentage for example no deduction is allowed for a year you use your car 100 for personal purposes example in april 2011 bob bought and placed in service a car he used exclusively in his business the car cost 31500 bob didn’t claim a section 179 deduction or the special depreciation allowance for the car he continued to use the car 100 in his business throughout the recovery period 2011 through 2016 for those years bob used the macrs depreciation chart 200 declining balance method and the maximum depreciation deduction for cars table earlier for the applicable tax year to figure his depreciation deductions during the recovery period bobs depreciation deductions were subject to the depreciation limits so he will have unrecovered basis at the end of the recovery period as shown in the following table macrs deprec year

of 15265 31500 – 16235 if bob continued to use the car 100 for business in 2017 and later years he can claim a depreciation deduction equal to the lesser of 1775 or his remaining unrecovered basis if bobs business use of the car was less than 100 during any year his depreciation deduction would be less than the maximum amount allowable for that year however in determining his unrecovered basis in the car he would still reduce his original basis by the maximum amount allowable as if the business use had been 100 for example if bob had used his car 60 for business instead of 100 his allowable depreciation deductions would have been 9741 16235 × 60 060 but he still would have to reduce his basis by 16235 to determine his unrecovered basis table 41 2017 macrs depreciation chart use to figure depreciation for 2017 if you claim actual expenses for your car use the chart below to find the depreciation method and percentage to use for your 2017 return for cars placed in service in 2017 first using the left column find the date you first placed the car in service in 2017 then select the depreciation method and percentage from column a b or c following the rules explained in this chapter for cars placed in service before 2017 you must use the same method you used on last years return unless a decline in your business use requires you to change to the straight line method refer back to the macrs depreciation chart for the year you placed the car in service see car used 50 or less for business later multiply the unadjusted basis of your car by your business use percentage multiply the result by the percentage you found in the chart to find the amount of your depreciation deduction for 2017 also see depreciation limits earlier if you placed your car in service after september of any year and you placed other business property in service during the same year you may have to use the jan 1–sept 30 percentage instead of the oct 1–dec 31 percentage for your car to find out if this applies to you determine 1 the basis of all business property you placed in service after september of that year and 2 the basis of all business property you placed in service during that entire year if the basis of the property placed in service after september isn’t more than 40 of the basis of all property certain property is excluded placed in service for the entire year use the percentage for jan 1–sept 30 for figuring depreciation for your car see which convention applies in chapter 4 of pub 946 for more details example you buy machinery basis of 32000 in may 2017 and a new van basis of 20000 in october 2017 both used 100 in your business you use the percentage for jan 1–sept 30 2017 to figure the depreciation for your van this is because the 20000 basis of the property van placed in

in the car you can continue to claim depreciation see deductions in years after the recovery period under depreciation limits earlier car used 50 or less for business if you use your car 50 or less for qualified business use defined earlier under depreciation deduction either in the year the car is placed in service or in a later year special rules apply the rules that apply in these two situations are explained in the following paragraphs for this purpose car was defined earlier under actual car expenses and includes certain trucks and vans qualified business use 50 or less in year placed in service if you use your car 50 or less for qualified business use the following rules apply you can’t take the section 179 deduction you can’t take the special depreciation allowance you must figure depreciation using the straight line method over a 5year recovery period you must continue to use the straight line method even if your percentage of business use increases to more than 50 in a later year instead of making the computation yourself you can use column c of table 41 to find the percentage to use example in may 2017 dan bought a car for 17500 he used it 40 for his consulting business because he didn’t use the car more than 50 for business dan can’t take any section 179 deduction or special depreciation allowance and he must use the straight line method over a 5year recovery period to recover the cost of his car dan deducts 700 in 2017 this is the lesser of700  17500 cost × 40 040 business use × 10 recovery percentage from column c table 41  or1264 3160 maximum limit × 40 040 business use qualified business use 50 or less in a later year if you use your car more than 50 in qualified business use in the tax year it is placed in service but the business use drops to 50 or less in a later year you can no longer use an accelerated depreciation method for that car for the year the business use drops to 50 or less and all later years in the recovery period you must use the straight line depreciation method over a 5year recovery period in addition for the year your business use drops to 50 or less you must recapture include in your gross income any excess depreciation discussed later you also increase the adjusted basis of your car by the same amount example in june 2014 you purchased a car for exclusive use in your business you met the morethan50use test for the first 3 years of the recovery period 2014 through 2016 but failed to meet it in the fourth year 2017 you determine your depreciation for 2017 using 20 from column c of table 41  you also will have to determine and include in your gross income any excess depreciation discussed next excess depreciation you must include any excess depreciation in your gross income and add it to your cars adjusted basis for the first tax year in which you don’t use the car more than 50 in qualified business use use form 4797 sales of business property to figure and report the excess depreciation in your gross income excess depreciation is the amount of the depreciation deductions allowable for the car including any section 179 deduction claimed and any special depreciation allowance claimed for tax years in which you used the car more than 50 in qualified business use minus the amount of the depreciation deductions that would have been allowable for those years if you hadn’t used the car more than 50 in qualified business use for the year you placed it in service this means the amount of depreciation figured using the straight line method example in september 2013 you bought a car for 20500 and placed it in service you didn’t claim the section 179 deduction or the special depreciation allowance you used the car exclusively in qualified business use for 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 for those years you used the appropriate macrs depreciation chart to figure depreciation deductions totaling 13185 3160 for 2013 5100 for 2014 3050 for 2015 and 1875 for 2016 under the 200 db method during 2017 you used the car 30 for business and 70 for personal purposes since you didn’t meet the morethan50use test you must switch from the 200 db depreciation method to the straight line depreciation method for 2017 and include in gross income for 2017 your excess depreciation determined as follows total depreciation claimed macrs 200 db method 13185minus total

2110for the correct limit see maximum depreciation deduction for cars under depreciation limits earlier for the maximum amount of depreciation allowed each year in 2017 using form 4797 you figure and report the 2110 excess depreciation you must include in your gross income your adjusted basis in the car is also increased by 2110 your 2017 depreciation is 1230 20500 unadjusted basis × 30 030 business use percentage × 20 020 from column c of table 41 on the line for jan 1–sept 30 2012 however your depreciation deduction is limited to 563 1875 x 30 030 business use leasing a car if you lease a car truck or van that you use in your business you can use the standard mileage rate or actual expenses to figure your deductible expense this section explains how to figure actual expenses for a leased car truck or van deductible payments if you choose to use actual expenses you can deduct the part of each lease payment that is for the use of the vehicle in your business you can’t deduct any part of a lease payment that is for personal use of the vehicle such as commuting you must spread any advance payments over the entire lease period you can’t deduct any payments you make to buy a car truck or van even if the payments are called lease payments if you lease a car truck or van for 30 days or more you may have to reduce your lease payment deduction by an inclusion amount explained next inclusion amounts if you lease a car truck or van that you use in your business for a lease term of 30 days or more you may have to include an inclusion amount in your income for each tax year you lease the vehicle to do this you don’t add an amount to income instead you reduce your deduction for your lease payment this reduction has an effect similar to the limit on the depreciation deduction you would have on the vehicle if you owned it the inclusion amount is a percentage of part of the fair market value of the leased vehicle multiplied by the percentage of business and investment use of the vehicle for the tax year it is prorated for the number of days of the lease term in the tax year the inclusion amount applies to each tax year that you lease the vehicle if the fair market value defined next when the lease began was more than the amounts shown in the following tables cars except for trucks and vansyear lease began fair market value2013–2017 190002010–2012 18500trucks and vans year lease began fair market value2014–2017 195002010–2013 19000fair market value fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and seller neither having to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of all the necessary facts sales of similar property around the same date may be helpful in figuring the fair market value of the property figure the fair market value on the first day of the lease term if the capitalized cost of a car is specified in the lease agreement use that amount as the fair market value figuring the inclusion amount inclusion amounts are listed in appendices a1 through a5 for cars and in appendices b1 through b5 for trucks and vans if the fair market value of the vehicle is 100000 or less use the appropriate appendix depending on the year you first placed the vehicle in service to determine the inclusion amount if the fair market value is more than 100000 see the revenue procedure s identified in the footnote of the appendices for the inclusion amount for each tax year during which you lease the car for business determine your inclusion amount by following these three steps locate the appendix that applies to you to find the inclusion amount do the following find the line that includes the fair market value of the car on the first day of the lease term go across the line to the column for the tax year in which the car is used under the lease to find the dollar amount for the last tax year of the lease use the dollar amount for the preceding year prorate the dollar amount from 1b for the number of days of the lease term included in the tax year multiply the prorated amount from 2 by the percentage of business and investment use for the tax year this is your inclusion amount example on january 17 2017 you leased a car for 3 years and placed it in service for use in your business the car had a fair market value of 32250 on the first day of the lease term you use the car 75 for business and 25 for personal purposes during each year of the lease assuming you continue to use the car 75 for business you use appendix a5 to arrive at the following inclusion amounts for each year of the lease for the last tax year of the lease 2020 you use the amount for the preceding year tax year dollar amount proration business use inclusion

deduct lease payments you must reduce your deduction by the inclusion amount figured for that year leased car changed from business to personal use if you lease a car for business use and in a later year change it to personal use follow the rules explained earlier under figuring the inclusion amount for the tax year in which you stop using the car for business use the dollar amount for the previous tax year prorate the dollar amount for the number of days in the lease term that fall within the tax year example on august 16 2016 will leased a car with a fair market value of 38500 for 3 years he used the car exclusively in his own data processing business on november 5 2017 will closed his business and went to work for a company where he isn’t required to use a car for business using appendix a4 will figured his inclusion amount for 2016 and 2017 as shown in the following table and reduced his deductions for lease payments by those amounts tax year dollar amount proration business

must determine the cars fair market value on the date of conversion then figure the inclusion amount using the rules explained earlier under figuring the inclusion amount use the fair market value on the date of conversion example in march 2015 janice leased a car for 4 years for personal use on june 1 2017 she started working as a selfemployed advertising consultant and started using the leased car for business purposes her records show that her business use for june 1 through december 31 was 60 to figure her inclusion amount for 2017 janice obtained an appraisal from an independent car leasing company that showed the fair market value of her 2015 car on june 1 2017 was 21650 using appendix a5 janice figured her inclusion amount for 2017 as shown in the following table tax year

that isn’t recognized see pub 547 for more information tradein when you trade in an old car for a new one the transaction is considered a likekind exchange generally no gain or loss is recognized for exceptions see chapter 1 of pub 544 in a tradein situation your basis in the new property is generally your adjusted basis in the old property plus any additional amount you pay see unadjusted basis

you dispose of your car before the end of its recovery period you are allowed a reduced depreciation deduction for the year of disposition to figure the reduced depreciation deduction for a car disposed of in 2017 first determine the depreciation deduction for the full year using table 41 if you used a date placed in service line for jan 1–sept 30 you can deduct onehalf of the depreciation amount figured for the full year figure your depreciation deduction for the full year using the rules explained in this chapter and deduct 50 of that amount with your other actual car expenses if you used a date placed in service line for oct 1–dec 31 you can deduct a percentage of the depreciation amount figured for the full year the percentage you use is determined by the month you disposed of the car figure your depreciation deduction for the full year using the rules explained in this chapter and multiply the result by the percentage from the following table for the month that you disposed of the car month percentage jan feb march 125april may june 375july aug sept 625oct nov dec 875don’t use this table if you are a fiscal year filer see sale or other disposition before the recovery period ends in chapter 4 of pub 9465 recordkeeping if you deduct travel entertainment gift or transportation expenses you must be able to prove substantiate certain elements of expense this chapter discusses the records you need to keep to prove these expenses if you keep timely and accurate records you will have support to show the irs if your tax return is ever examined you will also have proof of expenses that your employer may require if you are reimbursed under an accountable plan these plans are discussed in chapter 6 under reimbursements how to prove expenses table 51 is a summary of records you need to prove each expense discussed in this publication you must be able to prove the elements listed across the top portion of the chart you prove them by having the information and receipts where needed for the expenses listed in the first column you can’t deduct amounts that you approximate or estimate you should keep adequate records to prove your expenses or have sufficient evidence that will support your own statement you must generally prepare a written record for it to be considered adequate this is because written evidence is more reliable than oral evidence alone however if you prepare a record on a computer it is considered an adequate record what are adequate records you should keep the proof you need in an account book diary log statement of expense trip sheets or similar record you should also keep documentary evidence that together with your record will support each element of an expense documentary evidence you generally must have documentary evidence such as receipts canceled checks or bills to support your expenses exception documentary evidence isn’t needed if any of the following conditions apply you have meals or lodging expenses while traveling away from home for which you account to your employer under an accountable plan and you use a per diem allowance method that includes meals andor lodging  accountable plans and per diem allowances are discussed in chapter 6 your expense other than lodging is less than 75 you have a transportation expense for which a receipt isn’t readily available adequate evidence documentary evidence ordinarily will be considered adequate if it shows the amount date place and essential character of the expense for example a hotel receipt is enough to support expenses for business travel if it has all of the following information the name and location of the hotel the dates you stayed there separate amounts for charges such as lodging meals and telephone calls a restaurant receipt is enough to prove an expense for a business meal if it has all of the following information the name and location of the restaurant the number of people served the date and amount of the expense if a charge is made for items other than food and beverages the receipt must show that this is the case canceled check a canceled check together with a bill from the payee ordinarily establishes the cost however a canceled check by itself doesn’t prove a business expense without other evidence to show that it was for a business purpose duplicate information you don‘t have to record information in your account book or other record that duplicates information shown on a receipt as long as your records and receipts complement each other in an orderly manner you don’t have to record amounts your employer pays directly for any ticket or other travel item however if you charge these items to your employer through a credit card or otherwise you must keep a record of the amounts you spend timely kept records you should record the elements of an expense or of a business use at or near the time of the expense or use and support it with sufficient documentary evidence a timely kept record has more value than a statement prepared later when generally there is a lack of accurate recall you don’t need to write down the elements of every expense on the day of the expense if you maintain a log on a weekly basis that accounts for use during the week the log is considered a timely kept record if you give your employer client or customer an expense account statement it can also be considered a timely kept record this is true if you copy it from your account book diary log statement of expense trip sheets or similar record proving business purpose you must generally provide a written statement of the business purpose of an expense however the degree of proof varies according to the circumstances in each case if the business purpose of an expense is clear from the surrounding circumstances then you don’t need to give a written explanation example if you are a sales representative who calls on customers on an established sales route you don’t have to give a written explanation of the business purpose for traveling that route you can satisfy the requirements by recording the length of the delivery route once the date of each trip at or near the time of the trips and the total miles you drove the car during the tax year you could also establish the date of each trip with a receipt record of delivery or other documentary evidence confidential information you don’t need to put confidential information relating to an element of a deductible expense such as the place business purpose or business relationship in your account book diary or other record however you do have to record the information elsewhere at or near the time of the expense and have it available to fully prove that element of the expense what if i have incomplete records if you don’t have complete records to prove an element of an expense then you must prove the element with your own written or oral statement containing specific information about the element and other supporting evidence that is sufficient to establish the element if the element is the description of a gift or the cost time place or date of an expense the supporting evidence must be either direct evidence or documentary evidence direct evidence can be written statements or the oral testimony of your guests or other witnesses setting forth detailed information about the element documentary evidence can be receipts paid bills or similar evidence if the element is either the business relationship of your guests or the business purpose of the amount spent the supporting evidence can be circumstantial rather than direct for example the nature of your work such as making deliveries provides circumstantial evidence of the use of your car for business purposes invoices of deliveries establish when you used the car for business table 51 how to prove certain business expenses if you have expenses for   then you must keep records that show details of the following elements    amount time place or description business purpose business relationship travel cost of each separate expense for travel lodging and meals incidental expenses may be totaled in reasonable categories such as taxis fees and tips etc dates you left and returned for each trip and number of days spent on business destination or area of your travel name of city town or other designation purpose business purpose for the expense or the business benefit gained or expected to be gained relationship naentertainment cost of each separate expense incidental expenses such as taxis telephones etc may be totaled on a daily basis date of entertainment also see business purpose  name and address or location of place of entertainment type of entertainment if not otherwise apparent also see business purpose  purpose business purpose for the expense or the business benefit gained or expected to be gained for entertainment the nature of the business discussion or activity if the entertainment was directly before or after a business discussion the date place nature and duration of the business discussion and the identities of the persons who took part in both the business discussion and the entertainment activity relationship occupations or other information such as names titles or other designations about the recipients that shows their business relationship to you for entertainment you must also prove that you or your employee was present if the entertainment was a business meal gifts cost of the gift date of the gift description of the gift transportation cost of each separate expense for car expenses the cost of the car and any improvements the date you started using it for business the mileage for each business use and the total miles for the year date of the expense for car expenses the date of the use of the car your business destination purpose business purpose for the expense relationship nasampling you can keep an adequate record for parts of a tax year and use that record to prove the amount of business or investment use for the entire year you must demonstrate by other evidence that the periods for which an adequate record is kept are representative of the use throughout the tax year example you use your car to visit the offices of clients meet with suppliers and other subcontractors and pick up and deliver items to clients there is no other business use of the car but you and your family use the car for personal purposes you keep adequate records during the first week of each month that show that 75 of the use of the car is for business invoices and bills show that your business use continues at the same rate during the later weeks of each month your weekly records are representative of the use of the car each month and are sufficient evidence to support the percentage of business use for the year exceptional circumstances you can satisfy the substantiation requirements with other evidence if because of the nature of the situation in which an expense is made you can’t get a receipt this applies if all the following are true you were unable to obtain evidence for an element of the expense or use that completely satisfies the requirements explained earlier under what are adequate records you are unable to obtain evidence for an element that completely satisfies the two rules listed earlier under what if i have incomplete records you have presented other evidence for the element that is the best proof possible under the circumstances destroyed records if you can’t produce a receipt because of reasons beyond your control you can prove a deduction by reconstructing your records or expenses reasons beyond your control include fire flood and other casualties table 52 daily business mileage and expense log name odometer readings expenses date destination city town or areabusiness purpose start stop miles this trip type gas oil tolls etc amount weekly total total yeartodate separating and combining expenses this section explains when expenses must be kept separate and when expenses can be combined separating expenses each separate payment is generally considered a separate expense for example if you entertain a customer or client at dinner and then go to the theater the dinner expense and the cost of the theater tickets are two separate expenses you must record them separately in your records season or series tickets if you buy season or series tickets for business use you must treat each ticket in the series as a separate item to determine the cost of individual tickets divide the total cost but not more than face value by the number of games or performances in the series you must keep records to show whether you use each ticket as a gift or entertainment also you must be able to prove the cost of nonluxury box seat tickets if you rent a skybox or other private luxury box for more than one event see entertainment tickets in chapter 2 combining items you can make one daily entry in your record for reasonable categories of expenses examples are taxi fares telephone calls or other incidental travel costs meals should be in a separate category you can include tips for mealrelated services with the costs of the meals expenses of a similar nature occurring during the course of a single event are considered a single expense for example if during entertainment at a cocktail lounge you pay separately for each serving of refreshments the total expense for the refreshments is treated as a single expense car expenses you can account for several uses of your car that can be considered part of a single use such as a round trip or uninterrupted business use with a single record minimal personal use such as a stop for lunch on the way between two business stops isn’t an interruption of business use example you make deliveries at several different locations on a route that begins and ends at your employers business premises and that includes a stop at the business premises between two deliveries you can account for these using a single record of miles driven gift expenses you don’t always have to record the name of each recipient of a gift a general listing will be enough if it is evident that you aren’t trying to avoid the 25 annual limit on the amount you can deduct for gifts to any one person for example if you buy a large number of tickets to local high school basketball games and give one or two tickets to each of many customers it is usually enough to record a general description of the recipients allocating total cost if you can prove the total cost of travel or entertainment but you can’t prove how much it cost for each person who participated in the event you may have to allocate the total cost among you and your guests on a pro rata basis to do so you must establish the number of persons who participated in the event an allocation would be needed for example if you didn’t have a business relationship with all of your guests see allocating between business and nonbusiness in chapter 2 if your return is examined if your return is examined you may have to provide additional information to the irs this information could be

the understanding that you will pay your own expenses in this situation you have no reimbursement or allowance arrangement and you don’t have to read this section on reimbursements instead see completing forms 2106 and 2106ez later for information on completing your tax return reimbursement allowance or advance a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement is a system or plan that an employer uses to pay substantiate and recover the expenses advances reimbursements and amounts charged to the employer for employee business expenses arrangements include per diem and car allowances a per diem allowance is a fixed amount of daily reimbursement your employer gives you for your lodging meals and incidental expenses when you are away from home on business the term incidental expenses is defined in chapter 1 under standard meal allowance a car allowance is an amount your employer gives you for the business use of your car your employer should tell you what method of reimbursement is used and what records you must provide employers if you are an employer and you reimburse employee business expenses how you treat this reimbursement on your employees form w2 depends in part on whether you have an accountable plan reimbursements treated as paid under an accountable plan as explained next aren’t reported as pay reimbursements treated as paid under nonaccountable plans as explained later are reported as pay see pub 15 circular e employers tax guide for information on employee pay accountable plans to be an accountable plan your employers reimbursement or allowance arrangement must include all of the following rules your expenses must have a business connection—that is you must have paid or incurred deductible expenses while performing services as an employee of your employer you must adequately account to your employer for these expenses within a reasonable period of time you must return any excess reimbursement or allowance within a reasonable period of time adequate accounting and returning excess reimbursements are discussed later an excess reimbursement or allowance is any amount you are paid that is more than the businessrelated expenses that you adequately accounted for to your employer reasonable period of time the definition of reasonable period of time depends on the facts and circumstances of your situation however regardless of the facts and circumstances of your situation actions that take place within the times specified in the following list will be treated as taking place within a reasonable period of time you receive an advance within 30 days of the time you have an expense you adequately account for your expenses within 60 days after they were paid or incurred you return any excess reimbursement within 120 days after the expense was paid or incurred you are given a periodic statement at least quarterly that asks you to either return or adequately account for outstanding advances and you comply within 120 days of the statement employee meets accountable plan rules if you meet the three rules for accountable plans your employer shouldn’t include any reimbursements in your income in box 1 of your form w2 if your expenses equal your reimbursements you don’t complete form 2106 you have no deduction since your expenses and reimbursement are equal if your employer included reimbursements in box 1 of your form w2 and you meet all the rules for accountable plans ask your employer for a corrected form w2 accountable plan rules not met even though you are reimbursed under an accountable plan some of your expenses may not meet all three rules all reimbursements that fail to meet all three rules for accountable plans are generally treated as having been reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan discussed later failure to return excess reimbursements if you are reimbursed under an accountable plan but you fail to return within a reasonable time any amounts in excess of the substantiated amounts the amounts paid in excess of the substantiated expenses are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan see reasonable period of time earlier and returning excess reimbursements later reimbursement of nondeductible expenses you may be reimbursed under your employers accountable plan for expenses related to that employers business some of which are deductible as employee business expenses and some of which aren’t deductible the reimbursements you receive for the nondeductible expenses don’t meet rule 1 for accountable plans and they are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan example your employers plan reimburses you for travel expenses while away from home on business and also for meals when you work late at the office even though you aren’t away from home the part of the arrangement that reimburses you for the nondeductible meals when you work late at the office is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan the employer makes the decision whether to reimburse employees under an accountable plan or a nonaccountable plan if you are an employee who receives payments under a nonaccountable plan you can’t convert these amounts to payments under an accountable plan by voluntarily accounting to your employer for the expenses and voluntarily returning excess reimbursements to the employer adequate accounting one of the rules for an accountable plan is that you must adequately account to your employer for your expenses you adequately account by giving your employer a statement of expense an account book a diary or a similar record in which you entered each expense at or near the time you had it along with documentary evidence such as receipts of your travel mileage and other employee business expenses see table 51 in chapter 5 for details you need to enter in your record and documents you need to prove certain expenses a per diem or car allowance satisfies the adequate accounting requirement under certain conditions see per diem and car allowances later you must account for all amounts you received from your employer during the year as advances reimbursements or allowances this includes amounts you charged to your employer by credit card or other method you must give your employer the same type of records and supporting information that you would have to give to the irs if the irs questioned a deduction on your return you must pay back the amount of any reimbursement or other expense allowance for which you don’t adequately account or that is more than the amount for which you accounted per diem and car allowances if your employer reimburses you for your expenses using a per diem or a car allowance you can generally use the allowance as proof for the amount of your expenses a per diem or car allowance satisfies the adequate accounting requirements for the amount of your expenses only if all the following conditions apply your employer reasonably limits payments of your expenses to those that are ordinary and necessary in the conduct of the trade or business the allowance is similar in form to and not more than the federal rate defined later you prove the time dates place and business purpose of your expenses to your employer as explained in table 51 within a reasonable period of time you aren’t related to your employer as defined next if you are related to your employer you must be able to prove your expenses to the irs even if you have already adequately accounted to your employer and returned any excess reimbursement if the irs finds that an employers travel allowance practices are not based on reasonably accurate estimates of travel costs including recognition of cost differences in different areas for per diem amounts you won’t be considered to have accounted to your employer in this case you must be able to prove your expenses to the irs related to employer you are related to your employer if your employer is your brother or sister half brother or half sister spouse ancestor or lineal descendantyour employer is a corporation in which you own directly or indirectly more than 10 in value of the outstanding stock or certain relationships such as grantor fiduciary or beneficiary exist between you a trust and your employer you may be considered to indirectly own stock for purposes of 2 if you have an interest in a corporation partnership estate or trust that owns the stock or if a member of your family or your partner owns the stock the federal rate the federal rate can be figured using any one of the following methods for per diem amounts the regular federal per diem rate the standard meal allowance the highlow rate for car expenses the standard mileage rate a fixed and variable rate favr for per diem amounts use the rate in effect for the area where you stop for sleep or rest regular federal per diem rate the regular federal per diem rate is the highest amount that the federal government will pay to its employees for lodging meals and incidental expenses or meals and incidental expenses only while they are traveling away from home in a particular area the rates are different for different locations your employer should have these rates available you can also find federal per diem rates at gsagovperdiem the standard meal allowance the standard meal allowance is the federal mie rate for travel in 2017 the rate for most small localities in the united states is 51 a day most major cities and many other localities qualify for higher rates you can find this information at gsagovperdiem you receive an allowance only for meals and incidental expenses when your employer does one of the following provides you with lodging furnishes it in kind reimburses you based on your receipts for the actual cost of your lodging pays the hotel motel etc directly for your lodging doesn’t have a reasonable belief that you had or will have lodging expenses such as when you stay with friends or relatives or sleep in the cab of your truck figures the allowance on a basis similar to that used in figuring your compensation such as number of hours worked or miles traveled highlow rate this is a simplified method of figuring the federal per diem rate for travel within the continental united states it eliminates the need to keep a current list of the per diem rates for each city under the highlow method the per diem amount for travel during january through september of 2017 is 282 including 68 for mie for certain highcost locations all other areas have a per diem amount of 189 including 57 for mie for more information see notice 201658 which can be found at irsgovirb201641irbar06html effective october 1 2017 the per diem rate for certain highcost locations increased to 284 including 68 for mie the rate for all other locations increased to 191 including 57 for mie employers who didn’t use the highlow method during the first 9 months of 2017 can’t begin to use it before 2018 for more information see notice 201754 which can be found at irsgovirb201742irbar06html and rev proc 201147 at irsgovirb201142irbar12html prorating the standard meal allowance on partial days of travel the standard meal allowance is for a full 24hour day of travel if you travel for part of a day such as on the days you depart and return you must prorate the fullday mie rate this rule also applies if your employer uses the regular federal per diem rate or the highlow rate you can use either of the following methods to figure the federal mie for that day method 1 for the day you depart add 3  4 of the standard meal allowance amount for that day for the day you return add 3  4 of the standard meal allowance amount for the preceding day method 2 prorate the standard meal allowance using any method you consistently apply in accordance with reasonable business practice for example an employer can treat 2 full days of per diem that includes mie paid for travel away from home from 9 am of one day to 5 pm of the next day as being no more than the federal rate this is true even though a federal employee would be limited to a reimbursement of mie for only 1½ days of the federal mie rate the standard mileage rate this is a set rate per mile that you can use to figure your deductible car expenses for 2017 the standard mileage rate for the cost of operating your car for business use is 535 cents 0535 per mile fixed and variable rate favr this is an allowance your employer may use to reimburse your car expenses under this method your employer pays an allowance that includes a combination of payments covering fixed and variable costs such as a centspermile rate to cover your variable operating costs such as gas oil etc plus a flat amount to cover your fixed costs such as depreciation or lease payments insurance etc if your employer chooses to use this method your employer will request the necessary records from you reporting your expenses with a per diem or car allowance if your reimbursement is in the form of an allowance received under an accountable plan the following facts affect your reporting the federal rate whether the allowance or your actual expenses were more than the federal rate the following discussions explain where to report your expenses depending upon how the amount of your allowance compares to the federal rate allowance less than or equal to the federal rate if your allowance is less than or equal to the federal rate the allowance won’t be included in box 1 of your form w2 you don’t need to report the related expenses or the allowance on your return if your expenses are equal to or less than the allowance however if your actual expenses are more than your allowance you can complete form 2106 and deduct the excess amount on schedule a form 1040 if you are using actual expenses you must be able to prove to the irs the total amount of your expenses and reimbursements for the entire year if you are using the standard meal allowance or the standard mileage rate you don’t have to prove that amount example 1 in april jeremy takes a 2day business trip to denver the federal rate for denver is 247 178 lodging  69 mie per day as required by his employers accountable plan he accounts for the time dates place and business purpose of the trip his employer reimburses him 247 a day 494 total for living expenses jeremys living expenses in denver aren’t more than 247 a day jeremys employer doesn’t include any of the reimbursement on his form w2 and jeremy doesn’t deduct the expenses on his return example 2 in june matt takes a 2day business trip to boston matts employer uses the highlow method to reimburse employees since boston is a highcost area matt is given an advance of 282 214 lodging  68 mie a day 564 total for his lodging meals and incidental expenses matts actual expenses totaled 700 since matts 700 of expenses are more than his 564 advance he includes the excess expenses when he itemizes his deductions matt completes form 2106 showing all of his expenses and reimbursements he must also allocate his reimbursement between his meals and other expenses as discussed later under completing forms 2106 and 2106ez example 3 nicole drives 10000 miles in 2017 for business under her employers accountable plan she accounts for the time dates place and business purpose of each trip her employer pays her a mileage allowance of 40 cents 040 a mile since nicoles 5350 expense figured under the standard mileage rate 10000 miles x 535 cents 0535 is more than her 4000 reimbursement 10000 miles × 40 cents 040 she itemizes her deductions to claim the excess expense nicole completes form 2106 showing all her expenses and reimbursements and enters 1350 5350 − 4000 as an itemized deduction allowance more than the federal rate if your allowance is more than the federal rate your employer must include the allowance amount up to the federal rate under code l in box 12 of your form w2 this amount isn’t taxable however the excess allowance will be included in box 1 of your form w2 you must report this part of your allowance as if it were wage income if your actual expenses are less than or equal to the federal rate you don’t complete form 2106 or claim any of your expenses on your return however if your actual expenses are more than the federal rate you can complete form 2106 and deduct those excess expenses you must report on form 2106 your reimbursements up to the federal rate as shown under code l in box 12 of your form w2 and all your expenses you should be able to prove these amounts to the irs example 1 laura lives and works in austin in july her employer sent her to albuquerque for 4 days on business lauras employer paid the hotel directly for her lodging and reimbursed laura 65 a day 260 total for meals and incidental expenses lauras actual meal expenses weren’t more than the federal rate for albuquerque which is 51 per day table 61 reporting travel entertainment gift and car expenses and reimbursements if the type of reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement is under then the employer reports on form w2 and the employee reports on form 2106 an accountable plan with actual expense reimbursement adequate accounting made and excess returned no amount no amount actual expense reimbursement adequate accounting and return of excess both required but excess not returned the excess amount as wages in box 1 no amount per diem or mileage allowance up to the federal rate adequate accounting made and excess returned no amount all expenses and reimbursements only if excess expenses are claimed otherwise form is not filed per diem or mileage allowance up to the federal rate adequate accounting and return of excess both required but excess not returned the excess amount as wages in box 1 the amount up to the federal rate is reported only under code l in box 12 of form w2—it isn’t reported in box 1 no amount per diem or mileage allowance exceeds the federal rate adequate accounting up to the federal rate only and excess not returned the excess amount as wages in box 1 the amount up to the federal rate is reported only under code l in box 12 of form w2—it isn’t reported in box 1 all expenses and reimbursements reported under code l in box 12 of form w2 only if expenses in excess of the federal rate are claimed otherwise form isn’t filed a nonaccountable plan with either adequate accounting or return of excess or both not required by plan the entire amount as wages in box 1 all expenses no reimbursement plan the entire amount as wages in box 1 all expenses  you may be able to use form 2106ez see completing forms 2106 and 2106ez later her employer included the 56 that was more than the federal rate  65 − 51 × 4 in box 1 of lauras form w2 her employer shows 204 51 a day × 4 under code l in box 12 of her form w2 this amount isn’t included in lauras income laura doesn’t have to complete form 2106 however she must include the 56 in her gross income as wages by reporting the total amount shown in box 1 of her form w2 example 2 joe also lives in austin and works for the same employer as laura in may the employer sent joe to san diego for 4 days and paid the hotel directly for joes hotel bill the employer reimbursed joe 75 a day for his meals and incidental expenses the federal rate for san diego is 64 a day joe can prove that his actual meal expenses totaled 380 his employers accountable plan won’t pay more than 75 a day for travel to san diego so joe doesn’t give his employer the records that prove that he actually spent 380 however he does account for the time place and business purpose of the trip this is joes only business trip this year joe was reimbursed 300 75 × 4 days which is 44 more than the federal rate of 256 64 × 4 days the employer includes the 44 as income on joes form w2 in box 1 the employer also enters 256 under code l in box 12 of joes form w2 joe completes form 2106 to figure his deductible expenses he enters the total of his actual expenses for the year 380 on form 2106 he also enters the reimbursements that weren’t included in his income 256 his total deductible expense before the 50 limit is 124 after he figures the 50 limit on his unreimbursed meals and entertainment he will include the balance 62 as an itemized deduction example 3 debbie drives 10000 miles in 2017 for business under her employers accountable plan she gets reimbursed 60 cents 060 a mile which is more than the standard mileage rate her total reimbursement is 6000 debbies employer must include the reimbursement amount up to the standard mileage rate 5350 10000 × 535 cents 0535 under code l in box 12 of her form w2 that amount isn’t taxable her employer must also include 650 6000 − 5350 in box 1 of her form w2 this is the reimbursement that is more than the standard mileage rate if debbies expenses are equal to or less than the standard mileage rate she wouldn’t complete form 2106 if her expenses are more than the standard mileage rate she would complete form 2106 and report her total expenses and reimbursement shown under code l in box 12 of her form w2 she would then claim the excess expenses as an itemized deduction returning excess reimbursements under an accountable plan you are required to return any excess reimbursement or other expense allowances for your business expenses to the person paying the reimbursement or allowance excess reimbursement means any amount for which you didn’t adequately account within a reasonable period of time for example if you received a travel advance and you didn’t spend all the money on businessrelated expenses or you don’t have proof of all your expenses you have an excess reimbursement adequate accounting and reasonable period of time were discussed earlier in this chapter travel advance you receive a travel advance if your employer provides you with an expense allowance before you actually have the expense and the allowance is reasonably expected to be no more than your expense under an accountable plan you are required to adequately account to your employer for this advance and to return any excess within a reasonable period of time if you don’t adequately account for or dont return any excess advance within a reasonable period of time the amount you don’t account for or return will be treated as having been paid under a nonaccountable plan discussed later unproven amounts if you don’t prove that you actually traveled on each day for which you received a per diem or car allowance proving the elements described in table 51  you must return this unproven amount of the travel advance within a reasonable period of time if you don’t do this the unproven amount will be considered paid under a nonaccountable plan discussed later per diem allowance more than federal rate if your employers accountable plan pays you an allowance that is higher than the federal rate you don’t have to return the difference between the two rates for the period you can prove businessrelated travel expenses however the difference will be reported as wages on your form w2 this excess amount is considered paid under a nonaccountable plan discussed later example your employer sends you on a 5day business trip to phoenix in march 2017 and gives you a 400 80 × 5 days advance to cover your meals and incidental expenses the federal per diem for meals and incidental expenses for phoenix is 59 your trip lasts only 3 days under your employers accountable plan you must return the 160 80 × 2 days advance for the 2 days you didn’t travel for the 3 days you did travel you don’t have to return the 63 difference between the allowance you received and the federal rate for phoenix  80 − 59 × 3 days however the 63 will be reported on your form w2 as wages nonaccountable plans a nonaccountable plan is a reimbursement or expense allowance arrangement that doesn’t meet one or more of the three rules listed earlier under accountable plans in addition even if your employer has an accountable plan the following payments will be treated as being paid under a nonaccountable plan excess reimbursements you fail to return to your employer reimbursement of nondeductible expenses related to your employers business see reimbursement of nondeductible expenses earlier under accountable plans an arrangement that repays you for business expenses by reducing the amount reported as your wages salary or other pay will be treated as a nonaccountable plan this is because you are entitled to receive the full amount of your pay whether or not you have any business expenses if you aren’t sure if the reimbursement or expense allowance arrangement is an accountable or nonaccountable plan ask your employer reporting your expenses under a nonaccountable plan your employer will combine the amount of any reimbursement or other expense allowance paid to you under a nonaccountable plan with your wages salary or other pay your employer will report the total in box 1 of your form w2 you must complete form 2106 or 2106ez and itemize your deductions to deduct your expenses for travel transportation meals or entertainment your meal and entertainment expenses will be subject to the 50 limit discussed in chapter 2 also your total expenses will be subject to the 2ofadjustedgrossincome limit that applies to most miscellaneous itemized deductions example 1 kims employer gives her 1000 a month 12000 total for the year for her business expenses kim doesn’t have to provide any proof of her expenses to her employer and kim can keep any funds that she doesn’t spend kim is being reimbursed under a nonaccountable plan her employer will include the 12000 on kims form w2 as if it were wages if kim wants to deduct her business expenses she must complete form 2106 or 2106ez and itemize her deductions example 2 kevin is paid 2000 a month by his employer on days that he travels away from home on business his employer designates 50 a day of his salary as paid to reimburse his travel expenses because his employer would pay kevin his monthly salary whether or not he was traveling away from home the arrangement is a nonaccountable plan no part of the 50 a day designated by his employer is treated as paid under an accountable plan rules for independent contractors and clients this section provides rules for independent contractors who incur expenses on behalf of a client or customer the rules cover the reporting and substantiation of certain expenses discussed in this publication and they affect both independent contractors and their clients or customers you are considered an independent contractor if you are selfemployed and you perform services for a customer or client accounting to your client if you received a reimbursement or an allowance for travel entertainment or gift expenses that you incurred on behalf of a client you should provide an adequate accounting of these expenses to your client if you don’t account to your client for these expenses you must include any reimbursements or allowances in income you must keep adequate records of these expenses whether or not you account to your client for these expenses if you don’t separately account for and seek reimbursement for meals and entertainment in connection with providing services for a client you are subject to the 50 limit on those expenses see 50 limit in chapter 2 adequate accounting as a selfemployed person you adequately account by reporting your actual expenses you should follow the recordkeeping rules in chapter 5 how to report for information on how to report expenses on your tax return see selfemployed at the beginning of this chapter required records for clients or customers if you are a client or customer you generally don’t have to keep records to prove the reimbursements or allowances you give in the course of your business to an independent contractor for travel or gift expenses incurred on your behalf however you must keep records if you reimburse the contractor for entertainment expenses incurred on your behalf and the contractor adequately accounts to you for these expenses contractor adequately accounts if the contractor adequately accounts to you for entertainment expenses you the client or customer must keep records documenting each element of the expense as explained in chapter 5 use your records as proof for a deduction on your tax return if entertainment expenses are accounted for separately you are subject to the 50 limit on entertainment if the contractor adequately accounts to you for reimbursed amounts you don’t have to report the amounts on an information return contractor doesn’t adequately account if the contractor doesn’t adequately account to you for allowances or reimbursements of entertainment expenses you don’t have to keep records of these items you aren’t subject to the 50 limit on entertainment in this case you can deduct the reimbursements or allowances as payment for services if they are ordinary and necessary business expenses however you must file form 1099misc to report amounts paid to the
