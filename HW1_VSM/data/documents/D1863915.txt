danny boy— the mystery solvedby michael robinson oh danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling anyone who plays irish music must be ready to field countless requests for this song particularly around st patricks day there is no doubt about its popularity with those who know little about traditional irish music and even with the older generation of irishamericans but newly arrived immigrants from ireland have frequently never heard of danny boy where did the song come from is it irish at all those who subscribe to the internet irish music list irtradl may have seen a discussion of these points by folk music experts john moulden and philippe varlet interestingly the answer can be found in the collection of traditional irish harp music made by edward bunting a little more than 200 years agoi would also like to extend my thanks to jochen lueg of limavady northern ireland a place that will play a large role in my story he puts out a very lively newsletter of local happenings the roe valley news browser and he is also a good photographer he has generously allowed me to reproduce some of his photos on this site to begin with danny boy is one of over 100 songs composed to the same tune the author was an english lawyer frederic edward weatherly 18481929 who was also a songwriter and radio entertainer in 1910 he wrote the words and music for an unsuccessful song he called danny boy  in 1912 his sisterinlaw in america sent him a tune called the londonderry air or possibly something else as discussed in section 3 which he had never heard before he immediately noticed that the melody was perfectly fitted to his danny boy lyrics and published a revised version of the song in 1913 as far as is known weatherly never set foot in ireland if you would like to see fred weatherlys lyrics look at this site  if you have any questions on this topic please read all three sections of this article to see if the answer is there before contacting me the publisher boosey accepted the song and then it came to light that an old friend of weatherleys alfred perceval graves author of trottin to the fair… had already written two lyrics to the melody graves took strong except to having the folktune poached and it seems that the friendship with weatherly came to an abrupt end michael r turner and antony miall the edwardian songbook drawingroom ballads 19001914 methuen london 1982 p 113the most prolific poet of the edwardian—and for that matter victorian and georgian—ballad the genial and indefatiguable fred e frederick edward weatherly 18481929 was virtually a oneman song factory seven of his lyrics appear in this book but he wrote thousands of which at least fifteen hundred were published with music by dozens of composers who vied to get their hands on his verses …the law was as much a love as poetry and he studied and was called to the bar at the age of thirtynine thereafter enjoying a comfortable career on the western circuit often appearing in criminal cases almost invariably for the defence according to his own account in court he was remarkably keenwitted and effective songs poured from him he translated opera including cav and pag  and he published quantities of verse and childrens books he revelled in his considerable celebrity a little man physically he had as a friend put it a blithe and tender soul he may have been selfsatisfied but he was much loved and was certainly no fool cheerfully dismissing his facility as a lyricist as no safe ticket to parnassus his most commercially successful ballad was roses of picardy which became one of the great popular songs of the great war and it made its writer a small fortune michael r turner and antony miall the edwardian songbook drawingroom ballads 19001914 methuen london 1982 pp 113114 the other weatherly songs found in the above book are up from somerset nirvana  roses thora stonecracker john beyond the dawn friend o mine  the danny boy lyrics proved particularly popular in the united states where they were recorded by a number of popular singers including bing crosby note these lyrics plus some parody versions can be found on the digital tradition website another name for this tune is the londonderry air this title has a certain political bias since the name londonderry is used to emphasize the ties between northern ireland and britain referring to the colonization of the area by english settlers in the early 17th century irish nationalists usually prefer to use derry the original name of the northern city and county it appears that the title air from county derry was also used i take this subject up further in section 3 of this article where the connection to percy grainger is discussed the first appearance of the tune in print occurred in 1855 in ancient music of ireland published by the early collector george petrie 17891866 the untitled melody was supplied to petrie by miss jane ross of limavady county londonderry who claimed to have taken it down from the playing of an itinerant piper this is the origin of the londonderry air name petrie states name unknown for the following beautiful air i have to express my very grateful acknowledgement to miss j ross of ntlimavady in the county of londonderry—a lady who has made a large collection of the popular unpublished melodies of that county which she has very kindly placed at my disposal and which has added very considerably to the stock of tunes which i had previously acquired from that still very irish county i say still very irish for though it has been planted for more than two centuries by english and scottish settlers the old irish race still forms the great majority of its peasant inhabitants and there are few if any counties in which with less foreign admixture the ancient melodies of the country have been so extensively preserved the name of the tune unfortunately was not ascertained by miss ross who sent it to me with the simple remark that it was very old in the correctness of which statement i have no hesitation in expressing my perfect concurrence a great collector of the 1930s sam henry speculated that miss ross had collected the tune from a fiddler blind jimmy mc curry who was known to have been active in limavady at the time jimmys descendants have embraced this theory enthusiastically as seen on the pbs show danny boy in sunshine or in shadow however im going to postpone that discussion to section 3 of this article heres a photo of jane rosss house by jochen lueg the blue plaque reads jane ross 1810  1879 who recorded the folk tune the londonderry air lived hereas the tune grew in popularity and at the same time traditional irish music came to be more thoroughly researched considerable doubt emerged about miss rosss story no additional versions of the melody were encountered by other collectors the structure of the tune is unlike any other traditional irish tune and it is not suited for words in any of the known irish song meters miss ross was unable to provide any supporting evidence the name of the piper for example and the suspicion grew that she had composed it herself and was attempting to pass it off as a genuine irish tune although by doing so she would be missing out on considerable royalty payments she continued to maintain the truth of her original account i have encountered one claim for an earlier appearance of the tune the history of the tin whistle found on the website of the clarke company claims that the founder of the company robert clarke frequently played the tune while walking from suffolk to manchester in 1843 if true this would be before petries publication date of 1855 perhaps somebody at the company can clarify this my friend jerome colburn points out that the tune appears twice in the collection of francis oneill made among the irishamerican community in chicago around the end of the 19th century its still worth mentioning that the tune had a life of its own in the tradition between jane rosss time and frederic weatherlys as shown by drimoleague fair and londonderry love song in oneills both are settings of the same tune miss ross notated complete with duple meter halfcadence in the first part high note in the second etc etc if they got into circulation from musicians who read londonderry air in petrie they have undergone some alterations—more strikingly in londonderry love song where the last note of each phrase is changed to put the whole tune into minor mode drimoleague is in the south of county cork very close to where oneill grew up and about as far away from derry as one could get and still be on dry land since no other use of the drimoleague fair name is known and oneill is known to have use printed sources including petrie its highly likely that petrie is the source and oneill gave it the name he often gave his own titles to untitled tunes the next piece of the puzzle appeared in 1934 when anne geddes gilchrist published an article entitled a new light upon the londonderry air  in the journal of the english folk dance and song society  she theorized that the tune was taken from a performance in which the performer was using extreme rubato and this so disguised the natural rhythm that the tune was wrongly noted down in common instead of triple time if the prolonged notes occurring on the first beat of the bar are shortened the tune falls at once and easily into a rhythm which instead of being unique in irish folkmusic is paralleled in scores of other irish folktunes finally in 1979 an article new dates for old songs 17661803 by hugh shields appeared in long room the journal of the library of trinity college dublin shields identified a tune in edward buntings 1796 publication a general collection of the ancient irish music entitled aislean an oigfear in modern irish aisling an ógfhir the young mans dream as being very close to the gilchrist version of the londonderry air except in the fourth phrase which makes the londonderry air almost unsingable in traditional style while endearing it to virtuosos eager for effects of vocal expression this phrase does not however exceed the range of the pipes so there is nothing to show it was not present in the original performance edward bunting 17731843 was the pioneer collector of harp music whose career began in 1792 when he was hired to write down the tunes performed at the belfast harp festival it is to him and to people working for him particularly one patrick lynch that we owe the preservation of much of the traditional irish harp repertoire bunting noted aislean an oigfear from denis hempson 16971807 the very last traditional performer on the irish wirestrung harp who luckily lived to the age of 110 allowing bunting to collect many of his tunes before his death in magilligan county derry—very near to miss jane rosss home in limavady in his 1840 work a collection of the ancient music of ireland  bunting discusses the characteristics of typical irish melodies stating  the young mans dream and the air of the green woods of truigha might be suggested as answering more nearly to the editors conception of such a standard than any others with which he is acquainted so after more than a century miss ross has been vindicated although her skill as a transcriber is perhaps called into question of course we cannot be sure that the anonymous pipers performance was of the best standard either ive now added a midi version of buntings arrangement for people who would like to hear the original tune this includes the bass line published by bunting which is not shown in the musical score above except implicitly by chord names it is not known whether the bass line was actually played by hempson but most authorities think that it was composed by bunting only the melody lines in the bunting collection were as originally played we think although in some cases bunting has put them into different keys i am not aware of any traditional irish words to aislean an oigfear having been preserved note more recently i have in fact found the irish lyrics given in section 2 interestingly enough though there does exist a set of english words to the tune composed by thomas moore 17791852 who found his way to fame and fortune by writing his own words to the traditional tunes collected by bunting such as the harp that once through taras halls and the last rose of summer bunting did not receive any royalties from this effort and had financial difficulties throughout his collecting career in my 1859 edition of moores irish melodies the following set of words appear in fourpart vocal harmony set to the tune of the young mans dream as a beam oer the face of the waters as a beam oer the face of the waters may glow while the tide runs in darkness and coldness below so the cheek may be tingd with a warm sunny smile though the cold heart to ruin runs darkly the while one fatal remembrance one sorrow that throws its bleak shade alike oer our joys and our woes to which life nothing darker or brighter can bring for which joy has no balm and affliction no sting—oh this thought in the midst of enjoyment will stay like a dead leafless branch in the summers bright ray the beams of the warm sun play round it in vain— it may smile in his light but it blooms not againbased on an article published in the folk harp journal some additional material has been added to the version originally published since the above article was written i have discovered much more information about the young mans dream in fact its history can be traced back about a century earlier than what has been mentioned so far i have also located the original words which are in the irish language as well as another original set of words in english continue on to section
