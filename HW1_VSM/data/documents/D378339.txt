act upon it to her or his legal injury fraud is commonly understood as dishonesty calculated for advantage a person who is dishonestmay be called a fraud in the u s legal system fraud is a specific offense with certain features fraud is most common in the buying or selling of property including real estate personal property and intangible property such as stocks bonds and copyrights state and federalstatutes criminalize fraud but not all cases rise to the level of criminality prosecutors havediscretion in determining which cases to pursue victims may also seek redress in civil court fraud must be proved by showing that the defendants actions involved five separate elements 1 a false statement of a material fact 2 knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue 3 intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim 4 justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement and 5 injury to the alleged victim as a result these elements contain nuances that are not all easily proved first not all false statements arefraudulent to be fraudulent a false statement must relate to a material fact it should alsosubstantially affect a persons decision to enter into a contract or pursue a certain course of action a false statement of fact that does not bear on the disputed transaction will not be consideredfraudulent second the defendant must know that the statement is untrue a statement of fact that is simplymistaken is not fraudulent to be fraudulent a false statement must be made with intent to deceivethe victim this is perhaps the easiest element to prove once falsity and materiality are provedbecause most material false statements are designed to mislead third the false statement must be made with the intent to deprive the victim of some legal right fourth the victims reliance on the false statement must be reasonable reliance on a patentlyabsurd false statement generally will not give rise to fraud however people who are especiallygullible superstitious or ignorant or who are illiterate may recover damages for fraud if the defendantknew and took advantage of their condition finally the false statement must cause the victim some injury that leaves her or him in a worseposition than she or he was in before the fraud a statement of belief is not a statement of fact and thus is not fraudulent puffing or the expression of a glowing opinion by a seller is likewise not fraudulent for example a car dealer may representthat a particular vehicle is the finest in the lot although the statement may not be true it is not a statement of fact and a reasonable buyer would not be justified in relying on it the relationship between parties can make a difference in determining whether a statement is fraudulent a misleading statement is more likely to be fraudulent when one party has superiorknowledge in a transaction and knows that the other is relying on that knowledge than when thetwo parties possess equal knowledge for example if the seller of a car with a bad engine tells thebuyer the car is in excellent running condition a court is more likely to find fraud if the seller is an auto mechanic as opposed to a sales trainee misleading statements are most likely to be fraudulent where one party exploits a position of trust and confidence or a fiduciary relationship fiduciary relationships include those between attorneys and clients physicians and patientsstockbrokers and clients and the officers and partners of a corporation and its stockholders a statement need not be affirmative to be fraudulent when a person has a duty to speak silencemay be treated as a false statement this can arise if a party who has knowledge of a fact fails to disclose it to another party who is justified in assuming its nonexistence for example if a realestate agent fails to disclose that a home is built on a toxic waste dump the omission may be regarded as a fraudulent statement even if the agent does not know of the dump the omission may be considered fraudulent this is constructive fraud and it is usually inferred when a party is a fiduciary and has a duty to know of and disclose particular facts fraud is an independent criminal offense but it also appears in different contexts as the meansused to gain a legal advantage or accomplish a specific crime for example it is fraud for a person to make a false statement on a license application in order to engage in the regulated activity a person who did so would not be convicted of fraud rather fraud would simply describe the methodused to break the law or regulation requiring the license fraud resembles theft in that both involve some form of illegal taking but the two should not be confused fraud requires an additional element of false pretenses created to induce a victim to turn over property services or money theft by contrast requires only the unauthorized taking of anothers property with the intent to permanently deprive the other of the property because fraudinvolves more planning than does theft it is punished more severely federal and state criminal statutes provide for the punishment of persons convicted of
