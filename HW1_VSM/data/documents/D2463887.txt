game changer baseballsoftball scoring app and web service kevin purcell april 29 2010application reviews news all across the united states one of the most significant signs of spring is the crack of a bat at the local baseball and softball fields from the tiny teeball tots to the big league boys of summer baseball is a passion for americans but so is technology what do you get when you put the two together game changerpreviously following live online stats has been reserved for the pros or big time college teams but with game changer a baseball and softball statistics management system fans can keep track of any team online it offers something for everyone coaches can use game changer to keep track of stats and to score their games parents or fans can follow their favorite ball players’ progress and the player can show off his or her skills to friends family or even prospective college or pro recruiters game changer is the combination of a web site a scoring app for the i phone and users who want to either score a game or track the game stats live or after the fact here is how game changer works a representative of a baseball or softball team will sign up for the service at the game changer web site the service is free for the person keeping score and entering the stats once you have signed up and logged in you set up your team by adding players to the roster and then games to your schedule on game day setting up the roster is a simple drag and drop action once finished you are ready to score the game using the i phone app it will be easier if you register and set things up online however you can do it through the i phone app too if you have ever used one of those score keeping notebooks you will find the system simple to use in fact one game changer user named greta from omaha nebraska said advertisement keeping score is so much easier with game changer everything i need is right there on my phone the interface can be a little complicated so make sure you follow the help videos on the web site which explains how to set things up and score a game below is a video from the game changer web site that shows how to score a game once you learn the system it is much easier to score the game than using that old score keeping pad this is not the only value to the service the two things that make game changer a “game changer” is the ability to follow the game live and view stats after the game is over our fans love the service we have many parents on our team who have more than one child in sports these parents can watch the game on their web enabled phone while they are at a different game with their other child grandparents who don’t live in town can still “watch” the game unfold on their computer it is the best and most used app i have on my i phone greta omaha nebraskaerik is a little league coach from somerset massachusetts he said the scoring system is “intuitive and straightforward”short of sounding too cute game changer has been well a game changer … there’s never a question of what needs to be entered or how to enter it and i always have the information at my fingertips if i ever need to know what my players are hitting or what my pitchers’ pitch counts are it’s only a click away no more worrying about finding a pencil or better yet someone who knows how to scorekeep a book you can see how the service saves the person in charge of tracking stats a ton of post game number crunching instead of figuring a pitcher’s era or the player’s batting averages everything is updated in real time and posted for people to see online if they sign in and follow your team one team using game changer made their local news if you are a parent or fan of a team you will love the ability to follow games online through the game changer web site when someone signs into the site and finds your team’s web page they can launch what is called the game stream from that screen they can view how the game is going the game stream is updated whenever a player bats if he or she gets a hit you will see it almost immediately this would be great for a fan or a parent who cannot attend the game after the game is over anyone who is following the team can check on stats the proud parent can brag to his coworkers about little johnnie’s game winning homerun or how his little sussie pitched a nohitter college scouts could be directed to a prospect’s team page to follow the player’s stats and progress during a season and the coach can get the stats to see how a player is doing and make choices about future lineups based on how the player is doing if you are the web master for your local school you can use game changer as well the service allows you to put a live scoreboard on your own web site you don’t have to even know any html just copy and paste the code onto your site this way fans can go to my high school pagecom and check up on how their team is doing you can also promote the team by posting the game info to twitter facebook or via a link to the scoreboard in an email there are also live updates via text message for offline promotion you can quickly and easily create a printable flier to hand out to fans at another event or during the game for future games for fans the service is free unless you want to have access to live stats post game stats are also free but more advanced stats are part of the paid subscription currently the service is in beta making all of the information free but once the beta phase is over fans will be able to sign up for a subscription for a fee right now the scoring app is only available as an i phone or i pod touch app of course it will work on the i pad but a native hd app is not yet ready thought they are planning to create one after using the i phone app i can see that an i pad app would be much easier to use but the i phone app is not too complicated especially after viewing the tutorial videos an android game changer app is “definitely in the pipeline” and most likely to be available for the fall of 2010 a blackberry version might also be coming game changer is focused specifically on baseball and softball however i spoke to ted sullivan ceo of game changer and he said that their hope is to expand to other sports this is the first season that game changer has been available publicly the service is used by over 3000 teams nationwide at first it was primarily in southern california texas and florida but they are expanding quickly i can see why since it is essentially a free service the team won’t have to pay anything this is good when some public and even private schools are struggling to even put teachers in the classroom let alone pay for something like game changer little league teams could never afford this fans of a team can also use part of the service for free the avid fan will have to pay for more advanced stats but i think for nonprofit organizations running school or recreational leagues this is a nobrainer pros free for the team school or league to set up and score games great information available convenient app right on your i phone very good support and help tutorial videos info is available to fans
