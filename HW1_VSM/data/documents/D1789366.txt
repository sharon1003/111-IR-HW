article classical chinese poetry classical chinese poetry includes perhaps first and foremost shi 詩诗 and also other major types such as ci 詞词 and qu 曲 there is also a traditional chinese literary form called fu 賦赋 which defies categorization into english more than the other terms but perhaps can best be described as a kind of prosepoem during the modern period there also has developed free verse in western style traditional forms of chinese poetry are rhymed however the mere rhyming of text may not qualify literature as being poetry and as well the lack of rhyme would not necessarily disqualify a modern work from being considered poetry in the sense of modern chinese poetry for example lines from i ching are often rhymed but may not be considered to be poetry whereas modern verse may be considered to be poetry even without rhyme a crosscultural comparison to this might be the presocratic philosophical works in ancient greece which were often written in verse versus free verse beginnings of the tradition shijing and chuci  editthe earliest extant anthologies are the shi jing 诗经）and chu ci （楚辞 both of these have had a great impact on the subsequent poetic tradition earlier examples of ancient chinese poetry may have been lost because of the vicissitudes of history such as the burning of books and burying of scholars  焚书坑儒） by qin shihuang although one of the targets of this last event was the shi jing which has nevertheless survived shijing  editmain article shijing the elder of these two works the shijing also familiarly known in english as the classic of poetry and as the book of songs or transliterated as the sheh ching is a preserved collection of classical chinese poetry from over two millennia ago its content divided into 3 parts feng 风，folk songs from 15 small countries160 songs in total  ya 雅imperial court songssubdiviede in daya and xiaoya105 songs in total）and song 颂singing in ancestral worship 40 songs in total） this anthology received its final compilation sometime in the 7th century bce 2 the collection contains both aristocratic poems regarding life at the royal court odes and also more rustic poetry and images of natural settings derived at least to some extent from folk songs songs the shijing poems are predominantly composed of fourcharacter lines  四言 rather than the five and seven character lines typical of later classical chinese poetry the main techniques of espression  rhetorics are fu 赋，direct elaborate narrative，bi 比，metaphor and xing 兴，describe other thing to foreshadowing the main content chuci  editmain article chuci in contrast to the classic shijing the chu ci anthology also familiarly known in english as the songs of chu or the songs of the south or transliterated as the chu tzu consists of verses more emphasizing lyric and romantic features as well as irregular linelengths and other influences from the poetry typical of the state of chu the chuci collection consists primarily of poems ascribed to qu yuan 屈原） 329–299 bce and his follower song yu although in its present form the anthology dates to wang i s 158 ce compilation and notes which are the only historically reliable source of both the text and information regarding its composition 3 during the han dynasty 206 bc220ad the chu ci style of poetry contributed to the evolution of the fu descriptive poem style typified by a mixture of verse and prose passages often used as a virtuoso display the poets skills and knowledge rather than to convey intimate emotional experiences the fu form remained popular during the subsequent six dynasties period although it became shorter and more personal the fu form of poetry remains as one of the generic pillars of chinese poetry although in the tang dynasty fivecharacter and sevencharacter shi poetry begins to dominate han poetry  editmain article han poetry also during the han dynasty a folksong style of poetry became popular known as yuefu 樂府乐府  music bureau  poems so named because of the governments role in collecting such poems although in time some poets began composing original works in yuefu style many yuefu poems are composed of fivecharacter 五言 or sevencharacter 七言 lines in contrast to the fourcharacter lines of earlier times a characteristic form of han dynasty literature is the fu the poetic period of the end of the han dynasty and the beginning of the six dynasties era is known as jianan poetry an important collection of han poetry is the nineteen old poems jianan poetry  editmain article jianan poetry between and overlapping the poetry of the latter days of the han and the beginning period of the six dynasties was jianan poetry examples of surviving poetry from this period include the works of the three caos cao cao cao pi and cao zhi six dynasties poetry  editmain article six dynasties poetry a tang dynasty era copy of the preface to the lantingji xu poems composed at the orchid pavilion gathering originally attributed to wang xizhi 303–361 ad of the jin dynasty the six dynasties era 220ce −589ce was one of various developments in poetry both continuing and building on the traditions developed and handed down from previous eras and also leading up to further developments of poetry in the future major examples of poetry surviving from this dynamic era include the works of the seven sages of the bamboo grove the poems of the orchid pavilion gathering the midnight songs poetry of the four seasons the great fields and garden poet tao yuanming the yongming epoch poets and the poems collected in the anthology new songs from the jade terrace compiled by xu ling 507–83 the general and poet lu ji used neotaoist cosmology to take literary theory in a new direction with his wen fu or essay on literature in the fu poetic form tang poetry  editmain article tang poetry a high point of classical chinese poetry occurred during the tang period 618–907 not only was this period prolific in poets but also in poems perhaps around 50000 poems survive many of them collected in the collected tang poems  during the time of tang in china poetry was integrated into almost every aspect of the professional and social life of the literate class including becoming part of the imperial examinations taken by anyone wanting a government post by this point poetry was being composed according to regulated tone patterns regulated and unregulated poetry were distinguished as ancientstyle gushi poetry and regulated recentstyle jintishi poetry jintishi meaning new style poetry or regulated verse is a stricter form developed in the early tang dynasty with rules governing the structure of a poem in terms of linelength number of lines tonal patterns within the lines the use of rhyme and a certain level of mandatory parallelism good examples of the gushi and jintishi forms can be found in respectively the works of the poets li bai and du fu tang poetic forms include lushi a type of regulated verse with an eightline form having five six or seven characters per line ci verse following set rhythmic patterns and jueju truncated verse a fourline poem with five six or seven characters per line good examples of the jueju verse form can be found in the poems of li bai 4 and wang wei over time some tang poetry became more realistic more narrative and more critical of social norms for example these traits can be seen in the works of bai juyi the poetry of the tang dynasty remains influential today other late tang poetry developed a more allusive and surreal character as can be seen for example in the works of li he and li shangyin song poetry  editmain article song poetry by the song dynasty 960–1279 another form had proven it could provide the flexibility that new poets needed the ci 词詞 lyric—new lyrics written according to the set rhythms of existing tunes each of the tunes had music that has often been lost but having its own meter thus each ci poem is labeled to the tune of tune name 调寄 词牌調寄 詞牌 and fits the meter and rhyme of the tune much in the same way that christian hymn writers set new lyrics to preexisting tunes the titles of ci poems are not necessarily related to their subject matter and many poems may share a title in terms of their content ci poetry most often expressed feelings of desire often in an adopted persona however great exponents of the form such as the southern tang poet li houzhu and the song dynasty poet su shi used the ci form to address a wide range of topics yuan poetry  editmain article yuan poetry major developments of poetry during the yuan dynasty 1271–1368 included the development of types of poetry written to fixedtone patterns such as for the yuan opera librettos after the song dynasty the set rhythms of the ci came to be reflected in the setrhythm pieces of chinese sanqu poetry 散曲 a freer form based on new popular songs and dramatic arias that developed and lasted into the ming dynasty 14th–17th centuries examples can be seen in the work of playwrights ma zhiyuan 馬致遠 c 1270–1330 and guan hanqing 關漢卿 c 1300 ming poetry  editmain article ming poetry the ming dynasty 1368–1644 poets include gao qi 1336–1374 li dongyang 1447–1516 and yuan hongdao 1568–1610 mingqing transition  editmingqing transition includes the interludingoverlapping periods of the brief socalled shun dynasty also known as dashun 1644–1645 and the southern ming dynasty 1644 to 1662 one example of poets who wrote during the difficult times of the late ming when the already troubled nation was ruled by chongzhen emperor reigned 1627 to 1644 the shortlived dashun regime of peasantrebel li zicheng and then the manchu qing dynasty are the socalled three masters of jiangdong wu weiye 1609–1671 qian qianyi 1582–1664 and gong dingzi 1615–1673 qing poetry  editmain article qing poetry the qing dynasty 1644 to 1912 is notable in terms of development of the criticism of poetry and the development of important poetry collections such as the qing era collections of tang dynasty poetry known as the quantangshi and the three hundred tang poems both shi and ci continued to be composed beyond the end of the imperial period postimperial classical chinese poetry  editboth shi and ci continued to be composed past the end of the imperial period one example being mao zedong former chairman of the communist party of china who wrote classical chinese poetry in his own calligraphic style modern postclassical poetry  editmain article modern chinese poetry modern chinese poetry 新诗新詞 new poetry refers to the modern vernacular style of poetry as opposed to the traditional poetry written in classical chinese language usually modern chinese poetry does not follow prescribed patterns poetry was revolutionized after 1919s may fourth movement when writers like hu shih tried to use vernacular styles closer to what was being spoken  baihua rather than previously prescribed forms early 20thcentury poets like xu zhimo guo moruo and wen yiduo sought to break chinese poetry from past conventions by adopting western models for example xu consciously follows the style of the romantic poets with endrhymes in the postrevolutionary communist era poets like ai qing used more liberal running lines and direct diction which were vastly popular and widely imitated in the contemporary poetic scene the most important and influential poets are in the group known as misty poets who use oblique allusions and hermetic references the most important misty poets include shu ting bei dao gu cheng duo duo and yang lian most of whom were exiled after the tiananmen square protests of 1989 a special case is the mystic poet hai zi who became very famous after his suicide however even today the concept of modern poetry is still debated there are arguments and contradiction as to whether modern poetry counts as poetry due to the special structure of chinese writing and chinese grammar modern poetry or free verse poetry may seem like a simple short vernacular essay since they lack some of the structure traditionally used to define poetry influence  editchinese poetry early on influenced poets in korea japan and vietnam for example the kanshi and shichigonzekku poetry of japan later on it would be a big influence in the rest of the world ranging from the poetic movement known as beat poetry to the pop song  set the controls for
