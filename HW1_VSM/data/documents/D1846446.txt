a second difference between the movie and the novel was the relationship between daisy buchanan and jay gatsby in both the two lovers were reintroduced through nick they both attended a tea party at nicks house and their love was rekindled during that reunion gatsby asked jordan baker to suggest to nick the tea party he wants to know continued jordan if youll invite daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over 83 shes not to know about it gatsby doesnt want her to know youre just supposed to invite her to tea 85 after the invitation is extended to daisy the small differences come into place in the movie jay gatsby is already waiting in nicks house when daisy arrives in the book gatsby comes later an hour later the front door opened nervously and gatsby in a white flannel suit silver shirt and gold colored tie hurried in 89 from this point daisy and gatsby began to see each other in the book all of the encounters were not described but the mass amount of time they spent together was implied  daisys husband was evidently perturbed at daisys running around alone for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsbys party 110 there were many scenes in the movie of nick and daisy having tea together going to town together and going to a park together the secret relationship was described in both the novel and the movie but it was elaborated more in the movie version a final difference can be found in the final incidents of the great gatsby the end of the story ends tragically with the deaths of a few of the main characters the first death that occurs is the unfortunate murder of myrtle wilson tom buchanans mistress the events leading to her death are described in detail in the novel ive got my wife locked up in there explained wilson calmly shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away a moment later myrtle rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shouting before he could move away from his door the business was over the car didnt stop michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath the mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little 143145 the movie was not very informative about the death at all all that is seen in the movie is a crowd around myrtles dead body the accident is never even shown after wilson finds out that gatsbys car was the one that killed his wife he goes on a manhunt at gatsbys house the movie shows the scene in which gatsby is relaxing in his swimming pool he feels uneasy and keeps looking toward the patio and calling out daisys name wilson hides behind a curtain on the patio aims his gun and shoots gatsby in the pool another gunshot is heard and wilsons dead body falls to the ground gatsbys death is not describe in the novel it is barely mentioned that they found him in the pool with blood floating about him and the gardener saw wilsons body a little way off in the grass 170 rather than in the patio the 1974 version of the great gatsby followed the novel very closely minor parts were made different mainly to compensate for the fact that the novel only included events from nick carraways point of view
