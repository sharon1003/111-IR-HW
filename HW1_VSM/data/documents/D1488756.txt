started cooking by l v anderson mannequin of a tautavel man—would he have had known how to make fire photo credit by eric cabanisafpgetty images richard wrangham an anthropologist at harvard claims that hominids became people—that is acquired traits like big brains and dainty jaws— by mastering fire he places this development at about 18 million years ago this is an appealing premise no matter who you are for those who see cooking as morally culturally and socially superior to not cooking it is scientific validation of a worldview proof that cooking is literally what makes us human for the rest of us it means we have a clever retort the next time one of those annoying rawfood faddists starts going on about how natural it is never to eat anything heated above 115 degrees fahrenheit l v anderson l v anderson is a former slate associate editor there’s one problem with wrangham’s elegant hypothesis it’s hardly the scientific consensus in fact since 2009 when wrangham explained his theory in the book catching fire several archaeologists have come forward with their own wildly divergent opinions about what is arguably the oldest intellectual property debate in the world who really mastered fire in the sense of being able to create it control it and cook with it regularly was it homo erectus neanderthals or modern humans a brief primer on these species h erectus originated about 18 million years ago these hominids were about as tall as modern humans but probably hairier and definitely dumber it’s thought that both neanderthals and homo sapiens evolved from h erectus with neanderthals emerging about 600000 years ago and going extinct around 30000 years ago and modern humans emerging around 200000 years ago and still going strong neanderthals were shorter and had more complex societies than h erectus and they’re thought to have been at least as largebrained as modern humans but their facial features protruded a little more and their bodies were stouter than ours it’s thought that neanderthals died out from competing fighting or interbreeding with h sapiens according to wrangham h erectus must have had fire—just look at their anatomy h erectus had smaller jaws and teeth and smaller faces in general shorter intestinal tracts and larger brains than even earlier hominids such as australopithecus afarensis for instance who were boxier more apelike and probably duller wrangham argues that h erectus would not have developed its distinctive traits if the species hadn’t been regularly eating softer cooked food this hypothesis stems from a few modern observations when you eat cooked food you have access to many more calories than if you eat the same food raw there are two reasons our digestive systems can extract more calories from a cooked steak for instance than a raw steak and it takes much less energy to cook and eat a steak than to gnaw on a raw one for hours access to cooked food means a hominid no longer needs enormous teeth to break down all that raw meat and roughage into swallowable hunks nor does it need as robust a digestive system to process it all the combination of more calories and less complicated intestines means more energy can be devote to cogitating—hence h erectus ’ relatively big brains which suck up a lot of calories as evidence for his theory wrangham likes to point to the fact that modernday humans can’t thrive on an allraw diet—raw foodists tend to stop menstruating precluding reproduction wrangham’s theory is elegant but the archaeological record is a little more complicated there is definitely evidence of fire around 16 million years ago in what is now kenya but archaeologists dispute whether this was manmade or natural fire further complicating wrangham’s hypothesis is evidence that hominids may not have brought fire with them when h erectus moved out of africa into europe around a million years ago if fire was as transformative and beneficial as wrangham said it was you’d think our ancestors would have brought it with them when they moved to colder climes—or died out if they were unable to do so if h erectus didn’t bring fire mastery to europe who did archaeologists wil roebroeks of leiden university in the netherlands and paola villa of the university of colorado museum found evidence for frequent use of fire by european neanderthals between 400000 and 300000 years ago roebroeks and villa looked at all the data collected at european sites once inhabited by hominids and found no evidence of fire before about 400000 years ago—but plenty after that threshold evidence from israeli sites put fire mastery at about the same time h sapiens arrived on the scene in the middle east and europe 100000 years ago but our species didn’t have a discernible impact on the charcoal record roebroeks and villa conclude that neanderthals must have been the ones who mastered fire one of the beautiful things about the archaeological record is that archaeologists are always willing to debate about it attributing fire to neanderthals is an overly confident reading of the evidence according to archaeologist dennis sandgathe of british columbia’s simon fraser university of course the number of campsites with evidence of fire increased between 1 million and 400000 years ago he says—the number of campsites period increased during this time in proportion with population growth but that doesn’t mean the use of fire was universal among european hominids—there are plenty of neanderthal campsites out there that show little or no evidence of fire and sandgathe has personally excavated some of them what’s more sandgathe told me when i asked him about roebroeks’ and villa’s data “we actually have better data than they do when it comes to neanderthal use of fire”according to sandgathe and his colleagues hominids didn’t really master fire until around 12000 years ago—well after neanderthals had disappeared from the face of the planet or merged into the human gene pool via interbreeding depending on your view sandgathe and his colleagues excavated two neanderthal cave sites in france and found surprisingly that the sites’ inhabitants used hearths more during warm periods and less during cold periods why on earth would neanderthals not build fires when it was freezing outside in “ on the role of fire in neandertal adaptations in western europe evidence from pech de l’azé iv and roc de marsal france ” sandgathe advances the hypothesis that european neanderthals simply didn’t know how to make fire all they could do was harvest natural fires—those caused by lightning for instance—to occasionally warm their bodies and cook their food this explains why sandgathe found more evidence of fire from warm periods lightning is far less common during cold spells roebroeks and villa think sandgathe’s reasoning is flawed after all there isn’t evidence of fire at every modern human campsite either when you look at sites from the upper paleolithic period which concluded about 10000 years ago “however nobody would argue that upper paleolithic huntergatherers were not habitual users of fire” they wrote in a response to sandgathe et al’s criticism of their work wrangham meanwhile thinks both sandgathe et al and roebroeks et al ignore some critical nonarchaeological evidence his point that contemporary humans can’t survive on a diet of uncooked food accepting sandgathe’s hypothesis wrangham wrote in an email “means that the contemporary evidence is wrong or that humans have adapted to need cooked food only in the last 12000 years both suggestions are very challenging”why on earth can’t scientists agree on whether people mastered fire 18 million years ago or 12000 years ago that’s a 150fold difference well figuring out who burned what when is not an easy business for one thing archaeologists can’t always tell what caused a fire a volcano for instance a lightning strike or hominid ingenuity and even if there is clear evidence of hominid fire use—a hearth at a formerly inhabited cave for instance—it’s almost impossible to tell whether it was created by people from scratch or merely stolen from a natural fire and then transported to a hearth where it was kept alive as long as possible scientists call this kind of fire use opportunistic what’s more even when people were creating fires the evidence of said fires doesn’t always stay put ashes have a tendency to blow away instead of embedding themselves neatly in the archaeological record while water can take evidence of fire from its original location and carry it someplace completely different then there’s human error as sandgathe et al write in their discussion of the available evidence “there are … examples where residues originally interpreted as the remains of fires are later identified as something else” i hate it when that happens at one site in china for instance layers of earth originally believed to be ashes were later revealed to be silt and unburned bits of organic matter archaeological methods are improving and they may well end up bearing out wrangham’s hypothesis in a paper published earlier this year archaeologists used advanced techniques known as micromorphological and fouriertransform infrared microspectroscopy to examine sediment and reveal evidence of fire at a millionyearold south african cave site wrangham is also hopeful that other disciplines will provide evidence for his theory “i suspect genetics will help” he says “if we can pin down the genes underlying the adaptation to cooked food we may be able to date the control of fire close enough to settle the big question”“sure that would be pretty compelling evidence” admits sandgathe but he’s hopeful that genetics will bolster his hypothesis that neanderthals survived frigid glacial periods not because they regularly used fire but because they had thick body hair “at some point someone may announce the discovery of the gene or genes that code for thickness of body hair and so could answer that question” he says judging from the way things are going this debate may rage on for a good while longer and there is room for more than one right answer it’s possible that different groups mastered fire independently of one another at different points in time but laypeople can take comfort in knowing that even if we don’t know yet who first mastered fire—our simple ancestors almost 2 million years ago our more advanced cousins 400000 years ago or our direct antecedents about 10000 years ago—there’s no doubt who holds the intellectual property rights to it today we even put it in an oven and made it our own
