the role of vitamins and minerals in thyroid disease we all know that we should eat the right foods in order to obtain all the necessary vitamins to maintain good health lack of certain vitamins and minerals can cause thyroid deficiency and if you have thyroid deficiency the vitamins you are taking in are unable to be processed properly both stephen langer in his book solved the riddle of illness and dr ridha arem in his book the thyroid solution tell us that people with thyroid problems should make sure they get enough vitamins either by eating plenty of the foods containing these vitamins or by supplements many people now lead very busy lives and donít have time to eat properly many young woman miss meals altogether to lose weight without realising that this can cause problems for your thyroid even if you try and eat properly by the time we purchase prepare and cook everyday foods most of the nutrients have disappeared and we believe supplements are essential to maintain a good thyroid lack of protein in a vegetarian diet of a thyroid deficient person can also cause problems one thing doctors donít tend to do now unless you go to an alternative therapist is check you for vitamin and mineral deficiencies you might be surprised to find that you are deficient in quite a few of these vitamins we are hearing more and more that a lot of us are suffering from pernicious anaemia make sure you are checked for this next time you see your doctor vitamin a not carotenecarotene is a precursor of vitamin a an underactive thyroid gland cannot efficiently convert carotene to usable vitamin a so however many carrots etc you eat it wont help vitamin a must also be accompanied by protein to make it available to the body so if you are on a low protein diet you may be deficient in this vitamin if you are low on vitamin a your ability to produce tsh is limited this vitamin is required by the body to convert t4 to t3 if you find that lights are too bright or night driving is a problem try taking vitamin a supplements along with more protein and see if it helps vitamin b complex all the b vitamins are vital for good thyroid function but they all have a different role to play bl thiaminethis vitamin is drastically needed if you have an overactive thyroid b2 riboflavinthe lack of vitamin b2 suppresses thyroid function in that the thyroid and adrenal glands fail to secrete their hormones b3 niacinthis is needed to keep all the bodys cells including the endocrine glands in efficient working order b6 pyridoxinewithout this vitamin the thyroid cannot utilise its iodine raw material efficiently to make the hormones this vitamin is needed even more by an overactive thyroid muscle weakness is very common in people with an overactive thyroid and in those who are also lacking in b6 b12people with an underactive thyroid or people with no thyroid cannot absorb this vitamin a serious lack of b12 can cause mental illness various neurological disorders neuralgia neuritis and bursitis some doctors believe the normal range of b12 is too low and that the normal range should be at least 500  1300pgml rather than 200  1100 vitamin cthe thyroid gland needs this vitamin to keep it healthy long standing deficiency causes the thyroid gland to secrete too much hormone people with an overactive thyroid need extra vitamin c as this is actually drained from the tissues in their bodies vitamin dit has been found that when people with an overactive thyroid take this vitamin it counteracts the usual rapid excretion of calcium and osteoporosis can be avoided vitamin eagain lack of this vitamin encourages the thyroid gland to secrete too much hormone as well as too little tsh by the pituitary gland a higher intake of this vitamin is often needed by people with an overactive thyroid to counteract the large amounts of the vitamin depleted from the system calcium many of us consume too little calcium in the form of dairy products this is needed to combat bone loss especially important in overactive people dr arem recommends a supplementation of 1000 milligrams of elemental calcium calcium carbonate per day magnesium magnesium is required for the conversion of t4 into t3 so this mineral should be supplemented dr magovern tells us that some people lose magnesium at a great rate through urination also it seems that a diet high in refined food and caffeine will encourage magnesium loss selenium this is a crucial component of the enzyme that converts t4 to t3 in the body without it t3 cannot be produced in the right amounts and organs will function as if they were hypothyroid even though blood test levels are normal zinc research has shown that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism result in zinc deficiency it also plays a role in the functioning of the immune system low zinc levels have been found in obese people zinc is needed to convert t4 into t3 so this mineral is a must dr arem devotes some of his book to how we can stay healthy and he recommends the following vitamin supplementation · vitamin c 250  1000 milligrams · vitamin e 200  800 ius · beta carotene and mixed carotenoids 1000  5000 ius of vitamin a activity · selenium 50  100 mcg · zinc 15  20 milligrams · riboflavin vitamin b2 15 milligrams · niacin vitamin b3 15  20 milligrams · pyridoxine vitamin b6 25  50 milligrams · folic acid 400  600 mcg he recommends that if you are overactive you should take them even if your levels are high if you are hypothyroid he feels it is safer to start taking them when your levels are normal or close to normal he informs us that if you take iron at the same time as thyroid hormone it will bind with some of the thyroid hormone and block its absorption fibre and calcium carbonate if taken simultaneously with thyroid hormone may also interfere with absorption of the hormone where to get your supplements the nutri centre unit 3 kendal court kendal avenue london w3 0ru tel 02087528450 email
