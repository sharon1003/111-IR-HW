votefavorite12i just saw a member function like thispublic cat next cat  game state state but cat is an interface like thispublic interface cat void make cat  game state state so i am confused as to how to interpret this i know what it means when something returns an object or a primitive but what does it mean to return an interface how to use this functions return valuejavashare improve this

returns an object reference – raedwald dec 6 14 at 1252add a comment11 answers active oldest votesup vote29down voteaccepted think about this way if cat where a regular class what exactly would you care about when you wanted to call some methods on it youd care about the method definitions their names their argument types their return values you dont need to care about the actual implementationsince an interface provides all of that you can call methods on it just as you can on a regular class of course in order for the method to actually return some object there needs to be some class that implements that interface somewhere but what class that actually is or how it implements those methods doesnt really matter to the code that gets that object returned in other words you can write code like this cat cat  next cat  game state stuff cat make cat  game state otherstuff that code has no knowledge of the concrete type that implements the cat interface but it knows that the object can do everything that the cat interface requiresshare improve this answeranswered apr 18 11 at 653joachim sauer218k 47 456 541add a commentup vote7down vote this function returns an object of a class which implements the cat interface the implementation details for this concrete class are up to you as long as you implement all the methods of the cat interface for itshare improve this

interface where if some api has return type as map then user actually dont need to care about the type of object implementation ie hasmap for hashtable with the help of methods defined in map interface user can perform operation on the returned object because interface create a contract with the implementing classes that the implemeting class must provide defination for declared method otherwise declare that implementing class as abstractshare improve this answeranswered apr 18 11 at 703rajesh s125 3 9add a commentup vote2down vote for example you could do thisinterface cat string meeeeow public cat next cat  game state state return new cat  public string meeeeow  return meeeeeeeeeow in which case the method next cat returns an implementation of the cat interface by means of an anonymousinnerclass this shows that the code calling next cat does not need to know which code implements the returned cat interface this is an example of one of the key strengths of objectoriented programming because the calling code doesnt know the implementation the impact of changing the implementation later on is small as long as the interface remains the sameshare improve this answeredited

primitive value but lets stick with objects this reference is usually either stored in a variable or used to call instance methods or access instance members the declared return type tells us the least specific type of the real instance whose reference is returned by the method the object behind that reference may be exactly that type or any subclass or subsubclass share improve this

an instance when a method returns a reference it is declared as returning a reference to some particular kind of object in your case the reference this method returns will either be null or will refer to an object whose class implements catshare improve this answeredited apr 18 11 at 707andreasd911k 11 133 226answered apr 18 11 at 657atlantis1711 6 22 36add a commentup vote0down vote when you dont need to know about implementation you can return interface to leave implementation to that method and caller can just use methods that interface provides cat cat  next cat  state cat make cat  state

group of related methods with empty bodies interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler having said that next cat game state state returns an interface cat which means that at runtime it could return any object which implements cat now isnt that flexible clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use as long as the objects adhere to the interface that clients expectshare improve this answeranswered apr 18 11 at 658piyush mattoo109k 5 38 53add a commentup vote0down vote it is worth emphasizing once again that it is perfectly legal—and in fact very common—to have variables whose type is an interface such as  measurable meas measurable is an interface name just remember that the object to which meas refers doesn’t have type measurable in fact no object has type measurable instead the type of the object is some class that implements the measurable interface this might be an object of the bank account class or coin class or some other class meas  new bank account  1000   okmeas  new coin  01 dime   okwhat can you do with an interface variable given that you don’t know the class of the object that it references you can invoke the methods of the interfacedouble m  meas get measure and also you should know that there can be type conversians between class and interface typesshare
