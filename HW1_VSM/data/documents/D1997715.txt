and causes him only to despise others for being easily fooled unable to find happiness he is killed by a crowd after he pours his final perfume over himself grenouille let it go at that he refrained from overpowering some whole live person  that sort of thing would have  resulted in no new knowledge he knew he was master of the techniques needed to rob a human of his or her scent and knew it was
