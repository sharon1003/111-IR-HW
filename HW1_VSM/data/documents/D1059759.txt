difference between wavelength and frequency posted on november 17 2011 by admin last updated on november 17 2011wavelength vs frequency frequency and wavelength are two phenomena encountered in wave mechanics the frequency of an oscillation describes how “frequent” the event is the wavelength of a wave describes the length of a unit wave both of these concepts are very important in understanding fields such as wave mechanics modern physics quantum mechanics and electromagnetic field theory it is vital to have a clear understanding in these concepts in order to excel in such fields in this article we are going to discuss what frequency and wavelength are their definitions the similarities of wavelength and frequency and finally the difference between wavelength and frequency frequency frequency is a concept discussed in periodic motions of objects to understand the concept of frequency a proper understanding of periodic motions is required a periodic motion can be considered as any motion that repeats itself in a fixed time period a planet revolving around the sun is a periodic motion a satellite orbiting around the earth is a periodic motion even the motion of a balance ball set is a periodic motion most of the periodic motions we encounter are circular linear or semicircular a periodic motion has a frequency the frequency means how “frequent” the event is for simplicity we take frequency as the occurrences per second periodic motions can be either uniform or nonuniform a uniform can have a uniform angular velocity functions such as amplitude modulation can have double periods they are periodic functions encapsulated in other periodic functions the inverse of the frequency of the periodic motion gives the time for a period simple harmonic motions and damped harmonic motions are also periodic motions thereby the frequency of a periodic motion can also be obtained using the time difference between two similar occurrences the frequency of a simple pendulum only depends on the length of the pendulum and the gravitational acceleration for small oscillations wavelength wavelength is a concept discussed under waves the wavelength of a wave is the length where the shape of the wave starts to repeat itself this can be defined using the wave equation for a time dependent wave equation ψ x t in a given time if ψ x t is equal for two x values and there are no points between the two points having the same ψ value the difference of x values are known as the wavelength of the wave the relationship between the wavelength frequency and the velocity of the wave is given by v  f λ where f is the frequency of the wave and λ is the wavelength for a given wave since the wave velocity is constant the wavelength becomes inversely proportional to the frequency what is the difference between frequency and wavelength• frequency can be defined for both waves and vibrations and to any other periodic motion• the wavelength is only defined to a wave frequency is measured in hertz wavelength is measured in meters the wavelength of the wave is inversely proportional to the energy of the wave the frequency is linearly proportional to the energy of the wave related posts difference between amplitude and frequency difference between pitch and tone difference between oscillation and vibration difference between speed of light and sound difference between decibel and hertz help us to improve our writing please rate no ratings yetcite this page difference between wavelength and frequency difference between com november 17 2011  httpwwwdifferencebetweencomdifferencebetweenwavelengthandvsfrequency filed under physics tagged with frequency frequency vs periodic motion wave equation wave velocity wavelength wavelength vs
