how do i repeat top rows when printing in excel 2013 i am running excel 2013 i want to print a long spreadsheet and i would like the top rows repeated on the top of each page i go to print and go to page setup i select the “sheet” tab under “print” titles” both selections are disabled grayed “rows to repeat at top” and columns to repeat at left” are unavailable for selection do you know why i cannot access this feature in excel 2013nguyens answer as i have been using excel since excel 97 i always set the first row frozen so that when i scroll through my worksheet on screen i can differentiate the column information by having the first row frozen also i would do repeat these top rows when printing long document so that i do not have to turn my pages back and forward in previous versions of excel this greying out was the case if you activated “page setup” from the “print preview” option but not through “file”  “page setup” however microsoft has change the interface of the office package since microsoft office version 2007 in the shuffling of the user interface from 2007 onwards “file”  “print” is effectively the equivalent of the old “print preview” and the “page setup” option in the “page layout” tab the equivalent of the “old” “file”  “page setup” by default the option for setting print area “rows to repeat” and “columns to repeat” are greyed out if you display the “page setup” dialog via the “print” option i would suggest using the “print titles” button on the “page layout” tab in the ribbon to make the necessary changes let’s see my example i have two pages worksheet as we can see without repeating title rows or top rows we cannot know what column meaning in the second page now go directly to your excel file choose the “page layout” tab of ribbon bar then click on “print titles” then we will go to page setup dialog look under the print titles you can see “rows to repeat at top” that is what you want click on the rightside of the input box then you will back to your excel file will dialog named “page setup – rows to repeat at top” move your mouse to window edge and choose the rows to repeat here the range i choose is from first row to seventh row then push the “enter” button now excel will back to page setup dialog we can see the value we choose is displayed in right place click on preview button to see the result it’s here excel do repeat top rows across the printing pages when you printing with your own worksheet the result will be the same like this good luckthats all did you satisfy with it if not check out of below how to freeze top rows always on top in excel 2013 how to print all excel sheet columns on one page how to highlight cells alternatively in excel 2013 how to insert pictures into header or footer in excel 2007 how can i export outlook 2013 contacts to excel file how can i add comment to cells in microsoft excel 2013 lets stay in touchsign up here and youll receive even more tech and gadget help right to your inbox along with exclusive news and industry updates category microsoft office  answered by hai nguyen tag excel 2007 excel 2010 excel 2013previous how do i create microsoft account in windows 8 next how do i check mail from other accounts in gmail
