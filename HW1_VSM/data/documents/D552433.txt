i keep hearing about a supposed “hate speech” exception to the first amendment or statements such as “this isn’t free speech it’s hate speech” or “when does free speech stop and hate speech begin” but there is no hate speech exception to the first amendment hateful ideas whatever exactly that might mean are just as protected under the first amendment as other ideas one is as free to condemn islam — or muslims or jews or blacks or whites or illegal aliens or nativeborn citizens — as one is to condemn capitalism or socialism or democrats or republicans to be sure there are some kinds of speech that are unprotected by the first amendment but those narrow exceptions have nothing to do with “hate speech” in any conventionally used sense of the term for instance there is an exception for “fighting words” — facetoface personal insults addressed to a specific person of the sort that are likely to start an immediate fight but this exception isn’t limited to racial or religious insults nor does it cover all racially or religiously offensive statements indeed when the city of st paul tried to specifically punish bigoted fighting words the supreme court held that this selective prohibition was unconstitutional  r a v v city of st paul 1992 even though a broad ban on all fighting words would indeed be permissible and notwithstanding cnn anchor chris cuomo’s tweet that “hate speech is excluded from protection” and his later claims that by “hate speech” he means “fighting words” the fighting words exception is not generally labeled a “hate speech” exception and isn’t coextensive with any established definition of “hate speech” that i know of the same is true of the other narrow exceptions such as for true threats of illegal conduct or incitement intended to and likely to produce imminent illegal conduct ie illegal conduct in the next few hours or maybe days as opposed to some illegal conduct some time in the future indeed threatening to kill someone because he’s black or white or intentionally inciting someone to a likely and immediate attack on someone because he’s muslim or christian or jewish can be made a crime but this isn’t because it’s “hate speech” it’s because it’s illegal to make true threats and incite imminent crimes against anyone and for any reason for instance because they are police officers or capitalists or just someone who is sleeping with the speaker’s exgirlfriend the supreme court did in beauharnais v illinois 1952 uphold a “group libel” law that outlawed statements that expose racial or religious groups to contempt or hatred unless the speaker could show that the statements were true and were said with “good motives” and for “justifiable ends” but this too was treated by the court as just a special case of a broader first amendment exception — the one for libel generally and beauharnais is widely understood to no longer be good law given the court’s restrictions on the libel exception see new york times co v sullivan 1964 rejecting the view that libel is categorically unprotected and holding that the libel exception requires a showing that the libelous accusations be “of and concerning” a particular person garrison v louisiana 1964 generally rejecting the view that a defense of truth can be limited to speech that is said for “good motives” and for “justifiable ends” philadelphia newspapers inc v hepps 1986 generally rejecting the view that the burden of proving truth can be placed on the defendant r a v v city of st paul 1992 holding that singling bigoted speech is unconstitutional even when

33031 1988 finally “hostile environment harassment law” has sometimes been read as applying civil liability — or administrative discipline by universities — to allegedly bigoted speech in workplaces universities and places of public accommodation there is a hot debate on whether those restrictions are indeed constitutional they have generally been held unconstitutional when applied to universities but decisions are mixed as to civil liability based on speech that creates hostile environments in workplaces see the pages linked to at this site for more information on the subject but even when those restrictions have been upheld they have been justified precisely on the rationale that they do not criminalize speech or otherwise punish it in society at large but only apply to particular contexts such as workplaces none of them represent a “hate speech” exception nor have they been defined in terms of “hate speech”for this very reason “hate speech” also doesn’t have any fixed legal meaning under u s law u s law has just never had occasion to define “hate speech” — any more than it has had occasion to define rudeness evil ideas unpatriotic speech or any other kind of speech that people might condemn but that does not constitute a legally relevant category of course one can certainly argue that first amendment law should be changed to allow bans on hate speech whether bigoted speech blasphemy blasphemy to which foreigners may respond with attacks on americans or blasphemy or flag burning or anything else perhaps some statements of the “this isn’t free speech it’s hate speech” variety are deliberate attempts to call for such an exception though my sense is that they are usually incorrect claims that the exception already exists i think no such exception should be recognized but of course like all questions about what the law ought to be this is a matter that can be debated indeed people have a first amendment right to call for speech restrictions just as they have a first amendment right to call for gun bans or bans on islam or governmentimposed race discrimination or anything else that current constitutional law forbids constitutional law is no more set in stone than any other law but those who want to make such arguments should acknowledge that they are calling for a change in first amendment law and should explain just what that change would be so people can thoughtfully evaluate it calls for a new first amendment exception for “hate speech” shouldn’t just rely on the undefined term “hate speech” — they should explain just what viewpoints the government would be allowed to suppress what viewpoints would remain protected and how judges juries and prosecutors are supposed to distinguish the two saying “this isn’t free speech it’s hate speech” doesn’t i think suffice
