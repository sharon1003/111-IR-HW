nyko intercooler ts for the xbox 360 reviewed february 5 2009prev1 of 3next use your ← → arrow keys to browse when it comes to xbox 360 ownership the term red ring of death or rrod for short seems part of the vernacular this is typically caused by overheating of the system when engaged in long periods of spirited gameplay when halo 3 launched many cases of these rrods were reported and a similar number of xbox 360s were shipped away in little corrugated coffins for repair or replacement that means that anything to reduce temperatures in our xbox 360s is welcome this is where nyko comes into the picture the often copied nyko intercooler 360 was the original aftermarket cooler for the xbox 360 this was followed by the intercooler ex which wasnt an upgrade per se but more of a fix for the short circuiting issue from the power cord pass through both units kept temperatures down but the increased noise wasnt desireable for some gamers the intercooler ts that were reviewing today wants to make things right whats inside the box the intercooler ts comes packaged with some brief but effective instructions in multiple languages however i did find the smaller and well illustrated quick setup sheet more than adequate you also get a power adapter which is a change from the powercord pass through design of its predecessors features of the intercooler tsunlike the previous two intercoolers the new intercooler ts features a unique temperature sensor that automatically controls the fans turning them on when needed and off when not needed nyko claims that this will maintain optimal temperatures in your xbox 360 the fans automatically shut down when not needed the other feature of the new intercooler ts is the external power adapter the original intercoolers used a pass through design utilizing the xbox 360s own power cord this caused a number of early issues like short circuiting due to the power cord working loose which was later rectificed in the ex version the intercooler tss external power supply not only powers the unit independently but also allows the unit to continue cooling your xbox 360 even after you power it down this can improve the lifespan of your console this is similar to how some home theatre components like tvs and amplifiers operate finally the intercooler ts has a new optimized fan configuration that is designed to more quickly expel hot air away from the internal components of your xbox 360 console the new fan configuration also reduces the size of the intercooler ts when compared with its predecessors this can be good when installing your xbox 360s in tight spaces prev1 of 3next use your ← → arrow keys to browse share this with the worldcooling gaming nyko microsoft side winder x6 gaming keyboard review

i have the ts cooler and run it horizontally and it rox in my opinion here is a huge bit of advice i put my xbox 360 pro on a one of those small baskets flipped over you would find in a small freezeri think its made of hard plastic im unsure its blue in colorthis way the 360 is sitting on a grill like surface say around 810 inches away from the ground which allows more room to breathe and take my advice it works bigtime cheers overall the nyko intercooler ts works totally awesome do not use your xbox in a vertical position its harder on the drive itself and keep your power supply off the rug better on the hard surface to breathe i elevate my power supply about 3 inches from the floor its on using 2 objects on the underside of it on both endsit makes a huge dif too kk try this i promise youll be happyheres an example of the basket i use here httpecximagesamazonco right p  out stue2001 • 7 years ago update had move the senser which detects the outside temp from inside the intercooler to outside the intercoolers housing easy dun took 10mins and now working greatfor some reason the senser for detecting the outside temp is located inside the intercooler whats all that about  brock • 6 years ago the temp detector is inside because it needs to detect the temperature of the air coming out of the 360 when the air coming out of the 360 is hot the intercooler turns itself on to expel the hot air if the detector was outside it would detect the temperature of the air around the 360 which has no effect on the 360 at all if the detector was to be outside the intercooler then you could be in a hot room but your 360 might be cool and the fan would turn itself on this could happen when at night and youre asleep so it stops the fan randomly coming on thats what thats all about stue2001 • 7 years ago got this item today and dosnt seem to work properly as my xbox is in a hoz position the heat seems to rise to the top of case if i lean my xbox 360 forwards making the heat rise to the back the intercooler turns on so there is heat inside the case that needs to be drawn out but the senser dosnt pick it up also i noticed the intercooler case being hot shame about the product seemed like a good investment drakhlur • 7 years agoi am thinking of buying a ts intercooler but after reading the comments i am not to sure if i should buy a intercooler anyone give me your opinion or suggest me another fan system theviciousone • 6 years ago im in your boat im going to buy the fan stand for xbox link below and the intercooler listed above i have reviewed many different intercooler systems including liquid over the last four days and the ticket seems to be that just one fix is not enough drahklur flip your xbox upside down it vents from the bottom also and heat dose rise soor do what im suggesting a few other people as stated previously that they have done this and it seems very successful donpugz445 • 7 years agomy ts cooler never work properly on my 2008 ver elite but on my nephew who has a 2006 ver 360 is work perfectly so it depends what year your xbox was made too mine doesnt need the intercooler ts thats why i gave it to some who needed it ripoff • 7 years ago these devices are ripoffs and will ruin your machine dont be fooled thousands of people have complained about these doing just that and all they do is color it a different color and take your 20 then ruin your xbox steer cleer raging albinos • 7 years ago another thing about the intercooler that can really piss you is sometimes when you start up your xbox the intercooler makes a stupid annoying noise that sounds like a cat dying for about one minute and when you restart your xbox sometimes the intercooler will not turn on and you wont relize it this traps hot air from getting out of the xbox and can break your xbox just sayingguest • 7 years ago the noise means the bearings or bushings on on of the fans are bad brock • 6 years ago so how do you sort this out pillory • 7 years ago try this on your xbox 360 with the intercooler ts with an xbox 360 that has been running for about five minutes turn off the xbox and wait for the ts fans to shut off as soon as the ts fans shut off turn on the xbox 360 i can almost guarantee that the ts fans will never restart or at least take an extremely long time to do so this is the intercooler ts fatal flaw the reason this happens is because there is a reference sensor hidden within the case whose reading the ts compares to that of the primary and visible sensor that senses the air flowing out the xbox the problem is the intercooler case also heats up from the warm air coming off the xbox which in turn heats up the reference sensor within well guess what under certain conditions like the one mentioned in the previous paragraph the ts will read from its primary sensor a lower temperature than the reference sensor the ts then thinks the xbox is cooler than the surrounding air therefore the ts fans will never start even as your xbox gets hotter you have been warnedsomething360 • 7 years ago ive been using my nyko intercooler ts for the last year and a half i have never once had those specific issues in fact i just tried what you said my intercooler started back up no problem 30 seconeds after i turned on the console you obviously do nopt have the nyko ts and are basing your theory of no real proof i have never once had an issues with mine and it has never shut off and not come back on in fact i know it hasent beacuse the main drawback with this particular intercooler is that is is loud a lot louder then the xbox itself
