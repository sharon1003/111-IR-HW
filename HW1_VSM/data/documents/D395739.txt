showelections showpolitical parties showfederalism showother countries atlasv t e the election of president and vice president of the united states is an indirect election in which citizens of the united states who are registered to vote in one of the 50 u s states or washington d c cast ballots for members of the u s electoral college known as electors these electors then in turn cast direct votes known as electoral votes for president and vice president the candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral votes for president or vice president currently at least 270 out of a total of 538 is then elected to that office if no candidate receives an absolute majority for president the house of representatives chooses the president if no one receives a majority for vice president then the senate chooses the vice president the electoral college and its procedure is established in the u s constitution by article ii section 1 clauses 2 and 4 and the twelfth amendment which replaced clause 3 after its ratification in 1804 under clause 2 each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its senators and representatives in congress while per the twentythird amendment ratified in 1961 washington d c casts the same number of electoral votes as the leastrepresented state which is three also under clause 2 the manner for choosing electors is determined by each state legislature not directly by the federal government many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly but over time all of them switched to using the popular vote to help determine electors which persists today once chosen electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the plurality in their state but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as  faithless or  unpledged electors  1 in modern times faithless and unpledged electors have not affected the ultimate outcome of an election so the results can generally be determined based on the statebystate popular vote presidential elections occur quadrennially with registered voters casting their ballots on election day which since 1845 has been the first tuesday after november 1 2 3 4 this date coincides with the general elections of various other federal state and local races since local governments are responsible for managing elections these races typically all appear on one ballot the electoral college electors then formally cast their electoral votes on the first monday after december 12 at their respective state capitals congress then certify the results in early january and the presidential term begins on inauguration day which since the passage of the twentieth amendment has been set at january 20 the nomination process consisting of the primary elections and caucuses and the nominating conventions was not specified in the constitution but was developed over time by the states and political parties these primary elections are generally held between january and june before the general election in november while the nominating conventions are held in the summer though not codified by law political parties also follow an indirect election process where voters in the 50 u s states washington d c and u s territories cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political partys nominating convention who then in turn elect their partys presidential nominee each party may then choose a vice presidential running mate to join the ticket which is either determined by choice of the nominee or by a second round of voting because of changes to national campaign finance laws since the 1970s regarding the disclosure of contributions for federal campaigns presidential candidates from the major political parties usually declare their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year before the election almost 18 months

united states constitution originally established the method of presidential elections including the electoral college this was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted the congress to choose the president and those who preferred a national popular vote 6each state is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of congress combined with the ratification of the 23rd amendment to the constitution in 1961 the district of columbia is also granted a number of electors equal to the number of those held by the least populous state however u s territories are not represented in the electoral college constitutionally the manner for choosing electors is determined within each state by its legislature during the first presidential election in 1789 only 6 of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of popular vote 7 gradually throughout the years the states began conducting popular elections to help choose their slate of electors resulting in the overall nationwide indirect election system that it is today under the original system established by article two electors could cast two votes to two different candidates for president the candidate with the highest number of votes provided it was a majority of the electoral votes became the president and the secondplace candidate became the vice president this presented a problem during the presidential election of 1800 when aaron burr received the same number of electoral votes as thomas jefferson and challenged jeffersons election to the office in the end jefferson was chosen as the president because of alexander hamilton s influence in the house of representatives this added to the deep rivalry between burr and hamilton which resulted in their famous 1804 duel in response to the 1800 election the 12th amendment was passed requiring electors to cast two distinct votes one for president and another for vice president while this solved the problem at hand it ultimately had the effect of lowering the prestige of the vice presidency as the office was no longer for the leading challenger for the presidency the separate ballots for president and vice president became something of a moot issue later in the 19th century when it became the norm for popular elections to determine a states electoral college delegation electors chosen this way are pledged to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate offered by the same political party so while the constitution says that the president and vice president are chosen separately in practice they are chosen together the 12th amendment also established rules when no candidate wins a majority vote in the electoral college in the presidential election of 1824 andrew jackson received a plurality but not a majority of electoral votes cast the election was thrown to the house of representatives and john quincy adams was elected to the presidency a deep rivalry resulted between andrew jackson and house speaker henry clay who had also been a candidate in the election since 1824 aside from the occasional faithless elector the popular vote determines the winner of a presidential election by determining the electoral vote as each state or districts popular vote determines its electoral college vote although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the winner of a presidential election it does strongly correlate with who is the victor in 52 of the 56 total elections held so far about 93 percent the winner of the national popular vote has also carried the electoral college vote the winners of the nationwide popular vote and the electoral college vote differ only in close elections in highly competitive elections candidates focus on turning out their vote in the contested swing states critical to winning an electoral college majority so they do not try to maximize their popular vote by real or fraudulent vote increases in oneparty areas 8however candidates can fail to get the most votes in the nationwide popular vote in a presidential election and still win that election in the 1824 election jackson won the popular vote but no one received the majority of electoral votes according to the 12th amendment in the constitution the house of representatives must choose the president out of the top 3 people in the election clay had come fourth so he threw his support to adams who then won because adams later named clay his secretary of state jacksons supporters claimed that adams gained the presidency by making a deal with clay charges of a corrupt bargain followed adams through his term comparison of the popular vote totals since 1900 republican democrat all other candidates together then in 1876 1888 2000 and 2016 the winner of electoral vote lost the popular vote outright numerous constitutional amendments have been submitted seeking to replace the electoral college with a direct popular vote but none has ever successfully passed both houses of congress another alternate proposal is the national popular vote interstate compact an interstate compact whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results the presidential election day was established on a tuesday in the month of november because of the factors involved weather harvests and worship when voters used to travel to the polls by horse tuesday was an ideal day because it allowed people to worship on sunday ride to their county seat on monday and vote on tuesday–all before market day wednesday the month of november also fits nicely between harvest time and harsh winter weather which could be especially bad to people traveling by horse and buggy 9until 1937 presidents were not sworn in until march 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots and because of the winners logistical issues of moving to the capital with better technology and the 20th amendment being passed presidential inaugurations were moved to noon on january 20–allowing presidents to start their duties sooner 9the federal election campaign act of 1971 was enacted to increase disclosure of contributions for federal campaigns subsequent amendments to law require that candidates to a federal office must file a statement of candidacy with the federal election commission before they can receive contributions aggregating in excess of 5000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of 5000 thus this began a trend of presidential candidates declaring their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising and spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign 5the first president george washington was elected as an independent since the election of his successor john adams in 1796 all winners of u s presidential elections have represented one of two major parties third parties have taken second place only twice in 1860 and 1912 the last time a third independent candidate achieved significant success although still finishing in third place was in 1992 and the last time a thirdparty candidate received any electoral votes not from faithless electors was in 1968 procedure  editeligibility requirements  editthe handwritten copy of the naturalborncitizen clause as it appeared in 1787article two of the united states constitution stipulates that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a naturalborn citizen of the united states at least 35 years old and a resident of the united states for a period of no less than 14 years a candidate may start running his or her campaign early before turning 35 years old or completing 14 years of residency but must meet the age and residency requirements by inauguration day the twentysecond amendment to the constitution also sets a term limit a president cannot be elected to more than two terms the u s constitution also has two provisions that apply to all federal offices in general not just the presidency article i section 3 clause 7 states that if the u s congress convicts any officer on impeachment they may also bar that person from holding any public office in the future and section 3 of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the election to any federal office of any person who had held any federal or state office and then engaged in insurrection rebellion or treason this disqualification can be waived if such an individual gains the consent of twothirds of both houses of congress in addition the twelfth amendment establishes that the vicepresident must meet all of the qualifications of being a president although not a mandatory requirement federal campaign finance laws including the federal election campaign act state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of 5000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of 5000 among others must first file a statement of candidacy with the federal election commission 10 this has led presidential candidates especially members from the two major political parties to officially announce their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising or spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign 5 potential candidates usually form exploratory committees even earlier to determining the feasibility of them actually running nominating process  editmain articles united states presidential primary and united states presidential nominating convention a 2008 democratic caucus meeting in iowa city iowa the iowa caucuses are traditionally the first major electoral event of presidential primaries and caucuses madison square garden in new york city the site of the 1976 1980 and 1992 democratic national conventions and the 2004 republican national convention the floor of the 2008 republican national convention at the xcel energy center in saint paul minnesota the modern nominating process of u s presidential elections consists of two major parts a series of presidential primary elections and caucuses held in each state and the presidential nominating conventions held by each political party this process was never included in the united states constitution and thus evolved over time by the political parties to clear the field of candidates the primary elections are run by state and local governments while the caucuses are organized directly by the political parties some states hold only primary elections some hold only caucuses and others use a combination of both these primaries and caucuses are staggered generally between january and june before the federal election with iowa and new hampshire traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and primary respectively like the general election presidential caucuses or primaries are indirect elections the major political parties officially vote for their presidential candidate at their respective nominating conventions usually all held in the summer before the federal election depending on each states law and states political party rules when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary they may be voting to award delegates bound to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national convention unlike the general election voters in the u s territories can also elect delegates to the national conventions furthermore each political party can determine how many delegates to allocate to each state and territory in 2012 for example the democratic and republican party conventions each used two different formulas to allocate delegates the democratsbased theirs on two main factors the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the previous three presidential elections and the number of electoral votes each state had in the electoral college 11 in contrast the republicans assigned to each state 10 delegates plus 3 delegates per congressional district 12 both parties then gave fixed amounts of delegates to each territory and finally bonus delegates to states and territories that passed certain criteria 11 12along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses state and u s territory delegations to both the democratic and republican party conventions also include unpledged delegates that have a vote for republicans they consist of the three top party officials from each state and territory democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called  superdelegates  who are party leaders and elected officials each partys presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential nominee to run with him or her on the same ticket and this choice is rubberstamped by the convention if no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates including both pledged and unpledged then a  brokered convention  results all pledged delegates are then released and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate thereafter the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political horse trading and additional rounds of revotes 13 14 15 16the conventions have historically been held inside convention centers but since the late 20th century both the democratic and republican parties have favored sports arenas and domed stadiums to accommodate the increasing attendance the popular vote on election day  edita texas voter about to mark a selection for president on a ballot 2008 election day under the united states constitution the manner of choosing electors for the electoral college is determined by each states legislature although each state designates electors by popular vote other methods are allowed for instance instead of having a popular vote a number of states used to select presidential electors by a direct vote of the state legislature itself however federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day which is the first tuesday after the first monday in november ie a tuesday no earlier than november 2 and no later than november 8 17 today the states and the district of columbia each conduct their own popular elections on election day to help determine their respective slate of electors thus the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate and simultaneous state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government like any other election in the united states the eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the constitution and regulated at state level the constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on grounds of race or color sex or age for citizens eighteen years or older beyond these basic qualifications it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility generally voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice the presidential ballot is a vote for the electors of a candidate meaning that the voter is not voting for the candidate but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific presidential and vice presidential candidate many voting ballots allow a voter to “blanket vote” for all candidates in a particular political party or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as ballot access usually the size of the candidates political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is prelisted on the presidential ballot thus the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for president but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed laws are in effect to have other candidates prelisted on a ticket provided that enough voters have endorsed the candidate usually through a signature list the final way to be elected for president is to have ones name written in at the time of election as a writein candidate this is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be prelisted on the voting ticket it is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as mickey mouse or comedian stephen colbert whose application was voted down by the south carolina democratic party in any event a writein candidate has never won an election for president of the united states because u s territories are not represented in the electoral college u s citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for president guam has held straw polls for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact 18electoral college  editmain article electoral college united stateselectoral college map showing the

winnertakeall system wherein the ticket that wins a plurality of votes wins all of that states allocated electoral votes and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the electoral college maine and nebraska do not use this method instead giving two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district each states winning slate of

the rules outlined by the 12th amendment specifically the selection of president would then be decided by a contingent election in a ballot of the house of representatives for the purposes of electing the president each state has only one vote a ballot of the senate is held to choose the vice president in this ballot each senator has one vote the house of representatives has chosen the victor of the presidential race only twice in 1800 and 1824 the senate has chosen the victor of the vicepresidential race only once in 1836 if the president is not chosen by inauguration day the vice

legislatures appointed the senators technology and media  editlyndon b johnsons 1964 daisy advertisement advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns the invention of both radio and television have given way to the reliance of national political advertisements across those methods of communication national advertisements such as lyndon b johnson s 1964 commercial  daisy  ronald reagan s 1984 commercial  morning in america  and george h w bush s 1988 commercial  revolving door  became major factors in those respective elections in 1992 george h w bushs promise of  read my lips no new taxes  was extensively used in the commercials of bill clinton and bushs other opponents with significant effect during the campaign since the development of the internet in the mid90s internet activism has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns especially since 2000 the internet was first used in the 1996 presidential elections but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online 22 it was only used by a few candidates and there is no evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election cycle 22in 2000 both candidates  george w bush and al gore created maintained and updated their campaign website but it was not until the 2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the internet seen by the summer of 2003 ten people competing in the 2004 presidential election had developed campaign websites 23 howard dean’s campaign website from that year was considered a model for all future campaign websites his website played a significant role in his overall campaign strategy 23 it allowed his supporters to read about his campaign platform and provide feedback donate get involved with the campaign and connect with other supporters 22 a gallup poll from january 2004 revealed that 49 percent of americans have used the internet to get information about candidates and 28 percent said that they use the internet to get this information frequently 22in 2008 the internet became a grassroots and a voice of the people tool—a way for the users to connect with each other and with the campaign like dean’s website had done in 2004 all of the major candidates had a website and utilized social networking like facebook and my space the popularity of a candidate could be measured by the number of friends on these sites as well as on websites like hitwise which listed the number of hits all of the presidential candidate’s websites had each week internet channels such as you tube were used by candidates to share speeches and ads for free this also served as a forum for users to attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes 22a study done by the pew internet  american life project in conjunction with princeton survey research associates in november 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the united states used the internet to get information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific candidates this represents 73 percent of adult internet users the study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used social network sites or twitter to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns 24ecampaigning as it has come to be called is subject to very little regulation on march 26 2006 the federal election commission voted unanimously to not regulate political communication on the internet including emails blogs and the creating of web sites 25 this decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to campaign finance limitations 26 a comment was made about this decision by roger alan stone of advocacy inc which explains this loophole in the context of a political campaign a wealthy individual could purchase all of the email addresses for registered voters in a congressional district …produce an internet video ad and email it along with a link to the campaign contribution page…not only would this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent expenditure requirements it would never even need to be reported 25criticisms  editmain articles

points states won by democrat barack obama by 0–4 percentage points states won by democrat barack obama by 4–8 percentage points the presidential election process is controversial with critics arguing that it is inherently undemocratic and discourages voter participation and turnout in many areas of the country because of the staggered nature of the primary season voters in iowa new hampshire and other small states which traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses first in january usually have a major impact on the races campaign activity media attention and voter participation are usually higher in these states as the candidates attempt to build momentum and generate a bandwagon effect in these early primaries conversely voters in california and other large states which traditionally hold their primaries last in june usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidates will be the races are usually over by then and thus the campaigns the media and voters have little incentive to participate in these late primaries as a result more states vie for earlier primaries to claim a greater influence in the process however compressing the primary calendar in this way limits the ability of lesserknown candidates to effectively corral resources and raise their visibility among voters especially when competing with betterknown candidates who have more financial resources and the institutional backing of their partys establishment primary and caucus reform proposals include a national primary held on a single day or the interregional primary plan where states would be grouped into six regions and each of the regions would rotate every election on who would hold their primaries first with the primary races usually over before june the political conventions have mostly become scripted ceremonial affairs as the drama has left the conventions and complaints grown that they were scripted and dull pep rallies public interest and viewership has fallen off after having offered gaveltogavel coverage of the major party conventions in the mid20th century the big three television networks now only devote approximately three hours of coverage one hour per night critics also argue that the electoral college is archaic and inherently undemocratic with all states except maine and nebraska using a winnertakeall system both the democratic and the republican candidates are almost certain to win all the electoral votes from those states whose residents predominantly vote for the democratic party or the republican party respectively this encourages presidential candidates to focus exponentially more time money and energy campaigning in a few socalled  swing states  states in which no single candidate or party has overwhelming support such swing states like ohio are inundated with campaign visits saturation television advertising getoutthevote efforts by party organizers and debates meanwhile candidates and political parties have no incentive to mount nationwide campaign efforts or work to increase voter turnout in predominately democratic party safe states like california or predominately republican party safe states like texas in practice the winnertakeall system also both reinforces the countrys twoparty system and decreases the importance of third and minor political parties 27 furthermore a candidate can win the electoral vote without securing the greatest amount of the national popular vote such as during the 1824 1876 1888 2000 and 2016 elections in theory it is possible to secure the necessary 270 electoral votes from just the top 11 populous states and then ignore the rest of the country proposed changes to the election process  editin 1844 representative samuel f vinton of ohio proposed an amendment to the constitution that would replace the electoral college system with a lot system the joint resolution called for each state to elect by a simple majority a presidential candidate of said state each state would notify congress of the presidential election results congress would then inscribe the name of every state on uniform balls equal to the number of said states members of congress and deposit into a box in a joint session of congress a ball would be drawn and the elected candidate of the state of which is written on the drawn ball would be named president a second ball would immediately be drawn after and that states candidate would be named vicepresident the resolution did not pass the house representative vinton proposed an identical amendment in 1846 again it was unsuccessful the driving force behind the introduction of the resolution is unclear as there is no recorded debate for either proposal 28other constitutional amendments such as the every vote counts amendment have been proposed seeking to replace the electoral college with a direct popular vote which proponents argue would increase turnout and participation other proposed reforms include the national popular vote interstate compact an interstate compact without congressional authorization whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of voting their respective statewide results another proposal is for every state to simply adopt the district system used by maine and nebraska give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district the automatic plan would replace the electors with an automatic tallying of votes to eliminate the faithless elector affecting the outcome of the election the proportional plan often compared to the district plan would distribute electoral votes in each state in proportion to the popular vote introducing third party effects in election outcomes the house plan would require a constitutional amendment to allocate electors based on the house apportionment alone to lessen small state advantage direct

2004 and 2008 elections showed a noticeable increase over the turnout in 1996 and 2000 prior to 2004 voter turnout in presidential elections had been decreasing while voter registration measured in terms of voting age population vap by the u s census has been increasing the vap figure however includes persons ineligible to vote – mainly noncitizens and ineligible felons – and excludes overseas eligible voters opinion is mixed on whether this decline was due to voter apathy 73 74 75 76 or an increase in ineligible voters on the rolls 77 the difference between these two measures are illustrated by analysis of turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections voter turnout from the 2004 and 2008 election was not statistically different based on the voting age population used by a november 2008 u s census survey of 50000 households 73 if expressed in terms of vote eligible population vep the 2008 national turnout rate was 617 from 1313 million ballots cast for president an increase of over 16 percentage points over the 601 turnout rate of 2004 and the highest since 1968 78financial disclosures  editprior to 1967 many presidential candidates disclosed assets stock holdings and other information which might affect the public trust 79 in that year republican candidate george w romney went a step further and released his tax returns for the previous twelve years 79 since then many presidential candidates – including all majorparty nominees from 1980 to 2012 – have released some of their returns 80 although few of the major party nominees have equaled or exceeded george romneys twelve 81 82 the tax history project – a project directed by joseph j thorndike and established of the nonprofit tax analysts group 83 – has compiled the publicly released tax returns of presidents and presidential candidates including primary candidates 84in 2016 republican presidential nominee donald trump broke with tradition becoming the only majorparty candidate since gerald ford in 1976 to not make any of his full tax returns public 85 trump gave as a reason that he was being audited by the irs 85 however no law or precedent prevents a person from releasing their tax returns while under audit and in fact president richard m nixon released his tax returns while being audited 86 87presidential coattails  editmain article coattail effect presidential elections are held on the same date as those for all the seats in the united states house of representatives the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the united states senate the governorships in several u s states and many state and local elections presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who then vote for their partys candidates for those other offices 88 these other candidates are said to ride on the presidential candidates coattails voter turnout is also generally higher during presidential election years than either midterm election years 89 or oddnumbered election years 90comparison with other
