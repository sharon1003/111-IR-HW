modification most of us have form documents that we open and use to create a new document businesses usually have a collection of form letters so the correspondence leaving the company has a consistent appearance and tone the trick is to remember to immediately save the new document under a new name so the changes arent accidentally saved to the form document if you forget you can easily save your changes and alter the original there is a better way you can designate a file to be readonly when you open a readonly file you wont be allowed to save your changes to the original so you have to save your changes to a new file it is impossible to accidentally modify a file that has been set to readonly to designate a file as readonly you must have saved the file to disk you cannot have a copy of the file open in a word perfect window choose file open navigate to the file that you want to designate as readonly rightclick the file and choose properties place a check mark in the readonly check box in the attributes section choose ok to make changes to this original file youll have to reverse the process and remove the readonly attribute be sure you set it back after youve finalized the new form document
