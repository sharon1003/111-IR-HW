shaky i’ve done blood tests xrays ecographies to my all my abdominal area i had my pancreas checked i had a endoscopy and nothing my gastroenterologist says it’s stress and because of that i possibly

i definately understand i am having the same problems it started off only hurting when i would eat or drink something then going to just hurting randomly i went to a regular doctor and he ran blood tests and also did an ultrasound of course they found nothing except that my liver enzymes were a little high but supposedly not high enough to cause problems after different medications nothing worked so i was reffered to a gi specialist he put me on a very bland diet and it helped some but i was still having pain every once in a while went took a hida scan to check for gallstones but they didnt find any i took blood tests testing for other possibilities than the first blood test and i didnt hear for a week and a half about the blood results they had me scheduled for an upper gi after doing the upper gi they didnt see anything in my stomach but the blood tests showed some virus was there of course i was still out of it from the sedative but my stepmom told me what the doctor said he said it was something like mono but not mono i had a lot of the symptoms of mono and it was in my system for 2 months but i am not contagious he also said my liver is swollen and gave me no medications for it he told me that if in 2 weeks the pain hasnt gone away to come back for medications it seems like you are having the same problems i hope this helps good luck anonymous 42789

apparently its on the left side of your abdomen i didnt know that it could be that youre having trouble digesting or that youre constipated i dont go very often but i do eat a lot so that could explain it i dont think its ibs  it sounds more like a digestive problem constipation or gallbladder problems maybe anonymous 42789 replies february 8 2010 0710 pm 0 0flag this response im 28 just
