diagnosis no specific test exists to diagnose parkinsons disease your doctor trained in nervous system conditions neurologist will diagnose parkinsons disease based on your medical history a review of your signs and symptoms and a neurological and physical examination your doctor may order tests such as blood tests to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms imaging tests — such as mri ultrasound of the brain spect and pet scans — may also be used to help rule out other disorders imaging tests arent particularly helpful for diagnosing parkinsons disease in addition to your examination your doctor may give you carbidopalevodopa a parkinsons disease medication you must be given a sufficient dose to show the benefit as low doses for a day or two arent reliable significant improvement with this medication will often confirm your diagnosis of parkinsons disease sometimes it takes time to diagnose parkinsons disease doctors may recommend regular followup appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders to evaluate your condition and symptoms over time and diagnose parkinsons disease treatment deep brain stimulation parkinsons disease cant be cured but medications can help control your symptoms often dramatically in some later cases surgery may be advised your doctor may also recommend lifestyle changes especially ongoing aerobic exercise in some cases physical therapy that focuses on balance and stretching also is important a speechlanguage pathologist may help improve your speech problems medications medications may help you manage problems with walking movement and tremor these medications increase or substitute for dopamine a specific signaling chemical neurotransmitter in your brain people with parkinsons disease have low brain dopamine concentrations however dopamine cant be given directly as it cant enter your brain you may have significant improvement of your symptoms after beginning parkinsons disease treatment over time however the benefits of drugs frequently diminish or become less consistent although symptoms usually can continue to be fairly wellcontrolled medications your doctor may prescribe include carbidopalevodopa levodopa the most effective parkinsons disease medication is a natural chemical that passes into your brain and is converted to dopamine levodopa is combined with carbidopa rytary sinemet which protects levodopa from premature conversion to dopamine outside your brain which prevents or lessens side effects such as nausea side effects may include nausea or lightheadedness orthostatic hypotension after years as your disease progresses the benefit from levodopa may become less stable with a tendency to wax and wane wearing off also you may experience involuntary movements dyskinesia after taking higher doses of levodopa your doctor may lessen your dose or adjust the times of your doses to control these effects carbidopalevodopa infusion the u s food and drug administration approved a drug called duopa in 2015 this medication is made up of carbidopa and levodopa however its administered through a feeding tube that delivers the medication in a gel form directly to the small intestine duopa is for patients with more advanced parkinsons who still respond to carbidopalevodopa but who have a lot of fluctuations in their response because duopa is continually infused blood levels of the two drugs remain constant placement of the tube requires a small surgical procedure risks associated with having the tube include the tube falling out or infections at the infusion site dopamine agonists unlike levodopa dopamine agonists dont change into dopamine instead they mimic dopamine effects in your brain they arent as effective as levodopa in treating your symptoms however they last longer and may be used with levodopa to smooth the sometimes offandon effect of levodopa dopamine agonists include pramipexole mirapex ropinirole requip and rotigotine given as a patch neupro a shortacting injectable dopamine agonist apomorphine apokyn is used for quick relief some of the side effects of dopamine agonists are similar to the side effects of carbidopalevodopa but also include hallucinations sleepiness and compulsive behaviors such as hypersexuality gambling and eating if youre taking these medications and you behave in a way thats out of character for you talk to your doctor maob inhibitors these medications include selegiline eldepryl zelapar and rasagiline azilect they help prevent the breakdown of brain dopamine by inhibiting the brain enzyme monoamine oxidase b maob this enzyme metabolizes brain dopamine side effects may include nausea or insomnia when added to carbidopalevodopa these medications increase the risk of hallucinations these medications are not often used in combination with most antidepressants or certain narcotics due to potentially serious but rare reactions check with your doctor before taking any additional medications with a maob inhibitor catecholomethyltransferase comt inhibitors entacapone comtan is the primary medication from this class this medication mildly prolongs the effect of levodopa therapy by blocking an enzyme that breaks down dopamine side effects including an increased risk of involuntary movements dyskinesias mainly result from an enhanced levodopa effect other side effects include diarrhea or other enhanced levodopa side effects tolcapone tasmar is another comt inhibitor that is rarely prescribed due to a risk of serious liver damage and liver failure anticholinergics these medications were used for many years to help control the tremor associated with parkinsons disease several anticholinergic medications are available including benztropine cogentin or trihexyphenidyl however their modest benefits are often offset by side effects such as impaired memory confusion hallucinations constipation dry mouth and impaired urination amantadine doctors may prescribe amantadine alone to provide shortterm relief of symptoms of mild earlystage parkinsons disease it may also be given with carbidopalevodopa therapy during the later stages of parkinsons disease to control involuntary movements dyskinesias induced by carbidopalevodopa side effects may include a purple mottling of the skin ankle swelling or hallucinations surgical procedures deep brain stimulation in deep brain stimulation dbs surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain the electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest near your collarbone that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your parkinsons disease symptoms your doctor may adjust your settings as necessary to treat your condition surgery involves risks including infections stroke or brain hemorrhage some people experience problems with the dbs system or have complications due to stimulation and your doctor may need to adjust or replace some parts of the system deep brain stimulation is most often offered to people with advanced parkinsons disease who have unstable medication levodopa responses dbs can stabilize medication fluctuations reduce or halt involuntary movements dyskinesias reduce tremor reduce rigidity and improve slowing of movement dbs is effective in controlling erratic and fluctuating responses to levodopa or for controlling dyskinesias that dont improve with medication adjustments however dbs isnt helpful for problems that dont respond to levodopa therapy apart from tremor a tremor may be controlled by dbs even if the tremor isnt very responsive to levodopa although dbs may provide sustained benefit for parkinsons symptoms it doesnt keep parkinsons disease from progressing request an appointment at mayo clinic
