to check for them sara reply43007 2lois d d family t1 since 1981 age 57 join date august 2006location stafford virginia posts  100hi sara ketones are when your body burns fat or muscle instead of glucose this occurs when your numbers are running extremely high illness or not taking care of yourself this causes a conditional known as dka which is extremely dangerous and lead to hospitalization to check for ketones is very simple the pharmacy has the test strips usually 79 per bottle it is a urine test so just dip the strip in the urine wait the appropriate amount of time usually a couple of seconds then compare to the measurements listed on the bottle if the ketones are high call your doctor immediately or go directly to the emergency room it is better to get treatment as soon as possible in these cases sometimes the doc can adjust your insulin intake over the phone but have you watch closely for some time after hope this helps b colorgreenlois mm 722 wcgms since dec 2003

xceed which tests for blood ketones as well as blood glucose it reads the ketone level as it is at that moment which is good as urine testing checks for ketones which may have been present for some time reply43007 4tiger lily d d family t1 join date december 2006posts  100sara you check for ketones if your blood glucose is over 14 250 us to make sure that a type 1 hasnt gone into diabetic

strips that come in a container will go bad some time period after the container is opened like regular test strips so individually wrapped ketone strips may last for a longer period of time shaun

august 2006location seattle waposts  100ketones are a result of not having enough insulin you shouldnt forgo basal insulin even when sick and blood sugar is okay symptoms of high ketones can be abdominal pain vomiting muscle pains with children you should always check for ketones if they start vomiting you also may need to check often if they are sick especially with fever many parents prefer blood ketone meters such as precision xtra because children can be so variable urine ketones could be showing you what happened in the body hours ago whereas blood ketones are showing what is going on right now urine ketone testing is cheaper though small ketones can almost be considered normal however if the ketones are moderate or large you should call your doctor in general to flush the ketones out push insulin and carbs if they cant keep much down try juice or regular not diet drinks which of course you should cover with insulin this means you will need to keep checking ketones if the ketones dont come down or they start breathing abnormally then you need to go the er right away because they could be going into dka there they will give iv insulin and glucose if blood sugar is not super high to flush out the ketones i dont want to scare you but i think its important that you know details because sometimes ers need a little prodding since they dont deal much with type 1 also sometimes you will find doctors that dont seem to really know the dangers you are your own and your childs best advocate dx t2 32005 correctly dx t1 lada 112006 mm 522 wnovo log previously tried actos

ketones you just get a blood sample like you would with a sugar test you put it in the strip the same way as a sugar test and it reads in mmol the results are ketones 00 to 05 are normal there are also urine strips which you pee on there are two types of ketones one is starvation ketones anyone can get these these ketones are caused by someone starving themselves my doc told me that people my age dont worry not your sondont know what the limit is for his age who eat under 60 grams of carbs a day can get them they are resolved by eating something with carbs in them the other type of ketones that are most common are the diabetic ketones they are cause because there is to high of glucose and not enough insulin you can also get them when your sick sugars are usually higher and not eating as much as you normally do to fix this you need extra insulin for small to moderate ketones i was taught to give 10 of my total daily dose of insulin for moderate to large i was taught to give 20 of my daily dose these percentages are on top of my usual correction dose if the ketones are to high you can go into dka or diabetic keto acidose this requires emergency treatment and hospitalition the two times i was in dka i was given several leters of fluids and insulin drip in the er along with some iv medicine to stop the vomiting then i spent a week in the hospital with the iv fluids and insulin drip going slower and slower untill i was back to normal there is no way to describe how you feel with ketones that if you experience it your self you feel like a train wrech nonmedically correct term we use for someone who is very ill sometimes close to death you have severe stomach pain some people get back pain nauseus uncontrolled vomiting migraine on top of the high blood sugar symptoms it is not fun at all i was taught to check for ketones when ever my sugar was over 250mgdl was ill was nauseus or vomiting or just dont feel right if they come back positive i have to take extra insulin according to the scale the doctor gave me drink lots of sugar free drinks prefferably water and keep rechecking my sugar and ketones every hour if uncomfortable treating then call the endo on call if there is no improvement or i get worse in an hour i need to call the doctor and plan on going to the er which has happened several times just because they are still elevated or worse does not mean i am in dka but i could be i rather go to the er and be seen than wait it out and be in abad dka i have gone to the hosptial several times for high blood sugars and ketones twice i was in and official dka the other times i was treated with fluids and insulin untill everything came down and went home with out a hospital admission dont freak out about my cases i get ketones very easily for some reason the doc doesnt know why i can have high amounts if i miss my lantus by one hour it is just the way my body works my best friend on the other hand she is a t1 pumper hardely ever gets them and when she does they are small amounts ketones are not a bad thing to check for you can talk to the endo about them and they can give you one of the meters and write a script for the strips you can even buy the strips to pee on at walmarttargetcvswalgreensbrooksetc for under 10 bucks your endo can write a script for the pee ones that are individually packaged too i like the blood one the best i find it more accurate instead of a ball park reading you get an actual reading and the best thing with the percision xtra you can also get the glucose test strips and use it as his glucometer too if you
