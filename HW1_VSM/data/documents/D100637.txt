started on metformin last night 500mg x2 daily until now i can never get below 100 without a liver dump shooting it back up into the 120s130s when i am at work under stress it can go into the 190s any idea how long before i should be able to see some effect on my base bg level kinda hoping it could lower my bounce level about 20 points or so surfer age 51 type 2 since 2011 apr 2017  a1c 78 januvia

given met often takes 34 weeks to reach full strength blood levels but that doesnt mean it isnt working in the interim you may see changes in just a few days your dose is a good starting level and if you get by without gastric side effects my guess would be you could increase your dosage gradually over time if you dont see as much improvement as you hoped for what did your doc say about future

diabetes  metformin is the absolute best treatment for insulin resistance  bar none you may have to stand up to him more often if he gets stubborn about this  theres no excuse for withholding the meds that will lower your blood sugar there are no other oral meds that work as well as met without damaging your pancreas but see how you do on the current dosage  cross that bridge when you come to it

improvement i didnt see any improvement at 500 2xs a day dose so my doc tested my cpeptide and found out i wasnt producing enough insulin so we added insulin and my numbers are normal now10292011 1246

works in the liver by making you sensitive to your own insulin so it needs to build up in your system i started off on 500 then within a few days went to 1000 it lowered it somewhat but not enough i then went to 1700 mg and could get my bgs to about 120130 finally i had to go to 2550 and a very low carb diet 30 carbs a day before i saw bgs below 100 but as i said maybe that was just me the low carb diet really helped me the most metformin does not allow you to eat more carbs as some d drugs do diagnosed feb 2007 metformin2550 low carb organic diet 3 t of coconut oil daily moderate exercise

metformin and insulin normal and stable was not possible without reducing my daily intake of carbs to roughly 3050 grams insulin isnt supposed to be used so you can keep eating the same amount of carbs my doc purposely prescribed just enough to get me close to normal and then challenged me to go the rest of the way downward by making dietary changes i like that approach and its working well for me ive been going very hypo meaning below 70 lately before meals that im actually going to need to start reducing my insulin but i plan to discuss that with my doc next week during my 1 month

kentucky usaposts 158 type 2 diagnosed in 1998 60 likes received132 likes given quote originally posted by patdartvery hypo sounds pretty normal to me nope  not normal at all 70 is the lowest end of normal ive been going into the mid 50s thus very hypo then as i stated your body will send out all kinds of alarm bells to alert you to get yourself restored to normal in which case i do not overcorrect i just pop a glucose tablet and retest at 20 minute intervals until i am back up to normal then i assess the situation and ask myself things like how many carbs had i eaten how long ago etc for instance one time i had eaten a taco salad and a few bites of the shell and just 2 hours later i was at 56 my doc currently has me injecting 20 units premeal if my bg is 150 or less and more if its higher what this tells me is that 20 units of insulin is now too much for me especially if im having a no carb or very low carb meal so ill be discussing my ideas of how to fine tune things with my doc next week so i can maintain my target he has set for me which is 70130 hope this helps clarify things a little better
