china1 introduction the composition of the continental crust is critically important for understanding its formation and evolution and ultimately understanding earths differentiation and for quantifying geodynamic processes within the earth eg taylor and mc lennan 1995 2009 rudnick 1995 gao et al 1998a rundick and gao 2003 hawkesworth and kemp 2006a b it also provides baselines for assessing geochemical anomalies in exploration of ore deposits and environmental and agriculture investigations for these reasons determining the chemical composition of the continental crust has been an aim of geochemists since the first analyses of rocks were undertaken clarke 1889 the continental crust can be divided into upper middle and lower layers and shows wide lithological and geochemical variations the upper crust is readily accessible for direct sampling and its composition is reasonably well established for the major elements and many lithophile trace elements in comparison the composition of the deep middle and lower crust is less well established due to its general inaccessibility here we provide a brief review of the chemical composition of the continental crust with an emphasis on studies from china for detailed reviews of composition of the continental crust in the global context see rudnick and gao 2003 and taylor and mc lennan 20092 the upper crust two approaches have generally been used to determine the composition of the upper continental crust ref rudnick and gao 2003 taylor and mc lennan 2009 one is to establish weighted averages of the compositions of rocks exposed at the surface by largescale sampling campaigns all majorelement determinations of uppercrust composition rely upon this method the other approach is to determine the average concentrations of insoluble elements in finegrained clastic sediments and sedimentary rocks eg shale mudstone graywacke siltstone loess and tillite and use these to infer the average composition of their source regions21 weighted averages of exposed crust the canadian shield represents the first area in which largescale sampling of the crust was undertaken for both major and trace element analyses shaw et al 1967 1976 1986 eade and fahrig 1971 1973 more recently two campaigns of systematic largescale sampling and rock analyses were undertaken in eastern china in the 1980s and 1990s for the purpose of studying the chemical composition of the continental crust the first was carried out in the qinling orogen and the adjacent regions of the north china craton and yangtze craton the sampling covered an area of 153200 km 2 and comprised over 4500 individual rock samples that represented all of the late archean to neogene stratigraphic units the 23 of the exposed granitoids as well as all of the major maficultramafic intrusions in the study area these individual rocks were analyzed for thirteen major and thirty trace and rare earth elements the results were used in conjunction with seismic velocities of the deep crust and surface heat flow to estimate the composition of the upper deep and total crust of the qingling region gao et al 1992 zhang et al 1994 figure 1a second round of largescale sampling was conducted over most of eastern china covering a total area of ca 3300000 km 2 fig 1 yan et al 1997 yan and chi 1997 gao et al 1998b zhang et al 2002 a total of 28253 individual rocks were sampled from which 2718 composite samples were prepared based on age lithology and tectonic units between sixtythree to seventysix major and trace elements were analyzed by a variety of methods including elements that are rarely analyzed eg ag as bi br cd cl f ge hg i in mo pge te se w yan et al 1997 yan and chi 1997 gao et al 1998b zhang et al 2002 these studies revealed higher transition metal abundances of the upper crust compared to previous estimates that were based on results from the canadian shield studies shaw et al 1967 1976 1986 eade and fahrig 1971 1973 taylor and mc lennan 1985 wedepohl 1995 a higher transition metal content of the upper crust has been supported by subsequent studies of finegrained clastic sedimentary rocks condie 1993 plank and langmuir 1998 mc lennan 2001 hu and gao 2008 taylor and mc lennan 2009 the discrepancies between the canadian shield and eastern china studies were ascribed to differential erosion the presentday surface of the canadian shield is dominated by amphibolitefacies granitoid gneisses which are more typical of middle crust than upper crust the uppermost crust of archean regions typically contains more mafic volcanic rocks gao et al 1998b by contrast unmetamorphosed to greenschistfacies rocks are well preserved in eastern china the influence of erosion on the upper crust composition was also demonstrated by condie 1993 who added a 10 km thick layer of upper crust in precambrian areas and a 5 km thick layer of upper crust in phanerozoic areas to the present upper crust layer this restoration model for the upper continental crust composition shows a remarkably good agreement with the eastern china upper crust composition in terms of nb rb th zr co sc and v as well as k 2 o concentrations although the cr and ni abundances of the restoration model are significantly greater than the eastern china estimates the difference is small compared to estimates based on the canadian shield we conclude that eastern china surface samples are a good representation of the average upper continental crust gao et al 1992 1998b another important observation from eastern china is that various thicknesses of sedimentary cover including carbonate are an important component of the upper continental crust because carbonate and silicate rocks vary greatly in their chemical compositions and since the sedimentary cover in eastern china contains a significantly higher carbonate proportion with a carbonate pelitesandstone ratio of 031223 compared to the global ratio of 018 taylor and mc lennan 1985 the upper crust compositions with and without carbonate are distinct in major elements eg 585 vs 655 for si o2 and 741 vs 331 for ca o gao et al 1998b however because carbonates have low abundances of trace elements excepting sr the two estimates of the upper crust do not vary in relative trace element abundances yan et al 1997 gao et al 1998b the major element compositions without carbonate are also similar to previous estimates gao et al 1998b in addition trace elements associated with mineralization eg b cl se as bi pd w th cs ta tl hg au and pb show considerable interunit variability by a factor of 25 in the upper crust gao et al 1998b22 finegrained sedimentary rocks estimates of the upper crustal composition from finegrained clastic sedimentary rocks were applied by taylor and mc lennan 1985 to trace elements that are immobile during waterrock interaction and are not hosted in accessory minerals and thus are little fractioned during sedimentary processing and diagenesis such elements include ree y th and sc the more mobile elements such as k u and rb can be estimated from assumed thu ku and krb ratios taylor and mc lennan 1985 the finegrained sediment approach has more recently been extended to elements such as nb ta cs and transition metals cr ni v co and ti mc donough et al 1992 plank and langmuir 1998 barth et al 2000 mc lennan 2001 figure 2in a recent study hu and gao 2008 analyzed 48 trace elements by icpms including the rarely analyzed elements as b be bi cd ge in mo sb sn te tl w in wellcharacterized upper crustal samples shales pelites loess graywackes granitoids and their composites from australia china europe new zealand and north american the results reveal that interelement correlations in clastic sedimentary rocks can be extended to many immobile as well as mobile elements eg gain thsn rbtl thtl rbbe thbe rbge rbw bebi wbi inli bte fetransition trace metals fig 2 the significant r 2 06 correlations observed in clastic sediments and sedimentary rocks provide narrowly constrained upper continental crust elemental ratios which can be used with abundances for certain key elements to place constraints on the concentrations of these rarely analyzed elements in the upper crust using the wellestablished upper crustal abundances of la 31 ppm th 105 ppm al 2 o 3 1540 k 2 o 280 and fe 2 o 3 592 these correlations lead to revised upper crustal abundances for b47 ppm li41 ppm cr73 ppm ni34 ppm sb0075 te0027 ppm w14 ppm tl053 ppm and bi023 ppm no significant correlations exist between mo and cd and other elements in the clastic sediments and sedimentary rocks probably due to their enrichment in organic carbon if we assume that these two incompatible elements behave more or less like ree and th their abundances can be calculated by assuming the upper continental crust consists of 65 granitoid rocks plus 35 clastic sedimentary rocks the validity of this bulk average approach for incompatible elements is supported by the similarity of si o 2 al 2 o 3 la and th abundances calculated in this way with their upper crustal abundances given in rudnick and gao 2003 the upper crustal abundances thus obtained are mo06 ppm and cd006 ppm the data also suggest a 20 increase of the tm yb and lu abundances reported in rudnick and gao 2003 in summary studies of surface samples from eastern china and clastic sediments establish significantly higher upper crustal abundances of transition metals compared to those based on surface samples from the canadian shield the upper crustal compositions of the major elements and a majority of trace elements as well as some key elemental ratios are well established such estimates can form basis of mass balance calculations for the earth and provide geodynamic insights eg rudnick et al 2000 however the upper crustal abundances of some elements notably platinum group elements noble gases and the halogens are still highly uncertain3 the deep crust major uncertainties in the composition of the continental crust lie in the deep continental crust and particularly the lower crust as it is far less accessible than the upper crust four approaches have been used to infer its composition ref rudnick and gao 2003 1 analyses of highgrade metamorphic amphibolite or granulite facies terrains and exposed crustal crosssections in particular 2 studies of granulitefacies xenoliths entrained in fastrising magmas 3 correlation of measured seismic velocities of deep crustal rocks with seismic profiles of the crust and 4 surface heat flow measurements studies of exposed crustal crosssections and xenoliths indicate that although exceptions exist the middle crust is dominated by rocks metamorphosed at amphibolitefacies to lower granulite facies while the lower crust consists mainly of granulitefacies rocks rudnick and gao 2003 and references therein exposed amphibolite to granulitefacies terrains and middle crustal crosssections show that although they contain a wide variety of lithologies including metasedimentary rocks they are dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks of the dioritetonalitetrondhjemitegranodiorite dttg and granite suites this is true not only for precambrian shields but also for phanerozoic crust and continental arcs such rock associations are consistent with the average middle crustal pwave velocities of 6465 km s 1 seen in all the tectonic settings except for active rifts and some intraoceanic island arcs which have higher average velocities suggesting a more mafic composition rudnick and fountain 1995 middle crust compositional estimates based on sampling of amphibolitefacies rocks and seismic profiles yield a bulk composition with 6269 si o 2 trace element composition of the middle crust is poorly constrained as systematic trace element studies of amphibolitefacies rocks are few nevertheless the estimates of rudnick and fountain 1995 based on lithologies derived from seismic velocities and gao et al 1998b based on eastern china surface sampling show a broadly similar composition in both major and trace elements although the eastern china middle crust composition is more evolved having higher si o 2 k 2 o ba li zr and lree and la nyb n and lower total fe o sc v cr and co with a significant negative eu anomaly these differences are expected based on the slightly higher compressional velocity of rudnick and fountains global middle crust compared to that of eastern china 66 vs 64 km s 1 gao et al 1998a b the consistency is surprising considering that the two estimates are based on different sample sets and different approaches one global and the other regional rudnick and gao 2003 figure 3 figure 4like the middle crust the lower crust also contains a wide variety of lithologies as revealed by studies of granulite xenoliths exposed highpressure granulite terranes and crustal cross sections nevertheless mafic rocks appear to dominate in the lower crust based on the relatively high seismic velocities which are faster than 69 km s 1 mostly ≥70 km s 1 for various tectonic units rudnick and fountain 1995 while there is a general consensus that the global lower continental crust is mafic in composition ref rudnick and fountain 1995 christensen and mooney 1995 eastern china is a remarkable exception to this generality studies of exposed lower crustal crosssection and lower crustal granulitefacies xenoliths in eastern china indicate a bimodal lithological distribution in the lower crust with felsic rocks being an important constituent as exemplified by the hannuoba granulite xenoliths which have an average si o 2 of 56 kern et al 1995 liu et al 2001 this is unlike the worldwide compilations of lower crustal xenoliths which are predominately mafic rudnick and presper 1990 rudnick and fountain 1995 with an average si o 2 of 515 fig 3 this conclusion is supported by results of seismic profiling which indicate a distinct twolayered structure to the lower crust for all of eastern china except the qingling orogen fig 4 the upper lower crust has a mean velocity of 67 km s 1 suggesting an evolved composition only the lowermost crust has a mean velocity that is typical of mafic rocks average velocity  71 km s 1 and is comparable to the global lower crust the bulk lower crust of eastern china has a mean pwave velocity of 682 km s 1 that is slower than the global average by 0204 km s 1 and is consistent with an intermediate bulk composition gao et al 1998a b the slower velocity of the lower crust of eastern china is reinforced by recent compilations of seismic profiling in china li et al 2006 we conclude that the evolved lower crust composition of eastern china is well established and is a remarkable feature exceptional to the global continental crust4 the total crust composition and its geodynamic implications there is a general consensus that the bulk composition of the continental crust is andesitic all estimates of the crust composition including the pioneering work of clarke 1889 have a total crustal si o 2 that falls between 571645 rudnick and gao 2003 regardless of the approaches and data sets that have been employed to derive these estimates moreover all estimates show a continental crust that is characterized by enrichments in largeion lithophile elements eg cs rb ba and in particular pb and depletions in highfield strength elements nb ta ti these features are therefore considered robust and can be used to understand the formation and evolution of the continental crust the continental crust grows primarily by an igneous flux from the mantle which in most cases should be basaltic the demonstrably nonbasaltic composition of the continental crust requires some form of crustal recycling through delamination weathering andor subduction rudnick 1995 europium balance or imbalance in the continental crust may be useful for understanding the processes by which the crust evolved eg gao et al 1998a hawkesworth and kemp 2006b mantlederived additions to the crust would normally have no eu anomaly intracrustal differentiation by granitic magmatism has led to a prominent negative eu anomaly in the granitic upper crust eueu072 rudnick and gao 2003 and should produce a restitic lower crust with a complementary positive eu anomaly taylor and mc lennan 1985 2009 however if delamination of the dense mafic lower crust could occur and if this crust contained cumulate or residual plagioclase the total crust after delamination would evolve toward a felsic composition with a negative eu anomaly the total crust composition estimates of rudnick and gao 2003 has a weak negative eu anomaly eueu093 which would accommodate some removal of plagioclase cumulatesrestites although given the uncertainties there is no need to call upon plagioclase removal from the lower crust figure 5in contrast to the global average lower crust the continental crust in eastern china has a pronounced negative eu anomaly eueu080 gao et al 1998a b the upper and middle crusts of eastern china have eueu of 073 and 078 respectively weighted by thickness the upper plus middle crust as a whole has an average eueu of 075 fig 5 the hannuoba mafic and mafic to felsic granulite xenoliths have almost identical eueu of 128 and 130 respectively if the eastern china lower crust is assumed to be represented by the average hannuoba granulite xenoliths the resultant total crust has eueu of 089 fig 5 this magnitude of eu anomaly is insufficient to compensate for the negative eu anomaly of the upper and middle crust so as to produce no eu anomaly in the total crust the model lower crust is required to have eueu of 173 to make a balance which is far greater than the average worldwide mafic eueu124 and mafic to felsic granulite xenoliths eueu114 fig 5 delamination of the lower crust plus underlying lithospheric mantle has been suggested to have occurred in eastern china based on studies of mesozoic highmg adakitic magmas picritic and basaltic lavas and entrained eclogitic xenoliths in the north china craton gao et al 2004 2008 xu et al 2006 although other models may also explain the andesitic composition of the continental crust rudnick and gao 2003 arculus 2006 davidson and arculus 2006 we conclude that delamination of the deep lithosphere may have played an important role in driving the continental crust to an evolved composition loss of the archean keel and in producing the large volumes of intraplate magmatism in the north china craton during the mesozoic gao et al 2004 2008 xu et al 2006
