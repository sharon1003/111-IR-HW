crabeating macaque nursing her offspring a human mother feeding her child parental investment  pi  in evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology is any parental expenditure time energy etc that benefits one offspring at a cost to parents  ability to invest in other components of fitness 1 2 and is thus a form of reproductive success components of fitness 3 include the wellbeing of existing offspring parents future sexual reproduction and inclusive fitness through aid to kin 4 parental investment may be performed by both the male and female biparental care the mother alone exclusive maternal care or the father alone exclusive paternal care  initially introduced in 1930 by the english biologist and statistician ronald fisher parental care is found in a broad range of taxonomic groups including both ectothermic invertebrates fish amphibians and reptiles and endothermic birds and mammals species care can be provided at any stage of the offsprings life prenatal care including behaviours such as egg guarding preparation of nest brood carrying incubation and placental nourishment in mammals and postnatal care including food provisioning and protection of offspring an alternative to fishers theory is trivers  parental investment theory pit proposed in 1972 5 in which he focuses on how parental investment in humans affects their sexual behaviour this theory has been influential in explaining sex differences in phenomena such as sexual selection and mate preference the main premise of this theory is the differential investment of males and females particularly how in most species females invest more due to the mating effort required another aspect of the theory is mate preferences of each sex for example female choosiness and male promiscuity contents  hide 1

1930 book the genetical theory of natural selection 6 wherein fisher argued that parental expenditure on both sexes of offspring should be equal cluttonbrock expanded the concept of pi to include costs to any other component of parental fitness a cellar spider defending spiderlings reproduction is costly individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition survival and further reproductive output however such expenditure is typically beneficial to the offspring enhancing their condition survival and reproductive success these differences may lead to parentoffspring conflict parental investment can be provided by the female female uniparental care the male male uniparental care or both biparental care parents are naturally selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs and parental care will tend to exist when the benefits are substantially greater than the costs penguins are a prime example of a species that drastically sacrifices their own health and wellbeing in exchange for the survival of their offspring this behavior one that does not necessarily benefit the individual but the genetic code from which the individual arises can be seen in the king penguin although some animals do exhibit altruistic behaviors towards individuals that are not of direct relation many of these behaviors appear mostly in parentoffspring relationships while breeding males remain in a fastingperiod at the breeding site for five weeks waiting for the female to return for her own incubation shift however during this time period males may decide to abandon their egg if the female is delayed in her return to the breeding grounds this is an interesting case as it shows that these penguins initially show a tradeoff of their own health in hopes of increasing the survivorship of their egg but there comes a point where the male penguins costs become too high in comparison to the gain of a successful breeding season in a study olof olsson investigated the correlation between how many experiences in breeding an individual has and the duration an individual will wait until abandoning his egg he proposed that the more experienced the individual the better that individual will be at replenishing his exhausted body reserves allowing him to remain at the egg for a longer period of time the males sacrifice of their body weight and possible survivorship in order to increase their offsprings chance of survival is a tradeoff between current reproductive success and the parents future survival 7 this tradeoff makes sense with other examples of kinbased altruism and is a clear example of the use of altruism in an attempt to increase overall fitness of an individuals genetic material at the expense of the individuals future survival a study found that male dunnocks tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems however they increase their own reproductive success through feeding the offspring in relation to their own access to the female throughout the mating period which is generally a good predictor of paternity 8 this indiscriminative parental care by males is also observed in redlip blennies 9in iteroparous species where individuals may go through several reproductive bouts during their lifetime a tradeoff may exist between investment in current offspring and future reproduction parents need to balance their offsprings demands against their own selfmaintenance this potential negative effect of parental care was explicitly formalized by trivers in 1972 who originally defined the term parental investment to mean any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offsprings chance of surviving and hence reproductive success at the cost of the parents ability to invest in other offspring 2a female lizard defending her clutch against an eggeating snake the benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition growth survival and ultimately on reproductive success of the offspring for example in the cichlid fish tropheus moorii a female has very high parental investment in her young because she mouthbroods the young and while mouthbrooding all nourishment she takes in goes to feed the young and she effectively starves herself in doing this her young are larger heavier and faster than they would have been without it these benefits are very advantageous since it lowers their risk of being eaten by predators and size is usually the determining factor in conflicts over resources 10 however such benefits can come at the cost of parents ability to reproduce in the future eg through increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time interval until the next reproduction a special case of parental investment is when young do need nourishment and protection but the genetic parents do not actually contribute in the effort to raise their own offspring for example in bombus terrestris oftentimes sterile female workers will not reproduce on their own but will raise their mothers brood instead this is common in social hymenoptera due to haplodiploidy whereby males are haploid and females are diploid this ensures that sisters are more related to each other than they ever would be to their own offspring incentivizing them to help raise their mothers young over their own 11overall parents are selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs and parental care will be likely to evolve when the benefits exceed the costs in animals with small brains  editextensive parental investment is known in a wide range of smallbrained animals including some species of fish amphibians and insects therefore the bigger brains in mammals compared to most other animals cannot be due to a minimum parental care brain size the fact that big brains consume more nutrients than smaller brains makes this especially relevant for evolutionary theories of the brain 12 13offspring and situation direction  editparental care only requires behaviors that effectively enhances offsprings chances of survival it does not require underlying mechanisms to be potentially at a continuum with generalizable empathy appliceable to adults nor even other situations involving young than the specific reactions nor does it require the offspring to be altruistic back in any way 14 15 total ungeneralizability to adults has the evolvability advantage of not making parentally caring individuals vulnerable to being exploited by other adults sexual selection  editin many species sexual selection is closely linked to parental investment in theory a male from such a species can produce a large number of offspring over the course of his life by minimizing parental investment in favor of investing his time instead impregnating any reproductiveage female who is fertile in contrast a female from said species typically can have a much smaller number of offspring during her reproductive life partly due to an obligatory nonnil parental investment ie gestation and delivery this suggests that females will be more selective choosy of mates than males will be choosing males with good fitness eg genes high status resources etc  so as to help offset any lack of direct parental investment from the male and therefore increase reproductive success robert trivers  theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in lactation nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higherinvesting sex see batemans principle 16  in species where both sexes invest highly in parental care mutual choosiness is expected to arise an example of this is seen in crested auklets where parents share equal responsibility in incubating their single egg and raising the chick in crested auklets both sexes are ornamented 17the importance of parental investment can be seen especially in species in which the offspring are altricial ie unable to fend for themselves from earliest ages in many bird species and in modern humans this leads to males spending more time caring for their offspring than do the male parents of precocial species since reproductive success would otherwise suffer the higher parental investment in humans is the result of an extended childhood required in order to develop the unusually large human brain during this time parental investment comes in the form of feeding teaching and protection for example however if human parental investment starts from the point when the sperm fertilizes the egg then the minimal obligatory parental investment for the male is zero effort while the minimal obligatory investment for the female is nine months of pregnancy followed by delivery this difference of minimal obligatory investment between males and females suggests that the amount of investment and effort put into mating and parenting will differ in some insects male parental investment is given in the form of a nuptial gift for instance ornate moth females receive a spermatophore containing nutrients sperm and defensive toxins from the male during copulation this gift which can account for up to 10 of the males body mass constitutes the total parental investment the male provides 18trivers parental investment theory  editparental investment as defined by trivers in 1972 19 is the investment in offspring by the parent that increases the offsprings chances of surviving and hence reproductive success at the expense of the parents ability to invest in other offspring a large parental investment largely decreases the parents chances of investing in other offspring parental investment can be split into two main categories mating investment and rearing investment mating investment consist of the sexual act and the sex cells invested the rearing investment is the time and energy expended to raise the offspring after conception womens parental investment in both mating and rearing efforts greatly surpasses that of the male in terms of sex cells egg and sperms cells the females investment is a lot larger while males produce thousands of sperm cells which are supplied at a rate of twelve million per hour 20 women have a fixed supply of around 400 ova also the acts of fertilization and gestation occur in the women which compared to the males investment of just one cell outweighs it furthermore each intercourse could result in a ninemonth commitment such as gestation the act of breastfeeding for the woman from trivers theory of parental investment several implications follow the first is that women are often but not always the more investing sex the fact that they are the more investing sex has meant that evolution has favoured females who are more selective of their mates to ensure that intercourse would not result in unnecessary costs the third implication is that because women invest more and are essential for the reproductive success of their offspring they are a valuable resource for men as a result males often compete for sexual access to them females as the more investing sex  editdue to the heavy investment that women engage in after conception evolution has favoured women who are more selective of their partners therefore generally speaking women are more discriminating about their partners their mate preferences usually include males which are of good financial status and could therefore invest more resources who are more committed and would therefore dedicate more time and energy who are more athletic as they would be better at protecting and defending the female and her offspring and who are healthier again with the prospect in mind that they would ensure healthy offspring 21womens preferences for mates however vary depending on their context there are two contexts which have been identified to affect preferences the first is womens personal resources also referred to as the structural powerlessness hypothesis 22 according to this hypothesis women strive to find mates which have access to resources mainly because they themselves are excluded from them and they are usually largely controlled by men therefore women see finding a mate with a lot of resources as a channel to gain access to these resources however this hypothesis has been disproved by studies such as the one done by buss 23 which found that successful women place even greater importance on financial and societal status as well as on professional degrees another context which is known to alter female’s preferences for mates is temporal boundaries studies by buss and schmitt 24 have found that women put great emphasis on careerorientation ambition and devotion only when considering a longterm partner when marriage is not involved often females would put greater emphasis on looks 25 this could be explained through parental investment theory because when women expect to have offspring from a particular mate they employ a more demanding criteria as they know it will affect the reproductive success of their offspring however when looking at shortterm mating which would not involve longterm commitments females are less selective of course this alternation is only possible for humans with birth control technology which was not available in the past 26males as the more investing sex  editfor many species the only type of male investment received is that of sex cells in those terms the female investment greatly exceeds that of male investment as previously mentioned however there are other ways in which males invest in their offspring for example the male can find food as in the example of balloon flies 27 he may find a safe environment for the female to feed or lay her eggs as exemplified in many birds 28 29 he may also protect the young and provide them with opportunities to learn as in many young as in wolves overall the main role that males overtake is that of protection of the female and their young that often can decrease the discrepancy of investment caused by the initial investment of sex cells and indeed there are some species such as the mormon cricket pipefish seahorse and panamanian poison arrow frog males invest more what is interesting is that among the species where the male invests more the male is also the pickier sex placing higher demands on their selected female for example the female that they often choose usually contain 60 more eggs than rejected females 30 this links parental investment theory pit with sexual selection where parental investment is bigger for a male than a female its usually the female who competes for a mate as shown by phalaropidae and polyandrous bird species in these species females are usually more aggressive brightly coloured and larger than males 31 suggesting the more investing sex has more choice while selecting a mate compared to the sex engaged in intrasexual selection females as a valuable resource for males  editthe second prediction that follows from trivers theory is that the fact that women invest more heavily in offspring makes them a valuable resource for males as it ensures the survival of their offspring which is the driving force of natural selection therefore the sex that invests less in offspring will compete among themselves to breed with the more heavily investing sex in other words males will compete for females it has been argued that jealousy has developed to avert the risk of potential loss of parental investment in offspring 20 if a male redirects his resources to another female it is a costly loss of time energy and resources for her offspring however the risks for males are higher because although women invest more in their offspring they have bigger maternity certainty because they themselves have carried out the child however males can never have 100 paternal certainty and therefore risk investing resources and time in offspring that is genetically unrelated evolutionary psychology views jealousy as an adaptive response to this problem very often parentoffspring conflict can find its roots in parental investment because parents are equally related to all offspring they try to distribute their investment equally and proportionally however because the offspring is more related to themselves than they are to their siblings they often require a lot more care than the parent is able to provide according to trivers this discrepancy in investment optima occurs because the parent is selected to invest in the offspring up until the point in which the cost of investing more in the current offspring and hence leading to less future reproductive success is larger than the benefit of increased survival of the current offspring conflict arises if the parent continues to invest in the offspring even to the critical point where the cost begins to outweigh the benefits 32sociosexuality  editfrom an evolutionary perspective the sexual strategy and parental investment of male and female differ considerably and females usually invest more in parental care due to a timeconsuming period of pregnancy and childbirth while male are not restricted by the sperm production but by access to more sexual partners 19 33 there is a tradeoff between mating effort and parenting effort and males are generally more willing to have more sexual partners compared to females as reproduction of more offspring instead of using the time and resource to invest in existing offspring would be a tradeoff 34 therefore the amount and duration of investment necessary to ensure the survival of offspring was unequal between the two sexes with females investing more 35on the other hand trivers has proposed that females prefer to mate with males who display both an ability and willingness to invest resources for the survival of the female and her offspring thus the costs of female parental care and investment could be balanced by benefits in terms of more paternal investment in resources for offspring 36 this would mean that females who expect paternal investment in resources such as territory will be more conservative and careful towards having sexual intercourse with males regardless of how attractive the potential male is 37sociosexual orientation refers to individual differences in willingness to engage in sexual relations without love or intimacy unrestricted sexuality refers to a kind of sexual strategy people adopt when they engage in more than one concurrent sexual relationship and have had sex with multiple partners usually without commitment such as onenightstands individuals with a restricted sexuality would often have closeness and commitment before engaging in a sexual relationship 38 39 using sociosexual orientation inventory soi study has demonstrated that females who expect heavy paternal investment will try to emphasise fidelity and chastity thus scoring lower on the soi and demonstrating a more restricted sexuality females who have an unrestricted sexuality will not expect a big investment and will show they are open to sexual intercourse by emphasising sexual attractiveness 39 40the effect of father absence  editparental investment is any effort that increases quality of offspring this could be things such as spending of time energy and resources to help offspring to survive traditionally females have greater parental effort while males have greater mating effort and males often compete for the access to females and their investment in order to pass on their genes in human parental investment males are more uncertain compared to females when investing in offspring as they dont know if the offspring belongs to them so called paternity uncertainty lack of paternal investment due to father absence constituted a unique and independent path to early sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy for females 41 many studies have identified the absence of father as a major risk factor for both early sexual activity 42 and teenage pregnancy 43 in the study females that had no father absent since the age of 0 to 5 are more likely to engage in sexual activities earlier than females who had no father absent from 6 to 13 41 44another study looked at psychological social stress in the developmental environment the age of first menarche and the age of giving first birth to offspring the data suggests that the family environment with father absence makes the family support more uncertain which might trigger higher stress resulting in early menarche as menarche is the sign of puberty females are more likely to engage in sexual activities earlier because of the facilitation of early menarche unrestricted female sexuality could also be explained by females who lack paternal input would seek outside for social support due to uncertain future and uncertain availability of males 45research indicates that lack of paternal investment also impacts on male development 46 higher mortality higher impulsivity higher rapeprone activities and sexual coercion is associated with father absence compared to males who grew up in fatherpresence environment 47 48 these findings are consistent with lifecourse adversity models of early sexual activity and teenage pregnancy which stated that the stress within the family environment over lifetime provokes the earlier onset of sexual activity and reproduction 49 50application of trivers theory in real life  edittrivers theory has been very influential as the predictions it makes correspond to differences in sexual behaviours of men and women as demonstrated by a variety of research crosscultural study from buss 1989 51 shows that males are tuned into physical attractiveness as it signals youth and fertility and ensures male reproductive success which is increased by copulating with as many fertile females as possible women on the other hand are tuned into resources provided by potential mates as their reproductive success is increased by ensuring their offspring will survive and one way they do so is by getting resources for them alternatively another study shows that men are more promiscuous than women giving further support to this theory clark and hatfield 52 found that 75 of men were willing to have sex with a female stranger when propositioned compared to 0 of women on the other hand 50 of women agreed to a date with a male stranger this suggests males seek short term relationships while women show a strong preference for longterm relationships however these preferences male promiscuity and female choosiness can be explained in other ways in western cultures male promiscuity is encouraged through the availability of pornographic magazines and videos targeted to the male audience alternatively both western and eastern cultures discourage female promiscuity through social checks such as slutshaming 53pit parental investment theory also explains patterns of sexual jealousy 20 he found males are more likely to show a stress response when imagining their partners showing sexual infidelity having sexual relations with someone else and women showed more stress when imagining their partner being emotionally unfaithful being in love with another woman pit explains this as womans sexual infidelity decreases the males paternal certainty thus he will show more stress due to fear of cuckoldry on the other hand the woman fears losing the resources her partner provides if her partner has an emotional attachment to another female its likely that he wont invest into their offspring as much thus a greater stress response is shown in this circumstance a heavy criticism of the theory comes from thornhill and palmers analysis of it in a natural history of rape biological bases of sexual coercion 54 as it seems to rationalise rape and sexual coercion of females thornhill and palmer claimed rape is an evolved technique for obtaining mates in an environment where women choose mates as pit claims males seek to copulate with as many fertile females as possible the choice women have could result in a negative effect on the males reproductive success if women didnt choose their mates thornhill and palmer claim there would be no rape this ignores a variety of sociocultural factors such as the fact that not only fertile females are raped – 34 of underage rape victims are under 12 55 which means they are not of fertile age thus there is no evolutionary advantage in raping them 14 of rapes in england are committed on males 56 who cannot increase a mans reproductive success as there will be no conception thus what thornhill and palmer called an evolved machinery might not be very advantageous versus sexual strategies  edittrivers theory overlooks that women do have shortterm relationships such as onenight stands while not all men behave promiscuously an alternative explanation to pit parental investment theory and mate preferences would be buss and schmitts sexual strategies theory 34 sst argues that both sexes pursue shortterm and longterm relationships but seek different qualities in their short and longterm partners for a shortterm relationship women will prefer an attractive partner but in a longterm relationship they might be willing to tradeoff that attractiveness for resources and commitment on the other hand men might be accepting of a sexually willing partner in a shortterm relationships but to ensure their paternal certainty they will seek a faithful partner instead international politics  editparental investment is not only used to explain evolutionary phenomena and human behavior but describes recurrences in international politics as well specifically parental investment is referred to when describing competitive behaviors between states and determining aggressive nature of foreign policies the parental investment hypothesis states that the size of coalitions and the physical strengths of its male members determines whether its activities with its foreign neighbors are aggressive or amiable 57 according to triver men have had relatively low parental investments and were therefore forced into fiercer competitive situations over limited reproductive resources sexual selection naturally took place and men have evolved to address its unique reproductive problems among other adaptations mens psychology has also developed to directly aid men in such intrasexual competition 57one essential psychological developments involved decisionmaking of whether to take flight or actively engage in warfare with another rivalry group the two main factors that men referred to in such situations were 1 whether the coalition they are a part of is larger than its opposition and 2 whether the men in their coalition have greater physical strength than the other the male psychology conveyed in the ancient past has been passed on to modern times causing men to partly think and behave as they have during ancestral wars according to this theory leaders of international politics were not an exception for example the united states expected to win the vietnam war due to its greater military capacity when compared to its enemies yet victory according to the traditional rule of greater coalition size did not come about because the u s did not take enough consideration to other factors such as the perseverance of the local population 57the parental investment hypothesis contends that male physical strength of a coalition still determines the aggressiveness of modern conflicts between states while this idea may seem unreasonable upon considering that male physical strength is one of the least determining aspects of todays warfare human psychology has nevertheless evolved to operate on this basis moreover although it may seem that mate seeking motivation is no longer a determinant in modern wars sexuality such as rape is undeniably evident in conflicts even to this day 57see also  editwikimedia commons
