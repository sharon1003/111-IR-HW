users permission to install the software on an unlimited number of systems this gives it the edge over other tools with the threelicense industry standard slim cleaners attractive interface features a pleasant color scheme that deftly balances blacks and grays with a bright blue gradient clicking one of the categories located in the column located left of the main content area—cleaner optimize software browsers disk tools windows tools and hijack log—highlights the selection and displays that individual interface to the right slim cleaner also displays your pcs operating system cpu and gpu information just south of that a gripe i dont like that slim cleaner sometimes opens secondary windows when you click an option for example clicking disk tools opens another window that lets you run disk utilities—i dont dig that i prefer a tighter interface that keeps everything in one place cleaner optimizer social features the cleaner area—the section that contains tabs for windows applications browsers advanced and registry—is what youll encounter upon firing up the application clicking the analyze button causes slim cleaner to run and spit back a list of problems—my initial scan uncovered dozens upon dozens on my test computer the clean button removed all the problem files and web cookies but i preserved the login cookies of facebook and other sites i frequent using the intelli cookie filter thats a great touch thats far from the only tool at your disposal optimize lets you alter which programs boot at launch—handy for those who may not realize that resource hogs are slowing the boot process and hindering the overall system performance here you can find detailed file information so you know exactly what it does before taking action sort software based on user feedback using an adjustable colorcoded slider and rate programs yourself using dropdown menu selections and minireviews—all very useful i especially like that slim cleaner gives you a warning if you are about to remove software thats been wellreceived by the community its a nice way to safeguard yourself from removing a file that may prove vital to the computing experience unfortunately because the feature is communitybased your pc has to be connected to the web to get the crowdsourced software ratings taking a cue from popular social networking sites like facebook slim cleaner gives users a wall to display personal information and view badges awards that are given for users with helpful useful reviews in order to have badges saved to your wall you need to create an account from scratch or log in with your facebook account personally i could do without the badges but i suppose theyre carrots that will entice some users to contribute ratings which improves everyones experience slim ware utilities slim cleaner free review sharei error 4 media source is incompatible with player or browser041uninstaller browsers shredder hijack log running un installer causes slim cleaner to scan your computer and display the total number of software installs i began scrolling through the long list of software uninstalling unwanted applications such as black berry device manager yahoo toolbar and a number of others i dont like that you cant select multiple applications at once you have to uninstall applications one at a time which quickly became a chore when i visited the browsers section slim cleaner highlighted the internet explorer icon—the installed browser—but it also listed chrome firefox opera and safari although they were grayed out clicking the icon brought up an impressive amount of information on that particular browser including the default homepage and the toolbars extensions and plugins that were installed it amazed me that i had so many junk installs and that i had become blind to them in my daily use once cleaned internet explorer opened far swifter than it had in months i could also select a new search engine for the browser which was an unexpected extra the shredder lets you delete files or entire folders by overwriting them with data there are different shredding levels each with an increasing security level—quick one overwrite safe three overwrites thorough seven overwrites and guttman a whopping 35 overwrites once a file has been overwritten it cant be recovered so use this feature carefully high jack log lists all of the programs and plugins that are vulnerable to thirdparty attacks that can take over the system windows tools organizes system tools device manager system information and more in one easily navigated interface another aspect of slim cleaner that i liked a lot—theres a revert optimizations button on each screen which lets you roll back the settings should you have need for it you can schedule tuneups to run on a daily or weekly basis and you can make a portable version of the software by taking a trip to settings slim cleaner other features include intelligent defrag lets users to run a personalized defrag based on their specific pc hardware software updater lets users check for updates to the software on their pc and install those updates directly from slim cleaner solidstate drive optimization lets users optimize the layout of files on their solidstate drives to speedup loading programs and opening documents and duplicate finder gives users with a quick way to find and eliminate unnecessary duplicate files that can clutter and slow down a hard drive eliminating duplicate files proved a bit tedious as i couldnt do a mass elimination—i had to delete them one by one performance improvements i tested slim cleaners ability to whip a pc back into shape by performing two tests—running the geekbench system performance tool and measuring boot times—before and after running the software to compare the testbeds potency each test was run three times and averaged before slim cleaner scrubbed the system the 2ghz intel core i7 920xm stylenote notebook with 4gb of ram and an 80gb intel ssd drive achieved a 5914 geekbench score and booted in 503 seconds after using slim cleaner the system saw improved performance the geek bench score rose to 6338 which was short of iolo system mechanic 14s 6369 score  and the boot time decreased to 411 seconds a bit behind iolo system mechanics 397 seconds mark  those numbers wouldnt mean much if it didnt translate into usernoticeable improvements—fortunately it
