tim hortons takes on the world how going global could change the soul of canadas coffee chain with no shortage of global chains offering coffee and sweet treats around the world how can burger king worldwide hope to export a brand thats as distinctively canadian as tim hortons claire brownell august 30 2014 715 am edtfiled under news retail  marketing comment facebook twitter reddit email more tim hortons inc conjures no warm and fuzzy childhood memories or feelings of patriotic pride for azam shibli a 36yearold professional based in abu dhabi“it’s hard to distinguish between tim hortons and starbucks and dunkin’ donuts” mr shibli said making a comment that would probably come close to blasphemy were he to utter it in canada “i feel like it’s maybe slightly cheaper and slightly worse” npstorybar title”burger king will turn tim hortons into ‘iconic global brand’ miles nadal says” link” httpbusinessfinancialpostcom20140830burgerkingwillturntimhortonsintoiconicglobalbrandmilesnadalsays”5d burger king’s 125billion acquisition of tim hortons has raised fears among the chain’s devotees that the change in ownership will somehow alter the timmy’s experience npstorybarand yet since the canadian coffee and doughnut chain started opening locations in his city three years ago mr shibli tends to find himself at the order counter if there’s nothing particularly memorable about it there’s nothing wrong with it either — plus there’s a tims at a convenient point where mr shibli stops when he makes the drive between abu dhabi and dubai and he said “those little timbits are always kind of nice”if shareholders and regulators approve the us125billion deal announced this week burger king worldwide inc plans to buy tim hortons and use its existing international connections to take the beloved canuck brand global the chain is well known for its success in corporatizing canadian nostalgia linking its brand more directly with winter mornings and kids’ hockey games than any other that’s its magic its food products are decent enough but no one exactly raves about them but such things are scarcely exportable and outside canada tim hortons will be starting from scratch with customers like mr shibli with no shortage of global chains offering coffee sweet treats or a quick meal in cities around the world tims will have to figure out how to build a brand without the help of sentimentality eighty percent of tim hortons’ 4500 locations are here in canada about 1 are in the middle east the other 19 are in the u s where the company’s track record has been at best spotty actually tim hortons’ u s expansion is sometimes dismissed as an outright flop the chain has closed underperforming stores and last year two hedge funds with stakes in tim hortons suggested it pull up its american stakes entirely according to the market research firm technomic inc tim hortons’ 860 u s restaurants were responsible for just a small fraction of sales in what the firm calls the “coffeecafé” segment stores in that category pulled in us22billion last year starbucks corp and dunkin’ donuts dominate the sector holding about 85 of the u s market share between them tim hortons’ market share is a paltry 27 and yet something often overlooked is that in a market so otherwise fragmented even that seemingly small share ranks tims as the thirdbiggest coffee chain in america and americans seem only to want more coffee says darren tristano executive vice president of technomic their demand for takeout brew seems to be insatiable in major cities every street corner seems to have been taken by one coffee retailer or another yet the big players’ sales continue to grow at rates in the high single digits“what looks like a very mature segment still has room for growth” mr tristano said just a few years after entering the u s tim hortons has already beat out chains like caribou coffee co inc that had been around for a lot longer mr tristano said he thinks it could do even better by appealing to the growing demographic of hispanic customers and lower to middleincome groups as if playing to stereotypical canadian type tim hortons’ international expansion to date has been quiet polite and boring there’s been little social media buzz and no overnight lineups like those seen at new locations of buffalo wild wings inc or the cheesecake factory inc tim hortons’ u s advertisements have been similarly bland playing up the freshness of the coffee and food that stands in stark contrast to its heartstringtugging “true stories” advertisements in canada in which canadian backpackers soldiers and immigrants bond over their love of doubledoubles rohit deshpande a marketing professor at harvard business school who has studied countryoforigin branding said marketing a brand’s national roots is a good way to appeal to even foreign consumers looking for authenticity — think italian sports cars or swiss watches there may be nothing particularly canadian about doughnuts and coffee and canada doesn’t exactly have cosmopolitan appeal but canada goose and to some degree roots clothing before it is a rare example of a brand that has found a global market by playing up its canadian roots — knowing how to beat the cold with a parka is as authentically canadian as it gets and like those geese there really is or was a tim horton“there isn’t a burger king but there is a tim horton he’s the original leaf he’s tim doughnut” mr deshpande said if tims can repackage what sells at home as sentimentality and sell it as authenticity abroad it may be the edge it needs to succeed where other canadian coffee chains have faltered in attempting global reach the second cup ltd which has locations in the middle east pakistan the u s and elsewhere has been cutting costs and reorganizing management to reverse falling profits timothy’s coffees of the world inc has closed its u s retail locations but continues to sell singleserve coffee pods there after selling its wholesale operations to vermontbased green mountain coffee roasters inc in 2009 npstorybar title”tim hortons holds the ‘real power’ in burger king deal” link” httpbusinessfinancialpostcom20140825timhortonsburgerkingtakeover”5d tim hortons inc is about to take the driver’s seat not sell out to the americans in a potential takeover by burger king worldwide inc industry expert tom pirko says npstorybarthat doesn’t mean that tim hortons shareholders aren’t still waiting for answers about the finer details of the new combined burger kingtim hortons plan for world coffee and doughnut domination charles nadim a canadian equity manager with tim hortons’ thirdlargest shareholder jarislowsky fraser ltd said he’s confident burger king ceo daniel schwartz and brazil’s 3g capital inc the burger chain’s controlling shareholder can deliver on the promise of taking tims global fast but he’s less confident about what that means for shareholders in the medium and long term the brazilian private equity firm has made a name for itself as a forceful streamliner both at h j heinz co which it bought last year in partnership with warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway there are stories of office supply allowances at heinz headquarters and bans on colour copying and at burger king mr schwartz has uprooted the chain model at burger king rapidly converting stores to franchises offloading the local risk and raking in fees instead the result burger king has held on to profitability despite years of falling revenue“are they going to replicate the burger king model in the midterm to tim hortons which would mean for example selling all the land selling all the distribution assets the roasting facilities and outsourcing” mr nadim said “if you start baking in those kinds of cost cut potentials then this near term multiple becomes less interesting on a midterm basis”tims has already begun a campaign to soothe canadians who may be anxious about the change in ownership taking out doublepage ads in some newspapers promising that everything will stay exactly the way we have come to expect at our local stores but brand consultant tony chapman said anyone who believes nothing will change is in for a nasty surprise those canadian fans who have been fretting about tim hortons’ new americanbrazilian owners globalizing the chain at the expense of local franchise quality they might be onto something canada may be an important market for tims but the entire rest of the planet offers an awful lot more growth in canada we’re used to protecting our culture from the american global cultural juggernaut but if tim horton is going to share the world stage with ronald mc donald it’s hard not to see how sacrificing a few local processes and tastes wouldn’t be worth the opportunity to create a global profit machine after all nobody in abu dhabi remembers the days when bakers made doughnuts fresh on the premises and they’re unlikely to protest outsourced roasting if it makes the coffee a little cheaper“consumers have got to wake up” mr chapman said “you don’t put this kind of money in and not make massive changes to the organization”photo illustration by national post graphics editor’s note this story has been updated since it was originally published to include a longer version of the
