symptom of dysmenorrhea is pain concentrated in the lower abdomen or pelvis 1 it is also commonly felt in the right or left side of the abdomen it may radiate to the thighs and lower back 1symptoms often cooccurring with menstrual pain include nausea and vomiting diarrhea or constipation headache dizziness disorientation hypersensitivity to sound light smell and touch fainting and fatigue symptoms of dysmenorrhea often begin immediately after ovulation and can last until the end of menstruation this is because dysmenorrhea is often associated with changes in hormonal levels in the body that occur with ovulation the use of certain types of birth control pills can prevent the symptoms of dysmenorrhea because they stop ovulation from occurring causes  editdysmenorrhea can be classified as either primary or secondary based on the absence or presence of an underlying cause secondary dysmenorrhea is dysmenorrhea which is associated with an existing condition the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea is endometriosis which can be visually confirmed by laparoscopy in approximately 70 of adolescents with dysmenorrhea 4other causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include leiomyoma 5 adenomyosis 6 ovarian cysts and pelvic congestion 7unequal leg length might hypothetically be one of the contributors as it may contribute to a tilted pelvis which may cause lower back pain 8 which in turn may be mistaken for menstrual pain as women with lower back pain experience increased pain during their periods other skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis sometimes caused by spina bifida might be possible contributors as well mechanism  editduring a womans menstrual cycle the endometrium thickens in preparation for potential pregnancy after ovulation if the ovum is not fertilized and there is no pregnancy the builtup uterine tissue is not needed and thus shed molecular compounds called prostaglandins are released during menstruation due to the destruction of the endometrial cells and the resultant release of their contents 9 release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus cause the uterus to contract these substances are thought to be a major factor in primary dysmenorrhea 10 when the uterine muscles contract they constrict the blood supply to the tissue of the endometrium which in turn breaks down and dies these uterine contractions continue as they squeeze the old dead endometrial tissue through the cervix and out of the body through the vagina these contractions and the resulting temporary oxygen deprivation to nearby tissues are responsible for the pain or cramps experienced during menstruation compared with other women women with primary dysmenorrhea have increased activity of the uterine muscle with increased contractility and increased frequency of contractions 11in one research study using mri visible features of the uterus were compared in dysmenorrheic and eumenorrheic normal participants the study concluded that in dysmenorrheic patients visible features on cycle days 13 correlated with the degree of pain and differed significantly from the control group 12diagnosis  editthe diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is usually made simply on a medical history of menstrual pain that interferes with daily activities however there is no universally accepted gold standard technique for quantifying the severity of menstrual pains 13 yet there are quantification models called menstrual symptometrics that can be used to estimate the severity of menstrual pains as well as correlate them with pain in other parts of the body menstrual bleeding and degree of interference with daily activities 13further workup  editonce a diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is made further workup is required to search for any secondary underlying cause of it in order to be able to treat it specifically and to avoid the aggravation of a perhaps serious underlying cause further workup includes a specific medical history of symptoms and menstrual cycles and a pelvic exam 2 based on results from these additional exams and tests may be motivated such as laboratory tests 2gynecologic ultrasonography 2laparoscopy may be required 2management  editnsaids  editnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids are effective in relieving the pain of primary dysmenorrhea 14 they can have side effects of nausea dyspepsia peptic ulcer and diarrhea 15 14 people who are unable to take the more common nsaids may be prescribed a cox2 inhibitor 16hormonal birth control  edituse of hormonal birth control may improve symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea 17 18 a 2009 systematic review however found limited evidence that the birth control pill containing low doses or medium doses of oestrogen reduces pain associated with dysmenorrhea 19 in addition no differences between different birth control pill preparations were found 19norplant 20 and depoprovera 21 22 are also effective since these methods often induce amenorrhea the intrauterine system mirena iud may be useful in reducing symptoms 23other  edita review indicated the effectiveness of transdermal nitroglycerin 24alternative medicine  editthere is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any herbal or dietary supplements for treating dysmenorrhea including melatonin vitamin e fennel dill chamomile cinnamon damask rose rhubarb guava and uzara 1 25 further research is recommended to follow up on weak evidence of benefit for fenugreek ginger valerian zataria zinc sulphate fish oil and vitamin b1 a 2016 review found that evidence of safety is insufficient for all dietary supplements 25there is some conflicting evidence in the scientific literature including one review found thiamine and vitamin e to be likely effective 26 it found the effects of fish oil and vitamin b12 to be unknown 26reviews found tentative evidence that ginger powder may be effective for primary dysmenorrhea 27another review found vitamin b1 to be effective  citation needed magnesium supplementation are a promising possible treatment  citation neededreviews have found promising evidence for chinese herbal medicine for primary dysmenorrhea but that the evidence was limited by its poor methodological quality 28 29procedures  editacupuncture a 2016 cochrane review found that the randomized controlled trials rcts of acupuncture treatments for dysmenorrhea are of low quality and concluded that it is unknown if acupuncture or acupressure is effective for treating symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea 30 there are also concerns of bias in study design and in publication insufficient reporting few looked at adverse effects  and that they were inconsistent 30 there are conflicting reports in the literature including one review which found that acupressure topical heat transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and behavioral interventions are likely effective 26 it found the effect of acupuncture and magnets to be unknown 26a 2007 systematic review found some scientific evidence that behavioral interventions may be effective but that the results should be viewed with caution due to poor quality of the data 31spinal manipulation does not appear to be helpful 26 although claims have been made for chiropractic care under the theory that treating subluxations in the spine may decrease symptoms 32 a 2006 systematic review found that overall no evidence suggests that spinal manipulation is effective for treatment of primary and secondary dysmenorrhea 33epidemiology  editdysmenorrhea is estimated to affect approximately 25 of women 34 reports of dysmenorrhea are greatest among individuals in their late teens and 20s with reports usually declining with age the prevalence in adolescent females has been reported to be 672 by one study 35 and 90 by another 34 it has been stated that there is no significant difference in prevalence or incidence between races 34 yet a study of hispanic adolescent females indicated a high prevalence and impact in this group 36 another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 364 of participants and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity 37 childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea but this does not always occur one study indicated that in nulliparous women with primary dysmenorrhea the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40 38 a questionnaire concluded that menstrual problems including dysmenorrhea were more common in females who had been sexually abused 39a survey in norway showed that 14 percent of females between the ages of 20 to 35 experience symptoms so severe that they stay home from school or work 40 among adolescent girls dysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent shortterm school absence 41references  edit a
