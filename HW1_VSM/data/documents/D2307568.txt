hiking donnelly dome grants tremendous views of interior tim mowry  tmowrynewsminercom sep 2 2010  …hikers take in the view from the top of 3910foot donnelly dome south of delta junction the top of the dome offers spectacular views of the alaska range and donnelly flats tim mowrynewsminer kristan kelly pauses to enjoy the view on her way up donnelly dome on aug 22 the 3910foot dome makes a perfect day hike though the trail is very steep in places tim mowrynewsminer liam putman left and logan mowry are silhouetted against a blue sky as they sit on rocks on the way down donnelly dome on aug 22 kristen kelly fairbanks — to most people donnelly dome is a giant wart they drive by on the way to valdez or chitina the 3910foot dome sticks out like a sore thumb as you drive down the richardson highway about 20 miles south of delta junction an ant hill shadowed by the distant alaska range but climbing donnelly dome is an annual tradition in our family and i’m glad to report we made it to the top once again this year granted getting to the top of donnelly dome isn’t the same as reaching the summit of denali but it’s still an accomplishment to be proud of and the panoramic view of the alaska range will take your breath away if the climb up doesn’t if you’ve never climbed donnelly dome it’s worth the drive and effort it takes to get there especially at this time of year when the fall colors begin to paint the landscape red and yellow we drove down to delta two weekends ago for our annual pilgrimmage up the dome while the weather was beautiful when we left fairbanks it didn’t necessarily look that way when we pulled off the richardson highway at 248 mile and drove 2 12 miles up a dirt military and pipeline access road that leads to a trail at the base of the dome there were menacing black rain clouds hovering over the mountains to the south and east making us wonder if we had picked the wrong day to climb the dome we needn’t have worried it turned out to be a beautiful day for a climb up the dome it wasn’t too hot or too cold there was just enough wind to keep any bugs at bay but not so much that you got blown off your feet there are essentially two ways up donnelly dome you can drive up the same road we did to access a trail that climbs up north side of the dome or you can pull off the richardson highway and hike straight up the face of the dome either way you go it’s going to be steep in the steepest sections you’ll be forced to scramble up on all fours the trail that we followed on the north side of dome took us through alders for the first half of the climb which we used to pull ourselves up particularly steep sections once we got above treeline we followed the ridge line climbing over and through rock formations that required careful attention so as not to slip and fall having hiked up the trail on the north side of the dome and the trail leading up the face of the dome i prefer going up the face it’s a little steeper in some spots but you don’t have the alders to contend with and the views are better in that you don’t find yourself staring down at the transalaska pipeline every time you turn around it took our group of three adults three children and two dogs about an hour and a half to reach the top of the dome stopping occasionally to catch our breath sip some water enjoy the views and bribe the younger hikers with starburst that i had stashed in my fanny pack not that the kids needed much bribing my 11yearold son logan and his 12yearold buddy liam scrambled over the boulders and up the ridge like a pair of billie goats silhouetted against the sky on the ridge line they reached the top long before the rest of us did we saw a pair of sharpshinned hawks flying around above treeline and watched them chasing after a pair of hooligan magpies that insisted on pestering them we reached the top of the dome to find two other couples enjoying the views it was relatively calm on top unlike most times i’ve been there we took some pictures next to a rock cairn that someone has constructed and that logan and liam added to kristan and ann each celebrated with a beer as we drank up the panoramic views the pipeline snaked across the countryside on the north and west side of the dome for miles a shiny ribbon of silver on a green landscape dotted with small shimmering ponds on the east side of the dome the richardson highway stretched north and south vehicles traveling the road looked like matchbox cars though clouds obscured much of the alaska range to the west the outline of the mountains could be seen as they rose up into the sky the view was clearer to the east where the craggy granite mountains loomed in the distance there’s something about standing on top of a mountain in alaska even if it’s an ant hill like donnelly dome that makes you appreciate living here and makes you realize just how big this place really is we split up on the way down i took the dogs and headed down the trail we came up while everyone else opted to zigzag their way down the face of the dome which i was told proved to be an exercise in bushwhacking at times to avoid particularly steep parts of the trail the toughest part for me was making my way down the steep trail through the alders which i grabbed from time to time to help slow my descent it took me about a half hour to reach the bottom and another 15 minutes to reach the car and drive down the road to meet the rest of the group who were still making their way down the mountain as always we stopped at the buffalo center drivein for cheeseburgers and milkshakes on our way back through delta a just reward for reaching the top of the dome we also made a side trip to frank borman’s digyourown potato farm and had enough energy left to unearth more than 600 pounds of potatoes between three families it was one of those perfect alaska days that don’t come around often enough contact outdoors editor tim mowry at 4597587 most popular articles burst
