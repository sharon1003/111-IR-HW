following letter miriam mimi felt describes the gravity of the first ceremony for tomb of the unknown soldier in arlington national cemetery in november 1921 at that time mimi was 23yearsold and worked in the water sanitation division of the u s health service in washington dcsunday nov 13 1921dear familywell this last week has been quite an event in history and i certainly do wish you all could have been in washington it certainly is something i shall never forget somehow you can talk about it and think about it but the realization of the whole thing struck me so much more by seeing it all and it was so impressive of course washington is alive with foreigners of all sorts and i am turning around all the time to see something else for fear i will miss something the crowds have been simply enormous and i feel considerably thinner from having wedged my way through but leave it to clara we are always on the front line thursday night after work gertie and i went up to the capitol to see the body in state there we went up about six oclock  thinking the crowd would not be so large but at that time the line four abreast extended over two blocks and by the time we had reached the capitol steps and could look back at the crowd it extended up one side of the park down another side then the third side of it and on beyond around the capitol building where we could see no farther so i dont know how much longer it was it was perfectly beautifully managed and there was no crowding and everyone strangely enough acted as though they really were there to pay respect to the memory which that body was to represent to the country and not there to see out of curiosity there were guards of course all up the line and then a special guard of honor around the catafalque the flowers were simply magnificent each state and then different organizations sent wreaths or flowers made up in some beautiful piece president hardings wreath of red roses was on the bier and also a white ribbon was draped over it which mrs harding had made it was most impressive all told friday bright and early we arose and went down on pennsylvania avenue to see the funeral procession of course we had hysterics over clara trying to wedge us in amidst the crowd ill have to leave the details of that to tell something on the order of inauguration however it was sort of a fitting setting all around for it because you remember i told you the day the olympia arrived with the body it was very rainy and dark and in my mind sort of typified the thing itself then friday when the procession started it was as though it were in the gray dawn for the sun didnt really break through until it was about all passed and that went with that part of it too to me there were represented in the procession about every branch of service and all the organizations etc president harding and the cabinet and the senate all walked and we had a chance to see them all very clearly only i missed finding taft until he was passed i am going to have to see him soon somehow it seems that because i am specially anxious to see him i always miss himdid you know that this was the first time in history that three presidents were seen in the same procession wilson had to ride of course he looked quite well and people that have seen him recently seem to think he is much improved i couldnt quite understand however why mrs wilson had to ride by his side for she was the only lady of that sort in it the president and cabinet etc dropped out at the white house and rode up to arlington the rest marched on we didnt attempt to go there because there was no chance of seeing anything and we figured we could read the speech we had seen the cemetery on wednesday and knew about what would take place im glad we didnt attempt it for most people were about five hours in all getting up and back then that night was the illumination of the jeweled arch it was wonderful when the lights first started to come on you could see the different lines of the search lights gradually cross each other and then finally shine out in the most beautiful colors you have ever seen they fired twentyone minute guns and the lights were seen through the smoke i just cant describe to you the effect of it all i declare the arch was something that you cannot conceive of man making somehow it seemed almost superhuman the pillars on either side of the street were made into monument effects the tops from about half way up being covered with sequents of some sort this all was on a larger base and around them on each base was a large eagle and incense bowls all around too burning in the center of the arch was a large circle composed of smaller circles and within each of these the picture of the various flags then hanging from the pillars was a straight band of varicolored glass i guess it must have been which positively sparkled with more beautiful colors than i have ever seen they threw different colored search lights on it from all sides and that wasnt all — the washington monument was lighted so that it looked as though there were streamers of white light from the top to the bottom and two search lights from the top crossed and were sent out over the city also lights were thrown from the capitol building so far away which were visible too all along the street in front of the pan american building where the conference will be held for the most part there were erected tall poles with eagles on the top and colored lighted box effects built about them of the different shields that is flag productions of the shields it made the whole street lighter than day of course and with all the various colors it certainly was a vision to behold course you will see it in the movies and maybe not recognize my description of it all but its the best i can do and i thought perhaps mother and dad at least would like to hear my own description of ityours daughter sister and sweetheart m as a postscript ms felt wrotegive my love to grandpa sorry he isnt feeling up to par tell him to be a good boy tell him too that some of his old cronies marched to arlington friday and they looked mighty fine ill tell you  and i thought a lot about what he did for his country the veterans day national committee thanks ms barbara felt the authors niece for sharing this letter to relatives written by
