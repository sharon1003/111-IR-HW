frustrations with my paralyzed diaphragm after not being able to sleep too well for the past 4 months because of an elevated  paralyzed diaphragm and lying awake again this morning since 430 am i have finally decided to put some information out there to see if i get some answers let me first say that i am not out to damage the practice of anesthesiology lord knows we couldnt  wouldnt want to have certain procedures without being put to sleep or at least in lala land therefore i appreciate the profession greatly i also want to put information out there so people can make an informed decision once they hear what happened to me so here is my story i started having shoulder problems approx 11 years ago when i couldnt get a gallon of milk out of the fridge without holding my arm close to my side i knew something was wrong i had my first shoulder surgery approx 10 years ago it was a labrym tear after surgery therapy and a few months i was able to throw a football again shoot basketball etc without much pain fast forward to 2009 after more issues with my shoulder for the past year i was diagnosed with a tear in my rotator cuff and bone spurs i decided to have the surgery again on august 27th of 2009 no biggie i thought the one thing that stands out with this surgery is that i was told i would be receiving a block this was for the pain for basically the first 24 hours after surgery then it would wear off once again no big dealand i must say it was nice not being able to feel my shoulder those first 24 hours let me add that i didnt have a block my first surgery between 46 days after the surgery i started realizing i was having some breathing issues especially when i would lay back in the recliner my chest would get really tight i went to my local dr and they did a chest xray and said i had some fluid in my lungs from the surgery something about when they pulled the tube out some fluid got in my lungs  they had a term for it but i cant remember it my dr gave me a strong antibiotic and when i got home i took one of the pills about an hour or two later i took my dog for a walk well my chest got so tight from the time i got back from the 10 minute walk that when i came back in the house i lost it i started crying and told my wife kelly that i thought i was having a heart attack she called my dr and i went to see him immediately they did the tests they could do there and everything came back ok to be safe because of my family history and my past cholesterol levels i was sent to saint vincents here in birmingham for a battery of heart tests once again everything came back fine but im still feeling weird in my chest so i have these questions in my head as to what is going on fast forward a week still having these breathing issues and constantly keeping my hand on my chest  upper abdomen wanting to push massage just anything to try to relieve the pressure well i had been out with some friends and ate dinner one of the first bigger meals i had had since the surgery that night as i was trying to sleep on the recliner i was absolutely miserable chest was so tight couldnt breathe i was scared crying confessing getting things right god and i had one of our many conversations now i am not one to run to the emergency room you have to be somewhat on your deathbed to even want to go there especially at midnight knowing the waiting that lies ahead but even though i had been put through the mill the last time i was there i was so uncomfortable and my chest was so tight and i was so scaredthat i told kelly i am going to the emergency room after 2 chest xrays and another test or two once again they determined it was fluid and i needed a spirometer to help me breathe and get that fluid out of my lungs  i did wonder why i hadnt been given this gadget before all this but im not a dr and a pet peeve of mine is when people want to question drs as if theyve been to medical school themselves i know at times questions need to be asked and gut feelings need to be listened to and drs arent perfect but i guess i get this from my pharmacist dad and his experiences dealing with certain people  this is one reason why i want to be so careful as to how i come across writing this blog a few days later after taking all the prescribed medicine i went for a followup appt with my local dr and he took another xray to see how my lungs looked well after taking the xrays blood tests etc i thought i was finished so i headed out the door i almost got to my car when the nurse opened the door and yelled at me and said i needed to get back in the office i have to admit i was alarmed when i went back into the office my dr said come look at this xray he then said i dont know how you are breathing look at all this fluid it is even worse than before  it made me think of the joke my pastor tells of what was written on a mans tombstone i told you i was sick i was so frustrated because i seemed to be getting nowheredid anybody understand how i was feeling speaking of feelings i didnt feel any better when the bills began to roll in emergency room deductibles xrays tests etc and all this because of shoulder surgery hmm after being told that the fluid had gotten worse my dr recommended that i see a lung specialist at brookwood hospitalanother deductible   he informed me they would probably stick a needle in my back and into my lung and drain the fluid out of my lungs joy but i was ready when he told me i would feel almost immediate relief i just wanted to be able to breathe to walk up a flight of steps without having to stop and get my breath to wrestle with my boys without having to stop and catch my breath to enjoy a meal without dreading how id feel afterward most of all to sing lead worship you knowwhat i do for a living without struggling to be able to hold a note for more than 4 beats i was ready for that needlebring it on  ok i did lie awake wondering what in the world this was going to feel likeespecially after hearing everybodys personal experiences  isnt it funny how people feel like they are encouraging you when they tell you their horror story after waiting a few days to get in to see the lung specialist and thinking this was the day i would know if this procedure is no big deal or the  worst thing ive ever had done  the dr looks at me after looking at the xray and says  before we go sticking needles in you i want to make sure it is fluid  of course my first thought is what else could it be my mind went everywhere until he said  it could be an elevated or paralyzed diaphragm  what is that i had never heard of that how did this happen of course he wanted to do his own tests more  and i understand since i was his patient now but stillhere we go again to shorten this part after more tests he diagnosed me with an elevated  paralyzed diaphragm for me the reality was when i was standing in front of this xray machine and the dr said turn around here and breathe in and look at this screen wow when i did it was like i actually saw what i had been feeling i saw my left diaphragm drop and my lung expand but on the right side the diaphragm was way high seemed like more than half way up my lungand it just kind of fluttered interesting especially when the dr said  so its been 9 weeks uh usually after that long it probably wont go down i remember saying youve got to be kidding me as if someone would joke about that seriously i just couldnt fathom thisand after shoulder surgery all i wanted was my shoulder fixed the next question was how did this happen allow me to backtrack a little when the term elevated diaphragm was first used by the lung specialist i asked my local dr and a couple of other drs that i knew and the general thought was what does shoulder surgery have to do with a paralyzed diaphragm one dr called me back after researching this and said  did you have a block  i said yes he explained to me that there are occasions when a block for pain is linked to a paralyzed diaphragm he said that the nerves go from the brain down your neck then some in front of the heart and some behind the heart on down and there is a nerve that affects your diaphragm forgive me if some of the terms im using arent correct im a music guy of course my first thought was i wish i wouldve known this was a possibility i didnt have a block with my first shoulder surgery and did fine oh the thoughts and questions that were going through my mind that petpeeve of mine was rearing its ugly head ok lets be honest i was mad this affects what i do for a living singing will it get worse as i get older will the notes still come out plus ive built up my lawn mowing business to several yards in the summer getting out of debt thanks to dave ramsey  can i mow weedeat edge on my day offall day in the hot sun like i have been ive been looking forward to playing basketball again with my kids maybe on a church league and not having to shoot lefthanded im also tired of having to throw a football lefthandedand imagine throwing a baseball lefthanded then putting the glove back on to catch ittaking the glove back off to throw itlittle thingsbut frustrating well i will try to stop that ranting but when you bend over to tie your shoes and have to come up for aironce againfrustrating let me be the first to say i need to lose about 30 lbsbut as you can tell i am active always have been ask my neighbors who have seen me walk  jog in the mornings for the past 3 12 years since i moved into the neighborhood enough of thatfor those who know me you may be asking where is my faith in all this well i think you can have faith believe in gods word and also look for answers  help with physical issues such as what ive been describing so many times i have used the bible verses  all things work together for the good to those who love the lord and are called according to his purpose  and  i know where my help comes from m y help comes from the lord  i still believe that with all my heart but it is difficult to ignore your gut feelings especially when there have been times theyve been correct not always but a few because of that i share this with reservation because i cant see peoples hearts i do realize that but when you share passionately what you are feeling and how it is affecting what you do for a living the concerns you haveand the surgeon kind of pats you on the back and quickly says as hes walking out the room  everything happens for a reason and then by phone the anesthesiologist says man i am so sorry ive done hundreds of these and this has never happenedtheres nothing you can do but i will pray for yougood luck bye please hear me i believe in prayer i am praying and i have friends and family praying and that means more than anything it just kind of leaves you feeling strange when there are exam room conversations like what ive experienced i will give them the benefit of the doubt as far as their sincerity till the day i die unless god reveals something different its just that sometimes these scenarios leave you with more questions like this one i had a conversation with a friend of mine that recently had a similar shoulder surgery he was telling me about the block and how he asked the anesthesiologist if he could be knocked out when the dr told him about it the dr told him that he had to be awake so he knew when he hit the right place that his arm would automatically go up immediately i thought i was never told that and i definitely dont remember them getting ready to go into my neck with a needle now i was given an explanation of a amnesia type drug that causes you to not rememberbut my friend certainly remembered remember my petpeeve im feeling guilty again for questioning but i needed to get all that off my chest especially in case there is a dr out there that understands my thoughts and questions as far as singing i will sing as long as i have breatheven if its half a breath  let everything that has halfa breath praise the lord   i will continue doing what im doing satan will not keep me quiet as the ron kenoly song says  aint gonna let no rock out praise me aint gonna let no rock cry in my place  after saying all that if there is some help out there to get my breath back whether it is therapy surgery some new procedure i am open to that so far i have been told by the dr that there is nothing i can do so why did i type all this i tried to look up and read about causes symptoms etc about elevated  paralyzed diaphragms and although i learned some stuff i wanted to read real life detailed experiences i really didnt find that much i also wanted to let people know that if they want to be the least bit active especially if you sing for a living or an athlete seriously think twice about a block if you are considering shoulder surgery the first 24 painfree hours are not worth what i have been through and what im going through whether by prayer or the diaphragm just simply took a few months to go down either way i will shout it from the mountaintops and give god the praise and if there is a reader to this blogyou will be the first to know if the diaphragm goes down but if it went down today or tomorrow and i went back to normal i would still say no to the block believe me you dont want to be the 1 out of hundreds or thousands to hear these words from the dr  you are the first one this has happened to i am so sorry nothing you can do  forgive me for allowing my petpeeve to get the last word but here it goes if im one in hundreds or thousands could it be a mistake and not just an exception maybe i will never know and although i will not let it consume me nor allow me to hold a grudge or let it keep me from what im called to do periodically the question will remain posted by roy mc niel at 349 amlabels anesthesiologist  block  diaphragm  elevated diaphragm  paralyzed diaphragm  rotator cuff  surgery
