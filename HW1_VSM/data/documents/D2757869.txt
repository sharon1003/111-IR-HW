related to the subject please contact anatoly zak development historyorigin of the sputnik project in the postworld war ii ussr a group of scientists led by mikhail tikhonravov at the newly created nii4 military institute pioneered the work which would ultimately lead to the first soviet artificial satellite this effort prepared ground work for the political decision to go ahead with the launch of sputnik object d first soviet satellite project a decree of the soviet government no 14988ss formally authorizing the development of an artificial satellite was signed on january 30 1956 it called for the development of an unoriented satellite designated object d during 19571958 the spacecrafts mass was limited to 10001400 kilograms relying on the capabilities of the r7 ballistic missile between 200 and 300 kilograms were available for scientific instruments the launch date was set for 1957 technologysimplest satellite by the end of 1956 it became clear that problems in the development of the scientific instruments for object d threatened to derail the schedule to meet politically important window okb1 proposed the soviet government an offer it could not refuse  to precede object d with a  prosteishy sputnik  or simplest satellite also known by russian abbreviation as ps with the launch mass of only 80100 kilograms and it could be launched in aprilmay 1957 the rocket a version of the r7 rocket which was destined to carry the first satellite into orbit carried a rather long designation  8k71ps no 1 m1ps it featured several upgrades deferring it from previous r7 test vehicles along with the military warhead gone were measurement hardware top avionics section containing vibration monitoring system cables connecting the rocket and the warhead and the considerable portion of the flight control hardware including radio control system ground control to support first satellite launches the soviet government approved a number of upgrades to tracking facilities and to the hardware originally built for ballistic missile tests as the original satellite development program was designated object d the index d was added to the names of systems supporting the mission on the eve of the sputnik launch only part of the tracking systems originally planned for the object d project were ready for work the missionpreparing for flight on feb 15 1957 korolev signed an agreement with nii885 led by mikhail ryazansky on the specifications of the radio transmitter for the ps satellite it would be the the main component of the spacecraft to be developed outside korolevs okb1 the mission the launch vehicle with the ps1 satellite blasted off on october 4 1957 at 222834 moscow time  250 it was already october 5 in tyuratam before the satellite completed its first orbit tass the official soviet news agency announced the launch to the world the flight controllers intentionally left the tral telemetry system onboard the core stage active and its signal was detected during the second orbit the aftermath depending on the ideology of the viewer a sovietmade star in the sky could simultaneously represent an imminent nuclear holocaust a hope for the oppressed and dispossessed or the dawn of the interplanetary travel the enormous resonance of the sputnik launch was also thanks to the multifaceted nature of this single event and its ability to simultaneously break so many assumptions longstanding theories and even entire political strategies key figures behind sputniktikhonravov mikhail klavdievich july 29 1900  march 3 1974 tikhonravov graduated from zhukovsky air force academy in 1925 one of the pioneers of the soviet space program tikhonravov led a group of workers within the earliest soviet rocket research group gird from 1932 in 1934 he becomes a head of a department at the rocket research institute rnii in mid1940 tikhonravov led the earliest studies in the soviet union on the problems of multistage missiles and orbiting spacecraft  76korolev sergei pavlovich 19071966 involved in preworld war ii studies of rocketry in the ussr korolev like many of his colleagues went through stalins prisons and later participated in the search for rocket technology in occupied germany he deserves the most credits for turning rocket weapons into an instrument of space exploration and making the soviet union the worlds first spacefaring nation keldysh mstislav vsevolodovich dec 10 1911june 24 1978keldysh graduated from moscow state university mgu in 1931 and worked for central aerohydrodynamic institute ts agi and mgu where he became a professor in 1937 during his work at steklov applied mathematics institute keldysh led a group of researchers tackling mathematical problems of space flight as member of the presidium of the academy of science from 1953 keldysh provided major support for the satellite project within the scientific establishment ustinov dmitry fedorovich oct 30 1908  dec 12 1984 ustinov was born in the city of samara in the working class family he graduated from leningrad militarymechanical institute in 1934 he had risen to the minister of armaments of the ussr by 1946 in 1953 ustinov becomes the minister of the defense industry of the ussr from 1957 he held the post of deputy chairman of the soviet of ministers of the ussr as a top official overseeing soviet rocket industry ustinov was instrumental in providing political support for the sputnik project  121khrushchev nikita sergeyevich april 17 1894  sept 11 1971although he had no involvement into rocket industry until he won struggle for power in the ussr khrushchev quickly fell in love with rocketry after meeting korolev chelomei and other key figures in the field initially he saw rockets purely as weapons which would give him an equal footing in negotiations with the west however sputniks triumph showed khrushchev unmatched propaganda value of space program khrushchev had strongly supported space exploration projects until his fall from power in a bloodless kremlin coup of 1964
