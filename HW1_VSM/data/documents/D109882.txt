1  12 herpes is often mistaken for other conditions herpes is a common incurable sexually transmitted disease its so common in the united states that more than 1 out of every 6 people ages 14 to 49 has genital herpes because herpes is somewhat easier to pass from men to women than from women to men more american women than men have it herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus hsv there are two types of this virus herpes simplex 1 hsv1 and herpes simplex 2 hsv2 both viruses are transmitted by close contact with a person who has the virus hsv1 is usually associated with cold sores around the mouth while hsv2 most often affects the genital area however about half of all new cases of genital herpes in developed countries are caused by hsv1 not hsv2 this is because a person who has oral herpes caused by hsv1 can spread it to their partners genitals during oral sex you can also get genital herpes by having vaginal or anal sex with someone who has the virus a first genital herpes outbreak may cause multiple blisters that break and leave painful sores that take a week or more to heal after your first outbreak you may have more outbreaks especially if you are infected with hsv2 but the repeated outbreaks tend to be shorter and less severe each time you have one that being said many people who are infected with hsv have no symptoms or their symptoms are very mild so they often dont know they have the virus they may also mistake their symptoms for those of another std or skin condition such as a pimple or ingrown hair in their genital region on the plus side this underscores how mild the symptoms of herpes can be on the minus side it helps explain how and why the infection is so widespread if you don’t know you have it you are unlikely to take steps to avoid spreading it and herpes can be transmitted from one person to another even when there are no symptoms also having herpes raises the risk of getting hiv once you have herpes youll always have it theres no cure for herpes but there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks as well as make it less likely you will pass it on to intimate partners still if you have herpes whether or not you take medication you should tell anyone you have sex with so they know the risks your risk of spreading the virus is higher when sores or other symptoms are present but it can be spread at any time also while using condoms may help lower the risk of spreading herpes it will not guarantee your partner will not get it do you know how to recognize herpes additional reporting by cathy cassata and ingrid strauch2  12 what does genital herpes look like while you may not experience any symptoms of genital herpes if you do they can be mild or severe symptoms might include blisters or painful sores in your genital area or on your buttocks a skin rash or a burning sensation when urinating however these symptoms can also occur with other sexually transmitted diseases while your doctor can often make a diagnosis on the basis of your symptoms in some cases you will need to be tested either from a swab of a sore or a blood sample to figure out what is causing your symptoms an outbreak of genital herpes will heal on its own — but once youre infected particularly if you have hsv2 youll likely have occasional outbreaks for the rest of your life taking antiviral medication can help speed up the healing of genital herpes lesions reduce the number of outbreaks you have and lower the risk of spreading the virus to sexual partners but even with medication you can still pass on genital herpes to another person during sexual activity so its important to tell anyone you plan to have sex with that you have herpes using condoms also lowers — but does not eliminate — the risk of herpes transmission if you are pregnant you can pass on herpes to your infant during pregnancy or childbirth or just after birth herpes in a newborn is a serious sometimes fatal condition be sure to tell your doctor that you have herpes so your baby can be treated quickly at any signs or symptoms of neonatal herpes3  12 oral herpes blisters around the mouth and nose oral herpes also called cold sores or fever blisters is usually caused by hsv1 but it can also be caused by hsv2 which is typically associated with genital herpes not everyone infected with hsv1 or hsv2 will have symptoms of oral herpes but many people do between 2 and 20 days after contact with a person infected with the herpes virus you may feel a burning or stinging sensation around your mouth then blisters and sores may break out around the mouth or in the nose area occasionally cold sores form inside the mouth on the gums or roof of the mouth cold sore blisters can appear in a range in sizes some are more painful than others and they can last for 7 to 10 days as they heal they usually break crust over and eventually leave behind an area of red skin although the skin lesions that occur with oral herpes usually heal completely — as with genital herpes — the virus can stay in your body and reappear in the same area again and again or in a new area around the mouth or nose exactly why outbreaks occur isnt known but some common triggers include stress lack of sleep too much exposure to sunlight cold weather and for women hormonal changes cold sores can be spread through kissing and through sharing eating utensils cups and glasses straws lip balm or anything else that has come into contact with a sore when you have cold sores or fever blisters on your mouth you should refrain from giving oral sex because you can pass on the herpes virus to your partners genitals a cold sore outbreak can be shortened with antiviral medications4  12 fever blisters and cold sores are oral herpes too fever blisters and cold sores are just different names for oral herpes and they’ve been around for a very long time legend has it that in ancient rome the emperor tiberius banned kissing at public events because of an outbreak of fever blisters in other words they even knew back then how contagious fever blisters are the best way to protect yourself is to avoid contact with a person who has a cold sore and refrain from sharing eating utensils lip balm and the like note that someone with oral herpes can give you genital herpes if they perform oral sex on you avoid kissing and oral sex when outbreaks are present there is no cure for fever blisters and no vaccine to prevent them although research into preventing and treating them is ongoing if you do get oral herpes your doctor may recommend overthecounter pain medications and topical anesthetics to relieve symptoms some people also choose to take antiviral medications to make cold sores go away faster5  12 are canker sores caused by the herpes virus canker sores are not caused by the herpes virus or by any other virus in fact the cause of canker sores is unknown although they may be triggered by a minor injury in your mouth from dental work or brushing too hard an allergy a vitamin b deficiency stress or a food intolerance some medical conditions such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease may also cause canker sores and they often occur in families so its possible genetics or environment play a part too canker sores typically appear as small round or oval whitish sores with a red border they typically occur on the tongue inside the cheeks inside the lips or on the gums the medical term for a canker sore is aphthous ulcer canker sores can be quite painful but they usually heal within about two weeks without leaving any scarring unlike cold sores which usually occur outside the mouth canker sores occur only inside the mouth like cold sores canker sores are recurrent but they are not contagious you can’t give a canker sore to another person canker sores occur more often in teenagers and young adults and they are more common in women than men a canker sore that is large or particularly painful can make it hard to eat and talk in some cases your doctor may suggest you use an alcoholfree mouth rinse or topical treatment to ease the pain of a canker sore gargling salt water may also help if the sore lasts longer than 10 to 14 days you should see a doctor or dentist6  12 contact dermatitis can be mistaken for herpes contact dermatitis is a skin condition that can cause red itchy cracked dry or scaly skin blisters or a rash like herpes it recurs and while its not a std when it appears in the mouth or genital area it may be mistaken for herpes however unlike herpes contact dermatitis can happen anywhere on the skin and is caused by direct contact with an irritant or something youre allergic to its not caused by a virus contact dermatitis usually occurs within minutes to hours after touching an irritant common causes include poison ivy and reactions to medications cosmetics detergents and jewelry the skin rash from contact dermatitis usually clears up in a few weeks the best way to prevent contact dermatitis is to identify what’s causing it and avoid touching that item or substance again allergy testing can help identify the cause while contact dermatitis is generally not a serious condition it can be itchy and uncomfortable when the rash is present try using cool wet compresses or antiitch creams to soothe it antihistamine pills can help reduce the itchiness avoid scratching the area doing so can make symptoms worse and open the door to a bacterial or fungal infection if your itching is severe you should see your primary care provider or a dermatologist for topical steroid medications7  12 is that spot a pimple or a cold sore acne is the most common skin condition in teens and young adults in the united states and it’s increasingly common among women in their thirties forties and fifties it can cause a range of blemishes variously known as blackheads whiteheads papules pustules pimples cysts and nodules acne is sometimes confused with oral herpes because of the way a breakout looks although oral herpes sores usually appear as small clear blisters filled with fluid in some instances they can look more like the reddened skin and pimples associated with acne however herpes is typically associated with more itchiness and pain than acne and whereas oral herpes sores are usually found on the mouth lips chin cheeks or nose acne can break out on any area of the face as well as on the neck chest back and shoulders acne is caused by excess skin oil clogged pores and bacteria — not the herpes virus hormones stress certain medicines and sometimes diet can trigger or worsen acne outbreaks while a single pimple may clear up in a few days a larger acne outbreak may last for weeks to months acne is not contagious and topical and oral medications can help heal pimples stop new pimples from forming and prevent scars to avoid scarring dont squeeze or pop pimples8  12 how can i tell if its scabies or herpes scabies is caused by tiny eightlegged mites called human itch mites that burrow into the skin to live feed and lay their eggs there are millions of cases of scabies worldwide each year herpes may be confused with scabies because both conditions can cause a skin rash of small itchy bumps and blisters that spread through persontoperson contact as with herpes the scabies skin rash is sometimes seen in the genital area it can be transmitted through close physical or sexual contact because the mites can move from one body to another if youve never had scabies before it can take two to six weeks to develop symptoms after the mites move in unlike herpes you can also get scabies from bedding clothes or furniture thats infested with mites since the mites can live for about three to four days without being on a human also unlike herpes scabies is most commonly found on the hands arms and legs and the most common symptom is severe itching that occurs mainly at night your dermatologist can tell if you have scabies by examining your skin or looking at a small piece of skin under a microscope scabies is easily treated with a medicated cream or lotion that kills the mites9  12 how to tell a yeast infection from an stdvaginal yeast infections are very common — 75 percent of women will have one in their lifetime and nearly 50 percent will have more than one some of the symptoms of a yeast infection — including vaginal itching rash soreness and pain when urinating — are similar to those of herpes as well as of other stds like chlamydia and gonorrhea other symptoms of a yeast infection include a white discharge without a foul odor swelling of the vagina and vulva and pain during sex most vaginas have healthy yeast in them a yeast infection occurs when the acidity level in the vagina drops and too much of that yeast grows this can be caused by hormones drugs diabetes weak immune systems and more while very rare men can also get yeast infections on their penis and scrotum that cause redness and irritation yeast infections are not stds and generally aren’t contagious but they can be passed from one partner to another during sex having sex can also lead to yeast infections if your body has a bad reaction to a lubricant or contraceptive product receiving oral sex is known to cause yeast infections in some women and for some vaginal sex particularly with a new partner triggers a yeast infection if you have a yeast infection your doctor may suggest you take an overthecounter or prescription antifungal medication the infection will usually clear up in a few days10  12 what about chlamydia the most common std chlamydia is caused by bacteria whereas herpes is caused by a virus this is why chlamydia is easily treated and cured with antibiotics however many people have chlamydia and don’t know it because they dont have any symptoms thats why people who are at higher risk of chlamydia including sexually active young women and men who have sex with other men are advised to get a test for chlamydia every year if you dont treat chlamydia it can increase the chances of both men and women getting or giving hivaids untreated chlamydia can also cause serious pelvic inflammatory disease in women which can lead to infertility and in men it can spread to the testicles and the tube that carries sperm causing inflammation screening for chlamydia is usually done by taking a urine sample or a swab from your genitals results of these tests are usually found quickly different testing methods are used for infections of the rectum and throat and these take more time while the only way to completely avoid getting chlamydia or herpes is to not have sex you can reduce your chances of getting both by being in a longterm mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who is not infected with an std and by using latex condoms every time you have sex11  12 syphilis a greater health threat than herpes syphilis and genital herpes are both stds that can cause sores in the genital area like oral herpes syphilis can also cause mouth sores which often clear without treatment but despite these similarities in symptoms the two diseases differ in their causes — syphilis is caused by a bacteria and herpes by a virus — and the health risks they pose for most people — the exceptions being infants and people who have weakened immune systems or who are chronically ill — herpes is more of an annoyance than a dangerous disease but untreated syphilis can lead to severe complications including bone joint liver heart and brain damage there are four stages of syphilis each with different signs and symptoms in the primary stage a painless sore or sores develop where the bacteria first entered the skin or mucous membrane in the secondary stage you may develop a skin rash swollen lymph nodes fever and other flulike symptoms in the latent stage of syphilis there are no signs or symptoms and in the tertiary stage the bacterial infection can damage the heart brain and other organs of the body unlike herpes syphilis is easily cured if antibiotics — usually bicillin la  penicillin g benzathine — are given in the early stages of the disease however antibiotic treatment cant reverse any organ damage that has already occurred as a result of the disease and you can get syphilis again after treatment if you engage in sexual activities with someone who is infected while not having sex is the only way to completely guard yourself from syphilis if you are sexually active using condoms can help reduce your risk12  12 how to know if its gonorrhea or genital herpes gonorrhea is another common std that has some symptoms similar to genital herpes herpes and gonorrhea can both cause sores in the genital area skin rash and burning pain when urinating one symptom that distinguishes gonorrhea from genital herpes is discharge from the vagina or penis like syphilis and chlamydia gonorrhea can be serious if not treated but it usually responds to antibiotics since its caused by a bacteria your doctor may give you a onetime pill or a sevenday dose to treat gonorrhea if women dont get treated for gonorrhea they are at risk for serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause infertility in men complications of gonorrhea may include epididymitis an inflammation of a coiled tube at the back of the testicles this condition can cause testicular or scrotal pain and in rare cases infertility if you have any symptoms of a std see your doctor or go to a sexual health clinic your doctor will know what test to give you to detect which std you have and if youre sexually active get screened regularly and always practice safe sex like all stds herpes and gonorrhea are only completely avoidable if you dont have sex all sexually active people are at risk
