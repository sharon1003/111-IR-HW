seasonnine premiere of the big bang theory the hollywood reporter following eight seasons of willtheyorwontthey leonard johnny galecki and penny kaley cuocosweeting officially tied the knot during mondays seasonnine premiere of cbs the big bang theory but the happily ever after doesnt quite get off to a good start while penny did her best to overlook the fact that leonard had kissed another girl two years ago while he was on his north sea expedition she was unable to get past it and thought of the girl — who it turns out works at the university with leonard the fact that leonard sees mandy melissa tang regularly also doesnt sit well with penny and their wedding night is ruined the duo head home to pasadena where they spend their first night as husband and wife in their respective apartments also not helping matters is sheldon confirming that mandy is brilliant and attractive sheldon jim parsons meanwhile cant give amy mayim bialik the space she needs and winds up pushing her to the brink of finalizing their breakup he turns to his mother in texas for support and viewers learn that the ring he had planned to give amy when he proposed belongs to his greatgrandmother illustrating that in his own way he really does care here the hollywood reporter chats with leading man galecki and showrunner steve molaro about the wedding the fight and yes the roommate agreement that may or may not keep the newlyweds from officially moving in together first look at big bang theory wedding the wedding has been eight seasons in the making what was being on set for that scene like steve molaro it was great its a rocky episode for them but i wanted to make sure that the actual wedding moment was satisfying sweet and lovely which i think it was we were all pretty happy with how it turned out — especially with pennys vows kaley did a great job with them i was so excited about that scene and she came through and more johnny galecki it was emotional i love both of these characters as kaley does and were very protective of them were their biggest fans and weve been rooting for them for a long time and it was time to pull the trigger after talking about it for so long when you first heard that leonard and penny were actually going to go through with it were you surprised galecki no i wasnt surprised we talked about it with the writers that they may or may not take that step what we didnt want to do was play up the willtheyorwontthey any longer it wasnt in the audiences best interest the audience wants to see them married but just because they have rings on their fingers doesnt mean that its solved every relationship problem marriage doesnt answer all the questions and doesnt solve all the problems so there will be plenty ahead with this commitment that they share theres very little comedy in everything working out well laughs so well see what happens in the future but we didnt want to dangle the marriage carrot over the audiences head any longer will there be any sort of formal reception molaro there are no plans as of yet the guys all got to see it on the internet and thats good enough for now i feel like an actual wedding happened how will pennys father wyatt keith carradine respond to leonard as a soninlaw what kind of fatherly advice could he have for penny molaro we see him again in the third episode and well see penny talk to him and let her father know whats going on there leonard doesnt cross paths with pennys dad in this episode but wed love to have him back down the line the vibe between wyatt and leonard is fantastic the marriage is all so new to him we dont dig too much into fatherly advice yet youll have to see how it all plays out what about leonards mother will she have any nontherapist advice for her son molaro we dont happen to see that occur on the show im sure it happened but i dont know exactly what happened will penny legally change her last name will we learn what her maiden name was molaro i hope not im still afraid to know what it is laughs weve made it so far without knowing i think we have to go all the way to the end she has taken his name and maybe thats convenient so we dont have to deal with her maiden name but she is penny hofstadter now leonards vows are very special and include a nod to the theme song what went into writing those molaro we wrote it as a group in the room its funny the live audience giggled a little bit the first time they heard them because they thought maybe they were going to be goofier than they were but then very quickly they caught up and realized it was beautiful we talked about it and wanted his vows to be very leonardlike and sweet and evoke some kind of science and pennys vows to be off the cuff we had the idea for her quoting the toy story song for a while we had that part before we knew what leonards vows were going to be galecki i was glad they were written on a card i was holding in the scene because i was very emotional it was very much within leonards language ive always loved those episodes where she might not be able to relate and certainly doesnt have the same passion for physics that leonard has but she loves his passion for it and thats appealing to her it was nice to hear the live audience giggle when he launched into his vows being physics heavy and then ending in a very emotional and honest genuine place what made toy storys youve got a friend in me right molaro it seemed to be the right blend of silly and fun and something she could believably pull out of her head at the last second that also when it was done being silly actually did mean a lot to him she knows him and knows that toy story is one of his favorite movies so while the words arent exactly the most romantic the sentiment of all of it is galecki thats been something the writers have enjoyed a few times in the first episode we discussed leonards love for toy story theres also a funeral scene when bob newharts character passed will either leonard or penny have any regrets about eloping especially given the nature of what they come home to molaro they come back and theres certainly some level of regret in that walk up the stairs theyre more worried that theyre not sure how to fix it i dont know if its regret yet theyre still hopeful it can be fixed theyre just not sure how im always hopeful for leonard and penny without a doubt — and for all of them i want all seven of them in this world to be ok galecki i was surprised the whole group wasnt there wed done that with howard and bernadettes wedding so i understand why the writers chose to make it different but at this point in leonard and pennys relationship its just lets take the plunge already in true leonard form he was a little too honest with mandy leonard can fit a whole boot in his mouth most of the time and he was honest with her in a way that i find equally admirable and idiotic hes happy shes still speaking to him as he should bethe fact that leonard is taking responsibility for this fight shows a lot of growth for the character its a very grownup thing to say molaro it could have all been avoided its nice to get to see all these characters continue to grow and deal with life and what it has in store for them galecki when you get a role you love you want to run with it early on cocreator chuck lorre always said lets be patient we understand your passion for this role and you want to evolve the character but these guys evolve slowly think of molasses in terms of evolving there have been moments where if we didnt mature the characters — like when leonard told penny he was in love with her and she didnt return the sentiment — that changes a person it would be irresponsible to not then change the character a bit there are those opportunities to do so taking accountability is a big step for anybody and its often not easy see more behind the scenes the big bang theorynow that leonard and penny are married how will they tackle the mandy flap leonard didnt expect to spend his wedding night with sheldon molaro i do feel somehow in the context of this show leonard should be with sheldon for some reason on his wedding night it seemed oddly ok to me — and the way it should be laughs but moving forward were flying right to the face of it in the second episode in meeting mandy and leonard working hard to try and put this behind them how awkward will leonards and pennys interaction with mandy be molaro that was news to penny its pretty awkward its not well advised that he talk to her but he feels that he doesnt have many options left so hes really grasping at straws ultimately with or without mandy in the picture this will come down to leonard and penny and a question of is their relationship strong enough to get past a thing like this or not in the end it will come down to them and them figuring it out on their own but i think theres a good chance galecki theres part of me thats been on the fence about this situation and you try not to ever judge your character but when youre so close to him its hard not to there are moments when i want to defend leonard they were not together at the time and it was a kiss it was influenced chemicals laughs it can certainly be worse at the same time that penny is hurt over the whole thing its hard to not judge him harshly as far as mandy leonard is doing his best to rectify what hes tarnished and is going to put his head on the chopping block for penny for the relationship now that theyre married how do you think things will change overall for leonard and penny molaro the biggest hurdle after mandy is to tackle living arrangements sheldon is obviously a big part of that and now that theyre married what happens next is looming galecki im not sure ive never been married part of our job is to hold a mirror up to the audience and be frank and honest and share our human flaws that we all have theres a lot of hardship ahead big bang theory whats next for sheldon and amy after the divorce how big of a role will the roommate agreement come into play in all this sheldon cant be happy about this he hates change and this is a big one molaro a lot the roommate agreement will be around and out and on the table and being discussed in the fourth episode sheldon is not happy about a lot of things that are going on in his life right now but hes doing his best to try and hold it together and get past it all rise above it or solve it its a lot of weird things that he knows hes a smart guy and hes used to being able to apply logic and science to figuring things out and none of that seems to be working for him these days galecki itll be slow in figuring out what happens with their living arrangements both within the story and outside of the story thats always been the biggest question mark when weve talked about leonard and penny getting married what happens to the two boys but at the same point this deep into season nine they basically all live together there just happens to be a hallway between their two apartment doors so i dont know that that much will change immediately sheldon isnt ready to live by himself yet — especially in the wake of his split with amy but at te same time howard and bernadette have this guy — stuart kevin sussman — whom they cant get rid of molaro sheldon is very fragile right now leonard and penny — and wolowitz and bernadette — both have these men in their lives laughs which is a pretty funny parallel thats going on right now we put all that stuff down and episode three is pretty lighthearted and is a belated bachelor party and then we go right into working on tackling the living arrangements if you were going to pick sheldons next roommate who would you pick galecki stuart is pitch perfect im a huge fan of his and i want him in every episode because all the guys now are in relationships we get to have kevin on more to represent the bachelor character we certainly cant have those jokes anymore the audience cares too much about the relationships of howard and bernadette for example so howard cant have those risque lines of dialogue and theyre too protective of their relationship the last time sheldon was in this kind of situation he left town on a train how bad will his freakout be comparatively speaking molaro a freakout is looming theres a form of departure — though its not physical its vaguely based in time travel laughs ill leave you with thatare you any closer to bringing bob newharts professor proton back molaro wed love to but there are no concrete plans he knows hes welcome here if we can come up with a plan that works with his schedule wed love to make it happen but theres nothing on the books yet sheldon needs leonard more now than ever given his split with amy how will he be a factor as leonard and penny look to start life together as newlyweds molaro sheldon is dealing with a lot of emotions and they fluctuate all day long between sad and lonely to angry and hurt to jealous hes not doing a good job of controlling them its going to be a fascinating journey to watch him be on but its a good one for him and for leonard and penny as people if penny and leonard are ultimately going to make it work something like this will help them as a couple be stronger if they can weather it now this is really sheldons and amys first huge fight should they find their way back together could makeup coitus be something youve been considering molaro they are so far away from repairing it its too soon for me to even think about that part but theres always that dangling sexual issue between them so if they do manage to get through this thats not going to go away will amy explore being single or is she really going to lean on her friends molaro amy is definitely going to lean on everybody in the first several episodes shes not in a rush she wasnt looking to be with another person — she just wanted to figure out what shes doing and if a full life of sheldon is exactly whats right for her other men arent really on the immediate horizon for her the story behind big bang theorys tribute to carol ann susi w h at about for sheldon will he try and make amy jealous by dating other people molaro he may try to but thats all it is for him right now just trying to make her jealous or do anything to get her to have a feeling or miss him its all up for grabs for him what ever could possibly make this stop and let it go back to what it was — thats all hes interested in the ring was his greatgrandmothers will we learn more about the conversation between sheldon and his mother that led to him getting the ring thats a huge leap for that character molaro we dont know exactly what happened there she might have said ive got your greatgrandmothers ring i want to send it to you im not sure how that conversation went down whether sheldon asked for it or if she just gave it to him and thats what put the thoughts in his head either way he had been thinking about it down the line the ring certainly is a fixture its in the apartment and things will happen with it any update on storylines for raj as well as howard and bernadette molaro there are lots of fun little storylines going on for howard bernadette and raj but nothing causing huge shifts see the original story at the hollywood reporters website©2015 the
