jeff dunn apr 11 2017 915 am 19979you tube tv hollis johnson heres the thing about you tube its not television its faster larger in scope and far less constrained sometimes that is very much not a virtue but at its best it makes the site feel intimate and raw in a way that mass tv programming is not even in its dumbest moments you tube leaves you in control its in the name after all it lets you find almost anything people teaching you how to do things people telling stories people playing games people reviewing products people falling down then there are the bestof clips of actual tv shows the memes and the billion other wormholes lurking below the surface to be clear i fall within you tubes target audience im a mid20s guy who hasnt subscribed to cable in four years and uses the internet apps and video games to entertain me where tv entertained my parents and on a pure percentage basis most of you tubes videos are awful but because its such a freeforall its usually home to the most interesting thing i watch on a given day youll see this pretty often if you search for a normal you tube video jeff dunnbusiness insider given that people watch you tube for a billion hours a day — according to the company — im probably not alone for context a february report from the wall street journal said americans now watch 125 billion hours of television a day you tubes figure is worldwide and clearly the service is easier to access but its number is growing while tvs is steadily going down all this time though theres been a wall between you tubes usergenerated content and the live tv programming held by networks and cable operators bootlegged and quicklyflagged copies of that programming aside this is unique for a major streaming platform for as much as theyve pressured cable netflix amazon and hulu still rely on the shows and movies youd otherwise watch on regular tv they all produce their own stuff now yes but theyre harder sells without that licensed backlog there to help take away the option to rent movies from you tube meanwhile and little is likely to change for what it is you tube tv looks greatjeff dunnbusiness insider so when you tube announced it was creating a livetv streaming service called you tube tv i got excited the consumer dream for all video streaming services is to unbundle the cable package down to a show level and let you watch those programs whenever and wherever you want the idea in effect is to do for television what spotify has done for music you tube tv wasnt pitched to go that far but it is a chance to mostly fill the one big gap — fully licensed tv shows and movies as they air — in a service that has almost everything else it wouldnt be the one true service that everyone outside of the cable industry wants — there are too many holes in you tube tvs channel lineup for that to happen today — but it could go further than any service before it in blending livetv and ondemand content together jeff dunnbusiness insider now that you tube tv is available though its clear that the service isnt really interested in making that happen to be fair there are some bridges between the two a trending on you tube section on you tube tvs home tab shows you popular videos on you tube proper the kidfocused original shows from the you tube red subscription service are included certain channels that serialize their videos using you tubes  series editor  tool are put in a shows on you tube tab if you search for a certain program you can check out a curated selection of you tube videos related to that program on a nifty show page for instance if you click the related on you tube tab on the show page for the bachelor youll see interview and talk show clips from you tube that are related to the most recent season but you tube tvs site and app live separately from you tube proper and the former often keeps the latters videos in their own silo that trending on you tube section sits at the very bottom of the home tab many popular you tube channels do not use the series editor searching for those channels through you tube tv usually brings you nothing and outside the stuff mentioned above most links to you tube videos on you tube tv will just prompt you to open the main you tube app some examples of standard you tube videos that use the series editor tool and thus are more likely to be featured on you tube tv jeff dunnbusiness insider if you subscribe to you tube tv and go to the main you tube site meanwhile the only tiein you see is an option on the side panel to get you tube tv what youre left with is another iteration on the formula already set by sling tv play station vue and direc tv now you tube tv is a very goodlooking iteration of that formula its generous with dvr space and crucially its the first to stream shows without technically falling apart out of the gate but it only feels like you tube in name and aesthetics otherwise its just a smaller cheaper version of cable with all the caveats and annoyances that implies plus a few more easily preventable shortcomings  and thats what it wants to be — even the serialized you tube and you tube red videos here are made to feel more like tv shows many of the videos you see in the related on you tube tab do not come from everyday users jeff dunnbusiness insider there are sound reasons for you tube to keep its two services distant the company will likely tell you that you tube and you tube tv are different business models the former needs ad revenue you tube red aside while the latter needs subscriptions keeping the live tv stuff at arms length from the usergenerated stuff makes it easier to see why it specifically may be worth 35 a month — and thus why people who are more interested in live tv may want to use you tube more often maybe you tube the company just needs the money maybe it just wants to drive eyeballs to you tube red shows in an environment where they may feel more natural maybe the networks wanted to keep their stuff from getting buried maybe there isnt a way to merge livetv content into a site like you tube without creating an interface nightmare thats all fair enough what i object to is the idea that you tube tv should be a separate experience because regular you tube viewers arent as interested in live tv that may be true in some cases but most people cut the cord because because the stuff they like is saddled with the stuff theyll never care about not because every show is bad casey neistat is a you tuber with nearly 7 million subscribers the from you tube videos here link you back to the main site jeff dunnbusiness insider you tube is successful because it actively avoids that trap while still providing fast entertainment its also free if it gave you a way to easily jump from a fail video to a live premier league game to a lets play to a dvr recording of parks and recreation or whatever you like all within the same app thatd be powerful and convenient in a way att sony and dish cannot recreate you tube tv already knows how to mark favorites and personalize the shows youre more likely to watch so it wouldnt seem too hard to work that into the suggestions youre given on you tube proper for now though that holy grail remains distant maybe hulu can get closer see also heres how the services that let you stream live tv over the internet compare now watch a you tuber
