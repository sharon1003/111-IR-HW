pot  by a long shot according to price of weedcom a crowdsourced internet archive of black market pot prices across the country the national average cost of an ounce of highquality black market marijuana is roughly 350 great pot as reported by consumers is most expensive in north dakota where an ounce goes for 400 other states in which users report comparatively high prices for illegal weed include iowa louisiana new hampshire pennsylvania virginia and wyoming pot smokers can really stretch their dollars on the west coast it’s cheapest in oregon where highquality pot sells for about 210 per ounce followed by washington 232 per ounce and california 245 per ounce those prices are all for illicit recreational marijuana a step above the black market stuff is medical cannabis which is legal in 23 states and tends to be more expensive than what consumers can get on the street but is still cheaper than legal recreational weed medical marijuana is usually milder than its black market counterparts in part because medical cannabis users seek out varieties that treat specific conditions like nausea or arthritis a patient might prefer a variety that is aggressive in treating his or her symptoms but has a more temperate psychoactive effect the price of street medical and retail marijuana in colorado and washington photo international business timeshanna sender of the 23 states that have legalized medical marijuana only arizona california colorado maine michigan montana new mexico rhode island and washington employ licensed dispensaries to sell medical cannabis because the sale and distribution of marijuana of any kind remains illegal under federal law these dispensaries operate in a gray area at best and frequently face threats of forced shutdowns from federal officials still medical pot continues to sell and at competitive prices in colorado medical cannabis is about half the price of recreational cannabis denver dispensaries charge medical customers around 10 per gram prices per gram for the retail stuff range from 15 to 25 in seattle medical dispensaries sell weed for 8 to 15 per gram with washington state’s first marijuana retail stores opening this week  24 pot shops centered mainly around spokane vancouver tacoma and bellingham only one license was given to a retail store in seattle  it’s not yet clear how consumers will respond to the higher price of legal weed according to botec the consulting firm assisting the washington state liquor control board in rolling out initiative 502 which made pot legal for recreational use in 2012 the aftertax retail price for a gram of pot will be about 17 or 482 per ounce that’s about twice as expensive as what highquality marijuana goes for on the state’s black market andin the states medical marijuana dispensaries  and that’s the lowball figure other models put the price of a gram of legal weed at about 723 one of i502’s selling points was that it would supplant washington’s black market for pot but a lack of competition among marijuana retailers price markups exorbitant taxes and a supply shortage mean the legal product is not going to be cheap of the 2600 growers who applied

endless layers of taxes associated with legal marijuana  a 25 percent wholesale tax plus another 25 percent minimum retail tax tack on a sales tax and ultimately washington’s legal cannabis will have been taxed a total of 75 percent by the time it reaches the buyer but most observers expect washington consumers to embrace the legal paradigm as they have in colorado colorado which opened its first retail dispensaries at the beginning of the year raked in some 2 million in marijuana tax revenue in january 2014 alone and pulled in an additional 15 million in tax revenue from medical marijuana sales that same month if figures remain on target something state officials have indicated will likely be the case colorado could see itself 40 million richer by the end of the year roger roffman a professor emeritus in social work at the university of washington who has closely watched washington’s rollout of i502 told international business times he thinks “overall … people will be inclined to
