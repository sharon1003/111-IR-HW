from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search wheat a glutenfree diet gfd is a diet that strictly excludes gluten a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains including barley rye oat and all their species and hybrids such as spelt kamut and triticale  1 the inclusion of oats in a glutenfree diet remains controversial and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent crosscontamination with other glutencontaining cereals 2 3 4 5gluten causes health problems for those with glutenrelated disorders including celiac disease cd nonceliac gluten sensitivity ncgs gluten ataxia dermatitis herpetiformis dh and wheat allergy 6 in these people the glutenfree diet is demonstrated as an effective treatment 7 8 9 but several studies show that about 79 of the people with coeliac disease have an incomplete recovery of the small bowel despite a strict glutenfree diet 10 this is mainly caused by inadvertent ingestion of gluten 10 people with poor basic education and understanding of glutenfree diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet but are making regular errors 10 11in addition a glutenfree diet may in at least some cases improve gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis or hiv enteropathy among others 12 glutenfree diets have also been promoted as an alternative treatment of people with autism but the current evidence for their efficacy in making any change in the symptoms of autism is limited and weak 13 14 15gluten proteins have low nutritional and biological value and the grains that contain gluten are not essential in the human diet 16 however an unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of glutenfree replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies replacing flour from wheat or other glutencontaining cereals with glutenfree flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients such as iron and b vitamins some glutenfree commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their glutencontaining counterparts and often have greater lipid  carbohydrate content children especially often overconsume these products such as snacks and biscuits nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education 4a glutenfree diet should be mainly based on naturally glutenfree foods with a good balance of micro and macro nutrients meat fish eggs milk and dairy products legumes nuts fruits vegetables potatoes rice and maize are all appropriate components of such a diet 17 if commercially prepared glutenfree replacement products are used choosing those that are enriched or fortified with vitamins and minerals is preferable 4 pseudocereals  quinoa amaranth and buckwheat and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have high biological and nutritional value 4 16contents  hide 1 rationale behind adoption

glutenrelated disorders when they are following a glutenfree diet consuming gluten even in small quantities which may be the result of inadvertent crosscontamination causes active immune response and carries the risk of triggering associated diseases 18 19 20 11 21coeliac disease  editmain article coeliac disease coeliac disease  american english celiac cd is a chronic immunemediated and mainly intestinal process caused by the ingestion of wheat barley rye and derivatives that appears in genetically predisposed people of all ages cd is not only a gastrointestinal disease because it may affect several organs and cause an extensive variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms and most importantly it may often be completely asymptomatic added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers  antitissue transglutaminase tg2 are not always present 22 and many people with coeliac may have minor mucosal lesions without atrophy of the intestinal villi 23cd affects approximately 12 of the general population all over the world 24 and is on the increase 25 but most cases remain unrecognized undiagnosed and untreated exposing patients to the risk of longterm complications 26 27 people may suffer severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years before a proper diagnosis is achieved 28 untreated cd may cause malabsorption reduced quality of life iron deficiency osteoporosis obstetric complications  stillbirth intrauterine growth restriction preterm birth low birthweight and small for gestational age  29 an increased risk of intestinal lymphomas and greater mortality 30 cd is associated with some autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1 thyroiditis 31 gluten ataxia psoriasis vitiligo autoimmune hepatitis dermatitis herpetiformis primary sclerosing cholangitis and more 31cd with “classic symptoms” which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhoea and abdominal distention malabsorption loss of appetite and impaired growth is currently the least common presentation form of the disease and affects predominantly to small children generally younger than two years of age 26 28cd with “nonclassic symptoms” is the most common clinical type and occurs in older children over 2 years old adolescents and adults 28 it is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of nonintestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body and very frequently may be completely asymptomatic 26 both in children at least in 43 of the cases 32 and adults 26following a lifelong glutenfree diet is the only medicallyaccepted treatment for people with coeliac disease 16 33noncoeliac gluten sensitivity  editmain article nonceliac gluten sensitivity noncoeliac gluten sensitivity ncgs is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a glutenfree diet after coeliac disease and wheat allergy are excluded 34 35 people with ncgs may develop gastrointestinal symptoms which resemble those of irritable bowel syndrome ibs 36 37 or a variety of nongastrointestinal symptoms 20 38 39gastrointestinal symptoms may include any of the following abdominal pain bloating bowel habit abnormalities either diarrhea or constipation  20 39 nausea aerophagia gastroesophageal reflux disease and aphthous stomatitis 38 39 a range of extraintestinal symptoms said to be the only manifestation of ncgs in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms 20 38 39 have been suggested but remain controversial 30 40 these include headache migraine foggy mind fatigue fibromyalgia 40 41 joint and muscle pain leg or arm numbness tingling of the extremities dermatitis  eczema or skin rash  atopic disorders such as asthma rhinitis other allergies depression anxiety irondeficiency anemia folate deficiency or autoimmune diseases 20 38 39 40 ncgs has also been controversially implicated in some neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia eating disorders autism peripheral neuropathy ataxia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd 20 30 38 39 40 above 20 of people with ncgs have ig emediated allergy to one or more inhalants foods or metals among which most common are mites graminaceae parietaria cat or dog hair shellfish and nickel 20 approximately 35 of people with ncgs suffer other food intolerances mainly lactose intolerance 40the pathogenesis of ncgs is not yet well understood it was hypothesized that gluten as with coeliac disease is the cause of ncgs 38 much recent research on ncgs has aimed at determining which agents trigger a response in people with ncgs to which extent gluten fodmaps atis plantderived proteins present in glutencontaining cereals and gluten or wheat germ agglutinin are involved 39 40 for these reasons ncgs is a controversial syndrome 42 and some authors still question it 43 in a 2013 doubleblind placebocontrolled trial dbpc by biesiekierski et al in a few people with irritable bowel syndrome ibs the authors found no difference between gluten or placebo groups and the concept of ncgs as a syndrome was questioned nevertheless this study seems to have design errors and an incorrect selection of participants which could have masked the true effect of gluten reintroduction 27 40 in a review of may 2015 published in gastroenterology fasano et al conclude that besides gluten atis and fodmaps present in gluten wheat barley rye and their derivatives play a role in the development of ncgs symptoms atis which resist proteolytic digestion may be the inducers of innate immunity in people with coeliac disease or ncgs fodmaps cause mild wheat intolerance at most which is mainly limited to gastrointestinal symptoms 38after exclusion of coeliac disease and wheat allergy 44 the subsequent step for diagnosis and treatment of ncgs is to start a strict glutenfree diet to assess if symptoms improve or resolve completely this may occur within days to weeks of starting a gfd but improvement may also be due to a nonspecific placebo response 45 recommendations may resemble those for coeliac disease for the diet to be strict and maintained with no transgression 20 the degree of gluten cross contamination tolerated by people with ncgs is not clear but there is some evidence that they can present with symptoms even after consumption of small amounts 20 it is not yet known whether ncgs is a permanent or a transient condition 20 42 a trial of gluten reintroduction to observe any reaction after 1–2 years of strict glutenfree diet might be performed 20a subgroup of people with ncgs may not improve by eating commercially available glutenfree products which are usually rich of preservatives and additives because chemical additives such as sulphites glutamates nitrates and benzoates might have a role in evoking functional gastrointestinal symptoms of ncgs these people may benefit from a diet with a low content of preservatives and additives 46ncgs which is possibly immunemediated now appears to be more common than coeliac disease 47 with prevalence rates between 05–13 in the general population 48wheat allergy  editmain article wheat allergy people can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a wheat allergy 27 gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of coeliac disease and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms wheat allergy has a fast onset from minutes to hours after the consumption of food containing wheat and could be anaphylaxis 22 49the management of wheat allergy consists of complete withdrawal of any food containing wheat and other glutencontaining cereals 8 49 nevertheless some people with wheat allergy can tolerate barley rye or oats 50gluten ataxia  edita male with gluten ataxia previous situation and evolution after 3 months of glutenfree diet gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten 51 with gluten ataxia damage takes place in the cerebellum the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking speaking and swallowing with loss of purkinje cells people with gluten ataxia usually present gait abnormality or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs gazeevoked nystagmus and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common myoclonus palatal tremor and opsoclonusmyoclonus may also appear 52early diagnosis and treatment with a glutenfree diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible 52 53gluten ataxia accounts for 40 of ataxias of unknown origin and 15 of all ataxias 52 54 less than 10 of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom yet about 40 have intestinal damage 52as a fad diet  editsince the beginning of the 21st century the glutenfree diet has become the most popular trendy fad diet in the united states and other countries 38 clinicians worldwide have been challenged by an increasing number of people who do not have coeliac disease nor wheat allergy with digestive or extradigestive symptoms which improved removing wheat  gluten from the diet many of these persons began a glutenfree diet on their own without having been previously evaluated 55 56 another reason that contributed to this trend was the publication of several books that demonize gluten and point to it as a cause of type 2 diabetes weight gain and obesity and a broad list of diseases ranging from depression and anxiety to arthritis and autism 57 58 the book that has had the most impact is grain brain the surprising truth about wheat carbs and sugar  your brains silent killers by the american neurologist david perlmutter published on september 2013 57 another book that has had great impact is wheat belly lose the wheat lose the weight and find your path back to health by the cardiologist william davis which refers to wheat as a chronic poison and became a new york times bestseller within a month of publication in 2011 59 the glutenfree diet has been advocated and followed by many celebrities to lose weight such as miley cyrus gwyneth paltrow and kourtney kardashian and are used by some professional athletes who believe the diet can improve energy and health 60 61 62 63 it became popular in usa as the popularity of lowcarbohydrate diets faded 64estimates suggest that in 2014 30 of people in usa and australia were consuming glutenfree foods with a growing number calculated from surveys that by 2016 approximately 100 million americans would consume glutenfree products 38 57 65 data from a 2015 nielsen survey of 30000 adults in 60 countries around the world conclude that 21 of people prefer to buy glutenfree foods being the highest interest among the younger generations 66 in usa it was estimated that more than half of people who buy foods labeled glutenfree do not have a clear reaction to gluten and they do so because they think it will help them lose weight because they seem to feel better or because they mistakenly believe they are sensitive to gluten 67 although gluten is highly immunologically reactive and humans appear not to have evolved to digest it well a glutenfree diet is not a healthier option for the general population other than people suffering from glutenrelated disorders or other associated conditions which improve with a glutenfree diet in some cases such as irritable bowel syndrome and certain autoimmune and neurological disorders 12 68 69 there is no published experimental evidence to support that the glutenfree diet contributes to weight loss 69in a review of may 2015 published in gastroenterology fasano et al conclude that although there is an evident fad component to the recent rise in popularity of the glutenfree diet there is also growing and unquestionable evidence of the existence of noncoeliac gluten sensitivity 70the popularity of the glutenfree diet is hurting people who actually need to eliminate gluten due to medical reasons the servers are issuing judgments believing that it is simply a fad which is leading to them not taking the necessary precautions in the handling of the food to avoid gluten crosscontamination in other words the customers who order glutenfree meals washed down with a glutenfilled beer are essentially making a mockery of a serious issue 71 even many professionals in the medical field think that the glutenfree diet is just a fad 68 on the other hand the popularity of the glutenfree diet has increased the availability of commercial glutenfree replacement products and glutenfree grains 69glutenfree commercial replacement products such as glutenfree cakes are more expensive than their glutencontaining counterparts so their purchase adds a financial burden 28 they are also typically higher in calories fat and sugar and lower in dietary fiber 64 in less developed countries wheat can represent an important source of protein since it is a substantial part of the diet in the form of bread noodles bulgur couscous and other products 16 72healthcare professionals recommend against undertaking a glutenfree diet as a form of selfdiagnosis 73 because tests for coeliac disease are reliable only if the person has been consuming gluten recently there is a consensus in the medical community that people should consult a physician before going on a glutenfree diet so that a medical professional can accurately test for coeliac disease or any other gluteninduced health issues 74although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism there is no good evidence that a glutenfree diet is of benefit in reducing the symptoms of autism 13 14 15eating glutenfree  editquinoa is a pseudocereal that is glutenfree glutenfree bread made of a mixture of flours like buckwheat flour tapioca flour millet flour and psyllium seed husks special flour mixes can be bought for breadmaking purposes a glutenfree diet is a diet that strictly excludes gluten proteins present in wheat and all wheat varieties such as spelt and kamut  barley rye oat and derivatives of these grains such as malt and triticale and foods that may include them or shared transportation or processing facilities with them 1 17 the inclusion of oats in a glutenfree diet remains controversial 1 oat toxicity in people with glutenrelated disorders depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different among oat varieties 4 3 furthermore oats are frequently crosscontaminated with the other glutencontaining cereals 4 pure oat labelled as pure oat or glutenfree oat 2 refers to oats uncontaminated with any of the other glutencontaining cereals 3 some cultivars of pure oat could be a safe part of a glutenfree diet requiring knowledge of the oat variety used in food products for a glutenfree diet 3 nevertheless the longterm effects of pure oats consumption are still unclear 75 and further studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations on their inclusion in the glutenfree diet 5other grains although glutenfree in themselves may contain gluten by crosscontamination with glutencontaining cereals during grain harvesting transporting milling storing processing handling or cooking 76 77processed foods commonly contain gluten as an additive as emulsifiers thickeners gelling agents fillers and coatings so they would need specific labeling unexpected sources of gluten are among others processed meat vegetarian meat substitutes reconstituted seafood stuffings butter seasonings marinades dressings confectionary candies and ice cream 1gluten free rice flour cross contamination in the home is also a consideration for those who suffer glutenrelated disorders 21 10 there can be many sources of cross contamination as for example when family members prepare glutenfree and glutencontaining foods on the same surfaces counter tops tables etc or share utensils that have not been cleaned after being used to prepare glutencontaining foods cutting boards colanders cutlery etc  kitchen equipment toaster cupboards etc or certain packaged foods butter peanut butter etc 10medications and dietary supplements are made using excipients that may contain gluten 78the glutenfree diet includes naturally glutenfree food such as meat fish seafood eggs milk and dairy products nuts legumes fruit vegetables potatoes pseudocereals in particular amaranth buckwheat chia seed quinoa  only certain cereal grains  corn rice sorghum  minor cereals including fonio jobs tears millet teff called minor cereals as they are less common and are only grown in a few small regions of the world 17 some other plant products  arrowroot mesquite flour 79 sago 80 tapioca 80 and products made from these glutenfree foods risks  editan unbalanced selection of food and an incorrect choice of glutenfree replacement products may lead to nutritional deficiencies replacing flour from wheat or other glutencontaining cereals with glutenfree flours in commercial products may lead to a lower intake of important nutrients such as iron and b vitamins and a higher intake of sugars and saturated fats some glutenfree commercial replacement products are not enriched or fortified as their glutencontaining counterparts and often have greater lipid  carbohydrate content children especially often overconsume these products such as snacks and biscuits these nutritional complications can be prevented by a correct dietary education 4pseudocereals  quinoa amaranth and buckwheat and some minor cereals are healthy alternatives to these prepared products and have higher biological and nutritional value 4 16 advances towards higher nutritioncontent glutenfree bakery products improved for example in terms of fiber content and glycemic index have been made by using not exclusively corn starch or other starches to substitute for flour in this aim for example the dietary fiber inulin which acts as a prebiotic 81 or quinoa or amaranth wholemeal have been as substitute for part of the flour such substitution has been found to also yield improved crust and texture of bread 82 it is recommended that anyone embarking on a glutenfree diet check with a registered dietitian to make sure they are getting the required amount of key nutrients like iron calcium fiber thiamin riboflavin niacin and folate vitamins often contain gluten as a binding agent experts have advised that it is important to always read the content label of any product that is intended to be swallowed 83up to 30 of people with known coeliac disease often continue having or redeveloping symptoms 10 84 also a lack of symptoms or negative blood antibodies levels are not reliable indicators of intestinal recuperation several studies show an incomplete recovery of small bowel despite a strict glutenfree diet and about 79 of such people have persistent villous atrophy 10 this lack of recovery is mainly caused by inadvertent exposure to gluten 10 84 people with poor basic education and understanding of the glutenfree diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet but are making regular errors 11 10 in addition some people often deliberately continue eating gluten because of limited availability inferior taste higher price and inadequate labelling of glutenfree products poor compliance with the regimen is also influenced by age at diagnosis adolescents ignorance of the consequences of the lack of a strict treatment and certain psychological factors 10 ongoing gluten intake can cause severe disease complications such as various types of cancers both intestinal and extraintestinal and osteoporosis 10 84regulation and labels  editthe term glutenfree is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence 19 the exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial a 2008 systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg 10 ppm of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities although it noted that few reliable studies had been done 19regulation of the label glutenfree varies by country most countries derive key provisions of their glutenfree labeling regulations from the codex alimentarius international standards for food labeling as a standard relating to the labeling of products as glutenfree it only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten 85 glutenfree is defined as 20 ppm  20 mgkg or less it categorizes glutenfree food as food that is glutenfree by composition food that has become glutenfree through special processing reduced gluten content food which includes food products with between 20 and 100 ppm of gluten reduced gluten content is left up to individual nations to more specifically define the codex standard suggests the enzymelinked immunoassay elisa r5 mendez method for indicating the presence of gluten but allows for other relevant methods such as dna the codex standard specifies that the glutenfree claim must appear in the immediate proximity of the name of the product to ensure visibility there is no general agreement on the analytical method used to measure gluten in ingredients and food products 86 the elisa method was designed to detect wgliadins but it suffered from the setback that it lacked sensitivity for barley prolamins 87 the use of highly sensitive assays is mandatory to certify glutenfree food products the european union world health organization and codex alimentarius require reliable measurement of the wheat prolamins gliadins rather than allwheat proteins 88australia  editthe australian government recommends 89 thatfood labeled glutenfree include no detectable gluten 3ppm 90 oats or their products cereals containing gluten that have been malted or their productsfood

april 2016 the declaration of the possibility of crosscontamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives but the good manufacturing practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts 92 when a product contains the warning of crosscontamination with wheat rye barley oats and their hybridised strains the warning contains gluten is mandatory the law does not establish a gluten threshold for the declaration of its absence 91canada  edithealth canada considers that foods containing levels of gluten not exceeding 20 ppm as a result of contamination meet the health and safety intent of section b24018 of the food and drug regulations when a glutenfree claim is made 93 any intentionally added gluten even at low levels must be declared on the packaging and a glutenfree claim would be considered false and misleading labels for all food products sold in canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 10 ppm 94european union  editthe eu european commission delineates 95 the categories asglutenfree 20 ppm or less of

gluten in causing ncgs recent reports have indicated that gluten might not be the cause of ncgs and some investigators still question whether ncgs as a real clinical entity  cereals such as wheat and rye when consumed in normal quantities are only minor sources of fodmaps in the daily diet table 1 therefore glutencontaining grains are not likely to induce ibs exclusively via fodmaps in contrast there is growing evidence that other proteins that are unique to glutencontaining cereals can elicit an innate immune response that leads to ncgs raising a nomenclature issue for this reason wheat sensitivity rather than gluten sensitivity seems to be a more appropriate term keeping in mind that other glutencontaining grains such as barley and rye also can trigger the symptoms mansueto pasquale
