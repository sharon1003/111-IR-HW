editthe price of assets such as stocks is set by supply and demand by definition the market balances buyers and sellers so its impossible to literally have more buyers than sellers or vice versa although that is a common expression for a surge in demand the buyers will increase the price they are willing to pay while the sellers will increase the price they wish to receive for a surge in supply the opposite happens supply and demand are created when investors shift allocation of investment between asset types for example at one time investors may move money from government bonds to tech stocks at another time they may move money from tech stocks to government bonds in each case this will affect the price of both types of assets generally investors try to follow a buylow sellhigh strategy but often mistakenly end up buying high and selling low 19 contrarian investors and traders attempt to fade the investors actions buy when they are selling sell when they are buying a time when most investors are selling stocks is known as distribution while a time when most investors are buying stocks is known as accumulation according to standard theory a decrease in price will result in less supply and more demand while an increase in price will do the opposite this works well for most assets but it often works in reverse for stocks due to the mistake many investors make of buying high in a state of euphoria and selling low in a state of fear or panic as a result of the herding instinct in case an increase in price causes an increase in demand or a decrease in price causes an increase in supply this destroys the expected negative feedback loop and prices will be unstable 20 this can be seen in a bubble or crash investor sentiment  editinvestor sentiment is a contrarian
