science biology molecular biology  dnaq what is the main function of ribosomes a quick answer ribosomes are a type of organelle found in every cell and their main function is to synthesize proteins for use throughout the cell in the ribosomes individual amino acids are arranged into long protein chains according to the sequence of m rna or messenger rna it is the ribosomes job to read the sequence of m rna and translate it into the correct sequence of amino acids for each protein that must be made continue reading keep learning what is the function of trna where are proteins made in a cell what does a palisade cell do credit laguna design oxford scientific getty images full answer the process by which ribosomes make protein calls for several steps first the m rna is made in the nucleus of the cell and sent to the ribosome the m rna then combines with the ribosomes subunits which themselves are made of protein and is interpreted into a new sequence known as t rna or transfer rna each nucleic acid of the t rna chain is bound to an amino acid once the t rna chain is complete the ribosome pulls the amino acids off of the t rna and connects them into a long protein chain all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells contain ribosomes though those found in eukaryotic cells are larger some ribosomes known as free ribosomes are found directly in the cytosol others are bound to the cells endoplasmic reticulum which makes it easier to transport their finished products throughout the cell ribosomes are also found in mitochondria and chloroplasts and they serve the same function  to make proteins for these organelles to use learn more about molecular biology  dnasources facstaffbucknelledu biology4kidscom related questions q what part of the cell makes proteins a the ribosomes make proteins in the cell cytoplasmic granules that are rich in ribonucleic acid or rna compose ribosomes proteins are made continuously  full answer filed under cells q which features are common to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells a prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells have multiple features in common including the use of dna to code for proteins rna for translation into proteins a full answer filed under cells q what is a cell organelle a an organelle is a unique part of a cell that has a specific function the term is a combination of the word organum which means instrument or engine an full answer filed under cells q how are enzymes made a enzymes are a type of protein and like other proteins they are made by the translation of the genetic code into a particular sequence of amino acids by r full answer filed under biology you may also like q what is the human genome q what are two functions of a virus protein coat q what is the main function of nucleic acids q what is the gamete that contains the genes contributed by the mother q who is the father of genetics q what are the mrna codons for phenylalanine
