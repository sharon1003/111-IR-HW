variables and scales of measurement variables a variable is simply anything that varies anything that assumes different values or categories for example sex varies because there is more than one category or classification female and male race is a variable because there is more than one category asian black hispanic etc age is a variable because there is more than one category 1 year 2 years 3 years etc conversely a constant is anything that does not vary or take different values or categories for example everyone participating in this course is a student so that is not a variable since it does not vary since it has only one category as another example consider a group of white females with this group neither race nor sex varies so race and sex are constants for these people exercise identifying variables in the following statements identify the variables what is the relation between intelligence and achievement do students learn more from a supportive teacher or a nonsupportive teacher are students aged 55 and older more likely to drop out of college than students of ages between 30 and 40 what is the relationship between grade point average and dropping out of high school how do three counseling techniques—rationalemotive gestalt and nocounseling—differ in their effectiveness in decreasing test anxiety in high school juniors what is the relationship among leadership skills intelligence and achievement motivation of high school seniors answers intelligence and achievement level of support with two categories supportnonsupport and student learning age with two categories 55 and over 30 to 40 and dropping out of college also with two categories in or out grade point average and dropping out of high school two categories in or out counseling techniques with three categories rationalemotive gestalt and nocounseling and test anxiety leadership skills intelligence and achievement motivation scales of measurement measurement is the process of assigning labels to categories of variables categories of variables carry different properties which are identified below if one can only identify categories then that variable is referred to as a nominal variable if the categories of a variable can be ranked such as from highest to lowest or from most to least or from best to worst then that variable is said to be ordinal  if the categories can be ranked and if they also represent equal intervals then the variable is said to be interval equal interval means that the difference between two successive categories are the same for example temperature measured with fahrenheit has equal intervals that is the difference between temperatures of 30 and 31 degrees is 1 degree and the difference between 100 and 101 degrees is 1 degree no matter where on the scale that 1 degree is located that 1 degree represents the same amount of heat similarly when using a ruler to measure the length of something the difference between 2 and 3 inches is 1 inch and the difference between 10 and 11 inches is 1 inch  no matter where on the ruler that 1 inch lies it still represents the same amount of distance so this indicates equal intervals it is difficult to provide examples of true interval variables since the assumption of interval is that no true zero point no beginning or ending point exists few variables meet this criterion except in a theoretical sense the last scale is ratio this is just like interval except that a variable on the ratio scale has a true zero pointa beginning or ending point for example when timing someone on a task the length of time required to complete the task is a ratio measure since there was a starting and ending point in the measurement for most purposes especially in education the distinction between interval and ratio is not important in fact it is difficult to find examples of interval or ratio variables in education below is a table that specifies the criteria that distinguishes the four scales of measurement and the following table provides examples for each scale scales criteria nominal categories ordinal categories rank interval categories rank equal interval ratio categories

abstract with no ending or beginningratio age weight height time to complete a task classification of variables in research it is often important to distinguish variables by the supposed or theoretical function they play for example if one states that a childs intelligence level influences the childs academic achievement in school then the variable intelligence thought to have some impact some effect on academic performance in school in this example intelligence is called the independent variable and academic achievement is the dependent variable the logic here holds that achievement depends to some degree upon intelligence hence it is called a dependent variable since intelligence does not depend upon achievement intelligence in this example is referred to as the independent variable here are two methods for identify8ing independent variables iv and dependent variables dv first think in terms of chronological sequencein terms of the time order which variable comes first ones sex or ones achievement in school most would answer that one is born with a given sex female or male so it naturally precedes achievement in school the variable that comes first in the time order is the iv and the variable that comes afterwards is the dv a second method for identifying the ivs and dvs is the ask yourself about the notion of causality that is if one does this with variable a then what happens to variable b for example if one could increase intelligence then achievement in school may result but if one increased achievement school would this have any logical impact on ones intelligence in this example intelligence is the iv because it can affect achievement in school and achievement is the dv because it is unlikely to affect intelligence alternative labels for iv are cause and predictor and other labels for the dv are effect and criterion often it can be difficult to properly identify whether a variable is nominal ordinal interval or ratio a simpler approach is to identify variables as either qualitative or categorical or quantitative or continuous  a qualitativecategorical variable is one that has categories that are not rankedie a nominal variable all other variables have categories that can be ranked therefore the categories differ by degree these variables are quantitative or continuous and are represented by the ordinal interval and ratio scales for simplicity variables that have only two categories even if they can be ranked will be referred to as qualitative variables since this will be important later when determining which statistical tests may be used for analysis practice exercise here is a practice exercise to help you distinguish between iv and dvs using the same practice exercise for ivs and dvs also determine whether each iv and dv is qualitative or quantitative to make these determinations sometimes there will not be enough information about the measurement processhow the variables were actually measured in these cases it is important to consider the variable carefully to determine if the variable logically has ranked categories or not if it appears to have ranked categories then classify the variable as quantitative see illustrated examples in the practice exercise for further clarification of this issue supplemental reading this site by t e le vere of n c state university
