juvenile more anonymous the desjardins sailfin tang or red sea sailfin tang is a delightful tang enjoyed for its wonderful patterning and its attractive colorationcontents habitat natural geographic location status description lengthdiameter of fish maintenance difficulty foods maintenance aquarium parameters social behaviors sex sexual differences breedingreproduction availability like all seven of the sailfin tang species when the fins of the desjardins sailfin tang are fully extended its height is about the same as its length giving it a diskshaped appearance it is hard to tell the difference between this sailfin tang and its very similar relative the pacific sailfin tang z veliferum when they are both young however the adult desjardins sailfin tang will change stripes for spots and lightens in color while the adult pacific sailfin tang retains its juvenile coloration the desjardins will also get quite big in fact these two fish are the largest of the seven zebrasoma species when acquired as a juvenile which is what is most available from a marine supplier it is an easy tang to keep adult specimen photo courtesy john rice the desjardins sailfin tang or red sea sailfin tang makes a wonderful addition to the marine aquarium especially a large community aquarium it is relatively peaceful and will get along with a wide variety of like minded tank mates but should be added last keep it singly as it does not mix with others of its same genus bold in nature it will quickly adapt to aquarium fare and is easy to care for once it is settled one of the hardiest of the surgeonfish it is highly disease resistant and responds well to treatment there are some things that the zebrasoma species have in common with all the surgeonfish and tangs they like plenty of water movement to provide an oxygen rich environment rather than a placid aquarium they are quick and agile swimmers so will need lots of swimming space along with plenty of crevices among corals rocks to retreat into and for sleeping at night being voracious algae eaters an aquarium with good algae growth will provide for their nutritional needs as well as making them excellent candidates for a reef

desjardinii report broken video video of a juvenile tang being fed in captivity the desjardins sailfin tang is the more sought after of the two true sailfin tangs from this genus this tang is one of two from the zebrasoma genus that truly exhibit a sailfin quality since their dorsal and anal fins are much deeper than other species these grow very large reaching 16 as adults and reaching almost 13 in their first 5 years of life this dictates the need for a 180 gallon tank that is at least 6 feet long to accommodate their tall body and fast swimming habits tangs live from 30 to 45 years choat

sailfin tangs coloring it is quite beautiful blacks grays yellows and white coloring the tail fin has the spotting as you can see which sets it apart from the sailfin tang zebrasoma velifer who usually has a yellow tail fin as an adult these are the largest growers in the zebrasoma family reaching 16 in length and needing a 180 gallon tank or larger as you can see in the picture the desjardins sailfin tang puts up his sails when it is startled when housing with other tangs they will develop behavioral problems as they grow if the tank is not hundreds of gallons dr jungles you tube channel  marine sailfin tang loves cleaning days zebrasoma veliferum report broken video sub adult in captivity this tang will grow to 157 once it is full grown however the first 4 or 5 years of their life this means they will be about 125 by then but will need a tank that is at least 180 gallons they are similar to the desjardini or indian ocean sailfin tang however they do not have the bright spotting and more colorful striping feed plenty of good marine algae and monitor stony and soft corals feed them 3 times a day with an algae sheet for them to munch on in between meals dr

location the desjardins sailfin tang also known as the red sea sailfin tang or indian sailfin surgeonfish was described by bennett in 1836 they are found in the western indian ocean and red sea east to india java and cocoskeeling islands though not christmas island in their natural habitat they are found at depths between 7 to 98 feet 2  30 meters in lagoons and in both seaward and shelter reefs adults are seen in pairs or small groups in rocky regions while the juveniles are seen singly between rocks and corals in areas with strong currents commonly among staghorn corals status these fish are not listed on the iucn red list description the desjardins sailfin tang has a disk like shaped body similar to all surgeonfish but with giant dorsal and anal fins that are approximately the same size as its body when the fins of the sailfin tangs are fully extended the total height of these fish is about the same as the length all the sailfin tangs have extended snouts juvenile specimen the body has a beautiful striped patterning narrow lines of yellows blacks and whites the striping runs vertically on the upper 12 to 23s of the body and in horizontal arches on the anal and dorsal fins following the line of the outer edge of these fins there are also two broader dark vertical bands one running through the eye and a second just behind it on the lower portion of the body extending onto the anal fin are yellow or orangish spots and light spots on the caudal fin the overall coloration of the juvenile is darker often without the spotting on each side of the caudal peduncle is a single spine or scalpel used for defense or dominance when not in use the spine is folded down into a groove caution needs to be exercised when handling surgeonfish as a cut from its scalpel can cause discoloration and swelling of the skin with a high risk of infection the pain lasts for hours then still ends up having a dull ache it is very similar to the pacific sailfin tang z veliferum when they are both young however the adult desjardins sailfin tang will change stripes for spots and lightens in color while the adult pacific sailfin tang retains its juvenile coloration there are some authors that regard the desjardins as a variant of the sailfin tang lengthdiameter of fish adults reach up to 157 inches 40 cm and is one of the largest of the zebrasoma genus maintenance difficulty the desjardins sailfin tang is a great addition to the marine aquarium and easy to keep though juveniles seem to acclimate best as adults will often not adapt to the aquarium environment it can handle a wide range of water parameters however it will do best in an environment that provides consistency not only in water conditions and quality but also in decor and fellow inhabitants it can be housed in a fish only tank or in a reef environment as it will not harm corals or invertebrates it is highly disease resistant and responds well to treatment when ill there are some acanthuridae members that are delicate and will require more specific care but most will respond well if you employ a few technical considerations all surgeonfish need an aquarium with plenty of aeration a strong current will help to provide good oxygenation provide plenty of space especially for adult specimens along with lots of rocks corals with crevices for retreating and for sleeping this decor will also lend itself to algae growth which surgeonfish enjoy grazing on making them a valuable addition to a reef environment surgeonfish and tangs are continuous feeders and they need to be provided a proper diet they are susceptible to nutritional disorders which may cause color loss and lld lateral line disease supplementing their diet with the addition of vitamin c to their food or adding a vitamin supplement directly to their water can help to avoid or aid in reducing these ailments they are also susceptible to bacteria resulting from organic buildup which deteriorates water quality consequently they will need vigorous filtration protein skimming and regular small water changes many of the acanthuridae members are very colorful active and attractive to aquarists but they do not produce as much skin mucus on their bodies as other fish and can be susceptible to diseases such as marine ich and marine velvet surgeonfish are definitely a candidate for quarantine when you first receive them they can be treated successfully with medical care or copper drugs but because they have an important microfauna in their digestive system prolonged or continuous use of a copper treatment is not advisable in the wild a cleaner wrasse  labroides sp will help them by taking parasites from their bodies however these wrasses are extremely difficult to sustain in captivity alternative fish such as neon gobies  gobiosoma sp or cleaner shrimp can help them by providing this cleaning service in the home aquarium foods the desjardins sailfin tang are primarily herbivores in the wild they feed exclusively on filamentous algae which they scrape from hard surfaces this genus can store fat in their body cavities so may go through periods of nonfeeding in the aquarium the majority of their intake will be vegetable matter but they do need some meaty foods as well provide lots of marine algae prepared frozen formulas containing algae or spirulina frozen brine and mysid shrimp and flake foods japanese nori or other seaweed can be adhered to the aquarium glass with a vegetable clip an occasional live rock with micro and macro organisms will be greatly appreciated culturing macro algae like chaetomorphia in the tank is also a great idea feed 3 times a day in smaller amounts instead of a large quantity once a day as continuous grazers they will benefit from this and it will also keep the water quality higher over a longer period of time providing a vitamin supplement including vitamin c can help provide for their nutritional needs and vitamin c can help prevent or reduce lateral line erosion lle this can be done by soaking dried pellets with liquid vitamins adding vitamins to the food or adding a liquid vitamin into the water it is also said that pellets soaked in garlic may help fend off marine ich some hobbyists also report success with supplemental foods such as previously boiled or frozen zucchini broccoli spinach and leaf lettuce maintenance a quick and agile swimmer it will spend a good deal of its time in the open water and moving in and out of crevices frequent water changes are not necessary rather normal water changes at 10 biweekly or 20 monthly are fine for more information see marine aquarium basics maintenance aquarium parameters all surgeonfish tangs are quick agile swimmers and need lots of open areas to feel secure they also need rocks corals with many nooks and crannies to hide in and to wedge themselves into at night for sleeping this fish will not bother corals or inverts but it will graze on algae so it highly useful in a reef environment however keep corals glued down as their quick speeds may topple a coral or two they thrive well in tanks with algae growth minimum tank lengthsize a minimum 75 gallon 284 liters for a small juvenile a 125 gallon 473 liters for an adult light recommended light levels it nature it is found in sunlit areas it can be kept under normal lighting conditions in the aquarium but can also be kept under very bright light as long as some dimly lit spaces are provided temperature this species lives in tropical areas temperatures between 74 82Â° f 23  28Â° c will serve them well water movement weak moderate strong all surgeonfish and tangs thrive with good water movement need lots of oxygen and love to have the water rushing over their gills at times provide strong movement in at least one area of the tank water region top middle bottom it will spend time in the open water and darting in and out of the rocks corals it will sleep in crevices at night social behaviors the great thing about the desjardins sailfin tang is that they are fine in a reef setting with inverts and corals and they will graze on the algae they can also be kept in a fish only community tank with peaceful tank mates this fish is mild tempered and gets along with most fish except others of their own genus surgeonfish and tangs can be territorial sometimes just with their own kind and sometimes with other species introducing a new surgeonfish into an aquarium that already houses one or more is usually a problem it is best to initially introduce several species together rather than adding a new one later on though a large aquarium can help alleviate many problems be aware of the social behaviors of any species you are considering to prevent compatibility problems you may successfully pair this tang with different genus as long as there are no similarities one example of mixing genus in a large tank without incident would be to house a naso tang yellow tang and a hippo tang adding them together initially works best when adding a new member to an established group changing the rock work will often alleviate any aggression to the new guy a little chasing will occur but usually nothing detrimental sex sexual differences no sexual differences are noted for this species breedingreproduction some species of surgeonfish have spawned in public aquariums and there have been a few scattered reports of spawnings in home aquariums but regular spawnings and the rearing of the young has not yet been reported though the desjardins sailfin tang has not yet been bred in captivity this species has been observed in pair spawnings in the ocean as they may occasionally gather in large groups it is thought that they may group spawn in some areas for information on breeding and the
