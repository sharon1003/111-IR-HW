amortize or expense a trademark accounting tom sheppard  president at the sheppard group  aug 31 2013this isnt a question i have had to deal with n few years and it seems to have changed i am working with an early stage consumer products company that has established a brand for themselves in their industry in reviewing their books they are amortizing their trademark over 5 years i have talked to some cfo s who are expensing it upfront while i see some consumer product companies dont amortize or expense using asc350 since they are in the consumer market it is fair to say they will have future trademarks as well i am looking for guidance on best practices here since there doesnt seem to be agreement on the treatment answers anonymous consultant  aug 13 2012im not a professional accountant that said im curious about the apparent death of the notion that matching revenue and expense is critical to the accurate determination of profitability thus your question is really how long will this trademark influence buyer behavior in the marketplace tide will probably last several more lifetimes intel inside something less kodachrome ought to be fully amortized by now in short its a judgement call and if a conference room full of cpas wants to debate the issue good for them make the call include a footnote explaining your reasoning and move on topic expert keith perry consulting cfo and business operations advisor growth accelerator  aug 13 2012tomasc350 ive only applied to acquired marks where you need to do a ppa and allocate the surplus if that is the case i would hold onto it and test it for impairment if it is a tax question i believe it runs as a section 197 intangible and you amortize it over 15 years if youve developed the mark yourselfin my first startup i bent over backwards to capitalize and hold pending impairment these costs this would have been before my first accounting classes so a very very long time ago now i expense it all for the following reasons 1 nobody wants to see it in your financials 2it is incredibly difficult to decide which expenses were marketing expense and which were truly applicable to the value of the mark 3 it creates work the 5 year amortization i dont getmy understanding is that your choices are 15 years for tax and impairment for financial reporting for example if i acquired the ibm mark for 1m that would stay on my books until the test showed that it was worth less than 1mamortizing it wouldnt make any sense at all topic expert regis quirin director of finance gibney anthony  flaherty llp  aug 13 2012there really is no wrong answer for your nonquestion but it creates confusion accounting is very direct about what you can and cant do but not in this situation you can choose whatever approach is better for your situation just be consistent ie whatever decision you make you will need to stick with simply stated your choices are as follows option 1  capitalize vs expense will result in higher profits resulting in higher taxes and option 2  expense vs capitalize will allow you to take the loss today resulting in lower taxes today valuation will be higher by capitalizing  which you may want if you are looking for bank financing but you also add a bunch of entries if you capitalize ie depreciation every month vs one and done topic expert wayne spivak president  cfo sbaconsultingcom  oct 12 2014observation bank financing on ip can be either a flaky in other words it depends on the bank the banker and the week or b very expensive why you try to get appraisals trying to prove its value19337 views topics accounting
