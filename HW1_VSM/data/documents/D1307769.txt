the southern united states oyster reefs in florida are found in nearshore areas and estuaries of both coasts but grow especially vigorously near estuarine river mouths where waters are brackish and less than 10 meters deep for example the apalachicola river in northern florida is a particularly productive area for oysters and supplies over 90 of the states annual oyster catch within the indian river lagoon oyster reefs may be found in the vicinity of spoil islands and impounded areas in addition to being commercially valuable oyster reefs serve a number of important ecological roles in coastal systems providing important habitat for a large number of species improving water quality stabilizing bottom areas and influencing water circulation patterns within estuaries oyster reefs are built primarily by the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica through successive reproduction and settlement of larvae onto existing reef structure oysters in florida spawn from late spring through the fall the planktonic larvae that develop require a hard substratum to settle upon in order to complete development to the juvenile stage and prefer to settle on the shells of other oysters thus over time continued settlement and subsequent growth of generations of oysters may form massive reef structures consisting of staggering numbers of individuals luntz 1960 estimated that 5895 oysters the equivalent of 45 bushels occurred within a single square yard of oyster reef as successive generations of oysters settle and grow reefs become highly complex with many structural irregularities and infoldings that provide a wealth of microhabitats for many different species of animals wells 1961 listed 303 different species utilizing oyster reef as habitat in north carolina common indian river lagoon species associated with oyster reefs include bivalves such as the hard clam  mercenaria mercenaria and bay scallop  argopecten irradians concentricus  space competitors such as the scorched mussel  brachidontes exustus  ribbed mussel  geukensia demissa  the jingle shell  anomia simplex  and barnacles of the balanus genus gastropod mollusks such as the conchs  melongena spp and strombas spp and rocksnails  thais spp  numerous sponge species flatworms polychaete worms amphipods isopods shrimp and fishes such as blennies gobies spadefish snappers drum and seatrout among others beyond providing smaller organisms with habitat oyster reefs also provide food to a wide variety of secondary consumers many species of fish prey upon oyster reef associates while others such as the black drum  pogonias cromis and cownosed ray  rhinoptera bonasus prey upon oysters themselves other species that utilize oyster reefs for foraging and feeding include the xanthid crabs also known as mud crabs swimming crabs of the genus callinectes  mollusks such as the thick lipped oyster drill  eupleura caudata  the sharprib drill  e sulcidentata  the atlantic oyster drill  urosalpinx cinerea  the tampa drill  u tampaensis  the knobbed whelk  busycon carica  the lighthire whelk  b contrarium  and the pear whelk  b spiratum pyruloides  flatworms such as oyster leeches  stylochus spp  boring sponges c liona spp  and annelid worms p olydora spp oyster reefs also contribute to improved water quality in areas where they occur oysters are filter feeders which strain microalgae suspended particulate organic matter and possibly dissolved organic matter from the water column over their gills in order to feed under optimal temperature and salinity conditions a single oyster may filter as much as 15 liters of water per hour up to 1500 times its body volume spread over an entire reef for an entire day the potential for oysters to improve water clarity is immense additionally since oysters are sessile and bioaccumulate some potential toxins and pollutants found in the water column they have been used to assess the environmental health of some areas overharvesting as well as persistent diseases such as msx and dermo have taken a devastating toll on many oyster populations along the east and gulf coasts in recent years oyster reef restoration has been a concern for resource managers all along the east coast of the united states but especially in areas where oyster harvesting has historically been commercially important in the late 1800s for example annual oyster harvests in the southeastern united states routinely topped 10 million pounds per year and peaked in 1908 when the harvest was nearly 20 million pounds however annual harvests since that time have declined steadily today annual harvests for oysters in the southeast averages approximately 3 million pounds per year in many areas efforts are underway to revitalize depleted oyster reefs and encourage growth of new reefs for example the florida department of agriculture has stockpiled calico scallop shells from processors and placed these on depleted oyster reefs from the spring through the fall spawning periods when larvae are most abundant in the water column oyster larvae having a preference for settling on shell material then attach themselves onto the newly placed shells and metamorphose to the juvenile stage these young oysters under optimal conditions will grow to marketable size in as little as 18  24 months a more detailed look at some emerging humaninduced threats
