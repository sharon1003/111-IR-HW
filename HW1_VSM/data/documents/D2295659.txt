prattthe age of reasonby thomas paine to my fellowcitizens of the united states of america i put the following work under your protection it contains myopinions upon religion you will do me the justice to remember that ihave always strenuously supported the right of every man to his ownopinion however different that opinion might be to mine he whodenies to another this right makes a slave of himself to hispresent opinion because he precludes himself the right of changingit the most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is reason i have never used any other and i trust i never shall your affectionate friend and fellowcitizenthomas paineluxembourg 8th pluvoisesecond year of the french republic one and indivisible january 27 o s 1794 part firstit has been my intention for several years past to publish mythoughts upon religion i am well aware of the difficulties thatattend the subject and from that consideration had reserved it toa more advanced period of life i intended it to be the lastoffering i should make to my fellowcitizens of all nations andthat at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to itcould not admit of a question even by those who might disapprovethe work the circumstance that has now taken place in france of the totalabolition of the whole national order of priesthood and of everythingappertaining to compulsive systems of religion and compulsivearticles of faith has not only precipitated my intention butrendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary lest in thegeneral wreck of superstition of false systems of government andfalse theology we lose sight of morality of humanity and of thetheology that is true as several of my colleagues and others of my fellowcitizens of france have given me the example of making their voluntary andindividual profession of faith i also will make mine and i do thiswith all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of mancommunicates with itself i believe in one god and no more and i hope for happiness beyond this life i believe in the equality of man and i believe that religiousduties consist in doing justice loving mercy and endeavoring to makeour fellowcreatures happy but lest it should be supposed that i believe in many otherthings in addition to these i shall in the progress of this workdeclare the things i do not believe and my reasons for notbelieving them i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church bythe roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church all national institutions of churches whether jewish christianor turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up toterrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believeotherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentallyfaithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or indisbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does notbelieve it is impossible to calculate the moral mischief if i may soexpress it that mental lying has produced in society when a manhas so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as tosubscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe hehas prepared himself for the commission of every other crime he takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain and in order to qualify himself for that trade he begins with a perjury can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this soon after i had published the pamphlet common sense in america i saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in thesystem of government would be followed by a revolution in the systemof religion the adulterous connection of church and state whereverit had taken place whether jewish christian or turkish had soeffectually prohibited by pains and penalties every discussion uponestablished creeds and upon first principles of religion thatuntil the system of government should be changed those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world but that whenever this should be done a revolution in the system of religion would follow human inventions and priestcraft would be detected and man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one god and no more every national church or religion has established itself bypretending some special mission from god communicated to certainindividuals the jews have their moses the christians their jesus christ their apostles and saints and the turks their mahomet asif the way to god was not open to every man alike each of those churches show certain books which they callrevelation or the word of god the jews say that their word of godwas given by god to moses face to face the christians say thattheir word of god came by divine inspiration and the turks saythat their word of god the koran was brought by an angel from heaven each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief and formy own part i disbelieve them all as it is necessary to affix right ideas to words i will before iproceed further into the subject offer some other observations on theword revelation revelation when applied to religion means something communicated immediately from god to man no one will deny or dispute the power of the almighty to make sucha communication if he pleases but admitting for the sake of a casethat something has been revealed to a certain person and not revealed to any other person it is revelation to that person only when he tells it to a second person a second to a third a third to a fourthand so on it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons it isrevelation to the first person only and hearsay to every other andconsequently they are not obliged to believe it it is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call anything arevelation that comes to us at secondhand either verbally or inwriting revelation is necessarily limited to the firstcommunication after this it is only an account of something whichthat person says was a revelation made to him and though he mayfind himself obliged to believe it it cannot be incumbent on me tobelieve it in the same manner for it was not a revelation made to meand i have only his word for it that it was made to him when moses told the children of israel that he received the twotables of the commandments from the hands of god they were notobliged to believe him because they had no other authority for itthan his telling them so and i have no other authority for it thansome historian telling me so the commandments carry no internalevidence of divinity with them they contain some good moral precepts such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator could produce himself without having recourse to supernaturalintervention it is however necessary to except the declaration which saysthat god visits the sins of the fathers upon the children it iscontrary to every principle of moral justice when i am told that the koran was written in heaven and brought to mahomet by an angel the account comes too near the same kind ofhearsay evidence and secondhand authority as the former i did notsee the angel myself and therefore i have a right not to believeit when also i am told that a woman called the virgin mary saidor gave out that she was with child without any cohabitation with aman and that her betrothed husband joseph said that an angel toldhim so i have a right to believe them or not such a circumstancerequired a much stronger evidence than their bare word for it butwe have not even this for neither joseph nor mary wrote any suchmatter themselves it is only reported by others that they saidso it is hearsay upon hearsay and i do not choose to rest my beliefupon such evidence it is however not difficult to account for the credit that wasgiven to the story of jesus christ being the son of god he was bornwhen the heathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in theworld and that mythology had prepared the people for the belief ofsuch a story almost all the extraordinary men that lived under theheathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods it was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have beencelestially begotten the intercourse of gods with women was then amatter of familiar opinion their jupiter according to theiraccounts had cohabited with hundreds the story therefore hadnothing in it either new wonderful or obscene it was conformable tothe opinions that then prevailed among the people called gentilesor mythologists and it was those people only that believed it the jews who had kept strictly to the belief of one god and no moreand who had always rejected the heathen mythology never creditedthe story it is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the christian church sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology adirect incorporation took place in the first instance by making thereputed founder to be celestially begotten the trinity of gods thatthen followed was no other than a reduction of the former pluralitywhich was about twenty or thirty thousand the statue of marysucceeded the statue of diana of ephesus the deification of heroeschanged into the canonization of saints the mythologists had gods foreverything the christian mythologists had saints for everythingthe church became as crowded with one as the pantheon had been with the other and rome was the place of both the christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient mythologistsaccommodated to the purposes of power and revenue and it yetremains to reason and philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud nothing that is here said can apply even with the most distantdisrespect to the real character of jesus christ he was a virtuousand an amiable man the morality that he preached and practised was of the most benevolent kind and though similar systems of morality had been preached by confucius and by some of the greek philosophers many years before by the quakers since and by many good men in all ages it has not been exceeded by any jesus christ wrote no account of himself of his birth parentageor any thing else not a line of what is called the new testament isof his own writing the history of him is altogether the work of otherpeople and as to the account given of his resurrection and ascensionit was the necessary counterpart to the story of his birth hishistorians having brought him into the world in a supernatural mannerwere obliged to take him out again in the same manner or the firstpart of the story must have fallen to the ground the wretched contrivance with which this latter part is toldexceeds every thing that went before it the first part that of themiraculous conception was not a thing that admitted of publicity andtherefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantagethat though they might not be credited they could not be detected they could not be expected to prove it because it was not one ofthose things that admitted of proof and it was impossible that theperson of whom it was told could prove it himself but the resurrection of a dead person from the grave and hisascension through the air is a thing very different as to theevidence it admits of to the invisible conception of a child in thewomb the resurrection and ascension supposing them to have takenplace admitted of public and ocular demonstration like that of theascension of a balloon or the sun at noonday to all jerusalem atleast a thing which everybody is required to believe requires thatthe proof and evidence of it should be equal to all and universaland as the public visibility of this last related act was the onlyevidence that could give sanction to the former part the whole ofit falls to the ground because that evidence never was given insteadof this a small number of persons not more than eight or nine areintroduced as proxies for the whole world to say they saw it and allthe rest of the world are called upon to believe it but it appearsthat thomas did not believe the resurrection and as they saywould not believe without having ocular and manual demonstrationhimself so neither will i and the reason is equally as good forme and for every other person as for thomas it is in vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter the story so far as relates to the supernatural part has everymark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the face of it who were the authors of it is as impossible for us now to know as it is for usto be assured that the books in which the account is related werewritten by the persons whose names they bear the best survivingevidence we now have respecting that affair is the jews they areregularly descended from the people who lived in the times thisresurrection and ascension is said to have happened and they sayit is not true it has long appeared to me a strange inconsistencyto cite the jews as a proof of the truth of the story it is justthe same as if a man were to say i will prove the truth of what ihave told you by producing the people who say it is false that such a person as jesus christ existed and that he wascrucified which was the mode of execution at that day are historicalrelations strictly within the limits of probability he preachedmost excellent morality and the equality of man but he preachedalso against the corruptions and avarice of the jewish priests andthis brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order ofpriesthood the accusation which those priests brought against him was that of sedition and conspiracy against the roman government to which the jews were then subject and tributary and it is not improbable that the roman government might have some secret apprehensions of the effects of his doctrine as well as the jewish priests neither is it improbable that jesus christ had in contemplation the delivery of the jewish nation from the bondage of the romans between the two however this virtuous reformer and revolutionist lost his life it is upon this plain narrative of facts together with anothercase i am going to mention that the christian mythologists callingthemselves the christian church have erected their fable whichfor absurdity and extravagance is not exceeded by anything that is tobe found in the mythology of the ancients the ancient mythologists tell us that the race of giants madewar against jupiter and that one of them threw a hundred rocksagainst him at one throw that jupiter defeated him with thunderand confined him afterward under mount etna and that every time the giant turns himself mount etna belches fire it is here easy to see that the circumstance of the mountain thatof its being a volcano suggested the idea of the fable and thatthe fable is made to fit and wind itself up with that circumstance the christian mythologists tell us that their satan made waragainst the almighty who defeated him and confined him afterwardnot under a mountain but in a pit it is here easy to see that thefirst fable suggested the idea of the second for the fable of jupiterand the giants was told many hundred years before that of satan thus far the ancient and the christian mythologists differ verylittle from each other but the latter have contrived to carry thematter much farther they have contrived to connect the fabulouspart of the story of jesus christ with the fable originating from mount etna and in order to make all the parts of the story tietogether they have taken to their aid the traditions of the jews forthe christian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythologyand partly from the jewish traditions the christian mythologists after having confined satan in apit were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of thefable he is then introduced into the garden of eden in the shapeof a snake or a serpent and in that shape he enters into familiarconversation with eve who is no way surprised to hear a snake talkand the issue of this teteatete is that he persuades her to eat anapple and the eating of that apple damns all mankind after giving satan this triumph over the whole creation one wouldhave supposed that the church mythologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to the pit or if they had not done this that they would have put a mountain upon him for they say that their faith can remove a mountain or have put him under a mountain as the former mythologists had done to prevent his getting again among the women and doing more mischief but instead of this they leave him at large without even obliging him to give his parole the secret of which is that they could not do without him and after being at the trouble of making him they bribed him to stay they promised him all the jews all the turks by anticipation ninetenths of the world beside and mahomet into the bargain after this who candoubt the bountifulness of the christian mythology having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven inwhich none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded put satan into the pit let him out again giving him a triumph over thewhole creation damned all mankind by the eating of an apple these christian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together they represent this virtuous and amiable man jesus christ to be atonce both god and man and also the son of god celestiallybegotten on purpose to be sacrificed because they say that eve inher longing had eaten an apple putting aside everything that might excite laughter by itsabsurdity or detestation by its profaneness and confiningourselves merely to an examination of the parts it is impossible toconceive a story more derogatory to the almighty more inconsistentwith his wisdom more contradictory to his power than this story is in order to make for it a foundation to rise upon the inventorswere under the necessity of giving to the being whom they call satan a power equally as great if not greater than they attribute tothe almighty they have not only given him the power of liberatinghimself from the pit after what they call his fall but they havemade that power increase afterward to infinity before this fallthey represent him only as an angel of limited existence as theyrepresent the rest after his fall he becomes by their accountomnipresent he exists everywhere and at the same time he occupies the whole immensity of space not content with this deification of satan they represent himas defeating by stratagem in the shape of an animal of the creationall the power and wisdom of the almighty they represent him as having compelled the almighty to the direct necessity either ofsurrendering the whole of the creation to the government andsovereignty of this satan or of capitulating for its redemption bycoming down upon earth and exhibiting himself upon a cross in theshape of a man had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way that ishad they represented the almighty as compelling satan to exhibithimself on a cross in the shape of a snake as a punishment for hisnew transgression the story would have been less absurd lesscontradictory but instead of this they make the transgressortriumph and the almighty fall that many good men have believed this strange fable and livedvery good lives under that belief for credulity is not a crime iswhat i have no doubt of in the first place they were educated tobelieve it and they would have believed anything else in the samemanner there are also many who have been so enthusiasticallyenraptured by what they conceived to be the infinite love of god toman in making a sacrifice of himself that the vehemence of theidea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the absurdity and profaneness of the story the more unnatural anything is the more it is capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration but if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire dothey not present themselves every hour to our eyes do we not see afair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born a worldfurnished to our hands that cost us nothing is it we that light upthe sun that pour down the rain and fill the earth with abundance whether we sleep or wake the vast machinery of the universe stillgoes on are these things and the blessings they indicate infuture nothing to us can our gross feelings be excited by no othersubjects than tragedy and suicide or is the gloomy pride of manbecome so intolerable that nothing can flatter it but a sacrificeof the creator i know that this bold investigation will alarm many but itwould be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbearit on their account the times and the subject demand it to be done the suspicion that the theory of what is called the christian churchis fabulous is becoming very extensive in all countries and it willbe a consolation to men staggering under that suspicion anddoubting what to believe and what to disbelieve to see the objectfreely investigated i therefore pass on to an examination of thebooks called the old and new testament these books beginning with genesis and ending with revelation which by the by is a book of riddles that requires a revelationto explain it are we are told the word of god it is thereforeproper for us to know who told us so that we may know what creditto give to the report the answer to this question is that nobody cantell except that we tell one another so the case howeverhistorically appears to be as follows when the church mythologists established their system theycollected all the writings they could find and managed them as theypleased it is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether suchof the writings as now appear under the name of the old and new testament are in the same state in which those collectors say theyfound them or whether they added altered abridged or dressedthem up be this as it may they decided by vote which of the books outof the collection they had made should be the word of god and which should not they rejected several they voted others to be doubtful such as the books called the apocrypha and those books which had a majority of votes were voted to be the word of god had they voted otherwise all the people since calling themselves christians had believed otherwise for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other who the people were that did all this we know nothing of they called themselves by the general name of the church and this is all we know of the matter as we have no other external evidence or authority for believingthese books to be the word of god than what i have mentioned which is no evidence or authority at all i come in the next place to examine the internal evidence contained in the books themselves in the former part of this essay i have spoken of revelation inow proceed further with that subject for the purpose of applyingit to the books in question revelation is a communication of something which the person towhom that thing is revealed did not know before for if i have donea thing or seen it done it needs no revelation to tell me i havedone it or seen it nor to enable me to tell it or to write it revelation therefore cannot be applied to anything done uponearth of which man himself is the actor or the witness andconsequently all the historical and anecdotal parts of the biblewhich is almost the whole of it is not within the meaning and compassof the word revelation and therefore is not the word of god when samson ran off with the gateposts of gaza if he ever did so and whether he did or not is nothing to us or when he visited his delilah or caught his foxes or did any thing else what hasrevelation to do with these things if they were facts he couldtell them himself or his secretary if he kept one could write themif they were worth either telling or writing and if they werefictions revelation could not make them true and whether true ornot we are neither the better nor the wiser for knowing them when we contemplate the immensity of that being who directs and governs the incomprehensible whole of which the utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part we ought to feel shame at calling such paltrystories the word of god as to the account of the creation with which the book of genesis opens it has all the appearance of being a tradition whichthe israelites had among them before they came into egypt and aftertheir departure from that country they put it at the head of theirhistory without telling as it is most probable that they did notknow how they came by it the manner in which the account opensshows it to be traditionary it begins abruptly it is nobody thatspeaks it is nobody that hears it is addressed to nobody it hasneither first second nor third person it has every criterion ofbeing a tradition it has no voucher moses does not take it uponhimself by introducing it with the formality that he uses on otheroccasions such as that of saying the lord spake unto mosessaying why it has been called the mosaic account of the creation i am ata loss to conceive moses i believe was too good a judge of suchsubjects to put his name to that account he had been educated among the egyptians who were a people as well skilled in science and particularly in astronomy as any people of their day and the silence and caution that moses observes in not authenticating the account is a good negative evidence that he neither told it nor believed it the case is that every nation of people has been worldmakers and the israelites had as much right to set up the trade of worldmaking as any of the rest and as moses was not an israelite he might not choose to contradict the tradition the account however is harmless and this is more than can be said of many other parts of the bible whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt andbrutalize mankind and for my part i sincerely detest it as i detest everything that is cruel we scarcely meet with anything a few phrases excepted but whatdeserves either our abhorrence or our contempt till we come to themiscellaneous parts of the bible in the anonymous publications the psalms and the book of job more particularly in the latter wefind a great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of thepower and benignity of the almighty but they stand on no higherrank than many other compositions on similar subjects as wellbefore that time as since the proverbs which are said to be solomons though mostprobably a collection because they discover a knowledge of life whichhis situation excluded him from knowing are an instructive tableof ethics they are inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the spaniards and not more wise and economical than those of the american franklin all the remaining parts of the bible generally known by thename of the prophets are the works of the jewish poets anditinerant preachers who mixed poetry anecdote and devotiontogether and those works still retain the air and style of poetrythough in translation as there are many readers who do not see that a composition ispoetry unless it be in rhyme it is for their information that i addthis note poetry consists principally in two things imagery andcomposition the composition of poetry differs from that of prose inthe manner of mixing long and short syllables together take a longsyllable out of a line of poetry and put a short one in the room ofit or put a long syllable where a short one should be and that linewill lose its poetical harmony it will have an effect upon the linelike that of misplacing a note in a song the imagery in these bookscalled the prophets appertains altogether to poetry it isfictitious and oft en extravagant and not admissible in any otherkind of writing than poetry to show that these writings are composedin poetical numbers i will take ten syllables as they stand in thebook and make a line of the same number of syllables heroicmeasure that shall rhyme with the last word it will then be seenthat the composition of these books is poetical measure the instance i shall produce is from isaiahhear o ye heavens and give ear o earth tis god himself that calls attention forth another instance i shall quote is from the mournful jeremiah towhich i shall add two other lines for the purpose of carrying out thefigure and showing the intention the poeto that mine head were waters and mine eyeswere fountains flowing like the liquid skiesthen would i give the mighty flood releaseand weep a deluge for the human race there is not throughout the whole book called the bible any wordthat describes to us what we call a poet nor any word thatdescribes what we call poetry the case is that the word prophetto which latter times have affixed a new idea was the bible wordfor poet and the word prophesying meant the art of making poetry it also meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon anyinstrument of music we read of prophesying with pipes tabrets and horns ofprophesying with harps with psalteries with cymbals and withevery other instrument of music then in fashion were we now tospeak of prophesying with a fiddle or with a pipe and tabor theexpression would have no meaning or would appear ridiculous and tosome people contemptuous because we have changed the meaning of the word we are told of saul being among the prophets and also that heprophesied but we are not told what they prophesied nor what heprophesied the case is there was nothing to tell for these prophetswere a company of musicians and poets and saul joined in the concert and this was called prophesying the account given of this affair in the book called samuel isthat saul met a company of prophets a whole company of them coming down with a psaltery a tabret a pipe and a harp and that they prophesied and that he prophesied with them but it appearsafterward that saul prophesied badly that is he performed hispart badly for it is said that an evil spirit from god cameupon saul and he prophesied as those men who call themselves divines and commentators arevery fond of puzzling one another i leave them to contest the meaning of the first part of the phrase that of an evil spirit from god i keep to my text i keep to the meaning of the word prophesy now were there no other passage in the book called the bible thanthis to demonstrate to us that we have lost the original meaning ofthe word prophesy and substituted another meaning in its placethis alone would be sufficient for it is impossible to use andapply the word prophesy in the place it is here used and appliedif we give to it the sense which latter times have affixed to it the manner in which it is here used strips it of all religiousmeaning and shows that a man might then be a prophet or he mightprophesy as he may now be a poet or a musician without any regard to the morality or immorality of his character the word was originally a term of science promiscuously applied to poetry and to music and not restricted to any subject upon which poetry and music might beexercised deborah and barak are called prophets not because theypredicted anything but because they composed the poem or song thatbears their name in celebration of an act already done david isranked among the prophets for he was a musician and was also reputed to be though perhaps very erroneously the author of the psalms but abraham isaac and jacob are not called prophets it does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either sing play music or make poetry we are told of the greater and the lesser prophets they mightas well tell us of the greater and the lesser god for there cannot bedegrees in prophesying consistently with its modern sense but thereare degrees in poetry and therefore the phrase is reconcilable to thecase when we understand by it the greater and the lesser poets it is altogether unnecessary after this to offer anyobservations upon what those men styled prophets have written theaxe goes at once to the root by showing that the original meaningof the word has been mistaken and consequently all the inferences that have been drawn from those books the devotional respect that has been paid to them and the labored commentaries that have been written upon them under that mistaken meaning are not worth disputing about in many things however the writings of the jewish poets deserve a better fate than that of being bound up as they now are with the trash that accompanies them under the abused name of the word of god if we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things wemust necessarily affix the idea not only of unchangeableness butof the utter impossibility of any change taking place by any means oraccident whatever in that which we would honor with the name of theword of god and therefore the word of god cannot exist in any written or human language the continually progressive change to which the meaning of wordsis subject the want of a universal language which renders translationnecessary the errors to which translations are again subject themistakes of copyists and printers together with the possibility ofwillful alteration are of themselves evidences that the humanlanguage whether in speech or in print cannot be the vehicle ofthe word of god the word of god exists in something else did the book called the bible excel in purity of ideas andexpression all the books that are now extant in the world i would nottake it for my rule of faith as being the word of god because thepossibility would nevertheless exist of my being imposed upon butwhen i see throughout the greater part of this book scarcelyanything but a history of the grossest vices and a collection of themost paltry and contemptible tales i cannot dishonor my creator bycalling it by his name thus much for the bible i now go on to the book called the new testament the new testament that is the new will as if there couldbe two wills of the creator had it been the object or the intention of jesus christ toestablish a new religion he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his lifetime but there is no publication extant authenticated with his name all the bookscalled the new testament were written after his death he was a jew by birth and by profession and he was the son of god in like manner that every other person is for the creator is the father of all the first four books called matthew mark luke and john do notgive a history of the life of jesus christ but only detachedanecdotes of him it appears from these books that the whole time ofhis being a preacher was not more than eighteen months and it wasonly during this short time that these men became acquainted with him they make mention of him at the age of twelve years sitting they say among the jewish doctors asking and answering them questions as this was several years before their acquaintance with him began it is most probable they had this anecdote from his parents from this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years where he lived or how he employed himself during this interval is not known most probably he was working at his fathers trade which was that of a carpenter it does not appear that he had any school education and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born it is somewhat curious that the three persons whose names arethe most universally recorded were of very obscure parentage moseswas a foundling jesus christ was born in a stable and mahomet wasa mule driver the first and last of these men were founders ofdifferent systems of religion but jesus christ founded no new system he called men to the practice of moral virtues and the belief of one god the great trait in his character is philanthropy the manner in which he was apprehended shows that he was notmuch known at that time and it shows also that the meetings hethen held with his followers were in secret and that he had givenover or suspended preaching publicly judas could not otherwise betray him than by giving information where he was and pointing him out to the officers that went to arrest him and the reason for employing and paying judas to do this could arise only from the cause already mentioned that of his not being much known and living concealed the idea of his concealment not only agrees very ill with hisreputed divinity but associates with it something of pusillanimityand his being betrayed or in other words his being apprehended onthe information of one of his followers shows that he did notintend to be apprehended and consequently that he did not intend tobe crucified the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for thesins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it notthen have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the smallpoxof old age or of anything else the declaratory sentence which they say was passed upon adamin case he eat of the apple was not that thou shall surely becrucified but thou shalt surely die the sentence of death and notthe manner of dying crucifixion therefore or any other particularmanner of dying made no part of the sentence that adam was to suffer and consequently even upon their own tactics it could make no part of the sentence that christ was to suffer in the room of adam a fever would have done as well as a cross if there was any occasion for either the sentence of death which they tell us was thus passed upon adam must either have meant dying naturally that is ceasing to liveor have meant what these mythologists call damnation andconsequently the act of dying on the part of jesus christ mustaccording to their system apply as a prevention to one or other ofthese two things happening to adam and to us that it does not prevent our dying is evident because we all dieand if their accounts of longevity be true men die faster since thecrucifixion than before and with respect to the second explanation including with it the natural death of jesus christ as a substitutefor the eternal death or damnation of all mankind it isimpertinently representing the creator as coming off or revokingthe sentence by a pun or a quibble upon the word death thatmanufacturer of quibbles st paul if he wrote the books that bearhis name has helped this quibble on by making another quibble uponthe word adam he makes there to be two adams the one who sins infact and suffers by proxy the other who sins by proxy and suffersin fact a religion thus interlarded with quibble subterfuge and punhas a tendency to instruct its professors in the practice of thesearts they acquire the habit without being aware of the cause if jesus christ was the being which those mythologists tell ushe was and that he came into this world to suffer which is a wordthey sometimes use instead of to die the only real suffering he couldhave endured would have been to live his existence here was astate of exilement or transportation from heaven and the way backto his original country was to die in fine everything in thisstrange system is the reverse of what it pretends to be it is thereverse of truth and i become so tired of examining into itsinconsistencies and absurdities that i hasten to the conclusion ofit in order to proceed to something better how much or what parts of the books called the new testament were written by the persons whose names they bear is what we can know nothing of neither are we certain in what language they wereoriginally written the matters they now contain may be classedunder two beads anecdote and epistolary correspondence the four books already mentioned matthew mark luke and johnare altogether anecdotal they relate events after they had takenplace they tell what jesus christ did and said and what others didand said to him and in several instances they relate the same eventdifferently revelation is necessarily out of the question withrespect to those books not only because of the disagreement of thewriters but because revelation cannot be applied to the relating offacts by the person who saw them done nor to the relating orrecording of any discourse or conversation by those who beard it the book called the acts of the apostles an anonymous work belongsalso to the anecdotal part all the other parts of the new testament except the book ofenigmas called the revelations are a collection of letters underthe name of epistles and the forgery of letters has been such acommon practice in the world that the probability is at leastequal whether they are genuine or forged one thing however is much less equivocal which is that out of the matters contained in those books together with the assistance of some old stories the church has set up a system of religion very contradictory to the character of the person whose name it bears it has set up a religion of pomp and revenue in pretended imitation of a person whose life was humility and poverty the invention of purgatory and of the releasing of soulstherefrom by prayers bought of the church with money the selling ofpardons dispensations and indulgences are revenue laws withoutbearing that name or carrying that appearance but the casenevertheless is that those things derive their origin from theparoxysm of the crucifixion and the theory deduced therefrom whichwas that one person could stand in the place of another and couldperform meritorious service for him the probability therefore isthat the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption which is said to have been accomplished by the act of one person inthe room of another was originally fabricated on purpose to bringforward and build all those secondary and pecuniary redemptionsupon and that the passages in the books upon which the idea ortheory of redemption is built have been manufactured and fabricatedfor that purpose why are we to give this church credit when she tellsus that those books are genuine in every part any more than we giveher credit for everything else she has told us or for the miraclesshe says she had performed that she could fabricate writings iscertain because she could write and the composition of thewritings in question is of that kind that anybody might do it andthat she did fabricate them is not more inconsistent withprobability than that she could tell us as she has done that shecould and did work miracles since then no external evidence can at this long distance oftime be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrines called redemption or not for such evidence whether for or against would be subject to the same suspicion of being fabricated the case can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries within itself and this affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication for the internal evidence is that the theory or doctrine of redemption bas for its base an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice if i owe a person money and cannot pay him and he threatens toput me in prison another person can take the debt upon himself andpay it for me but if i have committed a crime every circumstanceof the case is changed moral justice cannot take the innocent for theguilty even if the innocent would offer itself to suppose justice todo this is to destroy the principle of its existence which is thething itself it is then no longer justice it is indiscriminaterevenge this single reflection will show that the doctrine ofredemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea corresponding to thatof a debt which another person might pay and as this pecuniary ideacorresponds again with the system of second redemption obtainedthrough the means of money given to the church for pardons theprobability is that the same persons fabricated both the one and theother of those theories and that in truth there is no such thingas redemption that it is fabulous and that man stands in the samerelative condition with his maker as he ever did stand since manexisted and that it is his greatest consolation to think so let him believe this and he will live more consistently andmorally than by any other system it is by his being taught tocontemplate himself as an outlaw as an outcast as a beggar as amumper as one thrown as it were on a dunghill at an immensedistance from his creator and who must make his approaches bycreeping and cringing to intermediate beings that he conceives eithera contemptuous disregard for everything under the name of religion or becomes indifferent or turns what he calls devout in the lattercase he consumes his life in grief or the affectation of it hisprayers are reproaches his humility is ingratitude he callshimself a worm and the fertile earth a dunghill and all theblessings of life by the thankless name of vanities he despises thechoicest gift of god to man the gift of reason and having endeavored to force upon himself the belief of a system against which reason revolts he ungratefully calls it human reason as if man could give reason to himself yet with all this strange appearance of humility and thiscontempt for human reason he ventures into the boldestpresumptions he finds fault with everything his selfishness is neversatisfied his ingratitude is never at an end he takes on himselfto direct the almighty what to do even in the government of theuniverse he prays dictatorially when it is sunshine he prays forrain and when it is rain he prays for sunshine he follows thesame idea in everything that he prays for for what is the amount ofall his prayers but an attempt to make the almighty change his mindand act otherwise than he does it is as if he were to say thouknowest not so well as i but some perhaps will say are we to have no word of god norevelation i answer yes there is a word of god there is arevelation the word of god is the creation we behold and it is in thisword which no human invention can counterfeit or alter that godspeaketh universally to man human language is local and changeable and is therefore incapableof being used as the means of unchangeable and universalinformation the idea that god sent jesus christ to publish as theysay the glad tidings to all nations from one end of the earth to theother is consistent only with the ignorance of those who knew nothingof the extent of the world and who believed as thoseworldsaviours believed and continued to believe for severalcenturies and that in contradiction to the discoveries ofphilosophers and the experience of navigators that the earth wasflat like a trencher and that man might walk to the end of it but how was jesus christ to make anything known to all nations he could speak but one language which was hebrew and there are in the world several hundred languages scarcely any two nations speak the same language or understand each other and as to translations every man who knows anything of languages knows that it is impossible to translate from one language to another not only without losing a great part of the original but frequently of mistaking the sense and besides all this the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time christ lived it is always necessary that the means that are to accomplish anyend be equal to the accomplishment of that end or the end cannot beaccomplished it is in this that the difference between finite andinfinite power and wisdom discovers itself man frequently fails inaccomplishing his ends from a natural inability of the power to thepurpose and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply powerproperly but it is impossible for infinite power and wisdom to failas man faileth the means it useth are always equal to the end buthuman language more especially as there is not an universal language is incapable of being used as an universal means of unchangeable and uniform information and therefore it is not the means that god useth in manifesting himself universally to man it is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of aword of god can unite the creation speaketh an universal languageindependently of human speech or human language multiplied andvarious as they may be it is an everexisting original which everyman can read it cannot be forged it cannot be counterfeited itcannot be lost it cannot be altered it cannot be suppressed it doesnot depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published ornot it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other itpreaches to all nations and to all worlds and this word of godreveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of god do we want to contemplate his power we see it in the immensity of the creation do we want to contemplate his wisdom we see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible whole is governed do we want to contemplate his munificence we see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth do we want to contemplate his mercy we see it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful in fine do we want to know what god is search not the book called the scripture which any human hand might make but the scripture called the creation the only idea man can affix to the name of god is that of afirst cause the cause of all things and incomprehensible anddifficult as it is for a man to conceive what a first cause is hearrives at the belief of it from the tenfold greater difficulty ofdisbelieving it it is difficult beyond description to conceive thatspace can have no end but it is more difficult to conceive an end itis difficult beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal durationof what we call time but it is more impossible to conceive a timewhen there shall be no time in like manner of reasoning everything we behold carries initself the internal evidence that it did not make itself every manis an evidence to himself that he did not make himself neithercould his father make himself nor his grandfather nor any of hisrace neither could any tree plant or animal make itself and itis the conviction arising from this evidence that carries us on as itwere by necessity to the belief of a first cause eternallyexisting of a nature totally different to any material existence weknow of and by the power of which all things exist and this firstcause man calls god it is only by the exercise of reason that man can discover god take away that reason and he would be incapable of understandinganything and in this case it would be just as consistent to readeven the book called the bible to a horse as to a man how then isit that those people pretend to reject reason almost the only parts in the book called the bible that conveyto us any idea of god are some chapters in job and the 19th psalmi recollect no other those parts are true deistical compositions forthey treat of the deity through his works they take the book of creation as the word of god they refer to no other book and allthe inferences they make are drawn from that volume i insert in this place the 19th psalm as paraphrased into englishverse by addison i recollect not the prose and where i write this i have not the opportunity of seeing it the spacious firmament on highwith all the blue ethereal skyand spangled heavens a shining frametheir great original proclaim the unwearied sun from day to daydoes his creators power displayand publishes to every land the work of an almighty hand soon as the evening shades prevailthe moon takes up the wondrous taleand nightly to the listning earth repeats the story of her birthwhile all the stars that round her burnand all the planets in their turnconfirm the tidings as they rolland spread the truth from pole to pole what though in solemn silence all move round this dark terrestrial ball what though no real voice or soundamidst their radiant orbs be found in reasons ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voiceforever singing as they shinethe hand that made us is divine what more does man want to know than that the hand or power that made these things is divine is omnipotent let him believe thiswith the force it is impossible to repel if he permits his reasonto act and his rule of moral life will follow of course the allusions in job have all of them the same tendency withthis psalm that of deducing or proving a truth that would beotherwise unknown from truths already known i recollect not enough of the passages in job to insert themcorrectly but there is one occurs to me that is applicable to thesubject i am speaking upon canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty to perfection i know not how the printers have pointed this passage for ikeep no bible but it contains two distinct questions that admit ofdistinct answers first canst thou by searching find out god yes because in thefirst place i know i did not make myself and yet i have existenceand by searching into the nature of other things i find that no otherthing could make itself and yet millions of other things existtherefore it is that i know by positive conclusion resulting fromthis search that there is a power superior to all those things andthat power is god secondly canst thou find out the almighty to perfection nonot only because the power and wisdom he has manifested in thestructure of the creation that i behold is to me incomprehensible butbecause even this manifestation great as it is is probably but asmall display of that immensity of power and wisdom by whichmillions of other worlds to me invisible by their distance werecreated and continue to exist it is evident that both these questions were put to the reasonof the person to whom they are supposed to have been addressed and it is only by admitting the first question to be answeredaffirmatively that the second could follow it would have beenunnecessary and even absurd to have put a second question moredifficult than the first if the first question had been answerednegatively the two questions have different objects the first refersto the existence of god the second to his attributes reason candiscover the one but it falls infinitely short in discovering thewhole of the other i recollect not a single passage in all the writings ascribed tothe men called apostles that conveys any idea of what god is thosewritings are chiefly controversial and the subjects they dwellupon that of a man dying in agony on a cross is better suited to thegloomy genius of a monk in a cell by whom it is not impossible theywere written than to any man breathing the open air of the creation the only passage that occurs to me that has any referenceto the works of god by which only his power and wisdom can beknown is related to have been spoken by jesus christ as a remedyagainst distrustful care behold the lilies of the field they toilnot neither do they spin this however is far inferior to theallusions in job and in the 19th psalm but it is similar in idea andthe modesty of the imagery is correspondent to the modesty of the man as to the christian system of faith it appears to me as a speciesof atheism a sort of religious denial of god it professes tobelieve in a man rather than in god it is a compound made upchiefly of manism with but little deism and is as near to atheismas twilight is to darkness it introduces between man and his maker anopaque body which it calls a redeemer as the moon introduces heropaque self between the earth and the sun and it produces by thismeans a religious or an irreligious eclipse of light it has put thewhole orbit of reason into shade the effect of this obscurity has been that of turning everythingupside down and representing it in reverse and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced it has made a revolution in theology that which is now called natural philosophy embracing the wholecircle of science of which astronomy occupies the chief place is thestudy of the works of god and of the power and wisdom of god in hisworks and is the true theology as to the theology that is now studied in its place it is thestudy of human opinions and of human fancies concerning god it is not the study of god himself in the works that he has made but in theworks or writings that man has made and it is not among the leastof the mischiefs that the christian system has done to the world thatit has abandoned the original and beautiful system of theology like abeautiful innocent to distress and reproach to make room for the hagof superstition the book of job and the 19th psalm which even the church admitsto be more ancient than the chronological order in which they stand inthe book called the bible are theological orations conformable to theoriginal system of theology the internal evidence of those orationsproves to a demonstration that the study and contemplation of theworks of creation and of the power and wisdom of god revealed andmanifested in those works made a great part in the religious devotionof the times in which they were written and it was this devotionalstudy and contemplation that led to the discovery of the principlesupon which what are now called sciences are established and it isto the discovery of these principles that almost all the arts thatcontribute to the convenience of human life owe their existence everyprincipal art has some science for its parent though the person whomechanically performs the work does not always and but very seldom perceive the connection it is a fraud of the christian system to call the sciences humaninvention it is only the application of them that is human everyscience has for its basis a system of principles as fixed andunalterable as those by which the universe is regulated andgoverned man cannot make principles he can only discover them for example every person who looks at an almanac sees anaccount when an eclipse will take place and he sees also that itnever fails to take place according to the account there given thisshows that man is acquainted with the laws by which the heavenlybodies move but it would be something worse than ignorance wereany church on earth to say that those laws are a human invention itwould also be ignorance or something worse to say that thescientific principles by the aid of which man is enabled tocalculate and foreknow when an eclipse will take place are a humaninvention man cannot invent a thing that is eternal and immutableand the scientific principles he employs for this purpose must be andare of necessity as eternal and immutable as the laws by which theheavenly bodies move or they could not be used as they are toascertain the time when and the manner how an eclipse will takeplace the scientific principles that man employs to obtain theforeknowledge of an eclipse or of anything else relating to themotion of the heavenly bodies are contained chiefly in that part ofscience which is called trigonometry or the properties of a trianglewhich when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies is calledastronomy when applied to direct the course of a ship on the oceanit is called navigation when applied to the construction of figuresdrawn by rule and compass it is called geometry when applied tothe construction of plans or edifices it is called architecture whenapplied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earthit is called land surveying in fine it is the soul of science it isan eternal truth it contains the mathematical demonstration ofwhich man speaks and the extent of its uses is unknown it may be said that man can make or draw a triangle and thereforea triangle is a human invention but the triangle when drawn is no other than the image of theprinciple it is a delineation to the eye and from thence to themind of a principle that would otherwise be imperceptible thetriangle does not make the principle any more than a candle takeninto a room that was dark makes the chairs and tables that before were invisible all the properties of a triangle exist independently of the figure and existed before any triangle was drawn or thought of byman man had no more to do in the formation of these properties orprinciples than he had to do in making the laws by which the heavenlybodies move and therefore the one must have the same divine origin as the other in the same manner as it may be said that man can make atriangle so also may it be said he can make the mechanicalinstrument called a lever but the principle by which the lever actsis a thing distinct from the instrument and would exist if theinstrument did not it attaches itself to the instrument after it ismade the instrument therefore cannot act otherwise than it doesact neither can all the efforts of human invention make it actotherwise that which in all such cases man calls the effect is noother than the principle itself rendered perceptible to the senses since then man cannot make principles from whence did he gain a knowledge of them so as to be able to apply them not only tothings on earth but to ascertain the motion of bodies so immenselydistant from him as all the heavenly bodies are from whence i askcould he gain that knowledge but from the study of the true theology it is the structure of the universe that has taught this knowledgeto man that structure is an everexisting exhibition of everyprinciple upon which every part of mathematical science is founded the offspring of this science is mechanics for mechanics is noother than the principles of science applied practically the manwho proportions the several parts of a mill uses the samescientific principles as if he had the power of constructing auniverse but as he cannot give to matter that invisible agency bywhich all the component parts of the immense machine of the universehave influence upon each other and act in motional unison togetherwithout any apparent contact and to which man has given the name of attraction gravitation and repulsion he supplies the place ofthat agency by the humble imitation of teeth and cogs all the partsof mans microcosm must visibly touch but could he gain a knowledgeof that agency so as to be able to apply it in practice we mightthen say that another canonical book of the word of god had beendiscovered if man could alter the properties of the lever so also could healter the properties of the triangle for a lever taking that sort oflever which is called a steelyard for the sake of explanation formswhen in motion a triangle the line it descends from one point ofthat line being in the fulcrum the line it descends to and the cordof the arc which the end of the lever describes in the air are thethree sides of a triangle the other arm of the lever describes also atriangle and the corresponding sides of those two trianglescalculated scientifically or measured geometrically and also thesines tangents and secants generated from the angles andgeometrically measured have the same proportions to each other asthe different weights have that will balance each other on thelever leaving the weight of the lever out of the case it may also be said that man can make a wheel and axis that hecan put wheels of different magnitudes together and produce a mill still the case comes back to the same point which is that he did notmake the principle that gives the wheels those powers thatprinciple is as unalterable as in the former case or rather it is thesame principle under a different appearance to the eye the power that two wheels of different magnitudes have upon eachother is in the same proportion as if the semidiameter of the twowheels were joined together and made into that kind of lever i havedescribed suspended at the part where the semidiameters join forthe two wheels scientifically considered are no other than the twocircles generated by the motion of the compound lever it is from the study of the true theology that all out knowledgeof science is derived and it is from that knowledge that all the artshave originated the almighty lecturer by displaying the principles of sciencein the structure of the universe has invited man to study and toimitation it is as if he had said to the inhabitants of this globethat we call ours i have made an earth for man to dwell upon and i have rendered the starry heavens visible to teach him science andthe arts he can now provide for his own comfort and learn from my munificence to all to be kind to each other of what use is it unless it be to teach man something that hiseye is endowed with the power of beholding to an incomprehensibledistance an immensity of worlds revolving in the ocean of space orof what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man what has man to do with the pleiades with orion with sirius withthe star he calls the north star with the moving orbs he has named saturn jupiter mars venus and mercury if no uses are to followfrom their being visible a less power of vision would have beensufficient for man if the immensity he now possesses were givenonly to waste itself as it were on an immense desert of spaceglittering with shows it is only by contemplating what he calls the starry heavens asthe book and school of science that he discovers any use in theirbeing visible to him or any advantage resulting from his immensity ofvision but when he contemplates the subject in this light he seesan additional motive for saying that nothing was made in vain for invain would be this power of vision if it taught man nothing as the christian system of faith has made a revolution intheology so also has it made a revolution in the state of learning that which is now called learning was not learning originally learning does not consist as the schools now make it consist inthe knowledge of languages but in the knowledge of things to whichlanguage gives names the greeks were a learned people but learning with them did notconsist in speaking greek any more than in a romans speaking latin or a frenchmans speaking french or an englishmans speaking english from what we know of the greeks it does not appear that they knew or studied any language but their own and this was one cause of their becoming so learned it afforded them more time to apply themselves to better studies the schools of the greeks were schools of science and philosophy and not of languages and it is in the knowledge of the things that science and philosophy teach thatlearning consists almost all the scientific learning that now exists came to us fromthe greeks or the people who spoke the greek language it therefore became necessary for the people of other nations who spoke a different language that some among them should learn the greek language in order that the learning the greeks had might be made known in those nations by translating the greek books of science and philosophy into the mother tongue of each nation the study therefore of the greek language and in the samemanner for the latin was no other than the drudgery business of alinguist and the language thus obtained was no other than the means as it were the tools employed to obtain the learning the greeks had it made no part of the learning itself and was so distinctfrom it as to make it exceedingly probable that the persons who hadstudied greek sufficiently to translate those works such forinstance as euclids elements did not understand any of the learningthe works contained as there is now nothing new to be learned from the dead languages all the useful books being already translated the languages are become useless and the time expended in teaching and learning them is wasted so far as the study of languages may contribute to the progress and communication of knowledge for it has nothing to do with the creation of knowledge it is only in the living languages that new knowledge is to be found and certain it is that in generala youth will learn more of a living language in one year than of adead language in seven and it is but seldom that the teacher knowsmuch of it himself the difficulty of learning the dead languages doesnot arise from any superior abstruseness in the languagesthemselves but in their being dead and the pronunciation entirelylost it would be the same thing with any other language when itbecomes dead the best greek linguist that now exists does notunderstand greek so well as a grecian plowman did or a grecianmilkmaid and the same for the latin compared with a plowman ormilkmaid of the romans it would therefore be advantageous to thestate of learning to abolish the study of the dead languages and tomake learning consist as it originally did in scientific knowledge the apology that is sometimes made for continuing to teach thedead languages is that they are taught at a time when a child isnot capable of exerting any other mental faculty than that ofmemory but that is altogether erroneous the human mind has a natural disposition to scientific knowledge and to the thingsconnected with it the first and favorite amusement of a child even before it begins to play is that of imitating the works of man it builds houses with cards or sticks it navigates the little ocean of a bowl of water with a paper boat or dams the stream of a gutter and contrives something which it calls a mill and it interests itself in the fate of its works with a care that resembles affection it afterwards goes to school where its genius is killed by the barren study of a dead language and the philosopher is lost in the linguist but the apology that is now made for continuing to teach thedead languages could not be the cause at first of cutting downlearning to the narrow and humble sphere of linguistry the causetherefore must be sought for elsewhere in all researches of thiskind the best evidence that can be produced is the internal evidencethe thing carries with itself and the evidence of circumstancesthat unite with it both of which in this case are not difficultto be discovered putting then aside as a matter of distinct consideration theoutrage offered to the moral justice of god by supposing him to makethe innocent suffer for the guilty and also the loose morality andlow contrivance of supposing him to change himself into the shape of aman in order to make an excuse to himself for not executing hissupposed sentence upon adam putting i say those things aside asmatter of distinct consideration it is certain that what is calledthe christian system of faith including in it the whimsical accountof the creation the strange story of eve the snake and the applethe ambiguous idea of a mangod the corporeal idea of the death of agod the mythological idea of a family of gods and the christiansystem of arithmetic that three are one and one is three are allirreconcilable not only to the divine gift of reason that god hathgiven to man but to the knowledge that man gains of the power andwisdom of god by the aid of the sciences and by studying thestructure of the universe that god has made the settersup therefore and the advocates of the christiansystem of faith could not but foresee that the continually progressiveknowledge that man would gain by the aid of science of the power and wisdom of god manifested in the structure of the universe and inall the works of creation would militate against and call intoquestion the truth of their system of faith and therefore itbecame necessary to their purpose to cut learning down to a sizeless dangerous to their project and this they effected by restrictingthe idea of learning to the dead study of dead languages they not only rejected the study of science out of the christianschools but they persecuted it and it is only within about thelast two centuries that the study has been revived so late as 1610galileo a florentine discovered and introduced the use oftelescopes and by applying them to observe the motions andappearances of the heavenly bodies afforded additional means forascertaining the true structure of the universe instead of beingesteemed for those discoveries he was sentenced to renounce themor the opinions resulting from them as a damnable heresy andprior to that time vigilius was condemned to be burned forasserting the antipodes or in other words that the earth was a globeand habitable in every part where there was land yet the truth ofthis is now too well known even to be told if the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief itwould make no part of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them there was no moral ill in believing the earth was flat like atrencher any more than there was moral virtue in believing that itwas round like a globe neither was there any moral ill in believingthat the creator made no other world than this any more than therewas moral virtue in believing that he made millions and that theinfinity of space is filled with worlds but when a system of religionis made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not trueand to unite itself therewith in a manner almost inseparabletherefrom the case assumes an entirely different ground it is thenthat errors not morally bad become fraught with the same mischiefsas if they were it is then that the truth though otherwiseindifferent itself becomes an essential by becoming the criterionthat either confirms by corresponding evidence or denies bycontradictory evidence the reality of the religion itself in thisview of the case it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possibleevidence that the structure of the heavens or any other part ofcreation affords with respect to systems of religion but this thesupporters or partisans of the christian system as if dreading theresult incessantly opposed and not only rejected the sciences butpersecuted the professors had newton or descartes lived three or four hundred years ago and pursued their studies as they did it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them and had franklin drawn lightning from the clouds at the same time it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in the flames later times have laid all the blame upon the goths and vandalsbut however unwilling the partisans of the christian system may be tobelieve or to acknowledge it it is nevertheless true that the ageof ignorance commenced with the christian system there was moreknowledge in the world before that period than for many centuriesafterwards and as to religious knowledge the christian system asalready said was only another species of mythology and themythology to which it succeeded was a corruption of an ancientsystem of theism it is impossible for us now to know at what time the heathenmythology began but it is certain from the internal evidence that itcarries that it did not begin in the same state or condition in whichit ended all the gods of that mythology except saturn were ofmodern invention the supposed reign of saturn was prior to that which is called the heathen mythology and was so far a species of theism that it admitted the belief of only one god saturn is supposed to have abdicated the government in favor of his three sons and one daughter jupiter pluto neptune and juno after this thousands of other gods and demigods were imaginarily created and the calendar of gods increased as fast as the calendar of saints and the calendars of courts have increased since all the corruptions that have taken place in theology and inreligion have been produced by admitting of what man calls revealedreligion the mythologists pretended to more revealed religion thanthe christians do they had their oracles and their priests whowere supposed to receive and deliver the word of god verbally onalmost all occasions since then all corruptions down from moloch to modernpredestinarianism and the human sacrifices of the heathens to the christian sacrifice of the creator have been produced by admitting ofwhat is called revealed religion the most effectual means toprevent all such evils and impositions is not to admit of any otherrevelation than that which is manifested in the book of creationand to contemplate the creation as the only true and real word of god that ever did or ever will exist and that everything else calledthe word of god is fable and imposition it is owing to this long interregnum of science and to no othercause that we have now to look through a vast chasm of many hundred years to the respectable characters we call the ancients had the progression of knowledge gone on proportionably with that stock that before existed that chasm would have been filled up with characters rising superior in knowledge to each other and those ancients we now so much admire would have appeared respectably in the background of the scene but the christian system laid all waste and if we take our stand about the beginning of the sixteenth century we look back through that long chasm to the times of the ancients as over a vast sandy desert in which not a shrub appears to intercept thevision to the fertile hills beyond it is an inconsistency scarcely possible to be credited thatanything should exist under the name of a religion that held it tobe irreligious to study and contemplate the structure of theuniverse that god has made but the fact is too well established to bedenied the event that served more than any other to break the firstlink in this long chain of despotic ignorance is that known by thename of the reformation by luther from that time though it doesnot appear to have made any part of the intention of luther or ofthose who are called reformers the sciences began to revive andliberality their natural associate began to appear this was theonly public good the reformation did for with respect to religiousgood it might as well not have taken place the mythology stillcontinued the same and a multiplicity of national popes grew out ofthe downfall of the pope of christendom having thus shown from the internal evidence of things the causethat produced a change in the state of learning and the motive forsubstituting the study of the dead languages in the place of thesciences i proceed in addition to several observations alreadymade in the former part of this work to compare or rather toconfront the evidence that the structure of the universe affords withthe christian system of religion but as i cannot begin this partbetter than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at anearly part of life and which i doubt not have occurred in some degreeto almost every person at one time or other i shall state whatthose ideas were and add thereto such other matter as shall arise outof the subject giving to the whole by way of preface a shortintroduction my father being of the quaker profession it was my good fortuneto have an exceedingly good moral education and a tolerable stockof useful learning though i went to the grammar school i did notlearn latin not only because i had no inclination to learn languagesbut because of the objection the quakers have against the books inwhich the language is taught but this did not prevent me from beingacquainted with the subject of all the latin books used in the school the same school thetford in norfolk that the present counsellor mingay went to and under the same master the natural bent of my mind was to science i had some turn and ibelieve some talent for poetry but this i rather repressed thanencouraged as leading too much into the field of imagination as soonas i was able i purchased a pair of globes and attended thephilosophical lectures of martin and ferguson and became afterwardacquainted with dr bevis of the society called the royal societythen living in the temple and an excellent astronomer i had no disposition for what is called politics it presentedto my mind no other idea than as contained in the word jockeyship when therefore i turned my thoughts toward matter of government i had to form a system for myself that accorded with the moral andphilosophic principles in which i have been educated i saw or atleast i thought i saw a vast scene opening itself to the world in theaffairs of america and it appeared to me that unless the americanschanged the plan they were pursuing with respect to the governmentof england and declared themselves independent they would not onlyinvolve themselves in a multiplicity of new difficulties but shut outthe prospect that was then offering itself to mankind through theirmeans it was from these motives that i published the work known bythe name of common sense which was the first work i ever did publish and so far as i can judge of myself i believe i should never have been known in the world as an author on any subject whatever had it not been for the affairs of america i wrote common sense thelatter end of the year 1775 and published it the first of january1776 independence was declared the fourth of july following any person who has made observations on the state and progressof the human mind by observing his own cannot but have observed that there are two distinct classes of what are called thoughts  thosethat we produce in ourselves by reflection and the act of thinkingand those that bolt into the mind of their own accord i have alwaysmade it a rule to treat those voluntary visitors with civility takingcare to examine as well as i was able if they were worthentertaining and it is from them i have acquired almost all theknowledge that i have as to the learning that any person gains fromschool education it serves only like a small capital to put himin a way of beginning learning for himself afterward every personof learning is finally his own teacher the reason of which is thatprinciples being a distinct quality to circumstances cannot beimpressed upon the memory their place of mental residence is theunderstanding and they are never so lasting as when they begin byconception thus much for the introductory part from the time i was capable of conceiving an idea and actingupon it by reflection i either doubted the truth of the christiansystem or thought it to be a strange affair i scarcely knew whichit was but i well remember when about seven or eight years of agehearing a sermon read by a relation of mine who was a great devoteeof the church upon the subject of what is called redemption by thedeath of the son of god after the sermon was ended i went into thegarden and as i was going down the garden steps for i perfectlyrecollect the spot i revolted at the recollection of what i hadheard and thought to myself that it was making god almighty actlike a passionate man that killed his son when he could not revengehimself in any other way and as i was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing i could not see for what purpose they preachedsuch sermons this was not one of that kind of thoughts that hadanything in it of childish levity it was to me a seriousreflection arising from the idea i had that god was too good to dosuch an action and also too almighty to be under any necessity ofdoing it i believe in the same manner at this moment and imoreover believe that any system of religion that has anything init that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system it seems as if parents of the christian profession were ashamed totell their children anything about the principles of their religion they sometimes instruct them in morals and talk to them of thegoodness of what they call providence for the christian mythology hasfive deities there is god the father god the son god the holy ghost the god providence and the goddess nature but the christianstory of god the father putting his son to death or employing peopleto do it for that is the plain language of the story cannot be toldby a parent to a child and to tell him that it was done to makemankind happier and better is making the story still worse as ifmankind could be improved by the example of murder and to tell himthat all this is a mystery is only making an excuse for theincredibility of it how different is this to the pure and simple profession of deism the true deist has but one deity and his religion consistsin contemplating the power wisdom and benignity of the deity inhis works and in endeavoring to imitate him in everything moralscientifical and mechanical the religion that approaches the nearest of all others to true deism in the moral and benign part thereof is that professed bythe quakers but they have contracted themselves too much byleaving the works of god out of their system though i reverence theirphilanthropy i cannot help smiling at the conceit that if thetaste of a quaker could have been consulted at the creation what asilent and drabcolored creation it would have been not a flowerwould have blossomed its gayeties nor a bird been permitted to sing quitting these reflections i proceed to other matters after ihad made myself master of the use of the globes and of the orreryand conceived an idea of the infinity of space and the eternaldivisibility of matter and obtained at least a general knowledge ofwhat is called natural philosophy i began to compare or as i havebefore said to confront the eternal evidence those things afford withthe christian system of faith as this book may fall into the hands of persons who do not knowwhat an orrery is it is for their information i add this note as thename gives no idea of the uses of thing the orrery has its namefrom the person who invented it it is a machinery of clockworkrepresenting the universe in miniature and in which the revolution ofthe earth round itself and round the sun the revolution of the moonround the earth the revolution of the planets round the sun theirrelative distances from the sun as the centre of the whole systemtheir relative distances from each other and their differentmagnitudes are represented as they really exist in what we call theheavens though it is not a direct article of the christian system thatthis world that we inhabit is the whole of the habitable creation yetit is so worked up therewith from what is called the mosaic accountof the creation the story of eve and the apple and the counterpartof that story the death of the son of god that to believe otherwisethat is to believe that god created a plurality of worlds at leastas numerous as what we call stars renders the christian system offaith at once little and ridiculous and scatters it in the mindlike feathers in the air the two beliefs cannot be held together inthe same mind and he who thinks that he believes both has thoughtbut little of either though the belief of a plurality of worlds was familiar to theancients it’s only within the last three centuries that the extentand dimensions of this globe that we inhabit have been ascertained several vessels following the tract of the ocean have sailedentirely round the world as a man may march in a circle and comeround by the contrary side of the circle to the spot he set outfrom the circular dimensions of our world in the widest part as aman would measure the widest round of an apple or ball is onlytwentyfive thousand and twenty english miles reckoning sixtyninemiles and a half to an equatorial degree and may be sailed round inthe space of about three years allowing a ship to sail on an average three miles in an hourshe would sail entirely round the world in less than one year ifshe could sail in a direct circle but she is obliged to follow thecourse of the ocean a world of this extent may at first thought appear to us to begreat but if we compare it with the immensity of space in which it issuspended like a bubble or balloon in the air it is infinitelyless in proportion than the smallest grain of sand is to the size ofthe world or the finest particle of dew to the whole ocean and istherefore but small and as will be hereafter shown is only one of asystem of worlds of which the universal creation is composed it is not difficult to gain some faint idea of the immensity ofspace in which this and all the other worlds are suspended if wefollow a progression of ideas when we think of the size or dimensionsof a room our ideas limit themselves to the walls and there theystop but when our eye or our imagination darts into space that iswhen it looks upward into what we call the open air we cannotconceive any walls or boundaries it can have and if for the sake ofresting our ideas we suppose a boundary the question immediatelyrenews itself and asks what is beyond that boundary and in the same manner what is beyond the next boundary and so on till thefatigued imagination returns and says there is no end certainlythen the creator was not pent for room when he made this world nolarger than it is and we have to seek the reason in something else if we take a survey of our own world or rather of this ofwhich the creator has given us the use as our portion in the immensesystem of creation we find every part of it the earth the watersand the air that surrounds it filled and as it were crowded withlife down from the largest animals that we know of to the smallestinsects the naked eye can behold and from thence to others stillsmaller and totally invisible without the assistance of themicroscope every tree every plant every leaf serves not only asa habitation but as a world to some numerous race till animalexistence becomes so exceedingly refined that the effluvia of ablade of grass would be food for thousands since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied why is it tobe supposed that the immensity of space is a naked void lying ineternal waste there is room for millions of worlds as large or largerthan ours and each of them millions of miles apart from each other having now arrived at this point if we carry our ideas only onethought further we shall see perhaps the true reason at least avery good reason for our happiness why the creator instead ofmaking one immense world extending over an immense quantity ofspace has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into severaldistinct and separate worlds which we call planets of which ourearth is one but before i explain my ideas upon this subject it isnecessary not for the sake of those who already know but for thosewho do not to show what the system of the universe is that part of the universe that is called the solar system meaningthe system of worlds to which our earth belongs and of which solor in english language the sun is the centre consists besidesthe sun of six distinct orbs or planets or worlds besides thesecondary called the satellites or moons of which our earth has onethat attends her in her annual revolution around the sun in likemanner as the other satellites or moons attend the planets or worldsto which they severally belong as may be seen by the assistance ofthe telescope the sun is the centre round which those six worlds or planetsrevolve at different distances therefrom and in circles concentrateto each other each world keeps constantly in nearly the same trackround the sun and continues at the same time turning round itselfin nearly an upright position as a top turns round itself when itis spinning on the ground and leans a little sideways it is this leaning of the earth 235 degrees that occasionssummer and winter and the different length of days and nights if the earth turned round itself in a position perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in around the sun as a top turnsround when it stands erect on the ground the days and nights would be always of the same length twelve hours day and twelve hours night and the seasons would be uniformly the same throughout the year every time that a planet our earth for example turns rounditself it makes what we call day and night and every time it goesentirely round the sun it makes what we call a year consequentlyour world turns three hundred and sixtyfive times round itself ingoing once round the sun those who supposed that the sun went round the earth every 24hours made the same mistake in idea that a cook would do in fact that should make the fire go round the meat instead of the meat turning round itself toward the fire the names that the ancients gave to those six worlds and whichare still called by the same names are mercury venus this worldthat we call ours mars jupiter and saturn they appear larger tothe eye than the stars being many million miles nearer to our earththan any of the stars are the planet venus is that which is calledthe evening star and sometimes the morning star as she happens toset after or rise before the sun which in either case is never morethan three hours the sun as before said being the centre the planet or worldnearest the sun is mercury his distance from the sun is thirtyfourmillion miles and he moves round in a circle always at thatdistance from the sun as a top may be supposed to spin round in thetrack in which a horse goes in a mill the second world is venusshe is fiftyseven million miles distant from the sun andconsequently moves round in a circle much greater than that of mercury the third world is this that we inhabit and which iseightyeight million miles distant from the sun and consequentlymoves round in a circle greater than that of venus the fourth worldis mars he is distant from the sun one hundred and thirtyfourmillion miles and consequently moves round in a circle greater thanthat of our earth the fifth is jupiter he is distant from the sunfive hundred and fiftyseven million miles and consequently movesround in a circle greater than that of mars the sixth world is saturn he is distant from the sun seven hundred and sixtythreemillion miles and consequently moves round in a circle that surroundsthe circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets the space therefore in the air or in the immensity of spacethat our solar system takes up for the several worlds to perform theirrevolutions in round the sun is of the extent in a straight line ofthe whole diameter of the orbit or circle in which saturn moves roundthe sun which being double his distance from the sun is fifteenhundred and twentysix million miles and its circular extent is nearlyfive thousand million and its globular contents is almost threethousand five hundred million times three thousand five hundredmillion square miles if it should be asked how can man know these things i haveone plain answer to give which is that man knows how to calculate aneclipse and also how to calculate to a minute of time when the planet venus in making her revolutions around the sun will come in astraight line between our earth and the sun and will appear to usabout the size of a large pea passing across the face of the sun thishappens but twice in about a hundred years at the distance of abouteight years from each other and has happened twice in our timeboth of which were foreknown by calculation it can also be known when they will happen again for a thousand years to come or to any other portion of time as therefore man could not be able to do thesethings if he did not understand the solar system and the manner inwhich the revolutions of the several planets or worlds areperformed the fact of calculating an eclipse or a transit of venus is a proof in point that the knowledge exists and as to afew thousand or even a few million miles more or less it makesscarcely any sensible difference in such immense distances but this immense as it is is only one system of worlds beyondthis at a vast distance into space far beyond all power ofcalculation are the stars called the fixed stars they are calledfixed because they have no revolutionary motion as the six worlds orplanets have that i have been describing those fixed stars continuealways at the same distance from each other and always in the sameplace as the sun does in the centre of our system the probabilitytherefore is that each of these fixed stars is also a sun roundwhich another system of worlds or planets though too remote for us to discover performs its revolutions as our system of worlds does round our central sun by this easy progression of ideas the immensity of space willappear to us to be filled with systems of worlds and that no partof space lies at waste any more than any part of the globe of earthand water is left unoccupied having thus endeavored to convey in a familiar and easy mannersome idea of the structure of the universe i return to explain what i before alluded to namely the great benefits arising to man inconsequence of the creator having made a plurality of worlds suchas our system is consisting of a central sun and six worldsbesides satellites in preference to that of creating one world onlyof a vast extent it is an idea i have never lost sight of that all our knowledgeof science is derived from the revolutions exhibited to our eye andfrom thence to our understanding which those several planets orworlds of which our system is composed make in their circuit round the sun had then the quantity of matter which these six worlds containbeen blended into one solitary globe the consequence to us would have been that either no revolutionary motion would have existed or not a sufficiency of it to give to us the idea and the knowledge of science we now have and it is from the sciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute so much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived as therefore the creator made nothing in vain so also must itbe believed that he organized the structure of the universe in themost advantageous manner for the benefit of man and as we see and from experience feel the benefits we derive from the structure of the universe formed as it is which benefits we should not have had the opportunity of enjoying if the structure so far as relates to oursystem had been a solitary globe we can discover at least one reasonwhy a plurality of worlds has been made and that reason calls forththe devotional gratitude of man as well as his admiration but it is not to us the inhabitants of this globe only that thebenefits arising from a plurality of worlds are limited theinhabitants of each of the worlds of which our system is composedenjoy the same opportunities of knowledge as we do they behold therevolutionary motions of our earth as we behold theirs all theplanets revolve in sight of each other and therefore the sameuniversal school of science presents itself to all neither does the knowledge stop here the system of worlds next tous exhibits in its revolutions the same principles and school ofscience to the inhabitants of their system as our system does tous and in like manner throughout the immensity of space our ideas not only of the almightiness of the creator but of hiswisdom and his beneficence become enlarged in proportion as wecontemplate the extent and the structure of the universe the solitaryidea of a solitary world rolling or at rest in the immense ocean ofspace gives place to the cheerful idea of a society of worlds sohappily contrived as to administer even by their motioninstruction to man we see our own earth filled with abundance but we forget to consider how much of that abundance is owing to thescientific knowledge the vast machinery of the universe has unfolded but in the midst of those reflections what are we to think ofthe christian system of faith that forms itself upon the idea of onlyone world and that of no greater extent as is before shown thantwentyfive thousand miles an extent which a man walking at therate of three miles an hour for twelve hours in the day could hekeep on in a circular direction would walk entirely round in lessthan two years alas what is this to the mighty ocean of space andthe almighty power of the creator from whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceitthat the almighty who had millions of worlds equally dependent on hisprotection should quit the care of all the rest and come to die inour world because they say one man and one woman had eaten anapple and on the other hand are we to suppose that every world inthe boundless creation had an eve an apple a serpent and aredeemer in this case the person who is irreverently called the son of god and sometimes god himself would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world in an endless succession ofdeaths with scarcely a momentary interval of life it has been by rejecting the evidence that the word or works of god in the creation afford to our senses and the action of our reasonupon that evidence that so many wild and whimsical systems of faithand of religion have been fabricated and set up there may be manysystems of religion that so far from being morally bad are in manyrespects morally good but there can be but one that is true and thatone necessarily must as it ever will be in all things consistentwith the everexisting word of god that we behold in his works butsuch is the strange construction of the christian system of faith thatevery evidence the heavens afford to man either directly contradictsit or renders it absurd it is possible to believe and i always feel pleasure inencouraging myself to believe it that there have been men in theworld who persuade themselves that what is called a pious fraud might at least under particular circumstances be productive of some good but the fraud being once established could not afterward beexplained for it is with a pious fraud as with a bad action itbegets a calamitous necessity of going on the persons who first preached the christian system of faithand in some measure combined it with the morality preached by jesus christ might persuade themselves that it was better than theheathen mythology that then prevailed from the first preachers thefraud went on to the second and to the third till the idea of itsbeing a pious fraud became lost in the belief of its being true andthat belief became again encouraged by the interests of those who made a livelihood by preaching it but though such a belief might by such means be rendered almostgeneral among the laity it is next to impossible to account for thecontinual persecution carried on by the church for several hundredyears against the sciences and against the professors of scienceif the church had not some record or tradition that it wasoriginally no other than a pious fraud or did not foresee that itcould not be maintained against the evidence that the structure of theuniverse afforded having thus shown the irreconcilable inconsistencies between thereal word of god existing in the universe and that which is calledthe word of god as shown to us in a printed book that any man mightmake i proceed to speak of the three principal means that have beenemployed in all ages and perhaps in all countries to impose uponmankind those three means are mystery miracle and prophecy the twofirst are incompatible with true religion and the third oughtalways to be suspected with respect to mystery everything we behold is in one sensea mystery to us our own existence is a mystery the whole vegetableworld is a mystery we cannot account how it is that an acorn whenput into the ground is made to develop itself and become an oak we know not how it is that the seed we sow unfolds and multipliesitself and returns to us such an abundant interest for so small acapital the fact however as distinct from the operating cause is nota mystery because we see it and we know also the means we are touse which is no other than putting the seed into the ground we know therefore as much as is necessary for us to know and that part of the operation that we do not know and which if we did we couldnot perform the creator takes upon himself and performs it for us weare therefore better off than if we had been let into the secretand left to do it for ourselves but though every created thing is in this sense a mystery theword mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light the god in whom we believe is a god of moral truth and not a god of mystery or obscurity mystery is theantagonist of truth it is a fog of human invention that obscurestruth and represents it in distortion truth never envelops itself inmystery and the mystery in which it is at any time enveloped is thework of its antagonist and never of itself religion therefore being the belief of a god and the practice ofmoral truth cannot have connection with mystery the belief of a godso far from having anything of mystery in it is of all beliefs themost easy because it arises to us as is before observed out ofnecessity and the practice of moral truth or in other words apractical imitation of the moral goodness of god is no other than ouracting toward each other as he acts benignly toward all we cannotserve god in the manner we serve those who cannot do without suchservice and therefore the only idea we can have of serving godis that of contributing to the happiness of the living creation that god has made this cannot be done by retiring ourselves from thesociety of the world and spending a recluse life in selfish devotion the very nature and design of religion if i may so express itprove even to demonstration that it must be free from everything ofmystery and unencumbered with everything that is mysterious religion considered as a duty is incumbent upon every living soulalike and therefore must be on a level with the understanding andcomprehension of all man does not learn religion as he learns thesecrets and mysteries of a trade he learns the theory of religionby reflection it arises out of the action of his own mind upon thethings which he sees or upon what he may happen to hear or to readand the practice joins itself thereto when men whether from policy or pious fraud set up systems ofreligion incompatible with the word or works of god in the creationand not only above but repugnant to human comprehension they were under the necessity of inventing or adopting a word that shouldserve as a bar to all questions inquiries and speculation the wordmystery answered this purpose and thus it has happened that religion which is in itself without mystery has been corrupted into a fog of mysteries as mystery answered all general purposes miracle followed as anoccasional auxiliary the former served to bewilder the mind thelatter to puzzle the senses the one was the lingo the other thelegerdemain but before going further into this subject it will be proper toinquire what is to be understood by a miracle in the same sense that everything may be said to be a mysteryso also may it be said that everything is a miracle and that no onething is a greater miracle than another the elephant thoughlarger is not a greater miracle than a mite nor a mountain a greatermiracle than an atom to an almighty power it is no more difficult tomake the one than the other and no more difficult to make millions ofworlds than to make one everything therefore is a miracle in onesense whilst in the other sense there is no such thing as a miracle it is a miracle when compared to our power and to our comprehension if not a miracle compared to the power that performs it but as nothing in this description conveys the idea that is affixed to the word miracle it is necessary to carry the inquiry further mankind have conceived to themselves certain laws by which whatthey call nature is supposed to act and that miracle is somethingcontrary to the operation and effect of those laws but unless we knowthe whole extent of those laws and of what are commonly called thepowers of nature we are not able to judge whether anything that mayappear to us wonderful or miraculous be within or be beyond or becontrary to her natural power of acting the ascension of a man several miles high in the air would haveeverything in it that constitutes the idea of a miracle if it werenot known that a species of air can be generated several timeslighter than the common atmospheric air and yet possess elasticityenough to prevent the balloon in which that light air is enclosed frombeing compressed into as many times less bulk by the common air that surrounds it in like manner extracting flames or sparks of fire from the human body as visible as from a steel struck with a flint andcausing iron or steel to move without any visible agent would alsogive the idea of a miracle if we were not acquainted with electricityand magnetism so also would many other experiments in naturalphilosophy to those who are not acquainted with the subject therestoring persons to life who are to appearance dead as ispractised upon drowned persons would also be a miracle if it werenot known that animation is capable of being suspended without beingextinct besides these there are performances by sleightofhand and bypersons acting in concert that have a miraculous appearance whichwhen known are thought nothing of and besides these there aremechanical and optical deceptions there is now an exhibition in parisof ghosts or spectres which though it is not imposed upon thespectators as a fact has an astonishing appearance as therefore weknow not the extent to which either nature or art can go there isno positive criterion to determine what a miracle is and mankindin giving credit to appearances under the idea of there beingmiracles are subject to be continually imposed upon since then appearances are so capable of deceiving and thingsnot real have a strong resemblance to things that are nothing canbe more inconsistent than to suppose that the almighty would makeuse of means such as are called miracles that would subject theperson who performed them to the suspicion of being an impostor andthe person who related them to be suspected of lying and the doctrineintended to be supported thereby to be suspected as a fabulousinvention of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtainbelief to any system or opinion to which the name of religion has beengiven that of miracle however successful the imposition may havebeen is the most inconsistent for in the first place wheneverrecourse is had to show for the purpose of procuring that belief for a miracle under any idea of the word is a show it implies alameness or weakness in the doctrine that is preached and in thesecond place it is degrading the almighty into the character of ashowman playing tricks to amuse and make the people stare and wonder it is also the most equivocal sort of evidence that can be set up for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle but upon the credit of the reporter who says that he saw it andtherefore the thing were it true would have no better chance ofbeing believed than if it were a lie suppose i were to say that when i sat down to write this booka hand presented itself in the air took up the pen and wrote everyword that is herein written would anybody believe me certainlythey would not would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact certainly they would not since then a real miraclewere it to happen would be subject to the same fate as the falsehoodthe inconsistency becomes the greater of supposing the almightywould make use of means that would not answer the purpose for which they were intended even if they were real if we are to suppose a miracle to be something so entirely outof the course of what is called nature that she must go out of thatcourse to accomplish it and we see an account given of such miracleby the person who said he saw it it raises a question in the mindvery easily decided which is is it more probable that natureshould go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie wehave never seen in our time nature go out of her course but we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in thesame time it is therefore at least millions to one that thereporter of a miracle tells a lie the story of the whale swallowing jonah though a whale is largeenough to do it borders greatly on the marvelous but it would haveapproached nearer to the idea of a miracle if jonah had swallowed thewhale in this which may serve for all cases of miracles thematter would decide itself as before stated namely is it morethat a man should have swallowed a whale or told a lie but suppose that jonah had really swallowed the whale and gonewith it in his belly to nineveh and to convince the people that itwas true had cast it up in their sight of the full length and sizeof a whale would they not have believed him to be the devilinstead of a prophet or if the whale had carried jonah to ninevahand cast him up in the same public manner would they not havebelieved the whale to have been the devil and jonah one of his imps the most extraordinary of all the things called miraclesrelated in the new testament is that of the devil flying away with jesus christ and carrying him to the top of a high mountain and tothe top of the highest pinnacle of the temple and showing him andpromising to him all the kingdoms of the world how happened it thathe did not discover america or is it only with kingdoms that hissooty highness has any interest i have too much respect for the moral character of christ tobelieve that he told this whale of a miracle himself neither is iteasy to account for what purpose it could have been fabricated unlessit were to impose upon the connoisseurs of queen annes farthingsand collectors of relics and antiquities or to render the belief ofmiracles ridiculous by outdoing miracles as don quixote outdidchivalry or to embarrass the belief of miracles by making itdoubtful by what power whether of god or of the devil anythingcalled a miracle was performed it requires however a great dealof faith in the devil to believe this miracle in every point of view in which those things called miracles canbe placed and considered the reality of them is improbable andtheir existence unnecessary they would not as before observedanswer any useful purpose even if they were true for it is moredifficult to obtain belief to a miracle than to a principle evidentlymoral without any miracle moral principle speaks universally foritself miracle could be but a thing of the moment and seen but bya few after this it requires a transfer of faith from god to man tobelieve a miracle upon mans report instead therefore ofadmitting the recitals of miracles as evidence of any system ofreligion being true they ought to be considered as symptoms of itsbeing fabulous it is necessary to the full and upright character oftruth that it rejects the crutch and it is consistent with thecharacter of fable to seek the aid that truth rejects thus much formystery and miracle as mystery and miracle took charge of the past and the presentprophecy took charge of the future and rounded the tenses of faith itwas not sufficient to know what had been done but what would be done the supposed prophet was the supposed historian of times to come and if he happened in shooting with a long bow of a thousand years to strike within a thousand miles of a mark the ingenuity of posterity could make it pointblank and if he happened to be directlywrong it was only to suppose as in the case of jonah and ninevehthat god had repented himself and changed his mind what a fool dofabulous systems make of manit has been shown in a former part of this work that theoriginal meaning of the words prophet and prophesying has beenchanged and that a prophet in the sense of the word as now usedis a creature of modern invention and it is owing to this change inthe meaning of the words that the flights and metaphors of the jewishpoets and phrases and expressions now rendered obscure by our notbeing acquainted with the local circumstances to which they applied atthe time they were used have been erected into prophecies and made to bend to explanations at the will and whimsical conceits ofsectaries expounders and commentators everything unintelligible was prophetical and everything insignificant was typical a blunder would have served for a prophecy and a dishclout for a type if by a prophet we are to suppose a man to whom the almightycommunicated some event that would take place in future eitherthere were such men or there were not if there were it is consistentto believe that the event so communicated would be told in termsthat could be understood and not related in such a loose andobscure manner as to be out of the comprehension of those that heardit and so equivocal as to fit almost any circumstance that may happenafterward it is conceiving very irreverently of the almighty tosuppose that he would deal in this jesting manner with mankind yetall the things called prophecies in the book called the bible comeunder this description but it is with prophecy as it is with miracle it could not answerthe purpose even if it were real those to whom a prophecy should betold could not tell whether the man prophesied or lied or whether ithad been revealed to him or whether he conceited it and if the thingthat he prophesied or intended to prophesy should happen orsomething like it among the multitude of things that are dailyhappening nobody could again know whether he foreknew it orguessed at it or whether it was accidental a prophet thereforeis a character useless and unnecessary and the safe side of thecase is to guard against being imposed upon by not giving credit tosuch relations upon the whole mystery miracle and prophecy are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion they are the means by which so many lo heres and lo theres have been spread about the world and religion been made into a trade the success of oneimposter gave encouragement to another and the quieting salvo ofdoing some good by keeping up a pious fraud protected them fromremorse having now extended the subject to a greater length than i firstintended i shall bring it to a close by abstracting a summary fromthe whole first that the idea or belief of a word of god existing inprint or in writing or in speech is inconsistent in itself forreasons already assigned these reasons among many others are thewant of a universal language the mutability of language the errorsto which translations are subject the possibility of totallysuppressing such a word the probability of altering it or offabricating the whole and imposing it upon the world secondly that the creation we behold is the real andeverexisting word of god in which we cannot be deceived itproclaims his power it demonstrates his wisdom it manifests hisgoodness and beneficence thirdly that the moral duty of man consists in imitating themoral goodness and beneficence of god manifested in the creationtoward all his creatures that seeing as we daily do the goodnessof god to all men it is an example calling upon all men to practicethe same toward each other and consequently that everything ofpersecution and revenge between man and man and everything ofcruelty to animals is a violation of moral duty i trouble not myself about the manner of future existence icontent myself with believing even to positive conviction that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it in any form andmanner he pleases either with or without this body and it appearsmore probable to me that i shall continue to exist hereafter thanthat i should have had existence as i now have before that existencebegan it is certain that in one point all the nations of the earth andall religions agree all believe in a god the things in which theydisagree are the redundancies annexed to that belief and thereforeif ever a universal religion should prevail it will not be bybelieving anything new but in getting rid of redundancies andbelieving as man believed at first adam if ever there were such aman was created a deist but in the meantime let every man followas he has a right to do the religion and the worship he prefers end of the first part thus far i had written on the 28th of december 1793 in theevening i went to the hotel philadelphia formerly whites hotelpassage des petis peres where i lodged when i came to paris inconsequence of being elected a member of the convention but leftthe lodging about nine months and taken lodgings in the rue fauxbourg st denis for the sake of being more retired than i could be in the middle of the town meeting with a company of americans at the hotel philadelphia iagreed to spend the evening with them and as my lodging wasdistant about a mile and a half i bespoke a bed at the hotel thecompany broke up about twelve oclock and i went directly to bed about four in the morning i was awakened by a rapping at my chamber door when i opened it i saw a guard and the master of the hotel with them the guard told me they came to put me under arrestation and to demand the key of my papers i desired them to walk in and i would dress myself and go with them immediately it happened that achilles audibert of calais was then in thehotel and i desired to be conducted into his room when we camethere i told the guard that i had only lodged at the hotel for thenight that i was printing a work and that part of that work was atthe maison bretagne rue jacob and desired they would take me there first which they did the printingoffice at which the work was printing was near to the maison bretagne where colonel blackden and joel barlow of the united states of america lodged and i had desired joel barlow to compare the proofsheets with the copy as they came from the press the remainder of the manuscript from page 32 to 76 was at my lodging but besides the necessity of my collecting all the parts of the work together that the publication might not be interrupted by my imprisonment or by any event that might happen to me it was highly proper that i should have a fellowcitizen of america with me during the examination of my papers as i had letters of correspondence in my possession of the president of congress general washington the minister of foreign affairs to congress mr jefferson and the late benjamin franklin and it might be necessary for me to make a procesverbal to send to congress it happened that joel barlow had received only one proofsheetof the work which he had compared with the copy and sent it back tothe printingoffice we then went in company with joel barlow to my lodging andthe guard or commissaires took with them the interpreter to the committee of suretygeneral it was satisfactory to me that they went through the examination of my papers with the strictness they did and it is but justice that i say they did it not only with civilitybut with tokens of respect to my character i showed them the remainder of the manuscript of the foregoingwork the interpreter examined it and returned it to me saying itis an interesting work it will do much good i also showed himanother manuscript which i had intended for the committee of public safety it is entitled observations on the commerce between the united states of america and france after the examination of my papers was finished the guardconducted me to the prison of the luxembourg where they left me asthey would a man whose undeserved fate they regretted i offered towrite under the procesverbal they had made that they had executedtheir orders with civility but they declined it thomas paine the age of reasonpart second preface to part iii have mentioned in the former part of the age of reason that ithad long been my intention to publish my thoughts upon religion butthat i had originally reserved it to a later period in lifeintending it to be the last work i should undertake thecircumstances however which existed in france in the latter end ofthe year 1793 determined me to delay it no longer the just andhumane principles of the revolution which philosophy had firstdiffused had been departed from the idea always dangerous tosociety as it is derogatory to the almighty that priests couldforgive sins though it seemed to exist no longer had blunted thefeelings of humanity and prepared men for the commission of allmanner of crimes the intolerant spirit of church persecutions hadtransferred itself into politics the tribunal styled revolutionarysupplied the place of an inquisition and the guillotine and the stakeoutdid the fire and fagot of the church i saw many of my mostintimate friends destroyed others daily carried to prison and ihad reason to believe and had also intimations given me that thesame danger was approaching myself under these disadvantages i began the former part of the age of reason i had besides neither bible nor testament to refer tothough i was writing against both nor could i procure anynotwithstanding which i have produced a work that no biblebeliever though writing at his ease and with a library of churchbooks about him can refute toward the latter end of december of that year a motion wasmade and carried to exclude foreigners from the convention therewere but two in it anacharsis cloots and myself and i saw i wasparticularly pointed at by bourdon de loise in his speech on thatmotion conceiving after this that i had but a few days of liberty isat down and brought the work to a close as speedily as possibleand i had not finished it more than six hours in the state it hassince appeared before a guard came there about three in the morning with an order signed by the two committees of public safety and surety general for putting me in arrestation as a foreigner and conveyed me to the prison of the luxembourg i contrived on my way there to call on joel barlow and i put the manuscript of the work into his hands as more safe than in my possession in prison and not knowing what might be the fate in france either of the writer or the work i addressed it to the protection of the citizens of the united states it is with justice that i say that the guard who executed thisorder and the interpreter of the committee of general surety whoaccompanied them to examine my papers treated me not only withcivility but with respect the keeper of the luxembourg bennoit aman of a good heart showed to me every friendship in his power asdid also all his family while he continued in that station he wasremoved from it put into arrestation and carried before the tribunalupon a malignant accusation but acquitted after i had been in the luxembourg about three weeks the americans then in paris went in a body to the convention to reclaim me as their countryman and friend but were answered by the president vadier who was also president of the committee of suretygeneral and had signed the order for my arrestation that i was born in england i heard no more after this from any person out of the walls of the prison till the fall of robespierre on the 9th of thermidor july 27 1794 about two months before this event i was seized with a fever thatin its progress had every symptom of becoming mortal and from theeffects of which i am not recovered it was then that i rememberedwith renewed satisfaction and congratulated myself most sincerely onhaving written the former part of the age of reason i had then butlittle expectation of surviving and those about me had less iknow therefore by experience the conscientious trial of my ownprinciples i was then with three chamber comrades joseph vanhuele of bruges charles bastini and michael rubyns of louvain the unceasing and anxious attention of these three friends to me by night and by day i remember with gratitude and mention with pleasure it happened that a physician dr graham and a surgeon mr bond part of the suite of general ohara were then in the luxembourg i ask not myself whether it be convenient to them as men under the english government that i express to them my thanks but should reproach myself if i did not and also to the physician of the luxembourg dr markoski i have some reason to believe because i cannot discover any othercause that this illness preserved me in existence among the papersof robespierre that were examined and reported upon to the convention by a committee of deputies is a note in the handwritingof robespierre in the following wordsdemander que thomas paine soit decrete daccusation pourlinteret de lamerique autant que de la france to demand that a decree of accusation be passed against thomas paine for the interest of america as well as of france from what cause it was that the intention was not put in execution i know not and cannot inform myself and therefore i ascribe it toimpossibility on account of that illness the convention to repair as much as lay in their power theinjustice i had sustained invited me publicly and unanimously toreturn into the convention and which i accepted to show i could bearan injury without permitting it to injure my principles or mydisposition it is not because right principles have been violatedthat they are to be abandoned i have seen since i have been at liberty several publicationswritten some in america and some in england as answers to the former part of the age of reason if the authors of these can amusethemselves by so doing i shall not interrupt them they may writeagainst the work and against me as much as they please they do memore service than they intend and i can have no objection that theywrite on they will find however by this second part without itsbeing written as an answer to them that they must return to theirwork and spin their cobweb over again the first is brushed away byaccident they will now find that i have furnished myself with a bible and testament and i can say also that i have found them to be muchworse books than i had conceived if i have erred in anything in theformer part of the age of reason it has been by speaking better ofsome parts of those books than they have deserved i observe that all my opponents resort more or less to what theycall scripture evidence and bible authority to help them out they areso little masters of the subject as to confound a dispute aboutauthenticity with a dispute about doctrines i will however put themright that if they should be disposed to write any more they mayknow how to begin thomas paine october 1795chapter ias to the old testament it has often been said that anything may be proved from the bible but before anything can be admitted as proved by the bible the bible itself must be proved to be true for if the bible be nottrue or the truth of it be doubtful it ceases to have authority andcannot be admitted as proof of anything it has been the practice of all christian commentators on the bible and of all christian priests and preachers to impose the bibleon the world as a mass of truth and as the word of god they havedisputed and wrangled and anathematized each other about the supposed meaning of particular parts and passages therein one has said and insisted that such a passage meant such a thing another that it meant directly the contrary and a third that it meant neither one nor the other but something different from both and this they callunderstanding the bible it has happened that all the answers which i have seen to theformer part of the age of reason have been written by priests andthese pious men like their predecessors contend and wrangle andpretend to understand the bible each understands it differentlybut each understands it best and they have agreed in nothing but intelling their readers that thomas paine understands it not now instead of wasting their time and heating themselves infractious disputations about doctrinal points drawn from the biblethese men ought to know and if they do not it is civility toinform them that the first thing to be understood is whether thereis sufficient authority for believing the bible to be the word of godor whether there is not there are matters in that book said to be done by the expresscommand of god that are as shocking to humanity and to every ideawe have of moral justice as anything done by robespierre by carrier by joseph le bon in france by the english government in the east indies or by any other assassin in modern times when we read in the books ascribed to moses joshua etc that they the israelites came by stealth upon whole nations of people who ashistory itself shows had given them no offence that they put allthose nations to the sword that they spared neither age norinfancy that they utterly destroyed men women and children thatthey left not a soul to breathe expressions that are repeated overand over again in those books and that too with exulting ferocityare we sure these things are facts are we sure that the creator ofman commissioned these things to be done and are we sure that thebooks that tell us so were written by his authority it is not the antiquity of a tale that is any evidence of itstruth on the contrary it is a symptom of its being fabulous for themore ancient any history pretends to be the more it has theresemblance of a fable the origin of every nation is buried infabulous tradition and that of the jews is as much to be suspected asany other to charge the commission of acts upon the almightywhich in their own nature and by every rule of moral justice arecrimes as all assassination is and more especially the assassinationof infants is matter of serious concern the bible tells us thatthose assassinations were done by the express command of god tobelieve therefore the bible to be true we must unbelieve all ourbelief in the moral justice of god for wherein could crying orsmiling infants offend and to read the bible without horror wemust undo everything that is tender sympathizing and benevolent inthe heart of man speaking for myself if i had no other evidence thatthe bible is fabulous than the sacrifice i must make to believe itto be true that alone would be sufficient to determine my choice but in addition to all the moral evidence against the bible iwill in the progress of this work produce such other evidence aseven a priest cannot deny and show from that evidence that the bible is not entitled to credit as being the word of god but before i proceed to this examination i will show wherein the bible differs from all other ancient writings with respect to thenature of the evidence necessary to establish its authenticity andthis is the more proper to be done because the advocates of the bible in their answers to the former part of the age of reasonundertake to say and they put some stress thereon that theauthenticity of the bible is as well established as that of anyother ancient book as if our belief of the one could become anyrule for our belief of the other i know however but of one ancient book that authoritativelychallenges universal consent and belief and that is euclids elementsof geometry and the reason is because it is a book ofselfevident demonstration entirely independent of its author and ofeverything relating to time place and circumstance the matterscontained in that book would have the same authority they now havehad they been written by any other person or had the work beenanonymous or had the author never been known for the identicalcertainty of who was the author makes no part of our belief of thematters contained in the book but it is quite otherwise withrespect to the books ascribed to moses to joshua to samuel etc those are books of testimony and they testify of things naturallyincredible and therefore the whole of our belief as to theauthenticity of those books rests in the first place upon thecertainty that they were written by moses joshua and samuelsecondly upon the credit we give to their testimony we may believethe first that is we may believe the certainty of the authorshipand yet not the testimony in the same manner that we may believe that a certain person gave evidence upon a case and yet not believe the evidence that he gave but if it should be found that the booksascribed to moses joshua and samuel were not written by mosesjoshua and samuel every part of the authority and authenticity ofthose books is gone at once for there can be no such thing asforged or invented testimony neither can there be anonymoustestimony more especially as to things naturally incredible suchas that of talking with god face to face or that of the sun andmoon standing still at the command of a man the greatest part ofthe other ancient books are works of genius of which kind are thoseascribed to homer to plato to aristotle to demosthenes to cicero etc here again the author is not essential in the credit wegive to any of those works for as works of genius they would havethe same merit they have now were they anonymous nobody believes the trojan story as related by homer to be true for it is the poet only that is admired and the merit of the poet will remain though the story be fabulous but if we disbelieve the matters related by the bible authors moses for instance as we disbelieve the thingsrelated by homer there remains nothing of moses in our estimationbut an impostor as to the ancient historians from herodotus to tacitus we credit them as far as they relate things probable andcredible and no farther for if we do we must believe the twomiracles which tacitus relates were performed by vespasian that ofcuring a lame man and a blind man in just the same manner as the same things are told of jesus christ by his historians we must alsobelieve the miracle cited by josephus that of the sea of pamphiliaopening to let alexander and his army pass as is related of the red sea in exodus these miracles are quite as well authenticated as the bible miracles and yet we do not believe them consequently thedegree of evidence necessary to establish our belief of thingsnaturally incredible whether in the bible or elsewhere is fargreater than that which obtains our belief to natural and probablethings and therefore the advocates for the bible have no claim to ourbelief of the bible because that we believe things stated in otherancient writings since we believe the things stated in these writingsno further than they are probable and credible or because they areselfevident like euclid or admire them because they are elegantlike homer or approve of them because they are sedate like platoor judicious like aristotle euclid according to chronological history lived three hundredyears before christ and about one hundred before archimedes he was of the city of alexandria in egypt having premised these things i proceed to examine theauthenticity of the bible and i begin with what are called the fivebooks of moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy my intention is to show that those books are spuriousand that moses is not the author of them and still further that theywere not written in the time of moses nor till several hundredyears afterward that they are no other than an attempted history ofthe life of moses and of the times in which he is said to have livedand also of the times prior thereto written by some very ignorant andstupid pretenders to authorship several hundred years after the deathof moses as men now write histories of things that happened or aresupposed to have happened several hundred or several thousand years ago the evidence that i shall produce in this case is from the booksthemselves and i shall confine myself to this evidence only were ito refer for proof to any of the ancient authors whom the advocatesof the bible call profane authors they would controvert thatauthority as i controvert theirs i will therefore meet them on theirown ground and oppose them with their own weapon the bible in the first place there is no affirmative evidence that moses isthe author of those books and that he is the author is an altogetherunfounded opinion got abroad nobody knows how the style and manner in which those books were written give no room to believe or even to suppose they were written by moses for it is altogether the style and manner of another person speaking of moses in exodus leviticus and numbers for everything in genesis is prior to the time of moses and not the least allusion is made to him therein the whole i say of these books is in the third person it is always the lord said unto moses or moses said unto the lord or moses said unto the people or the people said unto moses and this is the style and manner that historians use in speaking of the persons whose lives and actions they are writing it may be said that a man may speak of himself in the third person and therefore it may be supposed that moses did but supposition proves nothing and if the advocates for the belief that moseswrote these books himself have nothing better to advance than supposition they may as well be silent but granting the grammatical right that moses might speak ofhimself in the third person because any man might speak of himself inthat manner it cannot be admitted as a fact in those books that it is moses who speaks without rendering moses truly ridiculous and absurd for example numbers chap xii ver 3 now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth if moses said this of himself instead of being the meekest of men he was one of the most vain and arrogant of coxcombs and the advocates for those books may now take which side they please for both sides are against them if moses was not the author the books are without authority and if he was the author the author is without credit because to boast of meekness is the reverse of meekness and is a lie in sentiment in deuteronomy the style and manner of writing marks moreevidently than in the former books that moses is not the writer themanner here used is dramatical the writer opens the subject by ashort introductory discourse and then introduces moses in the actof speaking and when he has made moses finish his harangue he thewriter resumes his own part and speaks till he brings mosesforward again and at last closes the scene with an account of thedeath funeral and character of moses this interchange of speakers occurs four times in this bookfrom the first verse of the first chapter to the end of the fifthverse it is the writer who speaks he then introduces moses as in theact of making his harangue and this continues to the end of the40th verse of the fourth chapter here the writer drops moses andspeaks historically of what was done in consequence of what moseswhen living is supposed to have said and which the writer hasdramatically rehearsed the writer opens the subject again in the first verse of the fifthchapter though it is only by saying that moses called the peopleof israel together he then introduces moses as before andcontinues him as in the act of speaking to the end of the 26thchapter he does the same thing at the beginning of the 27th chapterand continues moses as in the act of speaking to the end of the 28thchapter at the 29th chapter the writer speaks again through the whole of the first verse and the first line of the second verse where heintroduces moses for the last time and continues him as in the actof speaking to the end of the 33rd chapter the writer having now finished the rehearsal on the part of mosescomes forward and speaks through the whole of the last chapter hebegins by telling the reader that moses went to the top of pisgahthat he saw from thence the land which the writer says had beenpromised to abraham isaac and jacob that he moses died therein the land of moab but that no man knoweth of his sepulchre untothis day that is unto the time in which the writer lived who wrotethe book of deuteronomy the writer then tells us that moses was120 years of age when he died that his eye was not dim nor hisnatural force abated and he concludes by saying that there arosenot a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom says thisanonymous writer the lord knew face to face having thus shown as far as grammatical evidence applies that moses was not the writer of those books i will after making a fewobservations on the inconsistencies of the writer of the book of deuteronomy proceed to show from the historical and chronologicalevidence contained in those books that moses was not because hecould not be the writer of them and consequently that there is noauthority for believing that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of menwomen and children told of in those books were done as those books say they were at the command of god it is a duty incumbent on every true deist that he vindicate the moral justice of god againstthe calumnies of the bible the writer of the book of deuteronomy whoever he was for itis not an anonymous work is obscure and also in contradictionwith himself in the account he has given of moses after telling that moses went to the top of pisgah and it doesnot appear from any account that he ever came down again he tells us that moses died there in the land of moab and that he buried him in a valley in the land of moab but as there is no antecedent to the pronoun he there is no knowing who he was that did bury him if the writer meant that he god buried him how should he the writer know it or why should we the readers believe him since we know not who the writer was that tells us so for certainly moses could not himself tell where he was buried the writer also tells us that no man knoweth where thesepulchre of moses is unto this day meaning the time in which thiswriter lived how then should he know that moses was buried in avalley in the land of moab for as the writer lived long after thetime of moses as is evident from his using the expression of untothis day meaning a great length of time after the death of moseshe certainly was not at his funeral and on the other hand it isimpossible that moses himself could say that no man knoweth wherethe sepulchre is unto this day to make moses the speaker would be an improvement on the play of a child that hides himself and cries nobody can find me nobody can find mosesthis writer has nowhere told us how he came by the speecheswhich he has put into the mouth of moses to speak and therefore wehave a right to conclude that he either composed them himself orwrote them from oral tradition one or the other of these is themore probable since he has given in the fifth chapter a table ofcommandments in which that called the fourth commandment is different from the fourth commandment in the twentieth chapter of exodus in that of exodus the reason given for keeping the seventh day is because says the commandment god made the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh but in that of deuteronomy the reason given is that it was the day on which the children of israel came out of egypt and therefore says this commandment the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day this makes no mention of the creation nor that of the coming out of egypt there are also many things given as laws of moses in this book that are not to be found in any of the other books among which is that inhuman and brutal law chapter xxi verses 18 19 20 and 21 which authorizes parents the father and the mother to bring their own children to have them stoned to death for what it is pleased to call stubbornness but priests have always been fond of preaching up deuteronomy for deuteronomy preaches up tithes and it is from this book chap xxv ver 4 that they have taken the phrase and applied it to tithing that thou shall not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn and that this might not escape observation they have noted it in the table of contents at the head of the chapter though it is only a single verse of less than two lines oh priests priests ye are willing to be compared to an ox for the sake of tithes though it is impossible for us to know identically who the writer of deuteronomy was it is not difficult to discover himprofessionally that he was some jewish priest who lived as ishall show in the course of this work at least three hundred andfifty years after the time of moses i come now to speak of the historical and chronologicalevidence the chronology that i shall use is the bible chronology for i mean not to go out of the bible for evidence of anything but tomake the bible itself prove historically and chronologically that moses is not the author of the books ascribed to him it istherefore proper that i inform the reader such a one at least as maynot have the opportunity of knowing it that in the larger biblesand also in some smaller ones there is a series of chronology printedin the margin of every page for the purpose of showing how long thehistorical matters stated in each page happened or are supposed tohave happened before christ and consequently the distance oftime between one historical circumstance and another i begin with the book of genesis in the 14th chapter of genesis the writer gives an account of lot being taken prisoner ina battle between the four kings against five and carried off andthat when the account of lot being taken came to abraham he armedall his household and marched to rescue lot from the captors and thathe pursued them unto dan ver 14 to show in what manner this expression pursuing them unto danapplies to the case in question i will refer to two circumstancesthe one in america the other in france the city now called new yorkin america was originally new amsterdam and the town in francelately called havre marat was before called havre de grace new amsterdam was changed to new york in the year 1664 havre de grace to havre marat in 1793 should therefore any writing be foundthough without date in which the name of new york should bementioned it would be certain evidence that such a uniting couldnot have been written before but must have been written after new amsterdam was changed to new york and consequently not till afterthe year 1664 or at least during the course of that year and inlike manner any dateless writing with the name of havre marat wouldbe certain evidence that such a writing must have been written after havre de grace became havre marat and consequently not till after the year 1793 or at least during the course of that year i now come to the application of those cases and to show thatthere was no such place as dan till many years after the death of moses and consequently that moses could not be the writer of thebook of genesis where this account of pursuing them unto dan isgiven the place that is called dan in the bible was originally a townof the gentiles called laish and when the tribe of dan seized uponthis town they changed its name to dan in commemoration of danwho was the father of that tribe and the great grandson of abraham to establish this in proof it is necessary to refer from genesisto the 18th chapter of the book called the book of judges it is theresaid ver 27 that they the danites came unto laish to a peoplethat were quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of thesword the bible is filled with murder and burned the city withfire and they built a city ver 28 and dwelt therein and theycalled the name of the city dan after the name of dan theirfather howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first this account of the danites taking possession of laish andchanging it to dan is placed in the book of judges immediatelyafter the death of sampson the death of sampson is said to havehappened 1120 years before christ and that of moses 1451 before christ and therefore according to the historical arrangement theplace was not called dan till 331 years after the death of moses there is a striking confusion between the historical and thechronological arrangement in the book of judges the five lastchapters as they stand in the book 17 18 19 20 21 are putchronologically before all the preceding chapters they are made to be28 years before the 16th chapter 266 before the 15th 245 beforethe 13th 195 before the 9th 90 before the 4th and 15 years beforethe 1st chapter this shows the uncertain and fabulous state of the bible according to the chronological arrangement the taking of laishand giving it the name of dan is made to be 20 years after the deathof joshua who was the successor of moses and by the historical orderas it stands in the book it is made to be 306 years after the deathof joshua and 331 after that of moses but they both exclude mosesfrom being the writer of genesis because according to either ofthe statements no such place as dan existed in the time of moses and therefore the writer of genesis must have been some person who lived after the town of laish had the name of dan and who that person was nobody knows and consequently the book of genesis is anonymous and without authority i proceed now to state another point of historical andchronological evidence and to show therefrom as in the precedingcase that moses is not the author of the book of genesis in the 36th chapter of genesis there is given a genealogy of thesons and descendants of esau who are called edomites and also alist by name of the kings of edom in enumerating of which it issaid verse 31 and these are the kings that reigned in edom beforethere reigned any king over the children of israel now were any dateless writings to be found in which speakingof any past events the writer should say these things happenedbefore there was any congress in america or before there was any convention in france it would be evidence that such writing could nothave been written before and could only be written after there wasa congress in america or a convention in france as the case mightbe and consequently that it could not be written by any personwho died before there was a congress in the one country or a convention in the other nothing is more frequent as well in history as in conversationthan to refer to a fact in the room of a date it is most natural soto do first because a fact fixes itself in the memory better thana date secondly because the fact includes the date and serves toexcite two ideas at once and this manner of speaking by circumstances implies as positively that the fact alluded to is past as if it were so expressed when a person speaking upon any matter says it was before i was married or before my son was born or before i went to america or before i went to france it is absolutely understood and intended to be understood that he had been married that he has had a son that he has been in america or been in france language does not admit of using this mode of expression in any other sense and whenever such an expression is found anywhere it can only be understood in the sense in which it only could have been used the passage therefore that i have quoted that these are thekings that reigned in edom before there reigned any king over thechildren of israel could only have been written after the firstking began to reign over them and consequently that the book of genesis so far from having been written by moses could not have been written till the time of saul at least this is the positive senseof the passage but the expression any king implies more kingsthan one at least it implies two and this will carry it to thetime of david and if taken in a general sense it carries itthrough all the time of the jewish monarchy had we met with this verse in any part of the bible that professedto have been written after kings began to reign in israel it wouldhave been impossible not to have seen the application of it ithappens then that this is the case the two books of chronicles whichgave a history of all the kings of israel are professedly as wellas in fact written after the jewish monarchy began and this versethat i have quoted and all the remaining verses of the 36th chapterof genesis are word for word in the first chapter of chroniclesbeginning at the 43d verse it was with consistency that the writer of the chronicles couldsay as he has said 1st chron chap i ver 43 these are thekings that reigned in the land of edom before any king reigned overthe children of israel because he was going to give and has given alist of the kings that had reigned in israel but as it isimpossible that the same expression could have been used before thatperiod it is as certain as anything that can be proved fromhistorical language that this part of genesis is taken from chroniclesand that genesis is not so old as chronicles and probably not soold as the book of homer or as aesops fables admitting homer tohave been as the tables of chronology state contemporary with david or solomon and aesop to have lived about the end of the jewish monarchy take away from genesis the belief that moses was the author onwhich only the strange belief that it is the word of god has stoodand there remains nothing of genesis but an anonymous book of stories fables and traditionary or invented absurdities or of downright lies the story of eve and the serpent and of noah and his ark drops to a level with the arabian tales without the merit of beingentertaining and the account of men living to eight and ninehundred years becomes as fabulous immortality of the giants of the mythology besides the character of moses as stated in the bible is themost horrid that can be imagined if those accounts be true he wasthe wretch that first began and carried on wars on the score or on thepretence of religion and under that mask or that infatuationcommitted the most unexampled atrocities that are to be found in thehistory of any nation of which i will state only one instance when the jewish army returned from one of their plundering andmurdering excursions the account goes on as follows numbers chapxxxi ver 13and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of thecongregation went forth to meet them without the camp and moseswas wroth with the officers of the host with the captains overthousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive behold these caused the children of israel through the council of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him but all the womenchildren that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves among the detestable villains that in any period of the world havedisgraced the name of man it is impossible to find a greater than moses if this account be true here is an order to butcher theboys to massacre the mothers and debauch the daughters let any mother put herself in the situation of those mothersone child murdered another destined to violation and herself inthe hands of an executioner let any daughter put herself in thesituation of those daughters destined as a prey to the murderers of amother and a brother and what will be their feelings it is in vainthat we attempt to impose upon nature for nature will have hercourse and the religion that tortures all her social ties is afalse religion after this detestable order follows an account of the plundertaken and the manner of dividing it and here it is that theprofaneness of priestly hypocrisy increases the catalogue of crimes ver 37 to 40 and the lords tribute of sheep was six hundred andthree score and fifteen and the beeves were thirty and sixthousand of which the lords tribute was three score and twelveand the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lords tribute was three score and one and the persons were sixteenthousand of which the lords tribute was thirty and two persons in short the matters contained in this chapter as well as in manyother parts of the bible are too horrid for humanity to read or fordecency to hear for it appears from the 35th verse of thischapter that the number of womenchildren consigned to debaucheryby the order of moses was thirtytwo thousand people in general do not know what wickedness there is in thispretended word of god brought up in habits of superstition they takeit for granted that the bible is true and that it is good theypermit themselves not to doubt of it and they carry the ideas theyform of the benevolence of the almighty to the book which they havebeen taught to believe was written by his authority good heavensit is quite another thing it is a book of lies wickedness andblasphemy for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe thewickedness of man to the orders of the almighty but to return to my subject that of showing that moses is not theauthor of the books ascribed to him and that the bible is spurious the two instances i have already given would be sufficient without anyadditional evidence to invalidate the authenticity of any book thatpretended to be four or five hundred years more ancient than thematters it speaks of or refers to as facts for in the case ofpursuing them unto dan and of the kings that reigned over thechildren of israel not even the flimsy pretence of prophecy can bepleaded the expressions are in the preter tense and it would bedownright idiotism to say that a man could prophecy in the pretertense but there are many other passages scattered throughout those books that unite in the same point of evidence it is said in exodus another of the books ascribed to moses chap xvi verse 34 andthe children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came toa land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto theborders of the land of canaan whether the children of israel ate manna or not or what mannawas or whether it was anything more than a kind of fungus or smallmushroom or other vegetable substance common to that part of thecountry makes nothing to my argument all that i mean to show isthat it is not moses that could write this account because theaccount extends itself beyond the life and time of moses mosesaccording to the bible but it is such a book of lies andcontradictions there is no knowing which part to believe or whetherany died in the wilderness and never came upon the borders of theland of cannan and consequently it could not be he that said what thechildren of israel did or what they ate when they came there thisaccount of eating manna which they tell us was written by mosesextends itself to the time of joshua the successor of moses asappears by the account given in the book of joshua after the childrenof israel had passed the river jordan and came unto the borders ofthe land of canaan joshua chap v verse 12 and the mannaceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of theland neither had the children of israel manna any more but theydid eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year but a more remarkable instance than this occurs in deuteronomywhich while it shows that moses could not be the writer of that bookshows also the fabulous notions that prevailed at that time aboutgiants in the third chapter of deuteronomy among the conquestssaid to be made by moses is an account of the taking of og king of bashan v ii for only og king of bashan remained of the remnantof giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of the children of ammom nine cubits was the lengththereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of aman a cubit is 1 foot 9 8881000ths inches the length thereforeof the bed was 16 feet 4 inches and the breadth 7 feet 4 inches thusmuch for this giants bed now for the historical part whichthough the evidence is not so direct and positive as in the formercases it is nevertheless very presumable and corroboratingevidence and is better that the best evidence on the contrary side the writer by way of proving the existence of this giantrefers to his bed as an ancient relic and says is it not in rabbath or rabbah of the children of ammon meaning that it isfor such is frequently the bible method of affirming a thing but itcould not be moses that said this because moses could know nothingabout rabbah nor of what was in it rabbah was not a city belongingto this giant king nor was it one of the cities that moses took the knowledge therefore that this bed was at rabbah and of theparticulars of its dimensions must be referred to the time when rabbah was taken and this was not till four hundred years after thedeath of moses for which see 2 sam chap xii ver 26 and joab davids general fought against rabbah of the children of ammonand took the royal city as i am not undertaking to point out all the contradictions intime place and circumstance that abound in the books ascribed to moses and which prove to a demonstration that those books could nothave been written by moses nor in the time of moses i proceed to thebook of joshua and to show that joshua is not the author of thatbook and that it is anonymous and without authority the evidence ishall produce is contained in the book itself i will not go out ofthe bible for proof against the supposed authenticity of the bible false testimony is always good against itself joshua according to the first chapter of joshua was theimmediate successor of moses he was moreover a military manwhich moses was not and he continued as chief of the people of israel25 years that is from the time that moses died which accordingto the bible chronology was 1451 years before christ until 1426years before christ when according to the same chronology joshuadied if therefore we find in this book said to have been writtenby joshua reference to facts done after the death of joshua it isevidence that joshua could not be the author and also that the bookcould not have been written till after the time of the latest factwhich it records as to the character of the book it is horrid it isa military history of rapine and murder as savage and brutal as thoserecorded of his predecessor in villainy and hypocrisy moses andthe blasphemy consists as in the former books in ascribing thosedeeds to the orders of the almighty in the first place the book of joshua as is the case in thepreceding books is written in the third person it is the historianof joshua that speaks for it would have been absurd and vaingloriousthat joshua should say of himself as is said of him in the last verseof the sixth chapter that his fame was noised throughout all thecountry i now come more immediately to the proof in the 24th chapter ver 31 it is said and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders thatoverlived joshua now in the name of common sense can it be joshua that relates what people had done after he was dead thisaccount must not only have been written by some historian that livedafter joshua but that lived also after the elders that outlived joshua there are several passages of a general meaning with respect totime scattered throughout the book of joshua that carries the time inwhich the book was written to a distance from the time of joshuabut without marking by exclusion any particular time as in thepassage above quoted in that passage the time that intervenedbetween the death of joshua and the death of the elders is excludeddescriptively and absolutely and the evidence substantiates thatthe book could not have been written till after the death of the last but though the passages to which i allude and which i am going toquote do not designate any particular time by exclusion they imply atime far more distant from the days of joshua than is containedbetween the death of joshua and the death of the elders such is thepassage chap x ver 14 where after giving an account that thesun stood still upon gibeon and the moon in the valley of ajalonat the command of joshua a tale only fit to amuse children thepassage says and there was no day like that before it or after itthat the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man this tale of the sun standing still upon mount gibeon and themoon in the valley of ajalon is one of those fables that detectsitself such a circumstance could not have happened without beingknown all over the world one half would have wondered why the sun did not rise and the other why it did not set and the tradition of it would be universal whereas there is not a nation in the world that knows anything about it but why must the moon stand still what occasion could there be for moonlight in the daytime and that too while the sun shone as a poetical figure the whole is well enough it is akin to that in the song of deborah and barak the stars in their courses fought against sisera but it is inferior to thefigurative declaration of mahomet to the persons who came toexpostulate with him on his goings on wert thou said he tocome to me with the sun in thy right hand and the moon in thy left itshould not alter my career for joshua to have exceeded mahomet he should have put the sun and moon one in each pocket and carried them as guy fawkes carried his dark lantern and taken them out to shine as he might happen to want them the sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that itis difficult to class them separately one step above the sublimemakes the ridiculous and one step above the ridiculous makes thesublime again the account however abstracted from the poeticalfancy shows the ignorance of joshua for he should have commanded the earth to have stood still the time implied by the expression after it that is after thatday being put in comparison with all the time that passed beforeit must in order to give any expressive signification to thepassage mean a great length of time for example it would havebeen ridiculous to have said so the next day or the next week or thenext month or the next year to give therefore meaning to thepassage comparative with the wonder it relates and the prior timeit alludes to it must mean centuries of years less however thanone would be trifling and less than two would be barely admissible a distant but general time is also expressed in the 8th chapterwhere after giving an account of the taking of the city of ai itis said ver 28 and joshua burned ai and made it a heap forevereven a desolation unto this day and again ver 29 wherespeaking of the king of ai whom joshua had hanged and buried atthe entering of the gate it is said and he raised thereon a greatheap of stones which remaineth unto this day that is unto theday or time in which the writer of the book of joshua lived andagain in the 10th chapter where after speaking of the five kingswhom joshua had hanged on five trees and then thrown in a cave it is said and he laid great stones on the caves mouth which remain unto this very day in enumerating the several exploits of joshua and of thetribes and of the places which they conquered or attempted it issaid chap xv ver 63 as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day the question upon this passage is at what time did the jebusitesand the children of judah dwell together at jerusalem as thismatter occurs again in the first chapter of judges i shall reserve myobservations until i come to that part having thus shown from the book of joshua itself without anyauxiliary evidence whatever that joshua is not the author of thatbook and that it is anonymous and consequently without authorityi proceed as before mentioned to the book of judges the book of judges is anonymous on the face of it and thereforeeven the pretence is wanting to call it the word of god it has not somuch as a nominal voucher it is altogether fatherless this book begins with the same expression as the book of joshua that of joshua begins chap i verse 1 now after the death of moses etc and this of the judges begins now after the death of joshua etc this and the similarity of style between the two booksindicate that they are the work of the same author but who he wasis altogether unknown the only point that the book proves is thatthe author lived long after the time of joshua for though it beginsas if it followed immediately after his death the second chapter isan epitome or abstract of the whole book which according to the bible chronology extends its history through a space of 306 yearsthat is from the death of joshua 1426 years before christ to thedeath of samson 1120 years before christ and only 25 years before saul went to seek his fathers asses and was made king but thereis good reason to believe that it was not written till the time of david at least and that the book of joshua was not written beforethe same time in the first chapter of judges the writer after announcing thedeath of joshua proceeds to tell what happened between the childrenof judah and the native inhabitants of the land of canaan in thisstatement the writer having abruptly mentioned jerusalem in the7th verse says immediately after in the 8th verse by way ofexplanation now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had taken it consequently this book could not havebeen written before jerusalem had been taken the reader willrecollect the quotation i have just before made from the 15thchapter of joshua ver 63 where it is said that the jebusitesdwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day meaningthe time when the book of joshua was written the evidence i have already produced to prove that the books ihave hitherto treated of were not written by the persons to whomthey are ascribed nor till many years after their death if suchpersons ever lived is already so abundant that i can afford toadmit this passage with less weight than i am entitled to draw fromit for the case is that so far as the bible can be credited as ahistory the city of jerusalem was not taken till the time of davidand consequently that the books of joshua and of judges were notwritten till after the commencement of the reign of david which was370 years after the death of joshua the name of the city that was afterward called jerusalem wasoriginally jebus or jebusi and was the capital of the jebusites theaccount of davids taking this city is given in ii samuel chapv ver 4 etc  also in i chron chap xiv ver 4 etc thereis no mention in any part of the bible that it was ever takenbefore nor any account that favors such an opinion it is not saideither in samuel or in chronicles that they utterly destroyed menwomen and children that they left not a soul to breathe as is saidof their other conquests and the silence here observed implies thatit was taken by capitulation and that the jebusites the nativeinhabitants continued to live in the place after it was taken theaccount therefore given in joshua that the jebusites dwell withthe children of judah at jerusalem unto this day corresponds to noother time than after the taking of the city by david having now shown that every book in the bible from genesis to judges is without authenticity i come to the book of ruth anidle bungling story foolishly told nobody knows by whom about astrolling countrygirl creeping slyly to bed with her cousin boaz pretty stuff indeed to be called the word of god it is howeverone of the best books in the bible for it is free from murder andrapine i come next to the two books of samuel and to show that thosebooks were not written by samuel nor till a great length of timeafter the death of samuel and that they are like all the formerbooks anonymous and without authority to be convinced that these books have been written much later than the time of samuel and consequently not by him it is onlynecessary to read the account which the writer gives of saul goingto seek his fathers asses and of his interview with samuel ofwhom saul went to inquire about those lost asses as foolish peoplenowadays go to a conjuror to inquire after lost things the writer in relating this story of saul samuel and theasses does not tell it as a thing that has just then happened but asan ancient story in the time this writer lived for he tells it in thelanguage or terms used at the time that samuel lived which obligesthe writer to explain the story in the terms or language used in thetime the writer lived samuel in the account given of him in the first of thosebooks chap ix is called the seer and it is by this term that saul inquires after him ver ii and as they saul and hisservant went up the hill to the city they found young maidensgoing out to draw water and they said unto them is the seer here saul then went according to the direction of these maidens and met samuel without knowing him and said unto him ver 18 tell me ipray thee where the seers house is and samuel answered saul andsaid i am the seer as the writer of the book of samuel relates these questions andanswers in the language or manner of speaking used in the time theyare said to have been spoken and as that manner of speaking was outof use when this author wrote he found it necessary in order to makethe story understood to explain the terms in which these questionsand answers are spoken and he does this in the 9th verse when hesays beforetime in israel when a man went to inquire of godthus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is nowcalled a prophet was beforetime called a seer this proves as ihave before said that this story of saul samuel and the asses wasan ancient story at the time the book of samuel was written andconsequently that samuel did not write it and that that book iswithout authenticity but if we go further into those books the evidence is still morepositive that samuel is not the writer of them for they relate thingsthat did not happen till several years after the death of samuel samuel died before saul for the 1st samuel chap xxviii tells that saul and the witch of endor conjured samuel up after he was deadyet the history of the matters contained in those books is extendedthrough the remaining part of sauls life and to the latter end ofthe life of david who succeeded saul the account of the death andburial of samuel a thing which he could not write himself is relatedin the 25th chapter of the first book of samuel and the chronologyaffixed to this chapter makes this to be 1060 years before christ yetthe history of this first book is brought down to 1056 years before christ that is till the death of saul which was not till four yearsafter the death of samuel the second book of samuel begins with an account of things thatdid not happen till four years after samuel was dead for it beginswith the reign of david who succeeded saul and it goes on to the endof davids reign which was fortythree years after the death of samuel and therefore the books are in themselves positiveevidence that they were not written by samuel i have now gone through all the books in the first part of the bible to which the names of persons are affixed as being theauthors of those books and which the church styling itself the christian church have imposed upon the world as the writings of moses joshua and samuel and i have detected and proved the falsehood of this imposition and now ye priests of every description who have preached and written against the former part of the age of reason what have ye to say will ye with all this mass of evidence against you and staring you in the face still have the assurance to march into your pulpits and continue to impose these books on your congregations as the works of inspired penmen and the word of god when it is as evident as demonstration can make truth appear that the persons who ye say are the authors are not the authors and that ye know not who the authors are what shadow of pretence have ye now to produce for continuing the blasphemous fraud what have ye still to offer against the pure and moral religion of deism in support of your system of falsehood idolatry and pretended revelation had the cruel and murderous orders with which the bible is filled and the numberless torturing executions of men women and children inconsequence of those orders been ascribed to some friend whose memory you revered you would have glowed with satisfaction at detecting the falsehood of the charge and gloried in defending his injured fame is it because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition or feel no interest in the honor of your creator that ye listen to the horrid tales of the bible or hear them with callous indifference the evidence i have produced and shall produce in the course of this work to prove that the bible is without authority will while it wounds the stubbornness of a priest relieve and tranquilize the minds of millions it will free them from all those hard thoughts of the almighty which priestcraft and the bible had infused into their minds and which stood in everlasting opposition to all their ideas of his moral justice and benevolence i come now to the two books of kings and the two books of chronicles those books are altogether historical and are chieflyconfined to the lives and actions of the jewish kings who ingeneral were a parcel of rascals but these are matters with whichwe have no more concern than we have with the roman emperors or homers account of the trojan war besides which as those works areanonymous and as we know nothing of the writer or of hischaracter it is impossible for us to know what degree of credit togive to the matters related therein like all other ancient historiesthey appear to be a jumble of fable and of fact and of probable andof improbable things but which distance of time and place and change of circumstances in the world have rendered obsolete and uninteresting the chief use i shall make of those books will be that ofcomparing them with each other and with other parts of the bibleto show the confusion contradiction and cruelty in this pretendedword of god the first book of kings begins with the reign of solomon whichaccording to the bible chronology was 1015 years before christ andthe second book ends 588 years before christ being a little after thereign of zedekiah whom nebuchadnezzar after taking jerusalem andconquering the jews carried captive to babylon the two books include a space of 427 years the two books of chronicles are a history of the same times andin general of the same persons by another author for it would beabsurd to suppose that the same author wrote the history twice over the first book of chronicles after giving the genealogy from adamto saul which takes up the first nine chapters begins with thereign of david and the last book ends as in the last book of kingssoon after the reign of zedekiah about 588 years before christ thetwo last verses of the last chapter bring the history forward 52 yearsmore that is to 536 but these verses do not belong to the bookas i shall show when i come to speak of the book of ezra the two books of kings besides the history of saul david and solomon who reigned over all israel contain an abstract of the livesof 17 kings and one queen who are styled kings of judah and of 19who are styled kings of israel for the jewish nation immediatelyon the death of solomon split into two parties who chose separatekings and who carried on most rancorous wars against each other these two books are little more than a history ofassassinations treachery and wars the cruelties that the jews hadaccustomed themselves to practise on the canaanites whose countrythey had savagely invaded under a pretended gift from god theyafterward practised as furiously on each other scarcely half theirkings died a natural death and in some instances whole familieswere destroyed to secure possession to the successor who after a few years and sometimes only a few months or less shared the samefate in the tenth chapter of the second book of kings an accountis given of two baskets full of childrens heads seventy in numberbeing exposed at the entrance of the city they were the children of ahab and were murdered by the order of jehu whom elisha thepretended man of god had anointed to be king over israel onpurpose to commit this bloody deed and assassinate his predecessor and in the account of the reign of menahem one of the kings of israelwho had murdered shallum who had reigned but one month it is said ii kings chap xv ver 16 that menahem smote the city of tiphsah because they opened not the city to him and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up could we permit ourselves to suppose that the almighty woulddistinguish any nation of people by the name of his chosen peoplewe must suppose that people to have been an example to all the rest of the world of the purest piety and humanity and not such a nation ofruffians and cutthroats as the ancient jews were a people whocorrupted by and copying after such monsters and impostors as mosesand aaron joshua samuel and david had distinguished themselvesabove all others on the face of the known earth for barbarity andwickedness if we will not stubbornly shut our eyes and steel ourhearts it is impossible not to see in spite of all thatlongestablished superstition imposes upon the mind that theflattering appellation of his chosen people is no other than a liewhich the priests and leaders of the jews had invented to cover thebaseness of their own characters and which christian priestssometimes as corrupt and often as cruel have professed to believe the two books of chronicles are a repetition of the same crimesbut the history is broken in several places by the author leavingout the reign of some of their kings and in this as well as inthat of kings there is such a frequent transition from kings of judahto kings of israel and from kings of israel to kings of judah thatthe narrative is obscure in the reading in the same book thehistory sometimes contradicts itself for example in the secondbook of kings chap i ver 17 we are told but in rather ambiguousterms that after the death of ahaziah king of israel jehoram or joram who was of the house of ahab reigned in his stead in thesecond year of jehoram or joram son of jehoshaphat king of judahand in chap viii ver 16 of the same book it is said and inthe fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israeljehoshaphat being then king of judah began to reign that is onechapter says joram of judah began to reign in the second year of joram of israel and the other chapter says that joram of israel began to reign in the fifth year of joram of judah several of the most extraordinary matters related in onehistory as having happened during the reign of such and such of theirkings are not to be found in the other in relating the reign ofthe same king for example the two first rival kings after the deathof solomon were rehoboam and jeroboam and in i kings chap xii and xiii an account is given of jeroboam making an offering of burntincense and that a man who was there called a man of god criedout against the altar chap xiii ver 2 o altar altar thussaith the lord behold a child shall be born to the house of davidjosiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the highplaces that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burntupon thee verse 4 and it came to pass when king jeroboam heardthe saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold onhim and his hand which he put out against him dried up so that hecould not pull it in again to him one would think that such an extraordinary case as this whichis spoken of as a judgment happening to the chief of one of theparties and that at the first moment of the separation of the israelites into two nations would if it had been true have beenrecorded in both histories but though men in latter times havebelieved all that the prophets have said unto him it does notappear that these prophets or historians believed each other theyknew each other too well a long account also is given in kings about elijah it runsthrough several chapters and concludes with telling il kings chapii ver ii and it came to pass as they elijah and elishastill went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot offire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah wentup by a whirlwind into heaven hum this the author of chroniclesmiraculous as the story is makes no mention of though he mentions elijah by name neither does he say anything of the story related inthe second chapter of the same book of kings of a parcel ofchildren calling elisha bald head bald head and that this man of god verse 24 turned back and looked on them and cursed them inthe name of the lord and there came forth two shebears out of thewood and tore fortyandtwo children of them he also passes over insilence the story told ii kings chap xiii that when they wereburying a man in the sepulchre where elisha had been buried ithappened that the dead man as they were letting him down ver21 touched the bones of elisha and he the dead man revived andstood upon his feet the story does not tell us whether they buriedthe man notwithstanding he revived and stood upon his feet or drewhim up again upon all these stories the writer of chronicles is assilent as any writer of the present day who did not choose to beaccused of lying or at least of romancing would be about storiesof the same kind but however these two historians may differ from each otherwith respect to the tales related by either they are silent alikewith respect to those men styled prophets whose writings fill upthe latter part of the bible isaiah who lived in the time of hezekiah is mentioned in kings and again in chronicles when thesehistorians are speaking of that reign but except in one or twoinstances at most and those very slightly none of the rest are somuch as spoken of or even their existence hinted at althoughaccording to the bible chronology they lived within the time thosehistories were written some of their long before if thoseprophets as they are called were men of such importance in their dayas the compilers of the bible and priests and commentators havesince represented them to be how can it be accounted for that not one of these histories should say anything about them the history in the books of kings and of chronicles is broughtforward as i have already said to the year 588 before christ itwill therefore be proper to examine which of these prophets livedbefore that period here follows a table of all the prophets with the times inwhich they lived before christ according to the chronology affixed tothe first chapter of each of the books of the prophets and also ofthe number of years they lived before the books of kings and chronicles were written table of the prophets names years years before observationsbefore kings and christ chronicles isaiah 760 172 mentioned jeremiah 629 41 mentioned only in thelast chap of chron ezekiel 595 7 not mentioned daniel 607 19 not mentioned hosea 785 97 not mentioned joel 800 212 not mentioned amos 789 199 not mentioned obadiah

said of him nor is any allusion made to the bookof jonah nor to his expedition to nineveh nor to his encounterwith the whale this table is either not very honorable for the biblehistorians or not very honorable for the bible prophets and ileave to priests and commentators who are very learned in littlethings to settle the point of etiquette between the two and toassign a reason why the authors of kings and chronicles have treatedthose prophets whom in the former part of the age of reason i haveconsidered as poets with as much degrading silence as any historianof the present day would treat peter pindar i have one observation more to make on the book of chroniclesafter which i shall pass on to review the remaining books of the bible in my observations on the book of genesis i have quoted a passage from the 36th chapter verse 31 which evidently refers to a time after kings began to reign over the children of israel and i haveshown that as this verse is verbatim the same as in chronicleschap i verse 43 where it stands consistently with the order ofhistory which in genesis it does not that the verse in genesisand a great part of the 36th chapter have been taken from chronicles and that the book of genesis though it is placed first in the bible and ascribed to moses has been manufactured by some unknown person after the book of chronicles was written which was not until at least eight hundred and sixty years after the time of moses the evidence i proceed by to substantiate this is regular andhas in it but two stages first as i have already stated that thepassage in genesis refers itself for time to chronicles secondlythat the book of chronicles to which this passage refers itselfwas not begun to be written until at least eight hundred and sixtyyears after the time of moses to prove this we have only to lookinto the thirteenth verse of the third chapter of the first book of chronicles where the writer in giving the genealogy of thedescendants of david mentions zedekiah and it was in the time of zedekiah that nebuchadnezzar conquered jerusalem 588 years before christ and consequently more then 860 years after moses those whohave superstitiously boasted of the antiquity of the bible andparticularly of the books ascribed to moses have done it withoutexamination and without any authority than that of one credulousman telling it to another for so far as historical andchronological evidence applies the very first book in the bible isnot so ancient as the book of homer by more then three hundredyears and is about the same age with aesops fables i am not contending for the morality of homer on the contraryi think it a book of false glory tending to inspire immoral andmischievous notions of honor and with respect to aesop though themoral is in general just the fable is often cruel and the cruelty ofthe fable does more injury to the heart especially in a child thanthe moral does good to the judgment having now dismissed kings and chronicles i come to the next incourse the book of ezra as one proof among others i shall produce to show the disorderin which this pretended word of god the bible has been put togetherand the uncertainty of who the authors were we have only to look atthe three first verses in ezra and the last two in chronicles for bywhat kind of cutting and shuffling has it been that the three firstverses in ezra should be the two last verses in chronicles or thatthe two last in chronicles should be the three first in ezra hitherthe authors did not know their own works or the compilers did notknow the authors the last verse in chronicles is broken abruptly and end in themiddle of the phrase with the word up without signifying to whatplace this abrupt break and the appearance of the same verses indifferent books show as i have already said the disorder andignorance in which the bible has been put together and that thecompilers of it had no authority for what they were doing nor weany authority for believing what they have done two last verses of chronicles ver 22 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia thatthe word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might beaccomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persiathat he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put italso in writing saying23 thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of theearth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged meto build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is thereamong you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let himgo up three first verses of ezra ver 1 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that theword of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made aproclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writingsaying2 thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hathgiven me all the kingdoms of earth and he hath charged me to buildhim an house at jerusalem which is in judah3 who is there among you of all his people his god be withhim and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and buildthe house of the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem i observed as i passed along several broken and senselesspassages in the bible without thinking them of consequence enoughto be introduced in the body of the work such as that i samuelchap xiii ver 1 where it is said saul reigned one year and whenhe had reigned two years over israel saul chose him three thousandmen c the first part of verse that saul reigned one year hasno sense since it does not tell us what saul did nor say anything ofwhat happened at the end of that one year and it is besides mereabsurdity to say he reigned one year when the very next phrase sayshe had reigned two for if he had reigned two it was impossible notto have reigned one another instance occurs in joshua chap v where the writer tellsus a story of an angel for such the table of contents at the headof the chapter calls him appearing unto joshua and the story endsabruptly and without any conclusion the story is as follows verse13 and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he liftedup his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over againsthim with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him andsaid unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries verse 14 andhe said nay but as captain of the hosts of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and saidunto him what saith my lord unto his servant verse 15 and thecaptain of the lords host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from offthy foot for the place whereon thou standeth is holy and joshuadid so and what then nothing for here the story ends and thechapter too either the story is broken off in the middle or it is a storytold by some jewish humorist in ridicule of joshuas pretendedmission from god and the compilers of the bible not perceiving thedesign of the story have told it as a serious matter as a story ofhumor and ridicule it has a great deal of point for it pompouslyintroduces an angel in the figure of a man with a drawn sword inhis hand before whom joshua falls on his face to the earth andworships which is contrary to their second commandment and thenthis most important embassy from heaven ends in telling joshua to pull off his shoe it might as well have told him to pull up his breeches it is certain however that the jews did not credit everythingtheir leaders told them as appears from the cavalier manner inwhich they speak of moses when he was gone into the mount as forthis moses say they we wot not what is become of him exodchap xxxii ver i the only thing that has any appearance of certainty in the book of ezra is the time in which it was written which was immediately afterthe return of the jews from the babylonian captivity about 536years before christ ezra who according to the jewishcommentators is the same person as is called esdras in the apocrypha was one of the persons who returned and who it isprobable wrote the account of that affair nehemiah whose bookfollows next to ezra was another of the returned persons and who itis also probable wrote the account of the same affair in the bookthat bears his name but these accounts are nothing to us nor toany other persons unless it be to the jews as a part of thehistory of their nation and there is just as much of the word of god in those books as there is in any of the histories of france or rapins history of england or the history of any other country but even in matters of historical record neither of those writersare to be depended upon in the second chapter of ezra the writergives a list of the tribes and families and of the precise numberof souls of each that returned from babylon to jerusalem and thisenrolment of the persons so returned appears to have been one of theprincipal objects for writing the book but in this there is anerror that destroys the intention of the undertaking the writer begins his enrolment in the following manner chapii ver 3 the children of parosh two thousand a hundred seventyand two ver 4 the children of shephatiah three hundred seventyand two and in this manner he proceeds through all the families andin the 64th verse he makes a total and says the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore but whoever will take the trouble of casting up the severalparticulars will find that the total is but 29818 so that theerror is 12542  what certainty then can there be in the biblefor anything particulars of the families from the second chapter of ezra chap ii brought forward 12243 15953 24144verse 3 2172 verse 14 2056 verse 25 743 verse 36 9734 372 15 454 26 621 37 10525 775 16 98 27 122 38 12476 2812 17 323 28 223 39 10177 1254 18 112 29 52 40 748 945 19 223 30 156 41

returned familiesand of the number of each family he begins as in ezra by sayingchap vii ver 8 the children of parosh two thousand a hundredseven and two and so on through all the families the list differs inseveral of the particulars from that of ezra in the 66th versenehemiah makes a total and says as ezra had said the wholecongregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred andthreescore but the particulars of this list makes a total of but31089 so that the error here is 11271 these writers may do wellenough for biblemakers but not for anything where truth andexactness is necessary the next book in course is the book of esther if madame estherthought it any honor to offer herself as a kept mistress to ahasuerusor as a rival to queen vashti who had refused to come to a drunkenking in the midst of a drunken company to be made a show of for the account says they had been drinking seven days and were merry let esther and mordecai look to that it is no business of ours atleast it is none of mine besides which the story has a great deal theappearance of being fabulous and is also anonymous i pass on tothe book of job the book of job differs in character from all the books we havehitherto passed over treachery and murder make no part of thisbook it is the meditations of a mind strongly impressed with thevicissitudes of human life and by turns sinking under and strugglingagainst the pressure it is a highlywrought composition betweenwilling submission and involuntary discontent and shows man as hesometimes is more disposed to be resigned than he is capable ofbeing patience has but a small share in the character of the personof whom the book treats on the contrary his grief is oftenimpetuous but he still endeavors to keep a guard upon it and seemsdetermined in the midst of accumulating ills to impose upon himselfthe hard duty of contentment i have spoken in a respectful manner of the book of job in theformer part of the age of reason but without knowing at that timewhat i have learned since which is that from all the evidence thatcan be collected the book of job does not belong to the bible i have seen the opinion of two hebrew commentators abenezra and spinoza upon this subject they both say that the book of job carries no internal evidence of being a hebrew book that the genius of the composition and the drama of the piece are not hebrew that it has been translated from another language into hebrew and that the author of the book was a gentile that the character represented under the name of satan which is the first and only time this name is mentioned in the bible does not correspond to any hebrew idea and that the two convocations which the deity is supposed to have made of those whom the poem calls sons of god and the familiarity which this supposed satan is stated to have with the deity are in the same case it may also be observed that the book shows itself to be theproduction of a mind cultivated in science which the jews so farfrom being famous for were very ignorant of the allusions to objectsof natural philosophy are frequent and strong and are of adifferent cast to anything in the books known to be hebrew theastronomical names pleiades orion and arcturus are greek and not hebrew names and it does not appear from anything that is to be found in the bible that the jews knew anything of astronomy or that they studied it they had no translation of those names into their ownlanguage but adopted the names as they found them in the poem that the jews did translate the literary productions of the gentile nations into the hebrew language and mix them with their own is not a matter of doubt the thirtyfirst chapter of proverbs is anevidence of this it is there said v i the words of king lemuelthe prophecy that his mother taught him this verse stands as apreface to the proverbs that follow and which are not the proverbs of solomon but of lemuel and this lemuel was not one of the kings of israel nor of judah but of some other country and consequently a gentile the jews however have adopted his proverbs and as theycannot give any account who the author of the book of job was nor how they came by the book and as it differs in character from the hebrew writings and stands totally unconnected with every otherbook and chapter in the bible before it and after it it has allthe circumstantial evidence of being originally a book of the gentiles the prayer known by the name of agurs prayer in the 30thchapter of proverbs immediately preceding the proverbs of lemuel and which is the only sensible wellconceived and wellexpressed prayer in the bible has much the appearance of being a prayer taken from the gentiles the name of agur occurs on no other occasion than this and he is introduced together with the prayer ascribed to him in the same manner and nearly in the same words that lemuel and his proverbs are introduced in the chapter that follows the first verse of the 30th chapter says the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy here the word prophecy is used in the same application it has in the following chapter of lemuel unconnected with any thing of prediction the prayer of agur is in the 8th and 9th verses remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain this has not any of the marks of being a jewish prayer for the jews never prayed but when they were in trouble and never for anything but victory vengeance and riches the biblemakers and those regulators of time thechronologists appear to have been at a loss where to place and how to dispose of the book of job for it contains no one historicalcircumstance nor allusion to any that might determine its place inthe bible but it would not have answered the purpose of these mento have informed the world of their ignorance and therefore theyhave affixed it to the era of 1520 years before christ which isduring the time the israelites were in egypt and for which theyhave just as much authority and no more than i should have forsaying it was a thousand years before that period the probabilityhowever is that it is older than any book in the bible and it is theonly one that can be read without indignation or disgust we know nothing of what the ancient gentile world as it iscalled was before the time of the jews whose practise has been tocalumniate and blacken the character of all other nations and it isfrom the jewish accounts that we have learned to call them heathens but as far as we know to the contrary they were a just and moralpeople and not addicted like the jews to cruelty and revenge butof whose profession of faith we are unacquainted it appears to havebeen their custom to personify both virtue and vice by statues andimages as is done nowadays both by statuary and by painting but itdoes not follow from this that they worshiped them any more than wedo i pass on to the book of psalms of which it is not necessary tomake much observation some of them are moral and others are veryrevengeful and the greater part relates to certain localcircumstances of the jewish nation at the time they were written withwhich we have nothing to do it is however an error or an impositionto call them the psalms of david they are a collection as songbooksare nowadays from different songwriters who lived at differenttimes the 137th psalm could not have been written till more than400 years after the time of david because it was written incommemoration of an event the captivity of the jews in babylon which did not happen till that distance of time by the rivers of babylon we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song saying sing us one of the songs of zion as a man would say to an american or to a frenchman or to an englishman sing us one of your american songs or of your french songs or of your english songs this remarkwith respect to the time this psalm was written is of no other use than to show among others already mentioned the general imposition the world has been under in respect to the authors of the bible no regard has been paid to time place and circumstance and the names of persons have been affixed to the several books which it was as impossible they should write as that a man should walk in procession at his own funeral the book of proverbs these like the psalms are a collectionand that from authors belonging to other nations than those of the jewish nation as i have shown in the observations upon the book of job besides which some of the proverbs ascribed to solomon did notappear till two hundred and fifty years after the death of solomonfor it is said in the 1st verse of the 25th chapter these are alsoproverbs of solomon which the men of hezekiah king of judahcopied out it was two hundred and fifty years from the time of solomon to the time of hezekiah when a man is famous and his nameis abroad he is made the putative father of things he never said ordid and this most probably has been the case with solomon itappears to have been the fashion of that day to make proverbs as itis now to make jestbooks and father them upon those who never sawthem the book of ecclesiastes or the preacher is also ascribed to solomon and that with much reason if not with truth it is writtenas the solitary reflections of a wornout debauchee such as solomonwas who looking back on scenes he can no longer enjoy cries outall is vanity a great deal of the metaphor and of the sentimentis obscure most probably by translation but enough is left to showthey were strongly pointed in the original  from what istransmitted to us of the character of solomon he was wittyostentatious dissolute and at last melancholy he lived fast anddied tired of the world at the age of fiftyeight years those that look out of the window shall be darkened is anobscure figure in translation for loss of sight seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines are worse thannone and however it may carry with it the appearance of heightenedenjoyment it defeats all the felicity of affection by leaving it nopoint to fix upon divided love is never happy this was the case with solomon and if he could not with all his pretentions to wisdomdiscover it beforehand he merited unpitied the mortification heafterward endured in this point of view his preaching isunnecessary because to know the consequences it is only necessaryto know the cause seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines would have stood in place of the whole book it was needless after this to say that all was vanity and vexation of spirit for it is impossible to derive happiness from the company of those whom we deprive of happiness to be happy in old age it is necessary that we accustom ourselvesto objects that can accompany the mind all the way through life andthat we take the rest as good in their day the mere man of pleasureis miserable in old age and the mere drudge in business is but littlebetter whereas natural philosophy mathematical and mechanicalscience are a continual source of tranquil pleasure and in spiteof the gloomy dogmas of priests and of superstition the study ofthese things is the true theology it teaches man to know and toadmire the creator for the principles of science are in the creationand are unchangeable and of divine origin those who knew benjamin franklin will recollect that his mindwas ever young his temper ever serene science that never growsgray was always his mistress he was never without an object forwhen we cease to have an object we become like an invalid in ahospital waiting for death solomons songs are amorous and foolish enough but which wrinkled fanaticism has called divine the compilers of the bible have placed these songs after the book of ecclesiastes and the chronologists have affixed to them the era of 1014 years before christ at which time solomon according to the same chronology was nineteen years of age and was then forming his seraglio of wives and concubines the biblemakers and the chronologists should have managed this matter a little better and either have said nothing about the time or chosen a time less inconsistent with the supposed divinity of those songs for solomon was then in the honeymoon of one thousand debaucheries it should also have occurred to them that as he wrote if hedid write the book of ecclesiastes long after these songs and inwhich he exclaims that all is vanity and vexation of spirit thathe included those songs in that description this is the moreprobable because he says or somebody for him ecclesiastes chapii ver 8 i gat me men singers and women singers most probablyto sing those songs as musical instruments and that of all sortsand behold ver ii all was vanity and vexation of spirit thecompilers however have done their work but by halves for as theyhave given us the songs they should have given us the tunes thatwe might sing them the books called the books of the prophets fill up all theremaining parts of the bible they are sixteen in number beginningwith isaiah and ending with malachi of which i have given you a listin my observations upon chronicles of these sixteen prophets allof whom except the three last lived within the time the books of kings and chronicles were written two only isaiah and jeremiahare mentioned in the history of those books i shall begin withthose two reserving what i have to say on the general character ofthe men called prophets to another part of the work whoever will take the trouble of reading the book ascribed to isaiah will find it one of the most wild and disorderly compositionsever put together it has neither beginning middle nor end andexcept a short historical part and a few sketches of history in two orthree of the first chapters is one continued incoherent bombasticalrant full of extravagant metaphor without application and destituteof meaning a schoolboy would scarcely have been excusable forwriting such stuff it is at least in the translation that kind ofcomposition and false taste that is properly called prose run mad the historical part begins at the 36th chapter and is continuedto the end of the 39th chapter it relates to some matters that aresaid to have passed during the reign of hezekiah king of judah atwhich time isaiah lived this fragment of history begins and endsabruptly it has not the least connection with the chapter thatprecedes it nor with that which follows it nor with any other in thebook it is probable that isaiah wrote this fragment himselfbecause he was an actor in the circumstances it treats of but exceptthis part there are scarcely two chapters that have any connectionwith each other one is entitled at the beginning of the first versethe burden of babylon another the burden of moab another the burden of damascus another the burden of egypt another the burden of the desert of the sea another the burden of the valley of vision as you would say the story of the knight of the burning mountain the story of cinderella or the children inthe wood etc etc see beginning of chapters xiii xv xvii xix xxi and xxii i have already shown in the instance of the two last verses of chronicles and the three first in ezra that the compilers of the bible mixed and confounded the writings of different authors with eachother which alone were there no other cause is sufficient todestroy the authenticity of any compilation because it is more thanpresumptive evidence that the compilers were ignorant who theauthors were a very glaring instance of this occurs in the bookascribed to isaiah the latter part of the 44th chapter and thebeginning of the 45th so far from having been written by isaiahcould only have been written by some person who lived at least ahundred and fifty years after isaiah was dead these chapters are a compliment to cyrus who permitted the jewsto return to jerusalem from the babylonian captivity to rebuild jerusalem and the temple as is stated in ezra the last verse ofthe 44th chapter and the beginning of the 45th are in the followingwords that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform allmy pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shall be built and to thetemple thy foundation shall be laid thus saith the lord to hisannointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the twoleaved gates and the gates shall not be shut i will go before thee etc what audacity of church and priestly ignorance it is to imposethis book upon the world as the writing of isaiah when isaiahaccording to their own chronology died soon after the death of hezekiah which was 693 years before christ and the decree of cyrus in favor of the jews returning to jerusalem was accordingto the same chronology 536 years before christ which is a distanceof time between the two of 162 years i do not suppose that thecompilers of the bible made these books but rather that they pickedup some loose anonymous essays and put them together under thenames of such authors as best suited their purpose they haveencouraged the imposition which is next to inventing it for it wasimpossible but they must have observed it when we see the studied craft of the scripturemakers in makingevery part of this romantic book of schoolboys eloquence bend tothe monstrous idea of a son of god begotten by a ghost on the bodyof a virgin there is no imposition we are not justified in suspectingthem of every phrase and circumstance is marked with the barbaroushand of superstitious torture and forced into meanings it wasimpossible they could have the head of every chapter and the top ofevery page are blazoned with the names of christ and the churchthat the unwary reader might suck in the error before he began toread behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son isaiah chapvii ver 14 has been interpreted to mean the person called jesus christ and his mother mary and has been echoed through christendom for more than a thousand years and such has been the rage of this opinion that scarcely a spot in it but has been stained with blood and marked with desolation in consequence of it though it is not my intention to enter into controversy on subjects of this kind but to confine myself to show that the bible is spurious and thus by taking away the foundation to overthrow at once the whole structure of superstition raised thereon i will however stop a moment to expose the fallacious application of this passage whether isaiah was playing a trick with ahaz king of judah towhom this passage is spoken is no business of mine i mean only toshow the misapplication of the passage and that it has no morereference to christ and his mother than it has to me and my mother the story is simply this the king of syria and the king of israel ihave already mentioned that the jews were split into two nationsone of which was called judah the capital of which was jerusalem and the other israel made war jointly against ahaz king of judah and marched their armies toward jerusalem ahaz and his people became alarmed and the account says verse 2 and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind in this situation of things isaiah addresses himself to ahaz andassures him in the name of the lord the cant phrase of all theprophets that these two kings should not succeed against him andto satisfy ahaz that this should be the case tells him to ask a sign this the account says ahaz declined doing giving as a reason thathe would not tempt the lord upon which isaiah who is the speakersays ver 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a signbehold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and the 16th versesays for before this child shall know to refuse the evil and choosethe good the land that thou abhorrest or dreadest meaning syriaand the kingdom of israel shall be forsaken of both her kings here then was the sign and the time limited for the completion of theassurance or promise namely before this child should know torefuse the evil and choose the good isaiah having committed himself thus far it became necessary tohim in order to avoid the imputation of being a false prophet and theconsequence thereof to take measures to make this sign appear itcertainly was not a difficult thing in any time of the world to finda girl with child or to make her so and perhaps isaiah knew of onebeforehand for i do not suppose that the prophets of that day wereany more to be trusted than the priests of this be that howeveras it may he says in the next chapter ver 2 and i took unto mefaithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah theson of jeberechiah and i went unto the prophetess and sheconceived and bare a son here then is the whole story foolish as it is of this childand this virgin and it is upon the barefaced perversion of thisstory that the book of matthew and the impudence and sordidinterests of priests in later times have founded a theory whichthey call the gospel and have applied this story to signify theperson they call jesus christ begotten they say by a ghost whomthey call holy on the body of a woman engaged in marriage andafterward married whom they call a virgin 700 years after thisfoolish story was told a theory which speaking for myself ihesitate not to disbelieve and to say is as fabulous and as false as god is true in the 14th verse of the 7th chapter it is said that the childshould be called immanuel but this name was not given to either ofthe children otherwise than as a character which the word signifies that of the prophetess was called mahershalalhashbaz and that of mary was called jesus but to show the imposition and falsehood of isaiah we have onlyto attend to the sequel of this story which though it is passed overin silence in the book of isaiah is related in the 28th chapter ofthe second chronicles and which is that instead of these two kingsfailing in their attempt against ahaz king of judah as isaiah hadpretended to foretell in the name of the lord they succeeded ahazwas defeated and destroyed a hundred and twenty thousand of hispeople were slaughtered jerusalem was plundered and two hundredthousand women and sons and daughters carried into captivity thusmuch for this lying prophet and impostor isaiah and the book offalsehoods that bears his name i pass on to the book of jeremiah this prophet as he iscalled lived in the time that nebuchadnezzar besieged jerusalem inthe reign of zedekiah the last king of judah and the suspicion wasstrong against him that he was a traitor in the interests of nebuchadnezzar everything relating to jeremiah shows him to have been a man of an equivocal character in his metaphor of the potter and the clay chap xviii he guards his prognostications in such a crafty manner as always to leave himself a door to escape by in case the event should be contrary to what he had predicted in the 7th and 8th verses of that chapter he makes the almighty tosay at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation andconcerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and destroy it if that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from theirevil i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them here was a proviso against one side of the case now for the otherside verses 9 and 10 and at what instant i shall speak concerning anation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it if it doevil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i shall repent ofthe good wherewith i said i would benefit them here is a provisoagainst the other side and according to this plan of prophesyinga prophet could never be wrong however mistaken the almighty might be this sort of absurd subterfuge and this manner of speaking of the almighty as one would speak of a man is consistent with nothing but the stupidity of the bible as to the authenticity of the book it is only necessary to readit in order to decide positively that though some passagesrecorded therein may have been spoken by jeremiah he is not theauthor of the book the historical parts if they can be called bythat name are in the most confused condition the same events areseveral times repeated and that in a manner different andsometimes in contradiction to each other and this disorder runseven to the last chapter where the history upon which the greaterpart of the book has been employed begins anew and ends abruptly the book has all the appearance of being a medley of unconnected anecdotes respecting persons and things of that time collected together in the same rude manner as if the various and contradictory accounts that are to be found in a bundle of newspapers respecting persons and things of the present day were put together without date order or explanation i will give two or three examples of this kind it appears from the account of the 37th chapter that the army of nebuchadnezzar which is called the army of the chaldeans hadbesieged jerusalem some time and on their hearing that the army of pharaoh of egypt was marching against them they raised the siege and retreated for a time it may here be proper to mention in order tounderstand this confused history that nebuchadnezzar had besieged and taken jerusalem during the reign of jehoiakim the predecessor of zedekiah and that it was nebuchadnezzar who had made zedekiah king or rather viceroy and that this second siege of which the book of jeremiah treats was in consequence of the revolt of zedekiahagainst nebuchadnezzar this will in some measure account for thesuspicion that affixes to jeremiah of being a traitor and in theinterest of nebuchadnezzar whom jeremiah calls in the 43d chapterver 10 the servant of god the 11th verse of this chapter the 37th says and it came topass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharoahs army that jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go as this account states into the land of benjaminto separate himself thence in the midst of the people and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans jeremiah being thus stopped and accused was after being examined committed to prison on suspicion of being a traitor where he remained as is stated in the last verse of this chapter but the next chapter gives an account of the imprisonment of jeremiah which has no connection with this account but ascribes hisimprisonment to another circumstance and for which we must go back to the 21st chapter it is there stated ver 1 that zedekiah sent pashur the son of malchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah thepriest to jeremiah to inquire of him concerning nebuchadnezzar whose army was then before jerusalem and jeremiah said unto them ver 8 and 9 thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way oflife and the way of death he that abideth in this city shall dieby the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he thatgoeth out and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you he shalllive and his life shall be unto him for a prey this interview and conference breaks off abruptly at the end ofthe 10th verse of the 21st chapter and such is the disorder of thisbook that we have to pass over sixteen chapters upon varioussubjects in order to come at the continuation and event of thisconference and this brings us to the first verse of the 38th chapteras i have just mentioned the 38th chapter opens with saying then shepatiah the son of mattan gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah here are more personsmentioned than in the 21st chapter heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying thus saith the lord he thatremaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine andby the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shalllive for he shall have his life for prey and shall live which arethe words of the conference therefore they say to zedekiah webeseech thee let us put this man to death for thus he weakeneththe hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands ofall the people in speaking such words unto them for this manseeketh not the welfare of the people but the hurt and at the 6thverse it is said then took they jeremiah and cast him into thedungeon of malchiah these two accounts are different and contradictory the oneascribes his imprisonment to his attempt to escape out of the citythe other to his preaching and prophesying in the city the one to hisbeing seized by the guard at the gate the other to his beingaccused before zedekiah by the conferees i observed two chapters 16th and 17th in the first book of samuel that contradict each other with respect to david and themanner he became acquainted with saul as the 37th and 38th chapters of the book of jeremiah contradict each other with respect to the cause of jeremiahs imprisonment in the 16th chapter of samuel it is said that an evil spiritof god troubled saul and that his servants advised him as aremedy to seek out a man who was a cunning player upon the harp and saul said verse 17 provide me now a man that can play welland bring him to me then answered one of the servants and saidbehold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning inplaying and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent inmatters and a comely person and the lord is with him wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son and verse 21 david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armorbearer and when the evil spirit from god was upon saul ver 23 that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well but the next chapter 17 gives an account all different to thisof the manner that saul and david became acquainted here it isascribed to davids encounter with goliah when david was sent byhis father to carry provision to his brethren in the camp in the 55thverse of this chapter it is said and when saul saw david go forthagainst the philistine goliah he said unto abner the captain ofthe host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thysoul liveth o king i cannot tell and the king said enquire thouwhose son the stripling is and as david returned from the slaughterof the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul withthe head of the philistine in his hand and saul said to him whoseson art thou young man and david answered i am the son of thyservant jesse the bethlehemite these two accounts belie eachother because each of them supposes saul and david not to haveknown each other before this book the bible is too ridiculous evenfor criticism in the next chapter the 39th we have another instance of thedisordered state of this book for notwithstanding the siege of thecity by nebuchadnezzar has been the subject of several of thepreceding chapters particularly the 37th and 38 the 39th chapterbegins as if not a word had been said upon the subject and as ifthe reader was to be informed of every particular concerning it forit begins with saying verse it in the ninth year of zedekiahking of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besieged itetc but the instance in the last chapter the 52d is still moreglaring for though the story has been told over and over againthis chapter still supposes the reader not to know anything of it forit begins by saying ver 1 zedekiah was one and twenty years oldwhen he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalemand his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah ver 4 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzarking of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem andpitched against it and built forts against it etc it is not possible that any one man and more particularly jeremiah could have been the writer of this book the errors are suchas could not have been committed by any person sitting down to compose a work were i or any other man to write in such a disordered manner nobody would read what was written and everybody would suppose that the writer was in a state of insanity the only way therefore to account for this disorder is that the book is a medley of detached unauthenticated anecdotes put together by some stupid bookmaker under the name of jeremiah because many of them refer to him and to the circumstances of the times he lived in of the duplicity and of the false prediction of jeremiah i shallmention two instances and then proceed to review the remainder of the bible it appears from the 38th chapter that when jeremiah was inprison zedekiah sent for him and at this interview which wasprivate jeremiah pressed it strongly on zedekiah to surrender himselfto the enemy if says he ver 17 thou wilt assuredly go forthunto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live etc zedekiah was apprehensive that what passed at this conference shouldbe known and he said to jeremiah ver 25 if the princes meaning those of judah hear that i have talked with thee and theycome unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thouhast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put theeto death and also what the king said unto thee then thou shalt sayunto them i presented my supplication before the king that hewould not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there thencame all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told themaccording to all the words the king had commanded thus this manof god as he is called could tell a lie or very stronglyprevaricate when he supposed it would answer his purpose forcertainly he did not go to zedekiah to make his supplicationneither did he make it he went because he was sent for and heemployed that opportunity to advise zedekiah to surrender himself to nebuchadnezzar in the 34th chapter is a prophecy of jeremiah to zedekiah inthese words ver 2 thus saith the lord behold i will give thiscity into the hands of the king of babylon and he shall burn itwith fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surelybe taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold theeyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth tomouth and thou shalt go to babylon yet hear the word of the lordo zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shaltnot die by the sword but thou shalt die in peace and with theburnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee soshall they burn odors for thee and they will lament thee saying ahlord for i have pronounced the word saith the lord now instead of zedekiah beholding the eyes of the king of babylon and speaking with him mouth to mouth and dying in peace and with the burning of odors as at the funeral of his fathers as jeremiah had declared the lord himself had pronounced the reverseaccording to the 52nd chapter was the case it is there said ver10 and the king of babylon slew the son of zedekiah before hiseyes then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylonbound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prisontill the day of his death what then can we say of theseprophets but that they were impostors and liars as for jeremiah he experienced none of those evils he wastaken into favor by nebuchadnezzar who gave him in charge to thecaptain of the guard chap xxxix ver 12 take him said he andlook well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee jeremiah joined himself afterward to nebuchadnezzar and went about prophesying for him against the egyptians who had marched to the relief of jerusalem while it was besieged thus much for another of the lying prophets and the book that bears his name i have been the more particular in treating of the booksascribed to isaiah and jeremiah because those two are spoken of inthe books of kings and chronicles which the others are not theremainder of the books ascribed to the men called prophets i shall nottrouble myself much about but take them collectively into theobservations i shall offer on the character of the men styledprophets in the former part of the age of reason i have said that the wordprophet was the bible word for poet and that the flights andmetaphors of jewish poets have been foolishly erected into what arenow called prophecies i am sufficiently justified in this opinionnot only because the books called the prophecies are written inpoetical language but because there is no word in the bible exceptit be the word prophet that describes what we mean by a poet ihave also said that the word signifies a performer upon musicalinstruments of which i have given some instances such as that of acompany of prophets prophesying with psalteries with tabrets withpipes with harps etc and that saul prophesied with them i sam chap x ver 5 it appears from this passage and from otherparts in the book of samuel that the word prophet was confined tosignify poetry and music for the person who was supposed to have avisionary insight into concealed things was not a prophet but a seer i sam chap ix ver 9 and it was not till after the wordseer went out of use which most probably was when saul banished those he called wizards that the profession of the seer or the art ofseeing became incorporated into the word prophet i know not what is the hebrew word that corresponds to the wordseer in english but i observe it is translated into french by lavoyant from the verb voir to see and which means the person whosees or the seer according to the modern meaning of the word prophet andprophesying it signifies foretelling events to a great distance oftime and it became necessary to the inventors of the gospel to giveit this latitude of meaning in order to apply or to stretch what theycall the prophecies of the old testament to the times of the newbut according to the old testament the prophesying of the seer andafterward of the prophet so far as the meaning of the word seerincorporated into that of prophet had reference only to things of thetime then passing or very closely connected with it such as theevent of a battle they were going to engage in or of a journey or ofany enterprise they were going to undertake or of any circumstancethen pending or of any difficulty they were then in all of which hadimmediate reference to themselves as in the case already mentioned of ahaz and isaiah with respect to the expression behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and not to any distant future time itwas that kind of prophesying that corresponds to what we callfortunetelling such as casting nativities predicting richesfortunate or unfortunate marriages conjuring for lost goods etc and it is the fraud of the christian church not that of the jews andthe ignorance and the superstition of modern not that of ancienttimes that elevated those poetical musical conjuring dreamingstrolling gentry into the rank they have since had but besides this general character of all the prophets theyhad also a particular character they were in parties and theyprophesied for or against according to the party they were with asthe poetical and political writers of the present day write in defenceof the party they associate with against the other after the jews were divided into two nations that of judah andthat of israel each party had its prophets who abused and accusedeach other of being false prophets lying prophets impostors etc the prophets of the party of judah prophesied against the prophetsof the party of israel and those of the party of israel against thoseof judah this party prophesying showed itself immediately on theseparation under the first two rival kings rehoboam and jeroboam the prophet that cursed or prophesied against the altar that jeroboamhad built in bethel was of the party of judah where rehoboam wasking and he was waylaid on his return home by a prophet of the party of israel who said unto him i kings chap xiii  art thou theman of god that came from judah and he said i am then theprophet of the party of israel said to him i am a prophet also asthou art signifying of judah and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but says the 18th verse he lied unto him this event however according to the story is that theprophet of judah never got back to judah for he was found dead on the road by the contrivance of the prophet of israel who no doubtwas called a true prophet by his own party and the prophet of judah alying prophet in the third chapter of the second of kings a story is related ofprophesying or conjuring that shows in several particulars thecharacter of a prophet jehoshaphat king of judah and jehoramking of israel had for a while ceased their party animosity andentered into an alliance and these two together with the king of edom engaged in a war against the king of moab after uniting andmarching their armies the story says they were in great distress forwater upon which jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet ofthe lord that we may inquire of the lord by him and one of theservants of the king of israel said here is elisha elisha wasone of the party of judah and jehoshaphat the king of judah saidthe word of the lord is with him the story then says that thesethree kings went down to elisha who as i have said was a judahmite prophet saw the king of israel he said unto him whathave i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and tothe prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him nayfor the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver theminto the hands of moab meaning because of the distress they were infor water upon which elisha said as the lord of hosts livethbefore whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look towards thee nor seethee here is all the venom and vulgarity of a party prophet we havenow to see the performance or manner of prophesying ver 15 bring me said elisha a minstrel and it came topass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came uponhim here is the farce of the conjurer now for the prophecy and elisha said singing most probably to the tune he was playingthus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches which was justtelling them what every countryman could have told them withouteither fiddle or farce that the way to get water was to dig for it but as every conjurer is not famous alike for the same thing soneither were those prophets for though all of them at least those i have spoken of were famous for lying some of them excelled incursing elisha whom i have just mentioned was a chief in thisbranch of prophesying it was he that cursed the fortytwo children inthe name of the lord whom the two shebears came and devoured we are to suppose that those children were of the party of israel but as those who will curse will lie there is just as much credit to begiven to this story of elishas two shebears as there is to that ofthe dragon of wantley of whom it is saidpoor children three devoured hethat could not with him grappleand at one sup he ate them upas a man would eat an apple there was another description of men called prophets thatamused themselves with dreams and visions but whether by night orby day we know not these if they were not quite harmless were butlittle mischievous of this class are ezekiel and daniel and the first question upon those books asupon all the others is are they genuine that is were theywritten by ezekiel and daniel of this there is no proof but so far as my own opinion goes i ammore inclined to believe they were than that they were not myreasons for this opinion are as follows first because those books donot contain internal evidence to prove they were not written by ezekiel and daniel as the books ascribed to moses joshua samueletc prove they were not written by moses joshua samuel etc secondly because they were not written till after the babylonian captivity began and there is good reason to believe thatnot any book in the bible was written before that period at leastit is proveable from the books themselves as i have already shownthat they were not written till after the commencement of the jewishmonarchy thirdly because the manner in which the books ascribed to ezekieland daniel are written agrees with the condition these men were inat the time of writing them had the numerous commentators and priests who have foolishlyemployed or wasted their time in pretending to expound and unriddlethose books been carried into captivity as ezekiel and danielwere it would have greatly improved their intellects in comprehendingthe reason for this mode of writing and have saved them the troubleof racking their invention as they have done to no purpose for theywould have found that themselves would be obliged to write whateverthey had to write respecting their own affairs or those of theirfriends or of their country in a concealed manner as those menhave done these two books differ from all the rest for it is only these thatare filled with accounts of dreams and visions and this differencearose from the situation the writers were in as prisoners of war orprisoners of state in a foreign country which obliged them to conveyeven the most trifling information to each other and all theirpolitical projects or opinions in obscure and metaphorical terms thepretend to have dreamed dreams and seen visions because it was unsafe for them to speak facts or plain language we ought however to suppose that the persons to whom they wrote understood what theymeant and that it was not intended anybody else should but thesebusy commentators and priests have been puzzling their wits to findout what it was not intended they should know and with which theyhave nothing to do ezekiel and daniel were carried prisoners to babylon under thefirst captivity in the time of jehoiakim nine years before thesecond captivity in the time of zedekiah the jews were then still numerous and had considerable force at jerusalem and as it is natural to suppose that men in the situationof ezekiel and daniel would be meditating the recovery of theircountry and their own deliverance it is reasonable to suppose thatthe accounts of dreams and visions with which those books are filledare no other than a disguised mode of correspondence to facilitatethose objects it served them as a cipher or secret alphabet ifthey are not thus they are tales reveries and nonsense or atleast a fanciful way of wearing off the wearisomeness of captivitybut the presumption is they were the former ezekiel begins his books by speaking of a vision of cherubimsand of a wheel within a wheel which he says he saw by the river chebar in the land of his captivity is it not reasonable to supposethat by the cherubims he meant the temple at jerusalem where they had figures of cherubims and by a wheel within a wheel which as a figure has always been understood to signify political contrivancethe project or means of recovering jerusalem in the latter part ofthis book he supposes himself transported to jerusalem and into thetemple and he refers back to the vision on the river chebar and says chapter xliii verse 3 that this last vision was like the vision onthe river chebar which indicates that those pretended dreams andvisions had for their object the recovery of jerusalem and nothingfurther as to the romantic interpretations and applications wild as thedreams and visions they undertake to explain which commentators and priests have made of those books that of converting them intothings which they call prophecies and making them bend to times andcircumstances as far remote even as the present day it shows thefraud or the extreme folly to which credulity or priestcraft can go scarcely anything can be more absurd than to suppose that mensituated as ezekiel and daniel were whose country was overrun andin the possession of the enemy all their friends and relations incaptivity abroad or in slavery at home or massacred or in continualdanger of it scarcely anything i say can be more absurd than tosuppose that such men should find nothing to do but that ofemploying their time and their thoughts about what was to happen toother nations a thousand or two thousand years after they were deadat the same time nothing is more natural than that they shouldmeditate the recovery of jerusalem and their own deliverance and that this was the sole object of all the obscure and apparently franticwritings contained in those books in this sense the mode of writing used in those two booksbeing forced by necessity and not adopted by choice is notirrational but if we are to use the books as prophecies they arefalse in the 29th chapter of ezekiel speaking of egypt it issaid ver ii no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot ofbeast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited for fortyyears this is what never came to pass and consequently it is falseas all the books i have already reviewed are i here close this partof the subject in the former part of the age of reason i have spoken of jonahand of the story of him and the whale a fit story for ridicule if itwas written to be believed or of laughter if it was intended totry what credulity could swallow for if it could swallow jonah andthe whale it could swallow anything but as is already shown in the observations on the book of joband of proverbs it is not always certain which of the books in the bible are originally hebrew or only translations from the books ofthe gentiles into hebrew and as the book of jonah so far fromtreating of the affairs of the jews says nothing upon that subjectbut treats altogether of the gentiles it is more probable that itis a book of the gentiles than of the jews and that it has beenwritten as a fable to expose the nonsense and satirize the viciousand malignant character of a bible prophet or a predicting priest jonah is represented first as a disobedient prophet runningaway from his mission and taking shelter aboard a vessel of the gentiles bound from joppa to tarshish as if he ignorantlysupposed by some paltry contrivance he could hide himself where god could not find him the vessel is overtaken by a storm at sea andthe mariners all of whom are gentiles believing it to be a judgmenton account of some one on board who had committed a crime agreed to cast lots to discover the offender and the lot fell upon jonah but before this they had cast all their wares and merchandiseoverboard to lighten the vessel while jonah like a stupid fellowwas fast asleep in the hold after the lot had designated jonah to be the offender theyquestioned him to know who and what he was and he told them he was a hebrew and the story implies that he confessed himself to beguilty but these gentiles instead of sacrificing him at oncewithout pity or mercy as a company of bible prophets or priests wouldhave done by a gentile in the same case and as it is related samuelhad done by agag and moses by the women and children theyendeavored to save him though at the risk of their own lives for theaccount says nevertheless that is though jonah was a jew and aforeigner and the cause of all their misfortunes and the loss oftheir cargo the men rowed hard to bring it the boat to land butthey could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous againstthem still they were unwilling to put the fate of the lot intoexecution and they cried says the account unto the lord saying v 14 we beseech thee o lord we beseech thee let us notperish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood forthou o lord hast done as it pleased thee meaning thereby thatthey did not presume to judge jonah guilty since that he might beinnocent but that they considered the lot that had fallen to him as adecree of god or as it pleased god the address of this prayershows that the gentiles worshipped one supreme being and that theywere not idolaters as the jews represented them to be but thestorm still continuing and the danger increasing they put the fate ofthe lot into execution and cast jonah into the sea whereaccording to the story a great fish swallowed him up whole and alive we have now to consider jonah securely housed from the storm inthe fishs belly here we are told that he prayed but the prayer is amadeup prayer taken from various parts of the psalms without anyconnection or consistency and adapted to the distress but not at allto the condition that jonah was in it is such a prayer as a gentile who might know something of the psalms could copy out forhim this circumstance alone were there no other is sufficient toindicate that the whole is a madeup story the prayer however issupposed to have answered the purpose and the story goes on taking up at the same time the cant language of a bible prophet saying chap ii ver 10 and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land jonah then received a second mission to nineveh with which hesets out and we have now to consider him as a preacher thedistress he is represented to have suffered the remembrance of hisown disobedience as the cause of it and the miraculous escape he issupposed to have had were sufficient one would conceive to haveimpressed him with sympathy and benevolence in the execution of hismission but instead of this he enters the city with denunciationand malediction in his mouth crying chap iii ver 4 yetforty days and nineveh shall be overthrown we have now to consider this supposed missionary in the last actof his mission and here it is that the malevolent spirit of a bibleprophet or of a predicting priest appears in all thatblackness of character that men ascribe to the being they call thedevil having published his predictions he withdrew says the storyto the east side of the city but for what not to contemplate inretirement the mercy of his creator to himself or to others but towait with malignant impatience the destruction of nineveh it cameto pass however as the story relates that the ninevites reformedand that god according to the bible phrase repented him of theevil he had said he would do unto them and did it not this saiththe first verse of the last chapter displeased jonah exceedinglyand he was very angry his obdurate heart would rather that all nineveh should be destroyed and every soul young and old perishin its ruins than that his prediction should not be fulfilled toexpose the character of a prophet still more a gourd is made togrow up in the night that promised him an agreeable shelter fromthe heat of the sun in the place to which he had retired and thenext morning it dies here the rage of the prophet becomes excessive and he is ready todestroy himself it is better said he for me to die than tolive this brings on a supposed expostulation between the almightyand the prophet in which the former says doest thou well to beangry for the gourd and jonah said i do well to be angry even untodeath then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for whichthou hast not labored neither madest it grow which came up in anight and perished in a night and should not i spare nineveh thatgreat city in which are more than sixscore thousand persons thatcannot discern between their right hand and their left hand here is both the winding up of the satire and the moral of thefable as a satire it strikes against the character of all the bible prophets and against all the indiscriminate judgments upon men women and children with which this lying book the bible iscrowded such as noahs flood the destruction of the cities of sodom and gomorrah the extirpation of the canaanites even to thesucking infants and women with child because the same reflectionthat there are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand meaning youngchildren applies to all their cases it satirizes also the supposedpartiality of the creator for one nation more than for another as a moral it preaches against the malevolent spirit ofprediction for as certainly as a man predicts ill he becomesinclined to wish it the pride of having his judgment right hardenshis heart till at last he beholds with satisfaction or sees withdisappointment the accomplishment or the failure of hispredictions this book ends with the same kind of strong andwelldirected point against prophets prophecies and indiscriminatejudgment as the chapter that benjamin franklin made for the bibleabout abraham and the stranger ends against the intolerant spiritof religious persecution thus much for the book of jonah of the poetical parts of the bible that are called propheciesi have spoken in the former part of the age of reason and alreadyin this where i have said that the word prophet is the bible word forpoet and that the flights and metaphors of those poets many of which have become obscure by the lapse of time and the change ofcircumstances have been ridiculously erected into things calledprophecies and applied to purposes the writers never thought of when a priest quotes any of those passages he unriddles it agreeably to his own views and imposes that explanation upon his congregation as the meaning of the writer the whore of babylon has been the common whore of all the priests and each has accused the other of keeping the strumpet so well do they agree in their explanations there now remain only a few books which they call books of thelesser prophets and as i have already shown that the greater areimpostors it would be cowardice to disturb the repose of the littleones let them sleep then in the arms of their nurses thepriests and both be forgotten together i have now gone through the bible as a man would go through awood with an axe on his shoulder and fell trees here they lie andthe priests if they can may replant them they may perhaps stickthem in the ground but they will never make them grow i pass on tothe books of the new testament chapter iiturning to the new testament the new testament they tell us is founded upon the prophecies ofthe old if so it must follow the fate of its foundation as it is nothing extraordinary that a woman should be with childbefore she was married and that the son she might bring forthshould be executed even unjustly i see no reason for not believingthat such a woman as mary and such a man as joseph and jesusexisted their mere existence is a matter of indifference aboutwhich there is no ground either to believe or to disbelieve and whichcomes under the common head of it may be so and what then theprobability however is that there were such persons or at leastsuch as resembled them in part of the circumstances because almostall romantic stories have been suggested by some actualcircumstance as the adventures of robinson crusoe not a word ofwhich is true were suggested by the case of alexander selkirk it is not the existence or nonexistence of the persons that itrouble myself about it is the fable of jesus christ as told inthe new testament and the wild and visionary doctrine raised thereon against which i contend the story taking it as it is told is blasphemously obscene it gives an account of a young woman engaged to be married and while under this engagement she is to speak plain language debauched by a ghost under the impious pretence luke chap i ver 35 that the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee notwithstanding which joseph afterward marries her cohabits with her as his wife and in his turn rivals the ghost this is putting the story into intelligible language and when told in this manner there is not a priest but must be ashamed to own it mary the supposed virginmother of jesus had several otherchildren sons and daughters see matthew chap xiii verses 55 56 obscenity in matters of faith however wrapped up is always atoken of fable and imposture for it is necessary to our seriousbelief in god that we do not connect it with stories that run as thisdoes into ludicrous interpretations this story is upon the face ofit the same kind of story as that of jupiter and leda or jupiter and europa or any of the amorous adventures of jupiter and shows asis already stated in the former part of the age of reason that the christian faith is built upon the heathen mythology as the historical parts of the new testament so far as concerns jesus christ are confined to a very short space of time less thantwo years and all within the same country and nearly to the samespot the discordance of time place and circumstance whichdetects the fallacy of the books of the old testament and proves themto be impositions cannot be expected to be found here in the sameabundance the new testament compared with the old is like a farce of one act in which there is not room for very numerous violations ofthe unities there are however some glaring contradictions whichexclusive of the fallacy of the pretended prophecies are sufficientto show the story of jesus christ to be false i lay it down as a position which cannot be controverted firstthat the agreement of all the parts of a story does not prove thatstory to be true because the parts may agree and the whole may befalse secondly that the disagreement of the parts of a storyproves the whole cannot be true the agreement does not prove truebut the disagreement proves falsehood positively the history of jesus christ is contained in the four booksascribed to matthew mark luke and john the first chapter of matthew begins with giving a genealogy of jesus christ and in thethird chapter of luke there is also given a genealogy of jesus christ did those two agree it would not prove the genealogy to betrue because it might nevertheless be a fabrication but as theycontradict each other in every particular it proves falsehoodabsolutely if matthew speaks truth luke speaks falsehood and if luke speaks truth matthew speaks falsehood and as there is noauthority for believing one more than the other there is no authorityfor believing either and if they cannot be believed even in thevery first thing they say and set out to prove they are notentitled to be believed in any thing they say afterward truth is auniform thing and as to inspiration and revelation were we toadmit it it is impossible to suppose it can be contradictory eitherthen the men called apostles are impostors or the books ascribedto them has been written by other persons and fathered upon them as is the case with the old testament the book of matthew gives chap i ver 6 a genealogy by namefrom david up through joseph the husband of mary to christ andmakes there to be twentyeight generations the book of luke givesalso a genealogy by name from christ through joseph the husband of mary down to david and makes there to be fortythree generationsbesides which there are only the two names of david and joseph thatare alike in the two lists i here insert both genealogical lists andfor the sake of perspicuity and comparison have placed them both inthe same direction that is from joseph down to david genealogy according to matthew genealogy according to luke christ 23 josaphat christ 23 neri2 joseph 24 asa 2 joseph 24 melchi3 jacob 25 abia 3 heli 25 addi4 matthan 26 roboam 4 matthat 26 cosam5 eleazar 27 solomon 5 levi

included there are but 27full generations to find therefore the average age of each personmentioned in the list at the time his first son was born it isonly necessary to divide 1080 years by 27 which gives 40 years foreach person as the lifetime of man was then but the same extent it isnow it is an absurdity to suppose that 27 following generationsshould all be old bachelors before they married and the more sowhen we are told that solomon the next in succession to david had a house full of wives and mistresses before he was twentyone years of age so far from this genealogy being a solemn truth it is not even a reasonable lie this list of luke gives about twentysix years for the average age and this is too much now if these men matthew and luke set out with a falsehoodbetween them as these two accounts show they do in the verycommencement of their history of jesus christ and of whom and of what he was what authority as i have before asked is there left forbelieving the strange things they tell us afterward if they cannot bebelieved in their account of his natural genealogy how are we tobelieve them when they tell us he was the son of god begotten by aghost and that an angel announced this in secret to his mother ifthey lied in one genealogy why are we to believe them in the other if his natural genealogy be manufactured which it certainly is whyare we not to suppose that his celestial genealogy is manufacturedalso and that the whole is fabulous can any man of seriousreflection hazard his future happiness upon the belief of a storynaturally impossible repugnant to every idea of decency andrelated by persons already detected of falsehood is it not moresafe that we stop ourselves at the plain pure and unmixed beliefof one god which is deism than that we commit ourselves on anocean of improbable irrational indecent and contradictory tales the first question however upon the books of the new testament as upon those of the old is are they genuine were theywritten by the persons to whom they are ascribed for it is uponthis ground only that the strange things related therein have beencredited upon this point there is no direct proof for or against andall that this state of a case proves is doubtfulness and doubtfulnessis the opposite of belief the state therefore that the books arein proves against themselves as far as this kind of proof can go but exclusive of this the presumption is that the books calledthe evangelists and ascribed to matthew mark luke and john werenot written by matthew mark luke and john and that they areimpositions the disordered state of the history in those fourbooks the silence of one book upon matters related in the otherand the disagreement that is to be found among them implies that they are the production of some unconnected individuals many years after the things they pretend to relate each of whom made his own legend and not the writings of men living intimately together as the men called the apostles are supposed to have done  in fine that they have been manufactured as the books of the old testament have been by other persons than those whose names they bear the story of the angel announcing what the church calls theimmaculate conception is not so much as mentioned in the booksascribed to mark and john and is differently related in matthew and luke the former says the angel appeared to joseph the latter says itwas to mary but either joseph or mary was the worst evidence thatcould have been thought of for it was others that should havetestified for them and not they for themselves were any girl that isnow with child to say and even to swear it that she was gottenwith child by a ghost and that an angel told her so would she bebelieved certainly she would not why then are we to believe thesame thing of another girl whom we never saw told by nobody knowswho nor when nor where how strange and inconsistent it is that thesame circumstance that would weaken the belief even of a probablestory should be given as a motive for believing this one that hasupon the face of it every token of absolute impossibility andimposturethe story of herod destroying all the children under two yearsold belongs altogether to the book of matthew not one of the restmentions anything about it had such a circumstance been true theuniversality of it must have made it known to all the writers and thething would have been too striking to have been omitted by any thiswriter tells us that jesus escaped this slaughter because josephand mary were warned by an angel to flee with him unto egypt but heforgot to make any provision for john who was then under two years of age john however who stayed behind fared as well as jesus whofled and therefore the story circumstantially belies itself not any two of these writers agree in reciting exactly in thesame words the written inscription short as it is which they tellus was put over christ when he was crucified and besides this marksays he was crucified at the third hour nine in the morning and john says it was the sixth hour twelve at noon according to john the sentence was not passed till about thesixth hour noon and consequently the execution could not betill the afternoon but mark says expressly that he was crucifiedat the third hour nine in the morning chap xv verse 25 johnchap xix verse 14 the inscription is thus stated in these books matthew this is jesus the king of the jews mark the king of the jews luke this is the king of the jews john jesus of nazareth king of the jews we may infer from these circumstances trivial as they are thatthose writers whoever they were and in whatever time they livedwere not present at the scene the only one of the men called apostleswho appears to have been near the spot was peter and when he wasaccused of being one of jesus followers it is said matthewchap xxvi ver 74 then he peter began to curse and to swearsaying i know not the man yet we are now called upon to believe the same peter convicted by their own account of perjury for whatreason or on what authority shall we do this the accounts that are given of the circumstances that they tell usattended the crucifixion are differently related in these four books the book ascribed to matthew says chap xxvii v 45 now fromthe sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninthhour ver 51 52 53 and behold the veil of the temple wasrent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake andthe rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of thesaints which slept arose and came out of the graves after hisresurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many such is the account which this dashing writer of the book of matthewgives but in which he is not supported by the writers of the otherbooks the writer of the book ascribed to mark in detailing thecircumstances of the crucifixion makes no mention of anyearthquake nor of the rocks rending nor of the graves opening norof the dead men walking out the writer of the book of luke issilent also upon the same points and as to the writer of the bookof john though he details all the circumstances of the crucifixiondown to the burial of christ he says nothing about either thedarkness the veil of the temple the earthquake the rocks thegraves nor the dead men now if it had been true that those things had happened and ifthe writers of those books had lived at the time they did happenand had been the persons they are said to be namely the four mencalled apostles matthew mark luke and john it was not possible forthem as true historians even without the aid of inspiration notto have recorded them the things supposing them to have beenfacts were of too much notoriety not to have been known and of toomuch importance not to have been told all these supposed apostlesmust have been witnesses of the earthquake if there had been any for it was not possible for them to have been absent from it theopening of the graves and the resurrection of the dead men andtheir walking about the city is of greater importance than theearthquake an earthquake is always possible and natural and provesnothing but this opening of the graves is supernatural and directlyin point to their doctrine their cause and their apostleship had itbeen true it would have filled up whole chapters of those booksand been the chosen theme and general chorus of all the writers butinstead of this little and trivial things and mere prattlingconversations of he said this and he said that are oftentediously detailed while this most important of all had it beentrue is passed off in a slovenly manner by a single dash of thepen and that by one writer only and not so much as hinted at bythe rest it is an easy thing to tell a lie but it is difficult tosupport the lie after it is told the writer of the book of matthewshould have told us who the saints were that came to life again andwent into the city and what became of them afterward and who itwas that saw them for he is not hardy enough to say he saw themhimself whether they came out naked and all in natural buffhesaints and shesaints or whether they came full dressed and where they got their dresses whether they went to their former habitations and reclaimed their wives their husbands and their property and how they were received whether they entered ejectments for the recovery of their possessions or brought actions of crim con against the rival interlopers whether they remained on earth and followed their former occupation of preaching or working or whether they died again or went back to their graves alive and buried themselves strange indeed that an army of saints should return to life andnobody know who they were nor who it was that saw them and thatnot a word more should be said upon the subject nor these saints have anything to tell us had it been the prophets who as we are told had formerly prophesied of these things they must have had a great deal to say they could have told us everything and we should have had posthumous prophecies with notes and commentaries upon the first a little better at least than we have now had it been moses and aaron and joshua and samuel and david not an unconverted jew had remained in all jerusalem had it been john the baptist and the saints of the time then present everybody would have known them and they would have outpreached and outfamed all the other apostles but instead of this these saints were made to pop up like jonahs gourd in the night for no purpose at all but to wither in the morning thus much for this part of the story the tale of the resurrection follows that of the crucifixionand in this as well as in that the writers whoever they weredisagree so much as to make it evident that none of them were there the book of matthew states that when christ was put in thesepulchre the jews applied to pilate for a watch or a guard to beplaced over the sepulchre to prevent the body being stolen by thedisciples and that in consequence of this request the sepulchre wasmade sure sealing the stone that covered the mouth and setting awatch but the other books say nothing about this application norabout the sealing nor the guard nor the watch and according totheir accounts there were none matthew however follows up thispart of the story of the guard or the watch with a second part that ishall notice in the conclusion as it serves to detect the fallacyof these books the book of matthew continues its account and says chapxxviii ver 1 that at the end of the sabbath as it began todawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and theother mary to see the sepulchre mark says it was sunrising and john says it was dark luke says it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that came to thesepulchre and john states that mary magdalene came alone so welldo they agree about their first evidence they all however appear tohave known most about mary magdalene she was a woman of a largeacquaintance and it was not an ill conjecture that she might beupon the stroll the book of matthew goes on to say ver 2 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it but the other books say nothing about any earthquake nor about the angel rolling back the stone and sitting upon it and according to their account there was no angel sitting there mark says the angel was within the sepulchre sitting on the right side luke says there were two and they were both standing up and john says they were both sitting down one at the head and the other at the feet matthew says that the angel that was sitting upon the stone on theoutside of the sepulchre told the two marys that christ was risen andthat the women went away quickly mark says that the women uponseeing the stone rolled away and wondering at it went into thesepulchre and that it was the angel that was sitting within on theright side that told them so luke says it was the two angels thatwere standing up and john says it was jesus christ himself thattold it to mary magdalene and that she did not go into the sepulchrebut only stooped down and looked in now if the writer of those four books had gone into a court ofjustice to prove an alibi for it is of the nature of an alibi that ishere attempted to be proved namely the absence of a dead body bysupernatural means and had they given their evidence in the samecontradictory manner as it is here given they would have been indanger of having their ears cropped for perjury and would have justlydeserved it yet this is the evidence and these are the books thathave been imposed upon the world as being given by divineinspiration and as the unchangeable word of god the writer of the book of matthew after giving this accountrelates a story that is not to be found in any of the other books andwhich is the same i have just before alluded to now says he that is after the conversation the women had withthe angel sitting upon the stone behold some of the watch meaning the watch that he had said had been placed over thesepulchre came into the city showed unto the chief priests all thethings that were done and when they were assembled with the eldersand had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldierssaying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away whilewe slept and if this come to the governors ears we will persuadehim and secure you so they took the money and did as they weretaught and this saying that his disciples stole him away iscommonly reported among the jews until this day the expression until this day is an evidence that the bookascribed to matthew was not written by matthew and that it had beenmanufactured long after the time and things of which it pretends totreat for the expression implies a great length of interveningtime it would be inconsistent in us to speak in this manner ofanything happening in our own time to give therefore intelligiblemeaning to the expression we must suppose a lapse of some generations at least for this manner of speaking carries the mind back to ancient time the absurdity also of the story is worth noticing for it showsthe writer of the book of matthew to have been an exceedingly weak and foolish man he tells a story that contradicts itself in point ofpossibility for through the guard if there were any might be madeto say that the body was taken away while they were asleep and togive that as a reason for their not having prevented it that samesleep must also have prevented their knowing how and by whom it was done and yet they are made to say that it was the disciples who did it were a man to tender his evidence of something that heshould say was done and of the manner of doing it and of theperson who did it while he was asleep and could know nothing ofthe matter such evidence could not be received it will do wellenough for testament evidence but not for anything where truth isconcerned i come now to that part of the evidence in those books thatrespects the pretended appearance of christ after this pretendedresurrection the writer of the book of matthew relates that the angel that wassitting on the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre said to the two marys chap xxviii ver 7 behold christ has gone before youinto galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you and thesame writer at the next two verses 8 9 makes christ himself tospeak to the same purpose to these women immediately after the angel had told it to them and that they ran quickly to tell it to thedisciples and at the 16th verse it is said then the elevendisciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus hadappointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but the writer of the book of john tells us a story very differentto this for he says chap xx ver 19 then the same day atevening being the first day of the week that is the same day that christ is said to have risen when the doors were shut where thedisciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stoodin the midst of them according to matthew the eleven were marching to galilee to meet jesus in a mountain by his own appointment at the very time whenaccording to john they were assembled in another place and thatnot by appointment but in secret for fear of the jews the writer of the book of luke contradicts that of matthew morepointedly than john does for he says expressly that the meeting wasin jerusalem the evening of the same day that he christ rose andthat the eleven were there see luke chap xxiv ver 13 33 now it is not possible unless we admit these supposeddisciples the right of willful lying that the writer of those bookscould be any of the eleven persons called disciples for if accordingto matthew the eleven went into galilee to meet jesus in a mountainby his own appointment on the same day that he is said to haverisen luke and john must have been two of that eleven yet the writer of luke says expressly and john implies as much that the meeting was that same day in a house in jerusalem and on the other hand if according to luke and john the eleven were assembled in a house in jerusalem matthew must have been one of that eleven yet matthew says the meeting was in a mountain in galilee and consequently the evidence given in those books destroys each other the writer of the book of mark says nothing about any meeting in galilee but he says chap xvi ver 12 that christ after hisresurrection appeared in another form to two of them as they walkedinto the country and that these two told it to the residue who wouldnot believe them luke also tells a story in which he keeps christemployed the whole day of this pretended resurrection until theevening and which totally invalidates the account of going to themountain in galilee he says that two of them without saying whichtwo went that same day to a village call emmaus three score furlongs seven miles and a half from jerusalem and that christ in disguisewent with them and stayed with them unto the evening and supped with them and then vanished out of their sight and reappeared thatsame evening at the meeting of the eleven in jerusalem this is the contradictory manner in which the evidence of thispretended reappearance of christ is stated the only point in whichthe writers agree is the skulking privacy of that reappearancefor whether it was in the recess of a mountain in galilee or ashutup house in jerusalem it was still skulking to what causethen are we to assign this skulking on the one hand it is directlyrepugnant to the supposed or pretended end that of convincing theworld that christ had risen and on the other hand to have assertedthe publicity of it would have exposed the writers of those books topublic detection and therefore they have been under the necessityof making it a private affair as to the account of christ being seen by more than five hundredat once it is paul only who says it and not the five hundred who sayit for themselves it is therefore the testimony of but one man andthat too of a man who did not according to the same accountbelieve a word of the matter himself at the time it is said to havehappened his evidence supposing him to have been the writer of the15th chapter of corinthians where this account is given is like thatof a man who comes into a court of justice to swear that what he hadsworn before is false a man may often see reason and he has tooalways the right of changing his opinion but this liberty does notextend to matters of fact i now come to the last scene that of the ascension into heaven here all fear of the jews and of everything else must necessarilyhave been out of the question it was that which if true was to sealthe whole and upon which the reality of the future mission of thedisciples was to rest for proof words whether declarations orpromises that passed in private either in the recess of a mountainin galilee or in a shutup house in jerusalem even supposing themto have been spoken could not be evidence in public it was thereforenecessary that this last scene should preclude the possibility ofdenial and dispute and that it should be as i have stated in theformer part of the age of reason as public and as visible as thesun at noonday at least it ought to have been as public as thecrucifixion is reported to have been but to come to the point in the first place the writer of the book of matthew does not saya syllable about it neither does the writer of the book of john thisbeing the case it is not possible to suppose that those writerswho effect to be even minute in other matters would have beensilent upon this had it been true the writer of the book of markpasses it off in a careless slovenly manner with a single dash ofthe pen as if he was tired of romancing or ashamed of the story soalso does the writer of luke and even between these two there is notan apparent agreement as to the place where his final parting issaid to have been the book of mark says that christ appeared to the eleven as theysat at meat alluding to the meeting of the eleven at jerusalem hethen states the conversation that he says passed at that meetingand immediately after says as a schoolboy would finish a dull storyso then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god but the writer of luke says that the ascension was from bethany that he christ led them out as far as bethany and was parted from them and was carried up into heaven so also was mahomet and as to moses the apostle jude says ver 9 that michael and the devil disputed about his body while we believe such fables as these or either of them we believeunworthily of the almighty i have now gone through the examination of the four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john and when it is considered that the whole space of time from the crucifixion to what is called theascension is but a few days apparently not more than three or fourand that all the circumstances are said to have happened nearlyabout the same spot jerusalem it is i believe impossible to findin any story upon record so many and such glaring absurditiescontradictions and falsehoods as are in those books they are morenumerous and striking than i had any expectation of finding when ibegan this examination and far more so than i had any idea of when i wrote the former part of the age of reason i had then neither biblenor testament to refer to nor could i procure any my ownsituation even as to existence was becoming every day moreprecarious and as i was willing to leave something behind me on thesubject i was obliged to be quick and concise the quotations ithen made were from memory only but they are correct and theopinions i have advanced in that work are the effect of the most clearand longestablished conviction that the bible and the testament areimpositions upon the world that the fall of man the account of jesus christ being the son of god and of his dying to appease the wrathof god and of salvation by that strange means are all fabulousinventions dishonorable to the wisdom and power of the almighty that the only true religion is deism by which i then meant and meannow the belief of one god and an imitation of his moral characteror the practice of what are called moral virtues and that it wasupon this only so far as religion is concerned that i rested allmy hopes of happiness hereafter so say i now and so help me god but to return to the subject though it is impossible at thisdistance of time to ascertain as a fact who were the writers of thosefour books and this alone is sufficient to hold them in doubt andwhere we doubt we do not believe it is not difficult to ascertainnegatively that they were not written by the persons to whom theyare ascribed the contradictions in those books demonstrate twothings first that the writers could not have been eyewitnesses andearwitnesses of the matters they relate or they would have relatedthem without those contradictions and consequently that the bookshave not been written by the persons called apostles who are supposed to have been witnesses of this kind secondly that the writers whoever they were have not acted inconcerted imposition but each writer separately and individuallyfor himself and without the knowledge of the other the same evidence that applies to prove the one applies equallyto prove both cases that is that the books were not written by themen called apostles and also that they are not a concertedimposition as to inspiration it is altogether out of the questionwe may as well attempt to unite truth and falsehood as inspirationand contradiction if four men are eyewitnesses and earwitnesses to a scene theywill without any concert between them agree as to time and placewhen and where that scene happened their individual knowledge ofthe thing each one knowing it for himself renders concert totallyunnecessary the one will not say it was in a mountain in the countryand the other at a house in town the one will not say it was atsunrise and the other that it was dark for in whatever place it wasat whatever time it was they know it equally alike and on the other hand if four men concert a story they willmake their separate relations of that story agree and corroborate witheach other to support the whole that concert supplies the want offact in the one case as the knowledge of the fact supersedes inthe other case the necessity of a concert the same contradictionstherefore that prove that there has been no concert prove alsothat the reporters had no knowledge of the fact or rather of thatwhich they relate as a fact and detect also the falsehood of theirreports those books therefore have neither been written by themen called apostles nor by impostors in concert how then have theybeen written i am not one of those who are fond of believing there is much ofthat which is called willful lying or lying originally except in thecase of men setting up to be prophets as in the old testament forprophesying is lying professionally in almost all other cases itis not difficult to discover the progress by which even simplesupposition with the aid of credulity will in time grow into alie and at last be told as a fact and whenever we can find acharitable reason for a thing of this kind we ought not to indulgea severe one the story of jesus christ appearing after he was dead is the storyof an apparition such as timid imaginations can always create invision and credulity believe stories of this kind had been told ofthe assassination of julius caesar not many years before and theygenerally have their origin in violent deaths or in the executionof innocent persons in cases of this kind compassion lends its aidand benevolently stretches the story it goes on a little and a littlefurther till it becomes a most certain truth once start a ghost andcredulity fills up the history of its life and assigns the cause ofits appearance one tells it one way another another way tillthere are as many stories about the ghost and about the proprietorof the ghost as there are about jesus christ in these four books the story of the appearance of jesus christ is told with thatstrange mixture of the natural and impossible that distinguisheslegendary tale from fact he is represented as suddenly coming inand going out when the doors were shut and of vanishing out ofsight and appearing again as one would conceive of an unsubstantialvision then again he is hungry sits down to meat and eats hissupper but as those who tell stories of this kind never provide forall the cases so it is here they have told us that when he arosehe left his grave clothes behind him but they have forgotten toprovide other clothes for him to appear in afterward or to tell uswhat he did with them when he ascended whether he stripped all offor went up clothes and all in the case of elijah they have beencareful enough to make him throw down his mantle how it happened not to be burned in the chariot of fire they also have not told us butas imagination supplies all deficiencies of this kind we maysuppose if we please that it was made of salamanders wool those who are not much acquainted with ecclesiastical historymay suppose that the book called the new testament has existed eversince the time of jesus christ as they suppose that the booksascribed to moses have existed ever since the time of moses but thefact is historically otherwise there was no such book as the new testament till more than three hundred years after the time that christ is said to have lived at what time the books ascribed to matthew mark luke and johnbegan to appear is altogether a matter of uncertainty there is notthe least shadow of evidence of who the persons were that wrotethem nor at what time they were written and they might as wellhave been called by the names of any of the other supposed apostlesas by the names they are now called the originals are not in thepossession of any christian church existing any more than the twotables of stone written on they pretend by the finger of god upon mount sinai and given to moses are in the possession of the jews and even if they were there is no possibility of proving thehandwriting in either case at the time those books were written therewas no printing and consequently there could be no publicationotherwise than by written copies which any man might make or alter at pleasure and call them originals  can we suppose it is consistentwith the wisdom of the almighty to commit himself and his will to man upon such precarious means as these or that it is consistent weshould pin our faith upon such uncertainties we cannot make noralter nor even imitate so much as one blade of grass that he hasmade and yet we can make or alter words of god as easily as wordsof man the former part of the “the age of reason” has not been published in two years and there is already an expression in it that is not mine the expression is the book of luke was carried by a majority of one voice only it may be true but it is not i that have said it some person who might know of the circumstance has added it in a note at the bottom of the page of some of the editions printed either in england or in america and the printers after that have placed it into the body of the work and made me the author of it if this has happened within such a short space of time notwithstanding the aid of printing which prevents the alteration of copies individually what may not have happened in a much greater length of time when there was no printing and when any man who could write could make a written copy and call it an original by matthew mark luke or john about three hundred and fifty years after the time that christis said to have lived several writings of the kind i am speaking ofwere scattered in the hands of diverse individuals and as thechurch had began to form itself into a hierarchy or churchgovernment with temporal powers it set itself about collectingthem into a code as we now see them called the new testament they decided by vote as i have before said in the former part of “the age of reason” which of those writings out of the collection they had made should be the word of god and which should not the rabbins of the jews had decided by vote upon the books of the bible before as the object of the church as is the case in all nationalestablishments of churches was power and revenue and terror themeans it used it is consistent to suppose that the most miraculousand wonderful of the writings they had collected stood the best chanceof being voted and as to the authenticity of the books the votestands in the place of it for it can be traced no higher disputes however ran high among the people then callingthemselves christians not only as to points of doctrine but as tothe authenticity of the books in the contest between the personscalled st augustine and fauste about the year 400 the lattersays the books called the evangelists have been composed longafter the times of the apostles by some obscure men who fearing that the world would not give credit to their relation of matters ofwhich they could not be informed have published them under thenames of the apostles and which are so full of sottishness anddiscordant relations that there is neither agreement nor connectionbetween them and in another place addressing himself to the advocates of thosebooks as being the word of god he says it is thus that yourpredecessors have inserted in the scriptures of our lord manythings which though they carry his name agrees not with hisdoctrines this is not surprising since that we have often provedthat these things have not been written by himself nor by hisapostles but that for the greater part they are founded upon talesupon vague reports and put together by i know not what halfjewsbut with little agreement between them and which they havenevertheless published under the names of the apostles of our lordand have thus attributed to them their own errors and their lies i have these two extracts from boulangers life of paulwritten in french boulanger has quoted them from the writings of augustine against fauste to which he refers the reader will see by these extracts that the authenticity ofthe books of the new testament was denied and the books treated astales forgeries and lies at the time they were voted to be the wordof god  but the interest of the church with the assistance of thefagot bore down the opposition and at last suppressed allinvestigation miracles followed upon miracles if we will believethem and men were taught to say they believed whether they believed or not but by way of throwing in a thought the french revolution has excommunicated the church from the power of working miracles she has not been able with the assistance of all her saints to work one miracle since the revolution began and as she never stood in greater need than now we may without the aid of divination conclude that all her former miracles were tricks and lies boulanger in his life of paul has collected from theecclesiastical histories and from the writings of fathers as theyare called several matters which show the opinions that prevailedamong the different sects of christians at the time the testamentas we now see it was voted to be the word of god the followingextracts are from the second chapter of that work the marcionists a christian sect assumed that the evangelistswere filled with falsities the manicheans who formed a very numerous sect at the commencement of christianity rejected as false all the new testament and showed other writings quite different that they gave for authentic the cerinthians like the marcionists admittednot the acts of the apostles the encratites and the severiansadopted neither the acts nor the epistles of paul chrysostom in ahomily which he made upon the acts of the apostles says that in histime about the year 400 many people knew nothing either of theauthor or of the book st irene who lived before that timereports that the valentinians like several other sects of christiansaccused the scriptures of being filled with imperfections errors andcontradictions the ebionites or nazarines who were the first christians rejected all the epistles of paul and regarded him as animpostor they report among other things that he was originally apagan that he came to jerusalem where he lived some time and thathaving a mind to marry the daughter of the high priest he causedhimself to be circumcised but that not being able to obtain her hequarreled with the jews and wrote against circumcision and againstthe observance of the sabbath and against all the legal ordinances when we consider the lapse of more than three hundred yearsintervening between the time that christ is said to have lived and thetime the new testament was formed into a book we must see evenwithout the assistance of historical evidence the exceedinguncertainty there is of its authenticity the authenticity of the bookof homer so far as regards the authorship is much better establishedthan that of the new testament though homer is a thousand years the most ancient it is only an exceedingly good poet that could havewritten the book of homer and therefore few men only could haveattempted it and a man capable of doing it would not have thrown away his own fame by giving it to another in like manner there were but few that could have composed euclids elements because none but an exceedingly good geometrician could have been the author of that work but with respect to the books of the new testament particularlysuch parts as tell us of the resurrection and ascension of christ anyperson who could tell a story of an apparition or of a manswalking could have made such books for the story is most wretchedlytold the chance therefore of forgery in the testament ismillions to one greater than in the case of homer or euclid of thenumerous priests or parsons of the present day bishops and all everyone of them can make a sermon or translate a scrap of latinespecially if it had been translated a thousand times before but isthere any among them that can write poetry like homer or science like euclid the sum total of a persons learning with very fewexceptions is a b ab and hic haec hoc and their knowledge ofscience is three times one is three and this is more thansufficient to have enabled them had they lived at the time to havewritten all the books of the new testament as the opportunities of forgeries were greater so also was theinducement a man could gain no advantage by writing under the name of homer or euclid if he could write equal to them it would be better that he wrote under his own name if inferior he could not succeed pride would prevent the former and impossibility the latter but with respect to such books as compose the new testament all theinducements were on the side of forgery the best imagined historythat could have been made at the distance of two or three hundredyears after the time could not have passed for an original underthe name of the real writer the only chance of success lay inforgery for the church wanted pretence for its new doctrine andtruth and talents were out of the question but as is not uncommon as before observed to relate stories ofpersons walking after they are dead and of ghosts and apparitionsof such as have fallen by some violent or extraordinary means andas the people of that day were in the habit of believing suchthings and of the appearance of angels and also of devils and oftheir getting into peoples insides and shaking them like a fit ofan ague and of their being cast out again as if by an emetic mary magdalene the book of mark tells us has brought up or beenbrought to bed of seven devils it was nothing extraordinary thatsome story of this kind should get abroad of the person called jesus christ and become afterward the foundation of the four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john each writer told the tale as he heard it or thereabouts and gave to his book the name of the saint or the apostle whom tradition had given as the eyewitness it is only upon this ground that the contradiction in those books can beaccounted for and if this be not the case they are downrightimpositions lies and forgeries without even the apology ofcredulity that they have been written by a sort of half jews as theforegoing quotations mention is discernable enough the frequentreferences made to that chief assassin and impostor moses and to the men called prophets establish this point and on the other band the church has complemented the fraud by admitting the bible and the testament to reply to each other between the christian jew and the christian gentile the thing called a prophecy and the thingprophesied the type and the thing typified the sign and the thingsignified have been industriously rummaged up and fitted togetherlike old locks and picklock keys the story foolishly enough toldof eve and the serpent and naturally enough as to the enmitybetween men and serpents for the serpent always bites about the heel because it cannot reach higher and the man always knocks theserpent about the head as the most effectual way to prevent itsbiting this foolish story i say has been made into a prophecy atype and a promise to begin with and the lying imposition of isaiah to ahaz that a virgin shall conceive and bear a son as a signthat ahaz should conquer when the event was that he was defeated as already noticed in the observations on the book of isaiah hasbeen perverted and made to serve as a winder up it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel genesischap iii verse 15 jonah and the whale are also made into a sign or a type jonahis jesus and the whale is the grave for it is said and they havemade christ to say it of himself matt chap xii ver 40 for as jonah was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shallthe son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of theearth but it happens awkwardly enough that christ according totheir own account was but one day and two nights in the graveabout 36 hours instead of 72 that is the friday night the saturday and the saturday night for they say he was up on the sunday morning by sunrise or before but as this fits quite as well as the bite and the kick in genesis or the virgin and her son in isaiahit will pass in the lump of orthodox things thus much for thehistorical part of the testament and its evidences epistles of paul the epistles ascribed to paul being fourteenin number almost fill up the remaining part of the testament whether those epistles were written by the person to whom they are ascribed is a matter of no great importance since the writer whoever he was attempts to prove his doctrine by argument he does not pretend to have been witness to any of the scenes told of the resurrection and the ascension and he declares that he had not believed them the story of his being struck to the ground as he was journeyingto damascus has nothing in it miraculous or extraordinary heescaped with life and that is more than many others have done whohave been struck with lightning and that he should lose his sight forthree days and be unable to eat or drink during that time is nothingmore than is common in such conditions his companions that werewith him appear not to have suffered in the same manner for they were well enough to lead him the remainder of the journey neither did they pretend to have seen any vision the character of the person called paul according to the accountsgiven of him has in it a great deal of violence and fanaticism hehad persecuted with as much heat as he preached afterward thestroke he had received had changed his thinking without alteringhis constitution and either as a jew or a christian he was thesame zealot such men are never good moral evidences of any doctrine they preach they are always in extremes as well of actions as of belief the doctrine he sets out to prove by argument is theresurrection of the same body and he advances this as an evidenceof immortality but so much will men differ in their manner ofthinking and in the conclusions they draw from the same premisesthat this doctrine of the resurrection of the same body so far frombeing an evidence of immortality appears to me to furnish an evidence against it for if i have already died in this body and am raised again in the same body in which i have lived it is a presumptive evidence that i shall die again that resurrection no more secures me against the repetition of dying than an aguefit when passed secures me against another to believe therefore in immortality i must have a more elevated idea than is contained in the gloomy doctrine of the resurrection besides as a matter of choice as well as of hope i had ratherhave a better body and a more convenient form than the present every animal in the creation excels us in something the wingedinsects without mentioning doves or eagles can pass over morespace and with greater ease in a few minutes than man can in anhour the glide of the smallest fish in proportion to its bulkexceeds us in motion almost beyond comparison and withoutweariness even the sluggish snail can ascend from the bottom of adungeon where a man by the want of that ability would perish and a spider can launch itself from the top as a playful amusement thepersonal powers of man are so limited and his heavy frame so littleconstructed to extensive enjoyment that there is nothing to induce usto wish the opinion of paul to be true it is too little for themagnitude of the scene too mean for the sublimity of the subject but all other arguments apart the consciousness of existence isthe only conceivable idea we can have of another life and thecontinuance of that consciousness is immortality the consciousness ofexistence or the knowing that we exist is not necessarily confinedto the same form nor to the same matter even in this life we have not in all cases the same form nor in any case the samematter that composed our bodies twenty or thirty years ago and yet we are conscious of being the same persons even legs and arms which make up almost half the human frame are not necessary to theconsciousness of existence these may be lost or taken away and thefull consciousness of existence remain and were their placesupplied by wings or other appendages we cannot conceive that itwould alter our consciousness of existence in short we know nothow much or rather how little of our composition it is and howexquisitely fine that little is that creates in us this consciousnessof existence and all beyond that is like the pulp of a peachdistinct and separate from the vegetative speck in the kernel who can say by what exceedingly fine action of fine matter it isthat a thought is produced in what we call the mind and yet thatthought when produced as i now produce the thought i am writing iscapable of becoming immortal and is the only production of man thathas that capacity statues of brass or marble will perish and statues made inimitation of them are not the same statues nor the sameworkmanship any more than the copy of a picture is the samepicture but print and reprint a thought a thousand times over andthat with materials of any kind carve it in wood or engrave it onstone the thought is eternally and identically the same thought inevery case it has a capacity of unimpaired existence unaffected bychange of matter and is essentially distinct and of a naturedifferent from every thing else that we know or can conceive ifthen the thing produced has in itself a capacity of being immortalit is more than a token that the power that produced it which isthe selfsame thing as consciousness of existence can be immortalalso and that as independently of the matter it was first connectedwith as the thought is of the printing or writing it first appearedin the one idea is not more difficult to believe than the otherand we can see that one is true that the consciousness of existence is not dependent on the sameform or the same matter is demonstrated to our senses in the worksof the creation as far as our senses are capable of receiving thatdemonstration a very numerous part of the animal creation preaches to us far better that paul the belief of a life hereafter their littlelife resembles an earth and a heaven a present and a future stateand comprises if it may be so expressed immortality in miniature the most beautiful parts of the creation to our eye are the wingedinsects and they are not so originally they acquire that form andthat inimitable brilliancy by progressive changes the slow andcreeping caterpillarworm of today passes in a few days to a torpidfigure and a state resembling death and in the next change comesforth in all the miniature magnificence of life a splendid butterfly no resemblance of the former creature remains everything ischanged all his powers are new and life is to him another thing we cannot conceive that the consciousness of existence is not the same in this state of the animal as before why then must i believe that the resurrection of the same body is necessary to continue to me the consciousness of existence hereafter in the former part of the age of reason i have called the creationthe only true and real word of god and this instance or this textin the book of creation not only shows to us that this thing may beso but that it is so and that the belief of a future state is arational belief founded upon facts visible in the creation for it isnot more difficult to believe that we shall exist hereafter in abetter state and form than at present than that a worm shouldbecome a butterfly and quit the dunghill for the atmosphere if wedid not know it as a fact as to the doubtful jargon ascribed to paul in the 15th chapterof i corinthians which makes part of the burial service of some christian sectaries it is as destitute of meaning as the tolling of abell at a funeral it explains nothing to the understanding itillustrates nothing to the imagination but leaves the reader tofind any meaning if he can all flesh says he is not the sameflesh there is one flesh of men another of beast another of fishesand another of birds and what then nothing a cook could havesaid as much there are also says he bodies celestial and bodiesterrestrial the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of theterrestrial is another and what then nothing and what is thedifference nothing that he has told there is says he one glory ofthe sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of thestars and what then nothing except that he says that one stardiffereth from another star in glory instead of distance and hemight as well have told us that the moon did not shine so bright asthe sun all this is nothing better than the jargon of a conjuror whopicks up phrases he does not understand to confound the credulouspeople who have come to have their fortunes told priests andconjurors are of the same trade sometimes paul affects to be a naturalist and to prove hissystem of resurrection from the principles of vegetation thoufool says he that which thou sowest is not quickened except itdie to which one might reply in his own language and say thoufool paul that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dienot for the grain that dies in the ground never does nor canvegetate it is only the living grains that produce the next crop but the metaphor in any point of view is no simile it issuccession and not resurrection the progress of an animal from one state of being to another asfrom a worm to a butterfly applies to the case but this of a graindoes not and shows paul to have been what he says of others a fool whether the fourteen epistles ascribed to paul were written by himor not is a matter of indifference they are either argumentativeor dogmatical and as the argument is defective and the dogmaticalpart is merely presumptive it signifies not who wrote them and thesame may be said for the remaining parts of the testament it is notupon the epistles but upon what is called the gospel contained inthe four books ascribed to matthew mark luke and john and uponthe pretended prophecies that the theory of the church calling itselfthe christian church is founded the epistles are dependent uponthose and must follow their fate for if the story of jesus christ befabulous all reasoning founded upon it as a supposed truth mustfall with it we know from history that one of the principal leaders of thischurch athanasius lived at the time the new testament was formed and we know also from the absurd jargon he left us under the name of a creed the character of the men who formed the new testament and we know also from the same history that the authenticity of the books of which it is composed was denied at the time it was upon the vote of such as athanasius that the testament was decreed to be the word of god and nothing can present to us a more strange idea than that of decreeing the word of god by vote those who rest their faith upon such authority put man in the place of god and have no foundation for future happiness credulity however is not a crime but it becomes criminal by resisting conviction it is strangling in the womb of the conscience the efforts it makes to ascertain truth we should never force belief upon ourselves in anything athanasius died according to the church chronology in theyear 371 i here close the subject of the old testament and the new theevidence i have produced to prove them forgeries is extracted from the books themselves and acts like a twoedged sword either way if the evidence be denied the authenticity of the scriptures is deniedwith it for it is scripture evidence and if the evidence beadmitted the authenticity of the books is disproved thecontradictory impossibilities contained in the old testament and the new put them in the case of a man who swears for and against either evidence convicts him of perjury and equally destroysreputation should the bible and the new testament hereafter fall it is not ithat have been the occasion i have done no more than extracted theevidence from the confused mass of matter with which it is mixedand arranged that evidence in a point of light to be clearly seenand easily comprehended and having done this i leave the readerto judge for himself as i have judged for myself chapter iiiconclusion in the former part of “the age of reason” i have spoken of the three frauds mystery miracle and prophecy and as i have seen nothing in any of the answers to that work that in the least affects what i have there said upon those subjects i shall not encumber this second part with additions that are not necessary i have spoken also in the same work upon what is calledrevelation and have shown the absurd misapplication of that term tothe books of the old testament and the new for certainly revelationis out of the question in reciting anything of which man has beenthe actor or the witness that which a man has done or seen needsno revelation to tell him he had done it or seen it for he knows italready nor to enable him to tell it or to write it it isignorance or imposition to apply the term revelation in such casesyet the bible and testament are classed under this fraudulentdescription of being all revelation revelation then so far as the term has relation between god andman can only be applied to something which god reveals of his will toman but though the power of the almighty to make such a communication is necessarily admitted because to that power all things are possible yet the thing so revealed if anything ever was revealed and which bye the bye it is impossible to prove is revelation to the person only to whom it is made his account of it to another person is not revelation and whoever puts faith in that account puts it in the man from whom the account comes and that man may have been deceived or may have dreamed it or he may be an impostor and may lie there is no possible criterion whereby to judge of the truth of what he tells for even the morality of it would be no proof of revelation in all such cases the proper answer would be when it is revealed to me i will believe it to be a revelation but it is not and cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it to be revelation before neither is it proper that i should take the word of a man as the word of god and put man in the place of god this is the manner in which i have spoken of revelation in the former part of the age of reason and which while it reverentially admitsrevelation as a possible thing because as before said to the almighty all things are possible it prevents the imposition of oneman upon another and precludes the wicked use of pretendedrevelation but though speaking for myself i thus admit the possibility ofrevelation i totally disbelieve that the almighty ever didcommunicate anything to man by any mode of speech in any language or by any kind of vision or appearance or by any means which our senses are capable of receiving otherwise than by the universal display of himself in the works of the creation and by that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad actions and the disposition to do good ones the most detestable wickedness the most horrid cruelties and thegreatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had theirorigin in this thing called revelation or revealed religion it hasbeen the most dishonorable belief against the character of the divinity the most destructive to morality and the peace and happinessof man that ever was propagated since man began to exist it isbetter far better that we admitted if it were possible athousand devils to roam at large and to preach publicly thedoctrine of devils if there were any such than that we permitted onesuch impostor and monster as moses joshua samuel and the bibleprophets to come with the pretended word of god in his mouth andhave credit among us whence arose all the horrid assassinations of whole nations ofmen women and infants with which the bible is filled and thebloody persecutions and tortures unto death and religious warsthat since that time have laid europe in blood and ashes whencerose they but from this impious thing called revealed religion andthis monstrous belief that god has spoken to man the lies of the bible have been the cause of the one and the lies of the testament ofthe other some christians pretend that christianity was not established bythe sword but of what period of time do they speak it was impossible that twelve men could begin with the sword they had not the power but no sooner were the professors of christianity sufficiently powerful to employ the sword than they did so and the stake and fagot too and mahomet could not do it sooner by the same spirit that peter cut off the ear of the high priests servant if the story be true he would have cut off his head and the head of his master had he been able besides this christianity grounds itself originally upon the bible and the bible was established altogether by the sword and that in the worst use of it not to terrify but to extirpate the jews made no converts they butchered all the bible is the sire of the testament and both are called the word of god the christians read both books the ministers preach from both books and this thing called christianity is made up of both it is then false to say that christianity was not established by the sword the only sect that has not persecuted are the quakers and theonly reason that can be given for it is that they are rather deiststhan christians they do not believe much about jesus christ and they call the scriptures a dead letter had they called them by a worse name they had been nearer the truth it is incumbent on every man who reverences the character of the creator and who wishes to lessen the catalogue of artificialmiseries and remove the cause that has sown persecutions thickamong mankind to expel all ideas of revealed religion as a dangerousheresy and an impious fraud what is that we have learned from thispretended thing called revealed religion nothing that is useful toman and everything that is dishonorable to his maker what is itthe bible teaches us rapine cruelty and murder what is it the testament teaches us to believe that the almighty committeddebauchery with a woman engaged to be married and the belief ofthis debauchery is called faith as to the fragments of morality that are irregularly and thinlyscattered in these books they make no part of this pretended thingrevealed religion they are the natural dictates of conscience andthe bonds by which society is held together and without which itcannot exist and are nearly the same in all religions and in allsocieties the testament teaches nothing new upon this subject andwhere it attempts to exceed it becomes mean and ridiculous thedoctrine of not retaliating injuries is much better expressed in proverbs which is a collection as well from the gentiles as the jewsthan it is in the testament it is there said proverbs xxv ver21 if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he bethirsty give him water to drink but when it is said as in the testament if a man smite thee on the right cheek turn to him theother also it is assassinating the dignity of forbearance andsinking man into a spaniel according to what is called christs sermon on the mount inthe book of matthew where among some other good things a great deal of this feigned morality is introduced it is there expressly saidthat the doctrine of forbearance or of not retaliating injurieswas not any part of the doctrine of the jews but as this doctrineis found in proverbs it must according to that statement have beencopied from the gentiles from whom christ had learned it thosemen whom jewish and christian idolaters have abusively calledheathens had much better and clearer ideas of justice and moralitythan are to be found in the old testament so far as it is jewishor in the new the answer of solon on the question which is themost perfect popular government has never been exceeded by any one since his time as containing a maxim of political morality thatsays he where the least injury done to the meanest individual isconsidered as an insult on the whole constitution solon livedabout 500 years before christ loving enemies is another dogma of feigned morality and hasbesides no meaning it is incumbent on man as a moralist that hedoes not revenge an injury and it is equally as good in a politicalsense for there is no end to retaliation each retaliates on theother and calls it justice but to love in proportion to theinjury if it could be done would be to offer a premium for crime besides the word enemies is too vague and general to be used in amoral maxim which ought always to be clear and defined like aproverb if a man be the enemy of another from mistake andprejudice as in the case of religious opinions and sometimes inpolitics that man is different to an enemy at heart with a criminalintention and it is incumbent upon as and it contributes also to ourown tranquillity that we put the best construction upon a thingthat it will bear but even this erroneous motive in him makes nomotive for love on the other part and to say that we can lovevoluntarily and without a motive is morally and physicallyimpossible morality is injured by prescribing to it duties that in the firstplace are impossible to be performed and if they could be would beproductive of evil or as before said be premiums for crime themaxim of doing as we would be done unto does not include thisstrange doctrine of loving enemies for no man expects to be lovedhimself for his crime or for his enmity those who preach this doctrine of loving their enemies are ingeneral the greatest persecutors and they act consistently by sodoing for the doctrine is hypocritical and it is natural thathypocrisy should act the reverse of what it preaches for my ownpart i disown the doctrine and consider it as a feigned or fabulousmorality yet the man does not exist that can say i have persecutedhim or any man or any set of men either in the american revolutionor in the french revolution or that i have in any case returnedevil for evil but it is not incumbent on man to reward a bad actionwith a good one or to return good for evil and whenever it isdone it is a voluntary act and not a duty it is also absurd tosuppose that such doctrine can make any part of a revealed religion we imitate the moral character of the creator by forbearing witheach other for he forbears with all but this doctrine would implythat he loved man not in proportion as he was good but as he wasbad if we consider the nature of our condition here we must see thereis no occasion for such a thing as revealed religion what is it wewant to know does not the creation the universe we behold preach to us the existence of an almighty power that governs and regulates the whole and is not the evidence that this creation holds out to oursenses infinitely stronger than anything we can read in a book thatany impostor might make and call the word of god as for morality the knowledge of it exists in every mans conscience here we are the existence of an almighty power is sufficientlydemonstrated to us though we cannot conceive as it is impossiblewe should the nature and manner of its existence we cannotconceive how we came here ourselves and yet we know for a fact thatwe are here we must know also that the power that called us intobeing can if he please and when he pleases call us to accountfor the manner in which we have lived here and therefore withoutseeking any other motive for the belief it is rational to believethat he will for we know beforehand that he can the probability oreven possibility of the thing is all that we ought to know for ifwe knew it as a fact we should be the mere slaves of terror ourbelief would have no merit and our best actions no virtue deism then teaches us without the possibility of beingdeceived all that is necessary or proper to be known the creation isthe bible of the deist he there reads in the handwriting of the creator himself the certainty of his existence and the immutabilityof his power and all other bibles and testaments are to himforgeries the probability that we may be called to accounthereafter will to a reflecting mind have the influence of belieffor it is not our belief or disbelief that can make or unmake thefact as this is the state we are in and which it is proper we shouldbe in as free agents it is the fool only and not the philosopheror even the prudent man that would live as if there were no god but the belief of a god is so weakened by being mixed with thestrange fable of the christian creed and with the wild adventuresrelated in the bible and of the obscurity and obscene nonsense of the testament that the mind of man is bewildered as in a fog viewing allthese things in a confused mass he confounds fact with fable andas he cannot believe all he feels a disposition to reject all butthe belief of a god is a belief distinct from all other things andought not to be confounded with any the notion of a trinity of godshas enfeebled the belief of one god a multiplication of beliefsacts as a division of belief and in proportion as anything is dividedit is weakened religion by such means becomes a thing of form instead offact of notion instead of principles morality is banished to makeroom for an imaginary thing called faith and this faith has itsorigin in a supposed debauchery a man is preached instead of godan execution is an object for gratitude the preachers daub themselveswith the blood like a troop of assassins and pretend to admire thebrilliancy it gives them they preach a humdrum sermon on the meritsof the execution then praise jesus christ for being executed andcondemn the jews for doing it a man by hearing all this nonsenselumped and preached together confounds the god of the creation withthe imagined god of the christians and lives as if there were none of all the systems of religion that ever were invented there isnone more derogatory to the almighty more unedifying to man morerepugnant to reason and more contradictory in itself than this thingcalled christianity too absurd for belief too impossible toconvince and too inconsistent for practice it renders the hearttorpid or produces only atheists and fanatics as an engine ofpower it serves the purpose of despotism and as a means of wealththe avarice of priests but so far as respects the good of man ingeneral it leads to nothing here or hereafter the only religion that has not been invented and that has in itevery evidence of divine originality is pure and simple deism itmust have been the first and will probably be the last that manbelieves but pure and simple deism does not answer the purpose ofdespotic governments they cannot lay hold of religion as an enginebut by mixing it with human inventions and making their own authority a part neither does it answer the avarice of priests but byincorporating themselves and their functions with it and becominglike the government a party in the system it is this that formsthe otherwise mysterious connection of church and state the churchhumane and the state tyrannic were man impressed as fully and as strongly as he ought to be withthe belief of a god his moral life would be regulated by the force ofthat belief he would stand in awe of god and of himself and wouldnot do the thing that could not be concealed from either to give thisbelief the full opportunity of force it is necessary that it actsalone this is deism but when according to the christian trinitarianscheme one part of god is represented by a dying man and anotherpart called the holy ghost by a flying pigeon it is impossiblethat belief can attach itself to such wild conceits the book called the book of matthew says chap iii verse 16that the holy ghost descended in the shape of a dove it might as wellhave said a goose the creatures are equally harmless and the oneis as much of a nonsensical lie as the other the second of actsverse 2 3 says that it descended in a mighty rushing wind in theshape of cloven tongues perhaps it was cloven feet such absurd stuffis only fit for tales of witches and wizards it has been the scheme of the christian church and of all theother invented systems of religion to hold man in ignorance of the creator as it is of government to hold man in ignorance of hisrights the systems of the one are as false as those of the other andare calculated for mutual support the study of theology as it standsin christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded onnothing it rests on no principles it proceeds by no authoritiesit has no data it can demonstrate nothing and it admits of noconclusion not any thing can be studied as a science without ourbeing in possession of the principles upon which it is founded and asthis is not the case with christian theology it is therefore thestudy of nothing instead then of studying theology as is now done out of the bible and testament the meanings of which books are alwayscontroverted and the authenticity of which is disproved it isnecessary that we refer to the bible of the creation the principleswe discover there are eternal and of divine origin they are thefoundation of all the science that exists in the world and must bethe foundation of theology we can know god only through his works we cannot have aconception of any one attribute but by following some principle thatleads to it we have only a confused idea of his power if we have notthe means of comprehending something of its immensity we can haveno idea of his wisdom but by knowing the order and manner in which it acts the principles of science lead to this knowledge for the creator of man is the creator of science and it is through thatmedium that man can see god as it were face to face could a man be placed in a situation and endowed with the powerof vision to behold at one view and to contemplate deliberately thestructure of the universe to mark the movements of the severalplanets the cause of their varying appearances the unerring order inwhich they revolve even to the remotest comet their connection anddependence on each other and to know the system of laws established by the creator that governs and regulates the whole he would then conceive far beyond what any church theology can teach him the power the wisdom the vastness the munificence of the creator he would then see that all the knowledge man has of science and that all the mechanical arts by which he renders his situation comfortable here are derived from that source his mind exalted by the scene and convinced by the fact would increase in gratitude as it increased in knowledge his religion or his worship would become united with his improvement as a man any employment he followed that had any connection with the principles of the creation as everything of agriculture of science and of the mechanical arts has would teach him more of god and of the gratitude he owes to him than any theological christian sermon he now hears great objects inspire great thoughts great munificence excites great gratitude but the groveling tales and doctrines of the bible and the testament are fit only to excite contempt though man cannot arrive at least in this life at the actualscene i have described he can demonstrate it because he has aknowledge of the principles upon which the creation is constructed we know that the works can be represented in model and that theuniverse can be represented by the same means the same principlesby which we measure an inch or an acre of ground will measure tomillions in extent a circle of an inch diameter has the samegeometrical properties as a circle that would circumscribe theuniverse the same properties of a triangle that will demonstrate uponpaper the course of a ship will do it on the ocean and whenapplied to what are called the heavenly bodies will ascertain to aminute the time of an eclipse though these bodies are millions ofmiles from us this knowledge is of divine origin and it is fromthe bible of the creation that man has learned it and not from thestupid bible of the church that teacheth man nothing the biblemakers have undertaken to give us in the first chapterof genesis an account of the creation and in doing this they havedemonstrated nothing but their ignorance they make there to have been three days and three nights evenings and mornings before there was a sun when it is the presence or absence of the sun that is the cause of day and night and what is called his rising and setting that of morning and evening besides it is a puerile and pitiful idea tosuppose the almighty to say let there be light it is the imperative manner of speaking that a conjuror uses when he says to his cups and balls presto begone and most probably has been taken from it as moses and his rod are a conjuror and his wand longinus calls this expression the sublime and by the same rule the conjuror is sublime too for the manner of speaking is expressively and grammatically the same when authors and critics talk of the sublime they see not how nearly it borders on the ridiculous the sublime of the critics like some parts of edmund burkes sublime and beautiful is like a windmill just visible in a fog which imagination might distort into a flying mountain or an archangel or a flock of wild geese all the knowledge man has of science and of machinery by theaid of which his existence is rendered comfortable upon earth andwithout which he would be scarcely distinguishable in appearance andcondition from a common animal comes from the great machine andstructure of the universe the constant and unwearied observationsof our ancestors upon the movements and revolutions of the heavenlybodies in what are supposed to have been the early ages of the worldhave brought this knowledge upon earth it is not moses and theprophets nor jesus christ nor his apostles that have done it the almighty is the great mechanic of the creation the firstphilosopher and original teacher of all science let us then learnto reverence our master and let us not forget the labors of ourancestors had we at this day no knowledge of machinery and were itpossible that man could have a view as i have before described ofthe structure and machinery of the universe he would soon conceivethe idea of constructing some at least of the mechanical works wenow have and the idea so conceived would progressively advance inpractice or could a model of the universe such as is called anorrery be presented before him and put in motion his mind wouldarrive at the same idea such an object and such a subject wouldwhile it improved him in knowledge useful to himself as a man and amember of society as well as entertaining afford far better matterfor impressing him with a knowledge of and a belief in the creator and of the reverence and gratitude that man owes to him
