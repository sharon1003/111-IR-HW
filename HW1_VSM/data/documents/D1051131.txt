window shopping learn what a good energy star rating for windows can tell youwritten by bstone•edited by sarah malburg•updated 162011buying energy efficient replacement windows is a great way to save energy and money in the long run but which model is the most effective learn what a good energy star rating for windows is in order to make a wise purchase high performance windows high performance windows are designed to prevent air leakage and in warmer climates minimize solar heating air leakage and undesired solar healing are some of the most important factors in having an energy efficient home as they account for wasted heat in cold climates and cool air in warmer climates according to the environmental protection agency windows can be responsible for as much as one fourth of all the energy used to heat a home and one half of the energy used to keep a home air conditioned considering one home causes on average 22000 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions every year taking measures to minimize energy use should be a top environmental priority for individuals as well as for society as a whole buying energy efficient replacement windows is a simple way to drastically reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills in order to decipher how environmentallyfriendly a model is you have to know what is a good energy star rating for windows the energy star sticker found on all qualified products will provide ratings data this information can be used to compare different models and to find out the perfect design for each consumers needs rating requirements and factors a window is an energy star qualified model if it meets specific requirements set by the energy star division of the us department of energy and the environmental protection agency these highly efficient windows must be manufactured with durable frame materials such as fiberglass or vinyl they must have at least two panes of glass although some models have three or four high performance windows are coated to reflect infrared and ultraviolet light sealing warm air inside in the winter and outside in the summer and protecting furniture from sun damage not all but some energy star models are filled with insulating gases such as argon or krypton once the base requirements are met each model is given a rating there are two primary figures in the energy star rating system for windows — the ufactor and the solar heat gain coefficient shgc the ufactor is the rate at which a window conducts nonsolar heat a lower figure signifies greater energy efficiency the shgc represents how much solar energy passes through the glazing material basically a low number means a window is more capable of shading solar light from entering the home in warm climates a low number is desired in cooler climates this number is not as important other secondary figures include air leakage and visible transmittance air leakage is how much air leaks through the window a tighter more efficient model will have a lower figure visible transmittance vt is the amount of visible sunlight entering the home like the shgc a low vt number is particularly desirable in warmer climates energy star climate zones the energy star rating system divides the united states into four different zones — northern northcentral southcentral and southern to determine your specific zone see the official energy star government website once the zone is known use the criteria listed on the website to find out what is a good energy star rating for windows in your area for example in northern climates a good ufactor is less than 3 while the shgc can vary in the southern zone the ufactor must be less than 6 and the shgc less than 27 in cooler areas the ufactor and air leakage are the most important in warmer areas the shgc and vt are most important although specific requirements vary with region as a general rule the lower the numbers the better the window all of the figures represent how much light heat energy or air is able to move through or around the window the models with the smallest figures are the most tightly constructed wellcoated and thoroughly insulated high performance windows resourceshigh performance windows us environmental protection agency december 2000 energy performance ratings for windows doors and skylights us department of energy energysaversgovyourhomewindowsdoorsskylightsindexcfmmytopic13320 energy star qualification criteria energy star april 7 2009 photo creditphoto by olga dietrich  ccflickr flickrcomphotosdietrich2402860858
