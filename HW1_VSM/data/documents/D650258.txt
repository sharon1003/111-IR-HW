nflits time for kenny washington to get his due as a true pioneer jackie robinson and kenny washington stood shouldertoshoulder on the athletic fields of ucla as both excelled at football and baseball yet they remain worlds apart in our nations consciousness major league baseball celebrates robinson every year on april 15  the date in 1947 when he broke baseballs longstanding color barrier but march 21 comes and goes every year without anyone pausing to remember that washington broke the nfls modernera color barrier as a member of the los angeles rams on that date in 1946  a full year before robinsons milestone every baseball player wears robinsons no 42 on april 15 its the only day that any player can wear the number with the exception of mariano rivera the last player who was allowed to have it when rivera retires no one else will wear it on a regular basis until the end of time forget a leaguewide recognition of washingtons no 13 by the nfl  his former team hasnt even retired it in fact it allowed chris miller to once wear it while floundering around the anaheim stadium turf in the final throes of the los angeles rams franchise at least kurt warner finally restored some dignity to the number when he donned it robinson was selected by time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century dr martin luther king called him a legend and a symbol in his own time washington on the other hand has yet to be recognized by the institution with the official final word on footballs legacy  the pro football hall of fame washingtons name hasnt been uttered by the senior committee which nominates players who are more than 25 years removed from the game for enshrinement in canton no offense to 2012 senior committee inductee jack butler but its hard to imagine someone having a bigger impact on the game than the nfls equivalent of jackie robinson but the recognition is coming filmmaker stephen sari単analampson is part of a los angeles lincoln high school alumni group that has started the kenny washington stadium foundation the goal of which is to restore the dilapidated field he once roamed the group organized the firstever kenny washington memorial football game in 2011 and the second will be played this september sari単analampson also will complete a documentary hero from the city of angels detailing the rise of washington who received a standing ovation from a crowd of 80000 in the los angeles coliseum during the last game he ever played in 1948 washington was presented with a trophy at halftime of that game and its now handed down to the top athlete at lincoln high school what kenny had to go through was in some ways harder than what jackie robinson had to endure sari単analampson said you could dodge a ball in baseball but the rams handed him the ball one time in a game against the redskins the players held him down piled on top and put chalk in his eyes the evolution of the nfl take a look at how the nfl has evolved from its humble roots and the efforts being made to ensure it continues to grow the ironic thing about calling washington the nfls jackie robinson is that washington actually was the superior baseball player  at least statistically according to records at ucla washington had a higher batting average than robinson during their time on the bruins baseball team former usc baseball coach rod dedeaux once said washington was more skilled than robinson and according to one story famed brooklyn dodgers manager leo durocher even offered to bring washington to the team before robinson  but only on the condition that he spend a year in puerto rico and pass himself off as a player from that country washington refused it was on the football field that washington won glory growing up in los angeles lincoln heights neighborhood washington led lincoln high school to a city section baseball title as a junior he had a home run in the championship game before leading his school to a football title in the fall i heard a lot of tales about him and i didnt believe it at first his grandson kirk washington said but then you talk to people who saw him play and it was all true washington was the star of uclas football and baseball teams but the pain of not being selected to college footballs allamerica team as a senior was tough for him to overcome washington played 580 of 600 minutes for the bruins and led the nation in total offense in 1939 washington caught the eye of legendary bears coach george halas who coached him in the college allstar game halas kept washington in chicago for three weeks on his own dime as he tried to lobby the nfl to reintegrate the league but he didnt succeed with redskins owner george preston marshall the lone holdout washington became a huge draw in semipro ball his pacific coast football league team often was billed as kenny washington and the hollywood bears but it looked like hed never make it in the nfl then the upstart aafc promised to add a los angeles franchise owned by actor don ameche goosing the nfl into allowing the cleveland rams to relocate to southern california when that happened the los angeles coliseum commission and los angeles tribune columnist halley harding pressured the nfl into integrating as a condition of allowing the rams to play games at the coliseum to fulfill that obligation the rams had no better choice than signing washington the rams also signed washingtons ucla teammate woody strode because they wanted somebody to room with him on the road a few months later the cleveland browns of the aafc signed marion motley and bill willis but washingtons story often is forgotten because professional football wasnt nearly as popular as baseball at the time also robinson was a charismatic figure playing in new york  the biggest city in the country its important to remember that when washington got to the nfl he wasnt the same player he was when he left college he had already undergone five knee surgeries partly because he contracted rickets as a child and was hit by a car breaking both of his knees at a young age still washington had three solid nfl seasons his best coming in 1947 when he averaged 74 rushing yards per attempt his 92yard run remains a rams record its easy to understand why washington wasnt a national darling back then but shouldnt he be now thats what i was wondering washingtons grandson said with the nfl being as popular as it is now you would figure there would be some recognition that recognition should start with the team that relocates to los angeles in the near future ideally the rams  ultimately however he should be honored in canton  home of the hall of fame sari単analampson said his foundations goal is to raise awareness of washington with the hall of fame and just as those fans in the coliseum gave a standing ovation to washington back in 1948 the crowd at fawcett stadium similarly should give his family an ovation during his induction in the coming years the wait has been way too long you can reach adam rank via twitter
