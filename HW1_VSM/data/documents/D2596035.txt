those seeking a compact car with a stick shift usually fall into one of three categories budget buyers on the prowl for the best deal perhaps subscribing to the theory that manual transmissions yield better fuel economy gameshow winners and those looking for a more involving fun driving experience we fall into the last camp and the excellent driving dynamics and transmissions in the mazda 3 the ford focus and the new honda civic make them natural targets for our affection chevrolet not only has the price shopper covered with the manualonly base model of the cruze the path chosen by subaru among others it deserves credit for also offering the stick on nicer models at upper trim levels either way for the purposes of this review we’re more interested in the transmission’s fun potential when it’s equipped to please the widest swath of american drivers—ie with the available sixspeed automatic transmission—we found the secondgeneration cruze is a darned good car in a recent test it is a quiet refined roomyfeeling conveyance for the everyman’s everyday mission tuned for comfort it is hardly zesty to drive but there is promise in the turbocharged engine and the fundamentally welltuned chassis with a clutch pedal and a lever working through six gates onboard does the cruze wake up and break out of its conservative mold nope the manual adds a modicum of driver engagement over the cruze’s available sixspeed automatic but little else the clutch is light and communicates its bite point well through the pedal but the shifter’s action is light and offers only vague feedback when moving into or out of gear also those who like to cover rock with paper in a game of rock paper scissors—or who awkwardly wrap an incoming fist bump in a handshake—will love the shift knob it’s about the size of a baseball the interface simply isn’t fun to use and neither is it as effective as we’d hoped as a tool for extracting more zip from the cruze’s wellbehaved 14liter turbocharged engine the transmission’s tall widely spaced fueleconomyoriented gear ratios put the final kibosh on things chevrolet fits the manual with a shorter 3831 finaldrive ratio the automatic uses a 353 final drive but accounting for each forward speed’s ratios only in first fifth and sixth gears is the overall gearing shorter in second third and fourth where most aroundtown driving takes place notably taller overall gearing in the manual model leaves the cruze feeling breathless when tasked with more than a steady cruise during our drive through nashville we often found ourselves one gear lower than should be necessary and even moderate grades required a downshift or two to climb smoothly on several occasions we even downshifted into first gear at speeds above 10 mph just to avoid lugging the engine in traffic drivability issues notwithstanding it’s puzzling that chevy would saddle the cruze with such tall gearing through most of the gears yet leave shorter ratios in both the lowest and highest gears a move that assuredly has an effect on the manual model’s 1mpg hit on the epa’s city and highway cycles which are still solid at 29 and 41 mpg relative to the automatic why not blanket the spectrum with skyhigh ratios and match the automatic on the epa test of course the easy workaround for tall gearing is to shift more and to hold lower gears however the cruze’s ratios also are widely spaced so much so that the engine’s 177 lbft torque peak on a nice plateau between 2000 and 4000 rpm doesn’t help all that much when the revs fall off hard after partthrottle upshifts the turbo four’s 153 horsepower don’t pick up the phone until 5600 rpm with power dropping off precipitously after that the driver’s shift point effectively is at a 1980slike 5600 rpm there being no evident payoff in holding on to the 6500rpm redline the gap between first and second is particularly wide with the 12 shift pancaking engine speed to just over 3000 rpm where the engine makes about 100 horsepower so the driver holds down the accelerator and waits for the turbo to start its long slow march toward the next shift that’s where we did find a compelling if unorthodox use for this 900rpm black hole between the horsepower peak and the redline—as a cushion for nolift shifts the dearth of power at max rpm softens the driveline shock to almost tolerable levels when holding the accelerator to the floor clutching in and selecting the next gear then popping the clutch driven this way—which we don’t recommend and acknowledge that few cruze owners will employ—the engine stays on the boil and doesn’t suffer as much lag after upshifts it feels quicker but the practice is also more abusive same cruze busier right arm it’s too bad the manual isn’t set up for fun—or even flexibility in traffic—because chevrolet has taken the uncommon step of offering the transmission on threequarters of the cruze lineup in other circumstances we’d be thrilled to report such widespread stickshift availability on a single car line outside of the base l the stick is standard on the midlevel ls and the wellequipped lt where it also comes paired with the rs appearance package a more aggressive grille a redcolored “rs” badge fog lights and a mild body kit that’s optional on other cruzes the lt can even be optioned with a 900 convenience package that includes heated cloth front seats a power eightway driver’s seat and a proximity key with pushbutton ignition every cruze manual or otherwise comes standard with an intuitive 70inch touchscreen with apple car play and android auto phone integration pretty much the only musthave feature that’s missing is some kind of sport tuning for the suspension but given this powertrain combination’s limits maybe the cruze’s cosseting ride is more of a consolation than a liability rarely do we suggest that a buyer skip the manualtransmission option after all we’re the save the manuals people in this case though a relaxed engine character that’s such a boon when paired with the automatic transmission where it chugs the car around smoothly and contentedly is ill served by the manual’s gearing entertaining stickshift compacts exist elsewhere but at least the decently equipped 17495 l base model has plenty to offer the budget buyer outside of a fun drive
