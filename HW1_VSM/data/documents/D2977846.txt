a thoughtful look behind the case back why do watches cost so much editorial  opinion by jason heaton a fter i tell people that i write about watches the question inevitably arises why do some watches cost so much this after the incredulity that one can actually make a living doing what i do there is always the guy in the group who says he’d never spend 5000 on a watch never mind that he has a 40000 suv that costs 100 a week to fill up with gas the easy way out of this discussion is to shrug and mumble something about brand prestige and high margins at which point said guy flashes his 50 ironman watch and says it keeps better time than his buddy’s rolex by then it’s time to change the subject after all if you don’t “get” watches the price question is largely a rhetorical one anyway but in fact the question of watch pricing is worth exploring we’re not snobs there are great watches to be had at nearly all price points from sub1000 outdoor watches to 100000 chronographs and we try to celebrate all the good ones out there but there is clearly a point at which the price curve goes more vertical in relation to a watch’s features here the value question comes into focus first of all let’s get the obvious out of the way there is a considerable markup on wristwatches since swiss brands are notoriously tightlipped about things like production numbers and costs we can’t say for certain what the markup is but we’re pretty confident it’s well north of 100 mind you we’re talking merely about cost of producing the watch itself not the overall overhead of rd marketing et al we’ll get to that in a moment established brands can tout their reputations and the cachet of the “swiss made” however watereddown that may be these days emblazoned on dials to charge a premium for their watches if none of us forked over 6000 for an iwc aquatimer they wouldn’t sell for that price period the corollary to this is that people are still willing to pay top dollar for watches the luxury timepiece industry is booming and shows no sign of letting up those of us “consuming” watches are partially to blame for the high prices after all companies will price their products for what the market will bear if none of us forked over 6000 for an iwc aquatimer they wouldn’t sell for that price period the second reason watches are so expensive is the overhead incurred to produce them we’re not just talking about the raw materials here though those can sometimes be of considerable price for watches with precious metal cases overhead for a watch company like any other industry includes materials production custom machinery prototyping design and research and development a brand that outsources many of these functions having cases made in asia and sourcing offtheshelf movements from thirdparty providers like eta or miyota can avoid these costs and typically can sell watches for far less than companies that devise inhouse movements make cases and push the boundaries of what is possible in watchmaking if you think it’s easy to make a splitminute mechanical chronograph starting with a blank sheet of paper think again it takes a team of watchmakers years to design the movement create working prototypes and build custom machinery to make specific parts before ramping up into production and at the higher end there’s the handson timeconsuming finishing of movements dials and cases that is nothing less than art you don’t see this on more affordable timepieces all of this doesn’t come cheap wellpriced alternatives breitling navitimer 01 or sinn 903 st iwc ingenieur automatic or christopher ward c20 lido panerai luminor submersible 1950 or magrette moana pacific professional iwc pilot chronograph or alpina startimer chronograph the extreme example here is a company like rolex who for years has operated its own foundry to alloy its own gold and forge its own cases the big r is an example of a vertically integrated company that covers all aspects of watchmaking from soup to nuts or rather from bezel to hairspring this complete control of its products is what helps rolex maintain a sterling reputation for quality but it also helps keep prices high when many people think of luxury watches rolex is the first name that comes to mind — though in the overall spectrum of brands it is decidedly middle of the pack pricewise given its reputation for high prices rolex created its “affordable” line tudor which borrows trickledown technologies from its parent company while cutting costs by using eta movements so while the iconic rolex submariner date costs close to 8000 the tudor pelagos can be had for around 4000 both possessing similar features — the pelagos being arguably the more capable dive watch the third reason watches cost so much is because watch companies are largely marketing machines it’s not enough these days to just say your watch tells time accurately we’ve got smartphones for that now brands have to compete with each other to peddle lifestyle stories that make one watch more appealing than the next regardless of its objective merits ad budgets are astronomical while press launches and annual watch fairs costs millions we’d all like to think that we’re immune to marketing able to cut through the hype to discern a quality timepiece from a lot of glossy photos and breathless ad copy but what redblooded male can resist lingering in iwc’s manhattan boutique with its flight simulator dive locker and leather sofas intermingled with vitrines of shiny chronographs finally the watches people typically think of as “expensive” are after all luxury products by definition they are completely unnecessary and have countless more affordable alternatives those of us working stiffs who save and scrimp to afford that nice omega are merely playing in a realm that is really occupied by an upper class who buy watches like we might splurge on a new pair of shoes or a nice dinner out watches used to be more necessary and mechanical watches were what everyone wore nowadays they are emblems of quality of tradition of craftsmanship and yes sometimes of wealth taste and prestige none of these reasons are justifications or excuses we’d love it if watch prices were lower and we could afford that jaegerle coultre on an editor’s salary at the same time if luxury timepieces were affordable they might not hold the same allure and there is something to be said for holding those aspirational pieces those grails that we covet and scheme to one day own that said hopefully now you can have a better answer for that guy who asks why your watch costs so much or you can take the easy path just smile and ask him why his watch costs so little cheers jeers we’d love to hear from you email the author at
