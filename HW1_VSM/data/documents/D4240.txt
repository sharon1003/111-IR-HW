city at the beginning of the 20th century within the sixstory walls of the massive show building guests would find themselves in an elaborate production set simulating a new york subway station manhattans roosevelt island tram station and a surrounding city block intricately detailed from garbage cans and graffiti covering the walls to fully stocked storefronts overhead television monitors displayed a special wwortv news report entitled kong on the loose reallife news anchor rolland smith reported that the giant ape king kong had escaped its confines and was wreaking havoc on the streets of new york kong had already destroyed two elevated trains and was rapidly approaching the east river with authorities seemingly powerless to stop him clips from the 1976 film version of king kong portraying the beasts rampage played during these newscasts as did alerts from the emergency broadcast system the queue made its way up a long ramp and ended at the elevated manhattan station of the roosevelt island tramway ride  editupon arriving at the station guests boarded a large openair aerial tram vehicle there a live guide aboard the tram informed them that they were being evacuated off of manhattan island and over to roosevelt island during kongs attack the trams radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of kongs location in the city the tram traveled above the streets of downtown new york city where guests could view kongs path of destruction there was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant broken steam pipes crashed and overturned cars and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track a police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio alerting that kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole kongs silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram as the tram passed the power pole it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded unleashing a shower of sparks and fire which ignited the derailed elevated subway train rounding a bend and nearing the east river the tram encountered kong hanging from the queensboro bridge a police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on kong to protect the approaching tram kong retaliated pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge narrowly escaping the attack the tram finally crossed over the river to roosevelt island a second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram inhibiting the view of what lay ahead the tram operator urged the chopper to turn off the light and in doing so revealed that kong had cut the tram off he proceeded to grab lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter after narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time small television monitors lowered from the trams ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the roosevelt island station although kong was never actually defeated the news report indicated that he was making his way away from new york city thereby alleviating the threat photograph  editguests exited the attraction and traveled down a series of ramps into a king kong themed gift shop called safari outfitters ltd there a kodak photo opportunity booth was located where guests could pose with king kong who appeared to grip them in front of a queensboro bridge backdrop construction and design  editthe attraction was based on the 1976 film remake of king kong and was designed by totally fun company and mca planning and development two king kong animatronic figures were built for the attraction and were scaled to be 39 feet 12 m tall with an arm span of 54 feet 16 m the one used for the street sequence weighed approximately 13000 pounds 5900 kg while a lighter figure that weighed approximately 8000 pounds 3600 kg was used for the bridge sequence of the ride the kongs were built to be both analog and digital giving them the ability to perform sixty two separate functions a smellitzer device was constructed to give the kong figures banana breath which was emitted during roars at the riders kongfrontations ride system was developed by arrow dynamics who subcontracted the manufacturing out to intermountain lift inc 1 the soundstage show building covered an area of 62000 square feet 5800 m 2 and a height of six floors the slabs used to construct the exterior walls of the building are the largest of its kind ever used for construction to make the city setting appear as realistic as possible fifty facades were modeled after manhattans lower east side circa 1976 news reports from the tv station wwortv were integrated into the ride and queue line as mcauniversal owned the station at the time the attraction was designed the helicopters that were used in the ride were molded from actual helicopters and were true to size replicating the newscasts from wwor the video in the queue monitors was real production for the audio in the ride work and preshow videos was handled by john miceli tony miceli david kneupper stan winston at the time with magic lantern productions and later soundelux who contracted all audio and video design for the ride since wwor had passed from the prior corporate owners  rko general to mca there were still conflicts in the prior audio from broadcast use as it was not cleared for locationbased entertainment use and the script was stylized for the ride experience the announcer for the script as the wwor reporter was provided by voiceover talent ron knight who also provided voice work for many of the voices of the chopper pilots radio dispatch sheriffs and other characters as well as voiceover work for two of the other premiere attractions e t adventure and jaws knight also became the national announcer for nickelodeon for all show promotion and network

kongfrontation has been credited as being the catalyst for the universal studios florida project which has since evolved into the universal orlando resort  2 universal originally envisioned the attraction as the crown jewel of the florida park while the attraction drew substantial crowds it had an unreliable track record due to the complex special effects involved 3 universal engineers attempted several times to improve reliability which ultimately required removing functionality of kong by limiting his movements and some of the background effects kongfrontation officially closed on september 8 2002 there has never been a solid reason given by universal for the closure although it is speculated that high staffing operations and maintenance costs were the main reasons the attraction joined a list of original universal studios florida attractions that have since been retired and replaced including ghostbusters spooktacular the funtastic world of hannabarbera back to the future the ride and jaws on may 6 2015 universal announced that king kong would finally be returning to the universal orlando resort in the summer of 2016 with the opening of an all new attraction at
