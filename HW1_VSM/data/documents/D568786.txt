internal derangement knee mpc 01341icd9 717this publication is available upon request in alternate formats pdf version on this page definition diagnostic standard anatomy and physiology clinical features pension considerations references definition internal derangement of the knee idk for the purposes of vac is a chronic disorder of the knee due to a torn ruptured or deranged meniscus of the knee or a partial or complete cruciate rupture with or without injury to the capsular ligament of the knee resulting in ongoing or intermittent signs and symptoms such as pain instability or abnormal mobility of that knee diagnostic standard diagnosis by a qualified medical practitioner is required in many cases arthroscopic investigation or an mri could be diagnostic and if conducted reports should be provided anatomy and physiology internal derangement of the knee is a mechanical disorder of the knee which interferes with normal joint motion andor mobility a fragment of soft tissue or bone that suddenly becomes interposed between the articular surfaces is the classic cause of internal derangement the misplaced fragment can be radiolucent or radiopaque the most frequent cause of locking is entrapment of the radiolucent meniscus the most common idk is the torn meniscus there are two principal cartilaginous structures in the knee joint  the articular cartilage and the menisci the articular cartilage envelopes the bony ends of the tibia femur and patella in contact with the joint the menisci play a vital role in providing joint stability impact absorption and lubrication both of these structures can be acutely damaged by trauma or chronically damaged by cumulative joint trauma see paper on cumulative joint trauma in the development of osteoarthrosis osteoarthritis injury to the menisci generally results from traction compression torque forces or a combination of all three the cruciate ligaments are most important in ensuring normal knee function damage to these ligaments contributes to significant impairment and disability the anteriorcruciate ligament acl is the more critical and is the most frequently involved in injury the complex interplay between instability torn menisci athletic activities muscle control and cumulative joint trauma ultimately leads to a degenerative change in the knee it is often unclear what mechanism caused the disability eg the original injury repeated locking instability high athletic demands powerful muscular contractions repeated trauma or altered mechanics osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyle is one of the most common conditions which generate radiopaque osteocartilaginous loose bodies it is three times more common in men than in women osteochondritis dissecans of the patella in some cases appears to be due to a tangential or shear fracture secondary to subluxation persons with intraarticular loose bodies of the knee will develop degenerative arthritis time until presentation of arthritis is dependent in part on activity level insofar as the more active the person the earlier the onset of arthritis clinical features the essential features of idk are as follows the appearance of locking andor recurrent locking of the knee as a result of the reflex pseudoparalysis of the hamstring and quadriceps muscles at the time of locking causing the knee to buckle during weightbearing ie sometimes in locking a persons knee may give way because both the extensors and flexors of the knee have failed sudden loss of motion usually of full extension sudden loss of function of the knee often associated with a minor injury possible restoration of the knee to normal function by manipulation subjective complaint of something moving around in the knee pension considerations on this page a causes and  or aggravation b medical conditions which are to be included in entitlement  assessment c common medical conditions which may result in whole or in part from internal derangement of the knee and  or its treatment causes and  or aggravation the timelines below are not binding each case should be adjudicated on the evidence provided and its own merits specific trauma to the knee prior to clinical onset or aggravation for specific trauma to cause or aggravate idk the following should be evident pain swelling or altered mobility or any other pertinent sign or symptom should occur in the joint within 24 hours of the injury and these acute symptoms and signs should generally last several days following their onset except where medical intervention  for the trauma to that joint has occurred  medical intervention includes but is not limited to physicianrecommended medication immobilization of the joint or limb by splinting sling or similar mechanisms injection of corticosteroids or local anesthetics into the joint aspiration of the joint surgery to the joint the majority of cases of acute internal derangement will be obvious within a few days pain is almost always present swelling may or may not be clinically obvious to the medical practitioner specific trauma means as follows direct physical injury such as a hit blow knock or a penetrating injury which may occur from a projectile such as a bullet or shrapnel or a twisting or wrenching injury which involves excessive stretching or straining of the capsule or ligaments in the knee joint and results in abnormal mobility and instability of the joint indicated by periodic giving way or locking up of the joint twisting injuries to the knee most commonly occur during sporting activities specific trauma does not include cumulative joint trauma in the absence of a specific injury specific trauma could result in the followingmeniscal tearosteochondritis dissecansligamentous instability  this includes partial or
