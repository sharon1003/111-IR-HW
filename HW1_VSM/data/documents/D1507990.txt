the history behind maxwell house’s “good to the last drop”2 replies most likely over the last several decades you have heard maxwell house ‘s famous slogan for their coffee “good to the last drop” the slogan has actually been around since 1917 but it wasn’t until the 1930s that maxwell house started to explain where the slogan came from possibly due to the fact that cocacola was using the same slogan at this time according to maxwell house lore president theodore roosevelt was visiting andrew jackson at jackson’s estate the hermitage on october 21 1907 during this visit he was served maxwell house coffee and he reportedly said that it was “good to the last drop” owners leon t cheek and john neal heard president roosevelt’s bold statement and they adopted it as their corporate slogan it’s a nice story but it’s one that has never been historically proven local press in tennessee did cover roosevelt’s visit and one paper did cover the story regarding roosevelt’s response to the maxwell house coffee however according to that source roosevelt said “this is the kind of stuff i like to drink by george when i hunt bears”maxwell house has since then said that the slogan was originally written by clifford spiller a former president of general foods yet in 2009 the coffee company reverted back to its original claims that the slogan came from roosevelt they even ran a commercial depicting president roosevelt retelling that famous story whether it’s true or not it’s a fun piece of legend for maxwell house and it certainly explains why they haven’t departed from their slogan in nearly 100 years this entry was posted in coffee brands coffee history on february 21 2013 by my coffee supply
