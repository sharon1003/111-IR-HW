defining makerspaces what the research says april 02 2015in learning spaces makerspaces26 comments recently i had the unfortunate experience of dealing with criticism i was told not to my face by a visitor to our school that our library makerspace is not a “real makerspace” this same person stated that our woodshop is a “real makerspace” because it has power tools she suggested that i “do some research” on what makerspaces actually are feeling personally insulted aside what bothers me most about this statement is the concept that some makerspaces are more valid than others and that a makerspace is solely defined by the tools it contains i do agree that our woodshop is a makerspace even though we don’t call it that our woodshop is awesome and i’m so glad that we have a space where students can learn how to use saws drills and other tools to build awesome projects as part of their curriculum yes that is a makerspace but is my space any less of a makerspace simply because it doesn’t have power tools because it doesn’t have a 3d printer because my students build with legos k’nex and cardboard defining makerspaces all of this got me thinking about how we define “makerspace” so i did what librarians do best i researched i gathered together my books on makerspaces i searched our databases for articles and i crowdsourced the amazing hive mind of twitter for the record here’s my own definition of a school makerspace a makerspace is a place where students can gather to create invent tinker explore and discover using a variety of tools and materials a makerspace can be anything from a repurposed bookcart filled with arts and crafts supplies to a table in a corner set out with legos to a full blown fab lab with 3d printers laser cutters and handtools no two school makerspaces are exactly alike nor should they be makerspaces are as unique as the school cultures they represent there is no such thing as one form of making being more valid or better than the other makers are artists crafters knitters seamstresses builders programmers engineers hackers painters woodworkers tinkerers inventors bakers graphic designers and more a makerspace is a place where kids gather to create invent tinker explore  discover click to tweet what the research says about makerspaces here’s where my research led me i like this definition from samatha roslund’s book makerspaces i see three important elements to this definition place… people… make things while different possible foci are mentioned this definition does not limit a makerspace to a particular set of tools it’s about a place about a community another similar quote comes from the educause learning initiative article 7 things you should know about makerspaces“a makerspace is a physical location where people gather to share resources and knowledge work on projects network and build”makerspaces are not about the tools they’re about enabling making more on makerspaces“… a space where kids have the opportunity to make – a place where some tools materials and enough expertise can get them started these places called makerspaces share some aspects of the shop class home economics class the art studio and science labs in effect a makerspace is a physical mashup of different places that allows makers and projects to integrate these different kinds of skills” dale dougherty the maker mindset in design make play“even if you don’t have access to expensive… hardware every classroom can become a makerspace where kids and teachers learn together through direct experience with an assortment of high and low tech materials ”  gary stager and sylvia martinez in invent to learn“a makerspace is a metaphor for a unique learning environment that encourages tinkering play and openended exploration for all” laura fleming author of worlds of making making creativity and design“what do you do in a makerspace the simple answer is you make things  things that you are curious about things that spring from your imagination… that inspire you and things that you admire the informal playful atmosphere allows learning to unfold rather than conform to a rigid agenda making rather than consuming is the focus it is craft engineering technology and wonderdriven” thinkers and tinkerers“the most important quality of a makerspace is that it encourages creativity this can be done with a space full of hand tools materials and finished projects the culture in a space should support the idea that anything is possible” 3 key qualities for a school makerspace“makerspaces provide handson creative ways to encourage students to design experiment build and invent as they deeply engage in science engineering and tinkering” jennifer cooper designing a school makerspace edutopia“makerspaces are collaborative learning environments where people come together to share materials and learn new skills… they are not necessarily born out of a specific set of materials or spaces but rather a mindset of community partnership collaboration and creation” library as incubator project emphasis in quotes is minewhat is a makerspace your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats
