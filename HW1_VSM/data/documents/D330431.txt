with the different seasons with it being longer during the winter months tigers that live in tropical locations such as the sumatran tiger tend to have shorter less dense fur male tigers have a ruff of fur around the back of their head and this is particularly pronounced in siberian tigers tigers have numerous thick white whiskers and these assist them in finding their way around in the dark

a white base coat with brown stripes a pink nose and blue eyes there have also been reports of blue tigers and black tigers mellanistic however these reports are unconfirmed and there has been no physical evidence that suggests their existence habitat tigers are found in a variety of habitats in south and east asia their habitats include tropical forests evergreen forests woodlands grasslands rocky country swamps and savannas they prefer areas that have dense cover and access to a water source they are solitary animals and mark their territories with urine secretions from their anal glands faeces and scratch marks female tigers have territories that are 25  1600 sq kms 10  618 sq miles male tigers have territories that are much larger and they will be connected to the smaller territories of several females the size of a tigers territory is dependent on the available resources and the largest territories belong to siberian tigers tigers defend their territory strongly and will fight any strange tiger that strays within their range diet tigers are carnivorous they mainly feed on medium and large sized prey and their diet varies depending on their location they prey upon chital sika deer roe deer musk deer rusa deer elk gaur water buffalo wild boar and they sometimes take smaller prey such as birds monkeys reptiles and fish occasionally they will kill more formidable predators such as dholes leopards pythons bears and crocodiles although generally these predators will try to avoid each other they will readily eat carrion and sometimes young elephants and rhinos but fully grown adults are too dangerous to attack they will also sometimes kill domestic animals and these tigers are termed cattlelifters or cattlekillers in contrast to the typical gamekillers tigers hunt alone and they ambush their prey overpowering them from any angle and using their body size and strength to knock large prey off balance they bite the throat of large prey and using their forelimbs they drag it to the ground they will then hold onto the throat until the prey dies in the case of smaller prey they will bite the back of the neck often breaking the spinal cord piercing the windpipe or severing the jugular vein or carotid artery this results in instantaneous death for the prey tigers will eat up to 40 kgs 88 lbs of meat at a time and they will return to a large kill to feed for 3  6 days tigers will rarely prey on humans but if they do there is usually a reason for it such as the tiger is too old or perhaps injured to hunt for its natural prey tigers that prey on humans are known as maneaters and they were a particular problem in india in the early part of the 20th century a hunter called jim corbett tracked down and killed the champawat maneating tigress and there were also attacks from the sunderbans maneaters and tara of the dudhwa national park breeding after a gestation period of approximately 104 days 2  4 tiger cubs are born in a den at birth the cubs weigh approximately 1 kg 22 lbs and they have their eyes and ears closed when the cubs reach 8 weeks old they are ready to accompany their mother from the den and it is at this point that she starts to feed them meat they become independent at around 18 months old but tend to stay with their mother until they are at least 2 years old when they leave their mother males will move away and find their own territory females however will stay in the same area as their mother and secure a territory close to hers tigers reach sexual maturity at 3  4 years of age predators tigers have no
