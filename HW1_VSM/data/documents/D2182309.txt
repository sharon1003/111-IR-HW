americans allof plymouth rock and jamestown and ellis island or ethnic literature and some redefinitions of america by werner sollors 2a very famous example is the statue of liberty the dedication of the statue on 28 october 1886 inspired the aging political poet john greenleaf whittierwhose career had climaxed before the civil war with his widely cited antislavery verseto compose the poem the bartholdi statue 1886 whittier stresses francoamerican liberty as an enlightening force singing o france the beautiful and concluding with the lines shine far shine free a guiding light to reasons ways and virtues aim a lightningflash the wretch to smite who shields his license with thy namewhittier thus presents the official francoamerican interpretation of the statue as advanced during the dedication ceremony which included only very brief references to immigrants yet the poet also celebrates the abolition of slavery as the realization of the dream of american liberty unlike the shapes on egypts sands uplifted by the toilworn slave on freedoms soil with freemens hands we rear the symbol free hands gave whittier 1904 29596whittiers national and official reading thus also contained his own cause the memory of the abolition of slavery this element did not remain in the foreground of later interpretations of the statue despite the inviting presence of the broken shackles of tyranny on the monument t he poet emma lazarus saw a different statue in her sonnet the new colossus which constituted a recasting of the statues officially intended meaning lazaruss statue a mother of exiles speakskeep ancient lands your storied pomp cries she with silent lips give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless tempesttost to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door lazarus 1888 2023w hittiers apostrophe shine far contrasts markedly with lazarus wellknown motto send these to me the new england poet james russell lowell seems to have been among the first to recognize the significance of lazaruss poem when he was the united states ambassador to england he reportedly wrote her that he liked her poem better than bartholdis statue but your sonnet gives its subject a raison dÃªtre which it wanted before quite as much as it wanted a pedestal handlin 1971 61 63 jacob 1949 179 a plaque with lazaruss sonnet was affixed to the statue of liberty in 1903 and though this was noted in the baedeker of 1909 72 and in immigrant writing it remained according to john highams book significantly entitled send these to me relatively unnoticed until the mid1920s when the immigration restrictions were legislated higham 1975 8283 while the overt message of lazaruss poem seemed to be foremost an invitation to immigrants from her beaconhand glows worldwide welcome and thus offered a reinterpretation of the statue of liberty that was offbeat enough to remain ignored or at least of secondary importance for some time the reference to the newcomers as wretched refuse also permitted a reading that the immigration historian james p shenton convincingly paraphrased as welcome garbage see also higham 1975 8586 in any event the nativist james h patten applied lazaruss phrase wretched refuse in 1906 to the beaten people of beaten races who come to america in order   to desecrate thy sabbath and despoil thy rich heritage purchased with so much anglosaxon blood and treasure patten 1906 16 solomon 1972 126a nd as zola levitt noticed the adaptation of lazaruss poem that was used at john f kennedy airport simply omitted the lines with the wretched refuse no matter how multivalent lazaruss imagery was ethnic writers often adopted her reinterpretation of the statue of liberty as the symbolic space where foreign and american identities meet in this fashion the swedishamerican journal valkyrian published from 1897 to 1909 had as its permanent cover illustration the image of a big valkyrie whereas a small statue of liberty in new york harbor was recognizable in the background thander 1991 thus connecting a norse and an american goddessproportionate to their meaning and in

1980 67 t he anarchist emma goldman left gave a curiously ironic testimony to the power of the statue as the dominant symbol of immigrant arrivals she remembers in her autobiography living my life 1931 that when she first came to america she was enraptured by the sight of the harbour and the statue of liberty suddenly emerging from the mist ah there she was the symbol of hope of freedom of opportunity she held her torch high to light the way to the free country the asylum for the oppressed of all lands    our spirits were high our eyes filled with tears goldman 1970 i 11 giesen 1991 513yet as immigration historians have noticed emma goldman could not have seen the statue since she arrived in new york on december 29 1885 months before the pedestal was completed and over half a year before the statue was assembled giesen 1991 515 in retrospect even a radical like goldman subjugated her own specific memory to the meaning of the statue that the other emma had helped to propagate and that had found triumphant expressions in such images as adolph treidlers war bonds poster of 1917 remember your first thrill of american liberty banta 1988 28 right l azaruss voice opposed not only the sentiments that whittier was to express but also opinions like those of croly that were often represented in antiimmigrant cartoons left and put into poetry by the new englander thomas bailey aldrich in his once famous unguarded gates 1892 another version of liberty wide open and unguarded stand our gates and through them presses a wild motley throng men from the volga and the tartar steppes featureless figures of the hoangho malayan scythian teuton kelt and slav flying the old worlds poverty and scorn these bringing with them unknown gods and rites those tiger passions here to stretch their claws in street and alley what strange tongues are these accents of menace alien to our air voices that once the tower of babel knew o liberty white goddess is it well to leave the gates unguarded aldrich 1892 cf zangwill 1910 199200aldrichs liberty is not imagined as a mother of exiles but in exactly opposite terms as a white goddess who should guard freedom against the menace of beastly invaders it is clear that aldrich did not believe in the message send these to me but he also had little faith in libertys ability to shine very far aldrich also polemicized against immigration by arguing that americas true emblem was no longer the eagle but some sort of unnaturalized mongrel solomon 1974 88 it is a measure of the transformation of public memory that by the time of the statues centennial celebrations in 1986 lazaruss voice had clearly won out over whittiers and aldrichs at the peak of the new immigration however some oldstock american intellectuals believed in race suicide calhoun 1919 some americans perceived themselves to be outnumbered by the invasion of strangers in the country their ancestors real or adopted had founded i say real or adopted even in thinking of the group that was dubbed the brahmin caste of new england in oliver wendell holmess novel elsie venner 1859 in order to describe a collegiate race of scholars different from the type of

had married into old families taylor 1979 4344 such intellectuals also adopted and increasingly stressed the symbols of the mayflower and plymouth rock as mythic points of origin the invention of plymouth and especially plymouth rock as an exclusivist ethnic symbol replaced earlier ideological readings in revolutionary religious or abolitionist contexts at the end of the nineteenth and the
