introduction the station was established in 2003 and approved as a member of the special environmental observation station network by cas in 2007 the station is the only research base for systematic observation and experimentation located in the center of the taklimakan desert it is located in the taklimakan desert at 39˚00´n 83°40´e at an altitude of 10993 m above sea level in qiemo county tazhong eremophytes botanical garden the local climate is extremely arid and rainless with mean annual precipitation of 107 mm and mean evaporation of 38064 mm more than 82 of its area is covered by drifting sand dunes the landform is dominated by highly complex sandridges and broad flat interdunes it is largely devoid of plants as well as surface runoff there were a few plant and animal species found in the desert area including 5 animal species such as araneida lepus yarkandensis dipus sagitta meriones meridianus camelus bactrianus and 19 plant species that belong to eight families such as t taklamakanensis m t liu phragmites communis trin bidens parviflora willd calligonum mongolicum turcz heliotropium micranthum pall bge etc hedgerow of calligonum l research fields 1 monitoring aeolian environments and the movement processes of windblown sand in the hinterland of the taklimakan desert 2 windblown sand disasters and the stability regarding the sustainable utilization of 436 km of crossdesert green corridor 3 monitoring environmental changes and ecological processes of the new manmade oases on the desert margins 4 technical issues of management maintenance and renewal of forest belts shelterbelts ecological project along the tarim desert highway mobile sand dunes in the taklimakan desert tarim desert highway infrastructures routine experiments and monitoring the infrastructures of the taklimakan station for desert research includes 1 livingoffice building and experiment building 2 botanical garden 3 sites to monitor about the protecting effects of physical sandprotecting systems and biological sandprotecting systems and 4 comprehensive weather station wind erosion monitoring station groundwater environment monitoring station atmospheric dust fall monitoring station routine experiments and monitoring are about water soil air and biology the following studies have been made at a range of temporal and spatial scales 1 the patterns of shifting windblown sand and the processes of their formation 2 conditions for dust storm occurrence 3 plant responses to multiple stresses 4 patterns of soil water and salt movement 5 stability of ecological shelter projects 6 selection and cultivation of plant species with high resistance to environmental stresses 7 development of special desert biological resources 8 the processes of desert formation and evolution 9 ecological processes and adverse stress resistance mechanisms of animals and plants under extreme environmental conditions major accomplishments based on more than 10 years of systematic research the station has 1 recognized movement patterns of wind blown sand in the taklimakan desert and formulated a classification standard for sand disasters for desert highways main
