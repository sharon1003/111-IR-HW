using the sigma efdg super flash in manual mode offcamera the sigma efdg super flash is a powerful hotshoebased flash unit with a lot of nice features it even includes a somewhat unusual feature for a hotshoebased flash a built in optical slave but the user interface is a bit hard to use the user manual is obtuse and accessing important use modes are often not intuitive even for gearheads many want to use this flash offcamera in manual mode they might want to trigger the sigma super with a cord with a radio slave or even with an external optical slave note the word external here but it is not obvious how to do this the copy below will show you how to set the super sigma for offcamera manual use please note that this short offering only deals with how to properly set the user mode for manual offcamera flash for the super sigma it does not deal with how to mount the flash offcamera or connect a sync device such as a cord a radio slave or external optical slave those issues are covered in other subject offerings step one  getting the sigma super to the proper mode these instructions are for the canon version of the sigma super but i suspect the other versions are similar and this may serve as a useful guidethe proper mode to use the super sigma for offcamera manual mode is “slave flash” per the super sigma users manual this seems odd but that is the way it is to access this mode turn the flash on then press the mode button until you access the “slave flash” mode the mode button will cycle through  ettlm many would think this “manual” mode is the correct one but it is not multiettl  wireless flash master ettl  wireless flash slave slave flash mode this is the mode you want note that ettl is not shown anywhere on the display iso  for setting the isocycle through these modes until you come to the “slave flash” mode when you are in the “slave flash” mode the words ettl or multi will not appear anywhere on the lcd panel step two  turning the internal optical slave off and setting the power level if you are going to activate your offcamera super sigma with a sync cord or a radio slave you will want to turn the super sigma’s internal optical slave off set the correct mode step one above and then hit the sel button the select button the c0 c1 or c2 channel designation will flash for a sync cord or radio slave hit the  or – buttons until you have either c1 or c2 displayed either one is fine then hit the sel button to make that selection the power level will then flash hit the  or – key to make your power level selection just let the selected power level flash so the power level will be ready to accept a change to another level as needed by hitting the  and – buttons the super sigma is now set correctly and you can stop here if you hit the sel button again an f will display you are in offcamera manual mode so anything you set is fine if you hit the sel button again things will stop flashing and you will see the proper c1 or c2 setting again hitting the sel button again cycles through the channel selection power level and f settings step three – turning the internal optical slave on and setting the power level to turn on the internal optical slave just follow all the instructions in step 2 above but be sure the channel designation is c0 not c1 or c2 here is a link to a pdf for instructions for all of the various versions of the sigma super httpwwwsigmaphotocomflashesflashesflashesdetailsaspid3257
