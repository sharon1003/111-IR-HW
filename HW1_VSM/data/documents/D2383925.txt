how do i increase my ketones jan 1 st 2013someone recently asked me how they could increase their ketones and after typing out an epic comment i decided to turn my reply into a post when it comes to ketones there are a couple things to look at1 are you measuring using a blood ketone meter or a urine strip if you are using a blood meter it usually registers highest in the evening and lowest in the morning if you are using the strips it’s the opposite higher in the morning and lower in the evening2 how long have you been eating a ketogenic diet it can take weeks for your body to adapt and make an adequate amount of ketones if you are measuring using a blood ketone meter the range is 05 – 503 how much protein are you eating your body can convert a portion of the protein you eat into glucose have you tried calculating your suggested protein and seeing if you are within range try to find an amount that keeps you satisfied as i’ve found going too low while it may raise your ketones causes me to be constantly hungry –4 how much fat are you eating when doing a ketogenic diet please don’t try to go lowfat make sure you are getting enough healthy fats saturated and monounsaturated like avocado pastured eggs butter and animal fats when doing a ketogenic diet the majority of your calories will come from fat if you are “doing everything right” and have given yourself enough time you may want to try eating more coconut oil or mct medium chain triglyceride oil as they are converted to ketones easily another idea is to switch up when you test for example since i have diabetes my blood sugar rises quickly in the morning and that causes my morning ketones to read very low however after eating breakfast they rebound nicely one more thought is to ask yourself why you want higher ketones assuming they are at least registering is it because you are feeling tired or experiencing poor blood sugar control or is it because you believe that higher ketones will result in better weight loss if it’s the former then keep tinkering and hopefully you will find what works best for you if it’s the latter i wish you the best of luck but must caution that i and a few others have found that there isn’t a great correlation between high ketones and weight loss posted by daytona jan 1 st 2013tweet« poop for science why am i still hungry on a ketogenic diet »
