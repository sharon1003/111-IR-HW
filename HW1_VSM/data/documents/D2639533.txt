trivia ymmv create new you can see so much in me so much in me thats newthe chinese have a saying before setting off on revenge you first dig two graves — james bond to melina havelock the one with the alleged car chase a british spy ship accidentally fishes out a mine and goes to the bottom unfortunately it contains a secret device that sends orders to british nuclear missile submarines 007 after visiting tracy s grave and dropping someone who strongly resembles blofeld down a chimney at what is now the location of the millennium dome which would feature in the world is not enough  is sent to find the ship and who was responsible for the murders of two people looking for it while shadowing his target he is captured and then saved via a crossbow bolt after which he meets melina havelock the girl of the movie and an action girl with a crossbow who wants to get revenge for her murdered parents surprisingly the only bond film in which the kgb and the soviets are officially the bad guys the others tend to involve them as allies against a common evil or have an individual who happens to be russian pursuing his own goals which do not coincide with those of the soviet government  even here they are more respectful competitors after all if you hear of a chance to get a key item that could give you a strategic advantage over your official enemies youd have to be a utter idiot not to make a play for it as it is general gogol not only survives uninjured in the attempt but stops bond from being shot when he destroys the device at the end of the film and concedes the loss without a fuss this film is somewhat of a mishmash of two ian fleming s short stories  for your eyes only and risico  with a scene from live and let die thrown in and some more plot added it has also been compared to from russia with love as the aforementioned secret device is similar to a mac guffin featured in the earlier film perhaps as a reaction to the perceived excesses of goofy humour and credibilitystretching adventure in the previous movie moonraker this movie is far closer to a classic spy yarn with almost no gadgets deployed no larger than life henchman with a gimmick and the bad guys simply being shot in one case and going away emptyhanded in the other the dark tone the film takes at times by far the most serious bond film roger moore did oddly comes from timothy dalton when he was first courted by albert r cubby broccoli he was asked what kind of bond he would play he briefed cubby on a much darker edgier bond grounded in reality and this script was born making a note of killing off the main series villain before the opening credits to make way for the new direction by the time the new script was ready moore had decided to do another one and dalton that he was too young to play bond so with the script ready and waiting moore slipped into this moody and morally ambiguous bond something we didnt see again until dalton took the role on a side note the original poster was controversial not only were the minishorts cut off in us theaters so all you saw were legs but three models all claimed to own those legs the films success helped saved united artists after the financial failure of heavens gate which led to it being acquired by mgm memorable moments in the movie the pretitles sequence in which a helicopter is flown indoors and then bond gets his revenge on ernst stavro blofeld once and for all for tracy the famous and still tense on rewatch scene in which bond is hanging from a cliff the colombokristatos switcheroo in which the latter turns out to be the villain after its initially made out that hes the goodie impressionist janet brown doing her thennotable impression of margaret thatcher and actor john wells reprising his role as denis from the west end farce anyone for denis bond kicking a car off a cliff with the dragon inside in cold blood car chase in a yellow citroën 2cv through olive groves underwater fight between bond melina and a villain in a jim suit a bond girl with a crossbow melina is a real action girl in the bond franchise as she has virtually no damsel in distress moments and ends up saving bond more than once the bill conticomposed discolike score with lots of cowbells  for your eyes only provides examples of action girl melina with her crossbow actually pretty funny after bond destroys the atac he quips that its detente for neither side to have it causing gogol to chuckle with amusement adaptation expansion many scenes and other story elements were lifted from ian flemings short stories or unused sequences in previously adapted novels however the overall story arc that links them together was created for the film note the alleged car bonds lotus esprit from the spy who loved me selfdestructs when a mook tries to open it forcing bond and melina to go through a car chase in the latters beatup citroën 2cv that said it holds it own against two latemodel peugeot 504s and that includes getting shot up and rolling down the side of a mountain roger moore himself has stated that of all the cars he ever drove in including the legendary lotus espritsubmarine  this was his favorite animal reaction shot a farmer and his cow both turn their heads to look at bond as he skis onto the roof of their barn apologetic attacker columbo flippantly apologizes to a wounded mook whom he knocks out with his pistol in order to keep him quiet while he joins the others for the main attack arson murder and jaywalking columbo yes i smuggle i smuggle gold diamonds pistachio nuts artistic license – biology given that the crew of the st georges had been dead for several days if not weeks—and underwater no less—their bodies would be gruesomely decomposed by the time bond and melina reached the ship not looking as pristine as if theyd only just perished asshole victim in the opening scene ernst stavro blofeld suddenly resurfaces years later with a plan to exact revenge on his archenemy for foiling his numerous evil plans and causing the downfall of spectre he is permanently crippled and wearing a neck brace presumably from injuries he sustained from the exploding oil rig at the end of diamonds are forever and tries to kill bond via murder by remote control vehicle he fakes a message from bonds office who was visiting the grave of his wife and sends a helicopter to pick him up then kills the pilot and assumes remote control of the chopper taunting bond he causes the chopper to make several near misses on high buildings before steering it into a disused factory where it will inevitably crash but when 007 turns the tables by regaining control over the helicopter blofeld enters into villainous breakdown mode he even pathetically begs bond to spare him going as far to offer 007 a delicatessen in stainless steel but bond wont have any and drops him down a tall industrial chimney stack to his death all this means that blofelds karma houdini warranty has expired and his death at bonds hands is very welldeserved back for the dead someone who looks a lot like blofeld is killed in the cold open bad boss when one of kristatos mooks falls overboard and is promptly eaten by sharks kristatos simply says oh leave him admittedly he was already being attacked and there wasnt much they could have done anyway bad habits q dresses as an orthodox priest to provide information to bond baitandswitch gunshot bond is being chased by mooks when hes suddenly confronted by a veiled figure pointing a crossbow who shoots the mook running up behind him she removes the veil to reveal herself as the female protagonist bald of evil the unnamed blofeld in the opening sequence batman cold open the opening sequence has nothing to do with the actual plot but there was a possibility moore wouldnt return after moonraker the opening was designed in case a new actor had to play bond and they wanted to establish the backstory with bonds wife it also plays into a theme within the movie do we have a right to avenge our lost loved ones bat scare when bond is climbing the mountain and the doves come out of a hole between my legs famously on the movies poster incidentally to get the right amount of gluteal coverage the model wore the swimsuit backwards british stuffiness chief of staff bill tanner in this film seems to have gone to the same public school or sixthform as terrythomas in terms of accent the cameo margaret thatcher not really no celebrities were harmed despite the looks and even calling her husband dennis in the credits is only the prime minister casual danger dialogue as standard for a bond film but a moment stands out during the car chase when bond quips while driving the alleged car offroad down the mountain that he enjoys a drive in the country despite the fact theyre in the middle of a life and death chase melina provides her bona fides as an action girl by finding the comment hilarious cat scare a shark swims out of the st georges wreck bond encounters the ole bird flying out of the cliff face cliche while climbing chekhovs gun the air tank that melina leaves at the submerged ruins later comes in handy when she and bond escape kristatos heck theres even a chekhovs parrot in this movie chivalrous pervert bond deliberately ignores bibi dahls attempts to seduce him then again shes just 16 click hello during the assault on the villains lair one of his lackeys is about to shoot bond only to have melina point her crossbow at his back and disarm him climb slip hang climb although unlike most examples of the trope this one does involve a rope comicbook adaptation marvel comics published a twoissue adaptation of the film the first us appearance of bond in comics since dr no was adapted by dc comics some 17 years earlier continuity nod bond visits his wifes grave in the opening which was intended as a way to ease a new actor into the role before moore decided to come back the musical lock to the identograph room is opened with the tune of nobody does it better the theme song from the spy who loved me the cat seen in the teaser is wearing the same diamondstudded collar from diamonds are forever continuity snarl blofeld appears bald and in a neck brace as he was at the end of on her majestys secret service even though he had subsequently appeared in diamonds are forever with no brace and looking completely different contrived coincidence of all things melina could leave to mark the spot in the ruins shed been studying she chose her oxygen tank it comes in handy saving their lives later on conveniently timed attack from behind kristatos dies from a thrown knife in the back from columbo just as hes either about to stab bond or catch a quarrel from melinas crossbow cool car subverted bonds usual gadgetladen car blows up when the bad guys try to break into it forcing him and melina to go through the resulting car chase in her yellow beatup citroën 2cv couldnt find a pen a message for bond is left on his hotel rooms bathroom mirror exposed via condensation from the sink darker and edgier especially in the moore era and it wouldnt be the last attempt at this destination defenestration bond goes flying through a stainedglass window while fighting a mook disney villain death the villain bond dumps down a chimney the hitman locque and the murderous biathlon skier eric kriegler disposable pilot in the teaser the pilot of the helicopter bond is in gets electrocuted midflight lampshaded by blofeld blofeld one of my less useful people dress hits floor bond and melina as they decide to take a midnight swim melina for your eyes only darling drugs are bad columbo smuggles gold diamonds pistachio nuts but no heroin the dragon emile leopold locque for kristatos and eric kriegler for general gogol dropped a bridge on him blofeldthe 80s already in full swing on the very first 80s bond no less especially the theme song everyone has standards even james bond wont stoop so low as to sleep with an underage girl evil cripple blofeld is in a wheelchair after the beating he took in his last appearance evil laugh blofeld gives constant evil chuckles as he watches bond struggle to escape his inescapable death trap fingertip drug analysis during the raid on kristatos warehouse bond is able to identify raw opium this way he does this again in the living daylights foreshadowing before being taken on a ride by blofeld a priest informs bond that a helicopter from universal exports is coming to pick bond up he then makes the sign of the cross toward bond as the helicopter takes off four eyes zero soul locque to a t friendly enemy general gogol just shrugs after bond destroys the mac guffin he flew in from moscow to purchase it helps that gogol already met bond and that a stalemate was an acceptable deal gogol was just being a good sport as he didnt need to have bond killed for anything good guns bad guns when bond and melina are captured after retrieving the atac kristatos and his mooks all carry p38 or luger pistols both weapons heavily associated with nazi germany go to your room  kristatos says this to bibi right before he slaps her graceful loser gogol just shrugs and chuckles after bond destroys the mac guffin he wanted to purchase groin attack arguably happens to melina havelock during the under water excavation when she and bond are attacked by a thug in an underwater excavation suit while making a go at her his suits claw hits her roughly in the groin area while she whimpers in fear may not have been intentional on the part of the filmmakers and could have simply been a result of slow movement underwater when one of kristatos men is attacked by sharks the first one goes straight for the groin the guards must be crazy if any of the guards at st cyrils had gone for help instead of trying to take on bonds small attack force themselves they would have been wiped out gunman with three names emile leopold locque hoist by his own petard if blofeld hadnt flown the helicopter by his own location bond would never have known where he was hope spot bond gets on the ski lift evading his pursuers  then the elevator door reopens and they get on hot subonsub action melina and bonds minisub is attacked by an enemy minisub hypocrite bond repeatedly tries to talk melina out of avenging her parents because she might end up getting herself killed this comes from a guy who at the beginning of the movie killed the person who had murdered his wife and who later proceeds to kill locque to avenge a fellow agent now this could have been understood as bond talking melina out of it because he himself didnt feel any satisfaction from it but the problem with that is that there is this other film from the series where bond once again isnt exactly opposed to the idea of a roaring rampage of revenge although an argument can be made that bond doesnt want melina to end up on a similar path to the one hes on imperial stormtrooper marksmanship academy kriegler is a biathlon champion who manages to shoot a ski pole in half when bond is trying to retrieve his lost handgun with it but is unable to shoot bond every time though to be fair biathletes train to hit stationary targets not moving ones instant death bullet melinas crossbow kills two people instantly although it only wounds a third who isnt hit in a less severe area kick the dog kristatos slapping bibi a minor but amusing one locque is paying off cuban assassin hector gonzales with a briefcase full of money gonzales takes out a wad of cash and throws it to one of his paid harem when gonzales gets killed locque just picks up the briefcase and leaves with his henchman snatching the wad from the girl as he walks past another minor example that foreshadows kristatos reveal as the bad guy when bond and ferrara are leaving their meeting with him at the ice rink he snubs ferraras offered hand after shaking bonds kick the son of a bitch bond kicking locque off the cliff is however justified given the nature of the victim entirely deliberate murder so good thing 007 is licenced to kill the last straw although the pin thrown in an impending car doesnt bring it down bonds kick does lawyerfriendly cameo blofeld as mentioned above blofeld is never named as such or fully shown he is bald and he does have a similar outfit and the white cat in his lap pretty much tells the audience who he is the explosion at the end of diamonds are forever must have left him alive but paralyzed hence the wheelchair leaning on the fourth wall after her parents are killed melina has an extended look directly into the camera mac guffin the atac device that went to the bottom of the sea mac guffin delivery service kristatos thank you mr bond you have saved us the trouble of disarming it meaningful name bibi dahl come on murder by remote control vehicle in the teaser blofeld although he is never named as such fakes a message from bonds office and sends a helicopter to pick him up he then kills the pilot and assumes remote control of the chopper taunting bond he causes the chopper to make several near misses on high buildings before steering it into a disused factory where it will inevitably crash bond naturally manages to disable the remote control and regain control of the helicopter before the crash needle in a stack of needles q gripes that theyve found 439 st cyrils in greece nipple and dimed we get a very brief glimpse of lisls right nipple as her nightie slips off melina however spends a couple scenes in a cutoff wet tshirt with nothing visible around or through you can only see melinas nipple during the closing credits though only while shes swimming in silhouette if you look for it no mac guffin no winner bond decides to destroy the atac in front of general gogol and says thats détente comrade you dont have it i dont have it though a bit puzzling as the british can simply build another atac bond is probably taunting gogol rather subtly in fact critical thought shows this was more a case of we win because you didnt by destroying the atac bond has prevented the russians from gaining control of britains nuclear missile supply for britain the loss of the atac is merely an inconvenience had the russians gained the atac the consequences for britain would have been far worse no more for me a running gag character  appeared in the two previous films  after a skier slides through his table not in front of the parrotoh really mr bond also used more seriously bond would have been screwed if it wasnt for kristatos telling his men where to take the atac in front of max well the parrot and columbo especially since he was quite familiar with the location and would have known parrot or no parrot not my driver blofeld sends a phony helicopter to pick up bond in the opening oh crap  the jim equipment mooks reaction when the ticking stops you can even see him beginning to mouth oh shit before the explosion cuts him off only i can kill him melina does it with gonzales but fails with kristatos ooh me accents slipping trope namer sort of lisl oh me nighties slipping bond sos your accent countess pool scene gonzales has a number of bikiniclad women lounging around his pool transgender the woman in a white bikini was played by a trans woman tabloids inflated it saying the trans woman was carole bouquet parasol parachute bond uses a poolside umbrella to slow his fall when jumping off a wall its also useful as a momentary visual shield to avoid bullets pistol whip columbo ushers melina out of the winchroom then knocks out the bound and gagged mook whos groaning from the quarrel stuck in his shoulder please put some clothes on bond to bibi dahl as she tries to seduce him powered armor the mook in the deepsea jim suit played by the movies stunt coordinator bond and melina must fight off underwater premortem oneliner you left this with ferrara i believe pretty in mink a few worn during the scenes in the alps including a coat melina wears psycho for hire locque is said to have been sentenced to life imprisonment in belgium for several particularly brutal murders where he had a psychiatrist which he later strangled to escape from prison punch punch punch uh oh bonds final battle with kreiger put on a bus m is absent from the film in the movie hes said to be on leave because bernard lee the original m died before production began he would returnplayed by robert brown in octopussy possibly subverted in that brown had already played the character of admiral hargreaves in the spy who loved me so this could be seen more as a major promotion race lift the jamaicanborn judy havelock of the short story became the anglogreek melina havelock the italian enrico columbo became the greek milos columbo real men wear pink kriegler wears a pink shirt in the climax real life writes the plot bernard lee the original m actor sadly died before production started out of respect to his memory the producers and filmmakers chose not to recast the role of m right then and there so they established early in the film by way of ms moneypenny that m was on leave vacation to explain his absence and the scenes that would have normally featured him were rewritten with other government official characters acting in his place carrying out his usual tasks m would return in octopussy played by robert brown but its never established if brown is meant to be the same character simply played by a different actor as bond usually is across his many recasts or if he is meant to be a new character replacing the previous m possibly even admiral hargreaves browns character from the spy who loved me  recycled in space the whole film is strongly reminiscent of on her majestys secret service in both films bond is with a countess on a beach threatened by mooks kicks a gun out of a mooks hand and hes wearing a tuxedo sans jacket both films show bond at a casino with the aforementioned countess both times the women are losing at baccarat the opening teaser sequence shows tracy bonds grave and blofeld in a neckbrace also the fact in this film melina is halfenglish halfgreek in ohmss tracy was halfenglish halfitalian both films have bond allied with a crime syndicate figure who doesnt sell drugs bond also escapes in both films by riding in the car of the female lead who does the majority of the driving both films have a wedding scene and bond riding in a helicopter piloted by someone else both films have bond speaking with a priest at some point both films are set in the alps at one point show a bond girl on icehave bond on skis getting shot at and have a bobsled track fightbattle sequence mountain climbers are shown in both at some point both films have a germanic female character who is in charge of a girlgirls finally in both films bond and his crime syndicate ally assault a mountaintop lair renegade russian averted this is the only bond movie in which the villain is an agent of a communist government whose goal is actually authorized by his government roaring rampage of revenge melina hunting down gonzalez and whoever hired him ruins for ruins sake at one point bond and melina scuba dive past a sunken greek temple in a deleted scene bond mentions it was once dedicated to apollo safety in muggles bonds pursuers are deterred from killing by the large crowd same language dub carole bouquet is inexplicably dubbed by another actress who sounds more like in her 40s than in her 20s however bouquet dubbed herself in the french version robert rietti overdubbed john hollis blofeld john moreno luigi ferrara and john wyman erich kriegler as well as some bitparts it would be his final contribution to the series sea mine the st georges disguised as a fishing trawler pulls up a wwii sea mine in its net setting up the events of the film later the dragon blows up a sea mine in the villains warehouse to cover his escape and unsuccessfully destroy an attacking force its presence raises the possibility that the sinking of the st georges may not have been an accident sequel escalation inverted moonraker featured a space station and a plot to wipe out humanity for your eyes only is about a stolen mac guffin show some leg the villains provide one for bond as hes infiltrating gonzales hangout and a member of his paid harem starts smooching with one of the guards enabling bond to sneak past smoke out during the car chase bond deliberately drives through some aggregate to create a smoke screen spy drama probably the only roger moore bond film that comes close to stale beer spy ship the film the st george has one accidentally fish up a sea mine and sink steal the surroundings when a spy ship goes missing it turns out that to steal machinery onboard worth millions on the black market the bad guys sunk the ship killing everyone on board so they could retrieve the equipment later by submarine stuka scream on the helicopter in the cold open and gonzales machine gunequipped seaplane take a third option at the end melina insists on killing kristatos but bond tells her that killing simply for revenge is wrong and that they should bring kristatos in alive to answer for his crimes while theyre arguing kristatos goes to stab bond in the back with a hidden knife only to get a knife in his own back courtesy of columbo take that  blofelds appearance was a swipe at kevin mc clory whose unofficial bond movie never say never again and legal issues surrounding it are the reason blofeld only makes a lawyerfriendly cameo here the destruction of bonds cool car while fleeing gonzalezs compound was a swipe at the overuse of gadgetladen vehicles during the seventies bond and melina are forced to flee in a beatup clunker instead resulting in one of the more memorable car chases in the franchise tantrum throwing kriegler finds his rifles barrel is bent and throws both it and an entire motorbike at bond theme tune cameo the code to the room containing the identigraph is part of nobody does it better threatening shark there are a few tiger sharks around when kristatos throws bond and melina overboard however when one of kristatos henchmen falls in they go for him instead title drop a very subtle and rather unique variation during his assignment briefing bond is handed a document marked classified and secured with a seal marked for your eyes only significantly less subtle for your eyes only darling at the end token romance a common trope in bond films but this one has a particulously obvious example of it there are literally no romantic moments at all between bond and melina havelock aside from maybe one slightly flirtatious moment before they wind up kissing in the last scene almost as an afterthought made more egregious by the fact that bond rejects the advances of bibi dahl played by lynnholly johnson as she is clearly too young for him yet caroline boucquet the actress who plays havelock is only a year older than johnson the age difference between her and roger moore is 30 years possibly explaining why their relationship seems far more fatherdaughter like rather than romantic twoperson pool party although it takes place in the sea unusual euphemism bonds superiors tell him to apply the necessary pressure to make gonzales talk vader breath when bond is about to be attacked by an enemy diver in jim equipment all we see is a pov shot accompanied by the sound of the air regulator and ticking the voiceless locque again we know he can speak because we see him do it in one scene but we never hear it fittingly the only time he makes a sound is screaming as bond shoves him to his doom we have reserves during the boat scene a mook falls in the water and gets attacked by sharks kristatos responds by saying ah leave him we used to be friends colombo and kristatos served together in the greek resistance but later took divergent paths after one of them turned out to be a soviet double agent we win because you didnt bonds destruction of the atac at the end of the film retrieving and returning the atac would have been preferable for the british but denying the russians the ability to turn britains missiles against britain was more important why dont you just shoot him  blofeld enjoys bonds apparently futile attempt to escape his remotecontrolled helicopter deliberately flying it near buildings to frighten him this gives bond time to work his way into the cockpit where he can disconnect the cables to the remote system also later when kristatos has bond and melina hostage he drags them behind his boat to be eaten by sharks except he patches up bonds open wound for no apparent reason wire dilemma needed to detach the atac from its selfdestruct device subverted in that bond and melina have the wire guide with them and its simply cutting them from left to right and the explosive and detonator remain intact merely detached from the failsafe allowing bond to use it as a limpet mine later you killed my father melinas motivation to join bonds quest previous index next the spy who loved me creatorpinewood studios octopussy
