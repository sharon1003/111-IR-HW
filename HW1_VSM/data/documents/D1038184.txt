baldy posts 244joined mar 2011jan 04 2013  1045 pm i had my first postoperative sonogram on 1252012 and unfortunately the results arent as sclean as i would like two nodes were found to be abnormally large both in my right neck one at level iv which was round and 3mm which doesnt demonstrate a fatty hilum and one at level vi which was oblong 4mm x 3mm and does demonstrate a fatty hilum from googling i find that the absense of a fatty sheath or hilum around a lymph node and a spherical shape can be indicators of a cancerous node so the one at level iv which the report calls suspicious could be residual cancer the other which does have a fatty sheath is oblong and the report merely states attention for followup studies recommended is likely swollen from an infection i did have a sinus infection some weeks before the sonogram a good sign is that all my blood levels are consistent with no cancer however my endo explained its possible that the blood levels could be decieving the current recommendation is to wait and see and have another sonogram in six months im not comfortable with the thought that if this is residual cancer it may very possibly metastisize if it already hasnt while im waiting and seeing hopefully this is all leftover from the sinus infection and im fretting over nothing alan ps historical info papillary stage iii  total thyroidectomy 2810 with 4 foci

there two years ago i too had strange looking lymph nodes both a pet scan and ultrasound pointed to a return  my surgeon opted to remove them to be safe rather than wait and they tested negative for cancer it was a condition called reactive hyperplasia big big reliefmy suggestion push for a needle biopsy if the nodes are located in a suitable area push for another ultrasound in two or three months and go from there seeing as you had a sinus infection  they could just be reacting to that hoping for the best log in or register to post comments baldy posts 244joined mar 2011jan 05 2013  453 pm lymph nodes hi amorrisoi have a preexisting follow up appointment with my head and neck surgeon scheduled for midjanuary i had already intended to do pretty much what youre suggesting with him though i hadnt thought of a fine needle biopsy i had already talked to him on the phone immeadiately following the sonogram and he agreed with the wait and see diagnosis my endo suggested he normally has an aggressive approach but he also usually defers to the endo who is pretty well known hopefully ill be able to sway him thanks for the replyalan log in or register to post comments baldy posts 244joined mar 2011aug 13 2013  719 pm belated follow up hi allafter speaking with the head and neck surgeon i reluctantly agree with the wait and see diagnosis as he explained someone who has already had major surgery in the area where the suspicious nodes are runs an increased chance that further surgery will cause incidental damage when the initial surgery is done the surgeon does his best to put all the nerves and vessels that he had to move aside back in their original positions but sometimes they arent quite where they should be if you go back in with scaring from the previous surgery and the possibility that nerves and vessels may be out of place the risks are greater than they were the first time since my impression is that hes on the aggressive side im going to proceed as he and the endocrinologist advise also he feels the nodes are too small and deep to do a fine needle biopsy sorry to be so late with this info alan log in or register to post comments baldy posts 244joined mar 2011aug 13 2013  818 pm2nd sonogram hi allits been six months and ive had my second sonogram the results were both good and bad one of the two nodes from the first is definately gone there is a node of aproximately the same size in the same area as the other there are also several new nodes showing up one of which is large enough to feel by hand at level v almost out on my shoulder i think im more worried about the probable repeat than the new ones the surgeon said the new ones will be easy to remove if it comes to that again the recommended course of action is wait and see with another sonogram in six months i really really hate wait and see alan log in or register to post comments baldy posts 244joined mar 2011dec 17 2013  106 am3rd sonogram hi alli thought id keep you informed so that maybe my experience with follow up sonograms may be of some help just had my 3rd sonogram the single node that was in both the 1st and 2nd sonogram didnt show up in the 3rd which im very happy about the enlarged group that showed up in the 2nd showed up again in the 3rd but they are not spherical and my endo says not to worry about them the 3rd also showed 3 other enlarged nodes in 2 different locations that were also not spherical and are therefore not a problem hes satisified enough with the results to extend the wait time for my 4th sonogram from six months to nine months for your peace of mind dont listen to anything the sonogram techs say while theyre doing the scan when i had my 2nd sonogram the techs were asking questions and making comments that made me believe that not only was there residual cancer but it was in both sides of my neck when i talked to the dr three days later he told me there was no evidence of residual cancer and there were no enlarged nodes at all on the one side of my neck they arent supposed to comment while theyre doing the scans and they shouldnt ask questions either since the patient me in this case can jump to conclusions based on the questions they ask this wasnt a problem this time both because i had learned my lesson and the tech who did the scan was professional enough not to comment and the only questions she asked were general but the 2nd time i had an anxious 3 days while i waited to talk to the dr about the results dont put yourself through that if you dont have to wait for the dr to tell you the resultsalan log
