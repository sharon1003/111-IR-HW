everyday items that you would never imagine containing animalderived ingredients1 plastic bags yet another reason to hate plastic bags they contain animal fat during the process of making plastic bags

byproducts are not sourced from responsible organic farmers but from the extremely polluting and damaging factory farms big business farms are only concerned with their bottom line and have no conscience when it comes to animal cruelty the unwavering goal of making money from every single piece of each animal once it is slaughtered also perpetuates the use of plastics and this affects us
