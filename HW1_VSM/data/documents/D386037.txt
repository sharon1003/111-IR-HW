instructor derrick arrington derrick has taught biology and chemistry at both the high school and college level he has a masters degree in science education elements are grouped into families on the periodic table based on their chemical and physical properties in this lesson you will learn about a unique group known as the halogen family definition of halogens vertical columns on the periodic table containing elements that exhibit similar properties are commonly referred to by chemists as groups or families there are a total of 18 groups on the periodic table the halogens are all elements that are found in group 17 of the periodic table the halogens include fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine all of these elements are considered to be reactive nonmetals reactivity of halogens atoms of elements consist of a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons the nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around in orbits or levels atoms of an element react with other atoms based on the number of electrons found in their outer orbit these outer electrons are called valence electrons for an atom of an element to be nonreactive it must have eight electrons in its outer level all members of the halogen family have seven valence electrons because these atoms are so close to having a full set of eight valence electrons theyre very reactive they show a chemical tendency to gain one electron by forming bonds and taking the electron from other atoms to attain a full set because of their chemical reactivity these elements do not exist as single elements in nature they are only found in compounds uses of halogens halogens have a variety of uses many household cleaning products contain halogen such as the chlorine found in bleach fluorine and chlorine are both abundant in nature as compounds with other elements and are present in biological compounds table salt used to flavor foods is an essential part of the human diet it is composed of sodium bonded with the halogen chlorine na cl humans also require iodine the halogen iodine is found in iodized table salt as well many towns and cities add fluorine to their water supplies it is also found in toothpaste because it prevents tooth decay bromine is found in the compound silver bromide that is used in photographic film as a lightsensitive coating iodine is also used to sterilize the skin of a patient before surgery because it has antibacterial properties astatine is radioactive and is sometimes used as a radioactive tracer in cancer treatments to unlock this lesson you must be a studycom member create your account register for a free trial are you a student or a teacher i am a student i am a teacher
