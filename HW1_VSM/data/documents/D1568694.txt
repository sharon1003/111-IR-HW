first clue they’re loaded with nutrition is their bright red color which indicates the presence of powerful phytonutrients called betalains betalains include reddishpurple betacyanin pigments and

in beets may improve muscle performance offering allure not only for athletes but also for maintaining muscle function as you age naturally occurring nitrates in beets may boost muscle health beets are a good source of naturally occurring nitrates which are converted into nitric oxide no in your body nitric oxide is perhaps most wellknown for its benefits to heart health as noted by cardiologist dr stephen sinatra 1“a dequate no production is the first step in a chain reaction that promotes healthy cardiovascular function while insufficient no triggers a cascade of destruction that eventually results in heart disease…no promotes healthy dilation of the veins and arteries so blood can move throughout your body plus it prevents red blood cells from sticking together to create dangerous clots and blockages”your heart of course is a muscle so it makes sense that boosting no production would also lead to improvements in other muscles in your body researchers from washington university school of medicine in missouri have previously found dietary nitrates improve muscle performance in elite athletes and they wanted to determine if such nitrates would also benefit patients with heart failure whose weakened hearts make them prone to fatigue and shortness of breath with everyday activities senior study author dr linda r peterson associate professor of medicine at the washington university school of medicine told medical news today 2a lot of the activities of daily living are powerbased  getting out of a chair lifting groceries or climbing stairs and they have a major impact on quality

tolerance to highintensity exercise a separate study similarly revealed that consuming a concentrated beet juice supplement increases wholebody no production as well as muscle speed and power in healthy men and women 6beet juice may lower your blood pressure and benefit brain health your blood pressure may also benefit from the nitrates in beet juice with benefits occurring within in a matter

reductions in blood pressure improvements in endothelial function and reduced arterial stiffness the researchers concluded 8“this is the first evidence of durable bp blood pressure reduction with dietary nitrate supplementation in a relevant patient group these findings suggest a role for dietary nitrate as an affordable readilyavailable and adjunctive treatment in the management of patients with hypertension”aside from the blood pressure benefits drinking beet juice may also be good for your brain the nitrates and resulting no help increase blood flow to the brain in elderly people as

beet juice appear well established keep in mind that beets are a very highsugar vegetable in fact beets have the highest sugar content of all vegetables although they also contain a wealth of vitamins minerals and antioxidants for this reason i recommend adding beets in whole nonjuiced form to your diet a few times a week to benefit from their nutrition without overdosing on their high amounts of sugar the sugar will be even more concentrated in beet juice without any of the fiber to somewhat moderate its effects so you have to be cautious when consuming beets in juiced form if you struggle
