causal reasoning from wikipedia the free encyclopedianavigation search causal reasoning is the process of identifying causality the relationship between a cause and its effect the study of causality extends from ancient philosophy to contemporary neuropsychology assumptions about the nature of causality may be shown to be functions of a previous event preceding a later one the first known protoscientific study of cause and effect occurred in aristotles physics 1 causal inference is an example of causal reasoning contents  hide 1 understanding cause and effect2 inferring cause and

causes b then a must transmit a force or causal power to b which results in the effect causal relationships suggest change over time cause and effect are temporally related and the cause precedes the outcome 3causality may also be inferred in the absence of a force a lesstypical definition 4 a cause can be removal or stopping like removing a support from a structure and causing a collapse or a lack of precipitation causing wilted plants humans can reason about many topics for example in social and counterfactual situations and mathematics with the aid of causal understanding 3 understanding depends on the ability to comprehend cause and effect people must be able to reason about the causes of others’ behavior to understand their intentions and act appropriately and understand the likely effects of their own actions counterfactual arguments are presented in many situations humans are predisposed to think about “what might have been” even when that argument has no bearing on the current situation although causality is related to mechanism 5 an understanding of causality does not necessarily imply an understanding of mechanism causeandeffect relationships define categories of objects 6 wings are a feature of the category birds this feature is causally interconnected with another feature of the category the ability to fly 6inferring cause and effect  edithumans are predisposed to understand cause and effect making inferences bidirectionally temporal cues demonstrate causality 7 when observing an event people assume that things preceding the event cause it and things following the event are effects of it 8coincidence of movement and spatial relationships are another way to infer cause and effect if objects move together or one object seems to initiate the movement of another causality is inferred from that relationship 9 animacy may also be inferred from such relationships causal reasoning may be activated almost automatically 3 10 however inferences about cause and effect do not always demonstrate understanding of mechanisms underlying causality causality has been described as cognitive illusion 11 much understanding of cause and effect is based on associations without an understanding of how events are related to one another this is known as the illusion of explanatory depth 5a 2013 neuropsychology study 12 demonstrates that humans conform new information to old information this suggests an inverted causal experience cause must be attributed to effect a posteriori to understand the causal connection between agent and act friedrich nietzsche argued against aristotelian causality that cause precedes effect in the will to power 13humans understand cause and effect research suggests that other animals such as rats 14 and monkeys 15 may or may not understand cause and effect animals may use information about cause and effect to improve decisionmaking and make inferences about past and future events 16 a constant which guides human reasoning and learning about events is causality 17 causal considerations are integral to how people reason about their environment 3 humans use causal cues and their related effects to make decisions and predictions and to understand mechanisms leading to change 18types of causal relationships  editseveral types of causal models are developed as a result of observing causal relationships commoncause relationships commoneffect relationships causal chains and causal homeostasis 5in commoncause relationships a single cause has several effects a virus is an example of a single cause resulting in several effects fever headache and nausea in commoneffect relationships several causes converge in one effect an increase in government spending is an example of one effect with several causes high unemployment increased currency value or civil unrest in causal chains one cause triggers an effect which triggers another effect an example is poor sleep leading to fatigue which leads to poor coordination in causal homeostasis causal relationships form a stable cycle or reinforcing mechanism feathers hollow bones high metabolic rate and flight reinforce each other in birds with adaptation to the whole rather than one instance beginning a causal relationship 5types of causal reasoning  editwhile causal understanding can be automatic in complex situations advanced reasoning is necessary types of causal reasoning 2 include deduction  editdeductive reasoning implies a general rule an event is a guaranteed conclusion an outcome may be deduced based on other arguments which may determine a causeandeffect relationship induction  editinductive reasoning is an inference made with uncertainty the conclusion is likely but not guaranteed induction can be used to speculate about causality abduction  editin abductive reasoning the premises do not guarantee a conclusion abduction moves from data description to a hypothesis without a necessary relationship between cause and effect models  editthere are several models of how humans reason about causality dependency  editthe dependency model asserts that effects are contingent upon causes 3 cause and effect have a probable relationship covariation  editthe covariation regularity model a type of dependency model suggests that humans understand relationships between causes and effects by their coincidence inferring that change in a cause changes an effect 19mechanism  editthis model 2 suggests that cause and effect are mechanistically related in this situation there is a basic process underlying the cause and effect dynamics  editthis model of causal representation 20 suggests that causes are represented by a pattern of forces the force theory 21 is an extension of the dynamics model that applies to causal representation and reasoning ie drawing inferences from the composition of multiple causal relations development in humans  editchildren develop an ability to understand causality and make inferences based on cause and effect at an early age 10 some research suggests that children as young as eight months can understand cause and effect 22 an understanding of mechanism and causality go hand in hand children need to understand cause and effect to understand the operation of mechanisms which allows them to understand causal relationships 5 children ask why at an early age to understand mechanism and in turn causality a child’s first why question often coincides with their first attempt to explain something within the first year after acquiring language 5 children ask why to understanding mechanism and causality 23the ability to understand and reason about causality at a young age allows children to develop naïve theories about many topics causality helps children learn about physics language concepts and the behavior of others 10 there is a developmental pattern to the causal understanding children have 23infants have an understanding of causal power 5 they know that certain causes have particular effects young children from late infancy to early childhood understand functional relations 5 a particular property or component of a mechanism has a certain function they also understand causal density how causes can interact in a complex way older children and adults continue to develop an understanding of mechanistic fragments 5 they understand the components of a working system in isolation although the full mechanistic details of a system do not emerge until adulthood jean piaget defined preoperational concrete operational and formal operational stages of development across cultures  editcausal attributions have been shown to be dissimilar among different cultures in several ways causal attributions  edityan and gaier 24 investigated causal attributions of college success and failure between two groups of students american and asian the asian group was from china korea japan and southeast asia performance was similar across the four nationalities the students were asked to make judgments about someone elses successes and failures in schoolwork and whether those outcomes were attributable to innate ability or to expended effort american participants were much more likely to attribute academic achievement to ability than asian participants were although americans tended to rate success as attributable to effort failure was not perceived as being a result of a lack of effort asian students did not show this pattern comparisons between western and eastern children and adults suggest differences between the cultures in the causality attributable to particular illnesses 25 after reading stories of illnesses and making inferences about the causes of those illnesses both groups showed an understanding of the biological causes of most illnesses however all the children and the eastern adults also attributed some illnesses and their remedies to magical causes causal motivations  editmembers of individualist or collectivist cultures may make different attributions of the origins and motivations of movement on a small scale among animated objects or what would cause movement within a group of animated objects 26 participants from the uk china and hong kong were shown videos of animated fish on a computer screen the videos depicted a central fish moving toward or away from a group of fish and participants were asked to determine the relationship among the fish internally motivated the central fish was looking for food or externally motivated the central fish wanted to join the others another set of videos suggested that the group of fish was the predominant agent with the individual fish being acted upon these different videos provided an opportunity to determine whether group or individual action is the preferred motivating force among different cultures selfreported results suggested that asian participants preferred descriptions and situations where the group was the central focus and causal agent while westerners preferred situations in which the individual was the agent these effects also extended to memory processes collectivist participants had better memories of situations in which the group was primary this suggests that members of individualistic cultures are more responsive to independent agents and members of collectivist cultures are more responsive when groups guide individual action causal reasoning in nonhuman animals  editcausal reasoning is not unique to humans animals are often able to use causal information as cues for survival 11 rats are able to generalize causal cues to gain food rewards animals such as rats can learn the mechanisms required for a reward by reasoning about what could elicit a reward sawa 2009 new caledonian crow  corvus moneduloidesnew caledonian crows have been studied for their ability to reason about causal events 27 this intelligent species uses tools in a way that even chimpanzees cannot  citation needed making complex tools to bring food within reach experimental work with this species suggests that they can understand hidden causes in a way that was previously believed uniquely human 28 in the first of two experiments a crow was confined with food in a tube inaccessible to the crow without some effort a human entered the enclosure and went behind a curtain waving a stick near the food tube through a hole in the curtain when the human left the enclosure the crow confidently moved toward the food area and retrieved the reward knowing that the human cause of the moving stick albeit invisible was gone in the second experiment no human entered or exited the enclosure in this case the crow moved toward the food uncertainly not knowing what caused the stick to move references  edit

circa 1880s which recent neuropsychological experiments confirm 477 nov 1887march 1888 i maintain the phenomenality of the inner world too every thing of which we become conscious is arranged simplified schematized interpreted through and through — the actual process of inner perception the causal connection between thoughts feelings desires between subject and object are absolutely hidden from us — and are perhaps purely imaginary the apparent inner world is governed by just the same forms and procedures as the outer world we never encounter facts pleasure and displeasure are subsequent and derivative intellectual phenomena — causality eludes us to suppose a direct causal link be ween thoughts as logic does — that is the consequence of the crudest and clumsiest observation between two thoughts all kinds of affects play their game but their motions are too fast therefore we fail to recognize them we deny them — thinking as epistemologists conceive it simply does not occur it is a quite arbitrary fiction arrived at by selecting one element from the process and eliminating all the rest an artificial arrangement for the purpose of intelligibility — the spirit something that thinks where possible even absolute pure spirit – this conception is a second derivative of that false introspection which believes in thinking first an act is imagined which simply does not occur thinking and secondly a subjectsubstratum in which every act of thinking and nothing else has its origin that is to say both the deed and the doer are fictions lovett richard a february
