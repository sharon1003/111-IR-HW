16 foods you can still eat after the expiration date october 19 2016 by erin kennedy 4 comments this is a huge issue in our house i always try to keep foods longer and my husband is adamant that if the food in the fridge has a date and that expiration date has passed then it is time to throw it out no ifs ands or buts however i see it differently i know that not all foods need to be thrown away right away my mom never threw anything away i know there is a line for some foods but which foods are fine to keep around for awhile and which are not don’t get confused by the labeling some dates are for the consumers and some are for the retailer here is what they mean“use by” and “best by” these dates are intended for consumer use but are typically the date the manufacturer deems the product reaches peak freshness it’s not a date to indicate spoilage nor does it necessarily signal that the food is no longer safe to eat“sell by” this date is only intended to help manufacturers and retailers not consumers it’s a stocking and marketing tool provided by food makers to ensure proper turnover of the products in the store so they still have a long shelf life after consumers buy them consumers however are misinterpreting it as a date to guide their buying decisions the report authors say that “sell by” dates should be made invisible to the consumer here are some foods you can keep after that annoying expiration date milk most milk will stay fresh up to a week after expiration date but use your smell sense for this one and make sure it doesn’t smell sour before pouring if it does time to get rid of otherwise get that cereal ready hard cheese i am notorious for putting good expensive delicious cheese in the cheese drawer only to be lost under other items and to only be found weeks later when i am craving some sharp cheese hard cheese can last up to four weeks after expiration date even after it has been opened mayonaise this was a surprise to me as i have thrown away many jars of the white stuff when i didn’t have to mayo will last up to 3 – 4 months after the expiration date as long as it was store bought and stored at the correct temperature after opening meats fresh meat should not be eaten a day or two after its expiration date but if you freeze your meats they will last for up to a year or longer so stock up on those meat or chicken sales and stick them in the freezer pork as long as your pork is fully cooked at the time of the expiration date you can eat it up to three days after potato chips since chips are highly processed they will last
