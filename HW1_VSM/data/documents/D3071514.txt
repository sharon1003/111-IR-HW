snowbird length 15 miles skill advanced pros waterfalls wildlife solitude cons none water plentiful notes take trail 64a to avoid many creek crossings can be dangerous after rainfall snowbird trail after upper falls and kings meadows trail can be difficult to follow backcountry orienteering skills are necessary for this hike this hike begins at the end of forest road 75 and ends at the hooper bald parking area on the cherohala skywayclick here for a trip report  camping located in the nantahala national forest finding snow bird is like finding a four leaf clover you feel lucky when you see it this wilderness area is secluded and not very well known to hikers so the chances of finding solitude are great this is actually a proposed wilderness area and wilderness designation has been blocked by a senator helms several times the big snowbird trail begins at the end of forest road 75 and the drive in is a preview of what lies ahead the trail is wet and an excellent hike for the summer big snowbird trail 64 is the trail at the end of the parking lot it resembles an old road but it is an old railroad grade railroad artifacts will punctuate this entire hike the trail grade begins a gentle climb along snowbird creek dense rhododendron as well as hemlock and beech trees separate the trail from the creek at times the trail is high above the creek but it never comes within easy reach of the rushing water after 15 miles the trail passes a small waterfall on the left an excellent place to cool off in the summer as the trail follows the creek many small cascades can be seen on your right at approximately 25 miles the trail turns right at an old junk car just ahead a few feet you cross sassafras creek this is an excellent campsite and is just above the confluence of sassafras and snowbird creek the trail climbs slightly and you pass sassafras creek trail on the left this is an alternate route that can make this a loop hike continue hiking on old logging railroad ties that are still in the ground just one of many artifacts left from the timber days hiking on narrow gauge railroad ties after 4 miles you pass big falls on the right there are a couple of good trails that lead through the thick rhododendron to the multi tiered falls big falls another 12 mile or so down the trail you cross the creek on a sturdy log bridge on the other side is an excellent open area for camping there is plenty of room for many groups to camp at this confusing trail junction there are many fishing trails here and many hikers take a wrong turn this is also the junction of 64a a dry route that takes you to the other side of middle falls 64a climbs a hill steeply and rises above and out of site of the creek rapidly after a mile the trail passes a junction on the left with middle falls overlook trail this is a spur that has a nice view of the falls just ahead the trail rejoins trail 64 at a cable bridge junction of trail 64 and 64ataking the high trail 64a is ideal for cold weather hiking if you feel like splashing around take 64 instead in a mile it crosses the creek 11 times after reaching the cable bridge turn right on the trail without crossing the bridge this will put you back on trail 64 at the bridge there are several good campsites right beside snowbird creek this is a very popular camping area and rightfully so middle falls are very beautiful and there are plenty of beautiful creekside sites here less experienced backpackers and hikers should make this a turnaround point or the first half of a loop after this trail 64 becomes more and more difficult to follow as you continue hiking through dense rhododendron on big snowbird trail 64 you rock hop several branches upper falls approximately 15 miles past middle falls are difficult to access because of thick rhododendron it is however possible to view them from the trail another mile down the trail after you cross an unnamed branch is a large cache of railroad artifacts in the clearing you will see several large metal parts if you bush whack up the branch to the right of the main trail you will see more metal parts some paint cans and a possible railroad junction a very interesting place to explore or to make camp as with most of this section of trail the foliage is so thick that very little light reaches the forest floor playing with old railroad scrap after this clearing the big snowbird trail is very hard to follow here it begins its many crossings of this pristine creek there arent any alternate trails to keep your feet dry so in cold weather or times of high water you may want to back track to the trailhead from here to the you will notice thick grass and rhododendron along the trail brook trout are residents of this creek proving that this water is very clean because of the erosion caused by careless logging practices the creeks in this area supported no fish population for many years thankfully the creek has completely recovered and now supports a healthy fish population including the brookies one of many creek crossings after upper falls this section of trail is not very well traveled possibly due to the many creek crossings it is difficult to follow the trail because of the numerous washouts that must be negotiated the railroad grades werent built to last forever recently at the ranger station one hiker said that he wouldnt recommend this section of trail  or lack thereof  to anyone he went on to say if you have some sins that you may want to do penance for this is the trail to do if you happen to get turned around just remember that the trail follows the creek trail washout at 85 miles the trail junctions with the mitchell lick trail this is a welcome sight after thrashing through the rhododendronfiltering water from snowbird creek the mitchell lick trail 154 leads up 15 miles past the king meadows trail 63 to continue to the skyway and your other vehicle continue your climb to the junction with the hooper bald trail at this junction a left will take you 1 mile to the parking area on the cherohala skyway a right will take you to hooper bald in just one fifth of a mile the cherohala skyway was a very controversial issue during its planning and construction the local residents needed a highway to connect with tellico plains for hunting tourism and other purposes environmentalists fought this highway because it cut through unspoiled wilderness and because it severed important migratory paths for several species rare animals and not so rare animals have been affected adversely migratory paths that had been previously untouched since the beginning of time were changed forever the result has been the reduction of the population of some wildlife species the cherohala skyway cutting through the wilderness enjoy the breathtaking views that can be observed from the parking areas cleverly placed along this skyway the ride from big junction to the starting point is the icing on the cake and a great way to complete this hiking trip gettinthere to reach the trail head take route 143 west out of robbinsville nc after passing views of santeetlah lake on the right you will see
