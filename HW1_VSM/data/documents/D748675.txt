down your digestive tract it forms a gel adding bulk to stools and making them softer and easier to pass in a review published in alimentary pharmacology and therapeutics in 2014 however researchers

cholesterol to replace the bile acids levels of ldl cholesterol are lowered increasing your soluble fiber intake by 5 to 10 grams a day typically results in a 5 percent reduction in ldl cholesterol in

narrowing or obstruction anywhere in the digestive tract people with kidney disease and those who are taking certain medications may not be able to take psyllium supplements if you have a new or persistent change in your bowel habits be sure to consult your doctor if you have a health condition that requires treatment such as diabetes or heart disease talk with your doctor if you are
