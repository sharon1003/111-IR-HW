of the data so if you find errors while making your own track it is not their fault talimena sp to queen wilhelmina sp this is from my track set that i collected for the existing ot maps on ouachita mapscom i had a few other tracks to the east of the queen but not much eric strongâ€™s 2005 through hike eric through hiked the oht in 2004 and ot in 2005 i have been using his oht tracks to fill the gaps in my own mapping and they have been a huge resource i started trying to use his ot data several years ago but the data is in routes and waypoints so the trail looks more like a kids dot to dot rather than a trail tons of good info though and a solid foundation jim ennis jim hiked the 31 mile section between highway 7 and highway 9 in march 2011 and took an excellent track unfortunately i have numerous other map projects in the works and a pesky real job so it has been sitting in my inbox for almost a year since the track was so good i decided to make a final version of the maps with enhanced roads and other goodies when i finally started laying out the sheets i thought to myself self you should lay out the entire trail so that they can be number sequentially that precipitated this web page and all the other maps mike newman at httparklahomahikerorg mike has tracked several segments between queen wilhelmina and big brushy that were very helpful and has made them publicly available on his website david saugey and tim tate and have added mile posts water sources and corrections michael reed  httpcompulsivehikercom provided an updated track from mile 192 to 214 tracks to some of the shelters and many mile markers he also has some informative trail reports on his site other sources timble outdoors has several tracks the forest service has a track of the entire trail through the ouachita national forest but it has some major errors possibly reflecting reroute and it is much smaller scale less detail to buy map color weatherproof versions 11x17 of each map are
