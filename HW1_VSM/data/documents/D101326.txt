brain and brain stem rather than the spinal cord nerves arising from the spinal cord are the spinal nerves there are 12 pairs of cranial nerves and these pairs of nerves passage through foramina in the skull either individually or in groups cranial nerves are traditionally referred to by roman numerals and these numerals begin cranially and run caudally the most cranial nerve is the olfactory nerve i which runs from the nasal cavity through to the olfactory bulb the next most cranial is the optic nerve ii which runs from the eyes to the thalamus cranial nerves iii to xii all exit from the brain stem and innervate the head neck and organs in the thorax and abdomen in order of most cranial to caudal these include the oculomotor nerve iii the trochlear nerve iv the trigeminal nerve v the abducens nerve vi the facial nerve vii the vestibulocochlear nerve viii the glossopharyngeal nerve ix the vagus nerve x the accessory nerve xi and the hypoglossal nerve xii many of the cranial nerves with nuclei within the brain stem contain sensory and motor neurone components the sensory fibre components have their cell bodies located in ganglia outside the central nervous system and the motor fibre element have their cell bodies within the central nervous system cranial nerve fibre types prior to a full explanation of each cranial nerve function physiology anatomy and particularly composition the numerous types of nerve fibre found in cranial nerves must be explained to ensure that the following can be better understood nerve fibres can undertake numerous roles within the body and their function is dictated by what type of fibre the nerve is composed of a classification scheme is used to describe the type of fibres found within the cranial nerves and therefore provides a better understanding of the function and composition of that particular nerve below is a brief outline of this nerve fibre classification afferent fibres  sensory general somatic afferent gsathis type of fibre is used in the majority of basic senses including temperature touch and pain these fibres mainly supply sensation to various areas of the head including to the skin and face via the trigeminal nerve cranial nerve v to the skin of the external ear via the trigeminal nerve cranial nerve v the facial nerve cranial nerve vii the glossopharyngeal nerve cranial nerve ix and via the vagus nerve cranial nerve x to the mucosae of the oral cavity via the trigeminal nerve cranial nerve v and to the meningies of the brain via the trigeminal nerve cranial nerve v and the vagus nerve cranial nerve x skin sensation example sensory cortex —→ thalamus —→ trigeminal nuclei —→ trigeminal ganglion —→ skin etc special somatic afferent ssathe special signifies that this fibre type is found in nerves related to the special senses which include vision and hearing this therefore relates to the optic nerves cranial nerve ii and the auditoryvestibular systems which are the vestibulocochlear nerves cranial nerve viii vision example occipital cortex —→ thalamus mgn —→ rostral colliculusretinal ganglion cell —→ bipolar cell —→ vision hearing example temporal cortex —→ thalamus mgn —→ caudal colliculus and hindbrain —→ spiral ganglion —→ hearing general visceral afferent gvathis fibre type is commonly found in sensory nerves to organs and to sensory tissues related to chemicals these include fibres found in the glossopharyngeal nerves cranial nerve ix and the vagus nerves cranial nerve x organ sensory example sensory cortex —→ thalamus —→ cranial nerve nuculi —→ nerve ganglion —→ organs etc special visceral afferent svathis fibre type is found again in special sense organs related to the sensing of chemicals and therefore including taste and olfaction the olfactory sense relates to the olfactory nerve cranial nerve i and the taste senses relate to the facial nerve cranial nerve vii the glossopharyngeal nerve cranial nerve ix and the vagus nerve cranial nerve x the sense of taste is performed by the gustatory organ which are cells located in gustatory papillae in the mucous membrane of the dorsal side of the tongue taste buds can also be found in the soft palate pharynx larynx lips and cheeks olfaction example piriform cortex —→ olfactory tubercle —→ olfactory bulb —→ smell taste example sensory cortex —→ thalamus —→ hindbrain vii ix x —→ ganglion —→ taste efferent fibres  motor general somatic efferent gsethis type of nerve fibre is mainly found in nerves supplying skeletal muscles motor fibres such as these undertake numerous roles within the body such as control over the external ocular muscles via the oculomotor nerve cranial nerve iii the trochlear nerve cranial nerve iv and the abducent nerve cranial nerve vi or for example the muscles around the dorsal and ventral neck including the brachiocephalicus trapezius omotransversarius and the sternocephalicus which are all supplied by the accessory nerve cranial nerve xi motor nerve innervation example motor cortex —→ motor nuculi —→ muscle general visceral efferent gvethis type of nerve fibre is found in nerves supplying smooth muscle cardiac muscle and glands sympathetic innervation for this type of nerve fibre comes directly from the cranial cervical ganglion however parasympathetic innervation comes from several cranial nerves including the oculomotor nerve cranial nerve iii the vestibulocochlear nerve cranial nerve viii the glossopharyngeal nerve cranial nerve ix and the vagus nerve cranial nerve x examples of where this type of fibre functions include the pupillary sphinter via the oculomotor nerve glands of the nasaloral cavity via the vestibulocochlear and glossopharyngeal nerves and thoracicabdominal viscera via the vagus nerve gland innervation example brainstem —→ parasympathetic nuculi —→ parasympathetic ganglion —→ gland etc cranial nerves there are three main groups of cranial nerves special senses innervation of the head muscles and innervation of structures originating from branchial arches the special senses cranial nerves include the olfactory ocular and vestibulocochlear cranial nerves related to the innervation of the head muscles include the oculomotor trochlear abducens and the hypoglossal nerves cranial nerves related to innervation of structures originating from branchial arches include the trigeminal facial glossopharyngeal vagus and accessory nerves olfactory nerve iolfaction is part of the special senses cranial nerve group and represents the chemical senses of olfaction smell and gustation taste when chemical substances interact with our bodies they stimulate special sensory cells which in turn generate an action potential the resultant impulse is sent to the brain via sensory afferent fibres and it is these fibres that represent the olfactory cranial nerve note an action potential is only generated where a special sensory cell for that particular chemical substance exists if no sensory cell exists that chemical substance will go undetected the olfactory neurosensory cells are found within the olfactory epithelium the olfactory epithelium contains cilia on the surface of the cells to increase the surface area for chemical interactions the olfactory nerve runs to the olfactory bulb which is found within the telencephalon the olfactory nerve is a sensory nerve and is composed of many special visceral afferent fibres the fibres are formed into bundles that are referred to as olfactory filaments the olfactory nerve passes through the cribiform plate and is surrounded by meningeal sheets including the subarachnoid space therefore the route of the olfactory nerve represents a potential site for an infection to track towards the brain injury of this nerve can lead to anosmia or loss of smell the olfactory organ in dogs is extremely well developed and species such as canines use olfaction to orientate themselves in an environment in a way that humans do not olfactory cells are continuously replaced and are only viable sensory cells for between 30  60 days this point is of importance as this is the only area in which nerve cells are able to be replaced or regenerated in adult animals and this area is now under research at cambridge university for the treatment of damaged nerves andor nerve disorders in nerves other than those involved in olfaction optic nerve iithe optic nerve is part of the special senses cranial nerves and represents the connection between the receptor cells of the retina and the diencephalon the optic nerve is a sensory nerve and is composed of special somatic afferent fibres optic nerve axons pass from the optic disc of the retina to the brain entering the skull via the optic canal the majority of axons decussate at the optic chiasm before continuing as the optic tracts the optic nerve can be examined clinically via a menace response and anopsia loss of vision can be seen in injury oculomotor nerve iiithe oculomotor nerve is part of the group of cranial nerves responsible for innervating the muscles of the head the nerves originate from the ventral midbrain and is a motor nerve it is composed of

muscles of the eyeball the dorsal rectus medial rectus ventral rectus ventral oblique and levator of the upper eyelid the general visceral efferent fibres of the oculomotor nerve control the sphincter pupillae muscle alters pupillary diameter and the ciliaris muscle alters curvature of the lens the oculomotor nerve has a preganglionic nucleus in the midbrain and the nerve passes through the orbital fissure along with the trochlear abducens and opthalmic branch v1 of the trigeminal nerve it synapses in the ciliary ganglion of the eye during a clinical examination horizontal eye movements

composed of general somatic afferent fibres the maxillary nerve passes through the round foramen and the alar canal it also runs across the wall of the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the infraorbital canal via the maxillary foramen whilst in the infraorbital canal the maxillary nerve branch then branches further into the infraorbital nerve which supplies sensory fibres to the teeth on exiting the infraorbital canal via the infraorbital foramen the maxillary nerve branches again into the zygomatic nerve which supplies sensory fibres to the horn and to the pterygopalatine nerve supplying sensory fibres to the palate mandibular nerve v3the mandibular nerve is a mixed sensory general somatic afferent fibres and motor general somatic efferent nerves the mandibular nerve passes through the oval foramen it provides motor branches to the masticatory muscles the ventral throat and muscles of the palate the mandibular nerve further branches into the masticatory nerve the

number of intermediate branches which separate from the main facial nerve inside the facial canal including the greater petrosal nerve the stapedial nerve motor and the chorda tympani these then emerges via the stylomastoid foramen at the caudoventral aspect of the skull the chorda tympani of the facial nerve represents the special visceral afferent fibre supplying taste to the rostral 23 of the tongue there are also numerous external branches of the facial nerve once the facial nerve has left the facial canal these include the internal auricular nerve the auriculopalpebral nerve the rostral auricular nerve the palpebral nerve the dorsal buccolabial nerve the ventral buccolabial nerve the ramus colli the digastric nerve the stylohoid nerve and the caudal auricular nerve the facial nerve supplies motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression these are superficial flat thin muscles that originate from bony areas of fascia and then radiate out around the skin they may also often from sphincters such as around the mouth and eye during a clinical examination any facial paralysis drooling or abscence of blinking may indicate a problem with the facial nerve vestibulocochlear nerve viiithe vestibulocochlear nerve is part of the special senses group of cranial nerves and is made up of two components the vestibular nerve and the cochlear nerve the vestibular nerve is responsible for balance whilst the cochlear nerve is responsible for hearing the nerves send impulses from the inner ear which contains the vestibular apparatus and cochlea the vestibulocochlear nerve is a sensory nerve made up of special somatic afferent fibres it passes through the internal acoustic meatus and into the petrosal bone the facial nerve also takes this route

and vagus nerves that passes through the jugular foramen which is termed the vagus group the accessory nerve supplies structures related to the fourth branchial arch the accessory nerve has cell bodies that are referred to as nucleus ambiguus and originate in the medulla oblongata the cranial root of the accessory nerve actually contributes to the vagus nerve and to the striated muscles of the pharynx larynx palate and oesophagus however the accessory nerve also contributes to the cervical spinal cord and spinal root through the foramen magnum providing innervation to muscles of the neck the spinal root of the accessory nerve branches into the dorsal branch and the ventral branch the dorsal branch innervates the brachiocephalicus trapezius and omotransversarius muscles of the dorsal neck the ventral branch innervates the sternocephalicus muscle during clinical examination any difficulties in turning the neck or muscle atrophy around the dorsal and ventral neck may indicate
