hall of famer the late captain lou albano and luigi the late danny wells living in brooklyn where they would often be visited by a celebrity guest star either playing themselves or another character at mario brothers plumbing a basement workshop which doubled as their home the liveaction segment would be followed by a cartoon based on the super mario bros and super mario bros 2 video games where mario luigi princess toadstool peach and toad would battle against king koopa bowser throughout the many lands of the world often in a movie or historical parody mouser tryclyde fryguy and a single unnamed koopa troopa often worked closely with king koopa serving as his henchmen getting into the spirit of these parodies king koopa usually took on a varying alter ego he had a different outfit for each one and would take on a different alias to along with it for example in a riverboatthemed episode king koopa was captain koopa while in one of the westernthemed episodes he went by billy the koopa in many episodes king koopas minions would often dress up in outfits as well to go along with koopas themed costumes in some episodes king koopa would go without an alter ego nor wear a costume except for mario and the beanstalk jungle fever and mario of the apes the only episode where king koopa doesnt appear is love em and leave em wart the main antagonist of the second game was never in any of the episodes yet most of his minions managed to appear as members of the koopa pack like most 1980s cartoons king koopa would prolong the series run by escaping from his adversaries which he did through the use of magic potion  even though they could easily catch him the bathtub the basis of the storyline introduced at the beginning of every animated episode was that mario and luigi were working on a bathtub drain which unknowingly was a warp zone to the mushroom kingdom and mario and luigi had literally gone down the drain and ended up in the mushroom kingdom by sheer coincidence causing problems for king koopa and rescuing toad and princess toadstool now that they were rescued the focus for the mario brothers was to return to brooklyn while stopping king koopas tyranny whenever they could lou albano and danny wells also voiced mario and luigi for the animated segment it was never revealed whether their live action sequences were a prequel to the animated series or they successfully returned to brooklyn and resumed their duties in the plumbing business following the cartoon was the third portion of the episode which continued the story that the liveaction segment set up in the beginning towards the end the second part of the liveaction segment was interrupted with scenes from that weeks upcoming episode of the legend of zelda  the super mario bros cartoon was shown on mondays through thursdays only on fridays the show would air the legend of zelda cartoons based on the game of the same name however a mario liveaction segment would air with the zelda episodes on september 3 1990 the show changed its name to club mario replacing the liveaction mario segment with two completely different characters known as tommy treehugger and co m c with occasional appearances by tammy treehugger tommys twin sister and evil eric co m cs evil twin brother in another mario related television series king koopas kool kartoons framed portraits of the super mario bros super show versions of mario luigi toad and princess toadstool can be seen in various episodes broadcast history  editthe show lasted from 1989 to 1990 after di cs mario cartoons ended the show was aired in reruns on the family channel currently known as freeform the family channels reruns of the series removed the legend of zelda previews and the scenes that segued into them from the liveaction segments and slowed down the episodes to bring them back to their original length they also changed the placement of the commercial breaks placing them during scene dissolves in the animated segments curiously the family channel version of  king mario of cramalot  and  day of the orphan  is the version used in subsequent dvd and digital releases also from that point onward the song covers played during the cartoons chase scenes were removed and replaced them with instrumentals of songs featured in the adventures of super mario bros 3 and super mario world this was probably done for licensing reasons as the lyrics of the song covers are copyrighted from 1989 to 1991 kid klassics released ntsc vhs videos of the show these videos contained two one or no liveaction segments and featured the cartoon segments with their original song covers intact on these videos the super mario bros theme wasnt included before the cartoon segment the show was made available to watch from yahooligans tv starting in march 2004 with a new episode usually uploaded every week it was taken down along with all di c entertainment cartoons on december 24 2005 as of november 3 2009 it can be

based on preexisting properties dic entertainment approached nintendo with an offer to make a cartoon based on the mario franchise nintendo initially declined but later signed a deal after dic put together a creative team they liked 1 nintendo required dic to pay extensive royalties an unusual arrangement for children programming at the time according to danny wells him and costar lou albano recorded the show on a six days schedule where they would first film the liveaction segments and then drive to another studio in order to record voices for the animated segments in an interview about dics history in adapting video games to television dic executive robby london stated that video games such as super mario bros were dics favorite type of media to adapt because   the videogames themselves were colorful imaginative hip and more than a little bizarre – in the best sense and that their sparse lores and simple character allowed more creativity than when adapting material from other media 2 london also spoke positively of nintendos involvement in the show stating   nintendo was reasonable professional and good to deal with their america office seemed quite capable of speaking definitively on behalf of their japanese owners and i don’t remember any problematic disputes with nintendo  and contrasting it with dics more turbulent partnership with sega for its three sonic series 2  the series was a rating success and was widely syndicated 1 also according to wells the guest stars actively asked to be part of the liveaction segments due to the popularity of super mario bros with their children 1 however despite its success nintendo had little interest in continuing the show beyond the initial package leading to its cancellation staff  editmain article list of the super mario bros super show staff the super show was executive produced by andy heyward directed by dan riba and produced by john grusd who also produced and directed the two subsequent mario cartoons by dic animation was provided by sei young animation co ltd the liveaction sequences were coproduced with saban productions differences from the games  editseveral characters have very different appearances from what became their standard character models in later years mostly owing to being based on sprites andor character artwork from donkey kong super mario bros and super mario bros 2  king koopas appearance was loosely based on his sprite from super mario bros his main skin color is green instead of orangeyellow his ribbed stomach is deeper yellow than its game color he has a crocodilian snout that matches the rest of his skin in coloration he has two spikebands instead of five worn on his wrists only which are dark green with gold spikes instead of black with white spikes his shell has a bright green lining and fewer spikes than in the games his horn and spikerings are green like his skin he has a crown instead of a mane and no eyebrows his tongue is reptilian instead of humanlike and his eyes are yellow instead of white and lack their red irises princess toadstools model portrays her as a redhead instead of a blonde resembling her sprites from the first two super mario bros games she also lacks her gloves and crown jewels and her brooch earrings and eye color are green rather than blue mario and luigi have overalls matching their cap colors with blue shirts and also have black hair instead of brown along the lines of their early appearances in sprites and artwork toads appearance is based on his sprite from super mario bros with the waistcoat being red instead of blue in the first three episodes all instances of white and red in his appearance were inverted but this was fixed from the fourth episode onwards although his shoes were recolored purple instead of the red from the original sprite however toads original inverted color scheme was reused for his super form in the episode the fire of hercufleas and on vhs and dvd covers in several episodes birdos were shown to fly a trait not seen in any mario game rather than becoming fire mario unlike in the games mario or luigi would become super mario or super luigi upon touching either a fire flower starman or some other source of excessive power as super mario mario could hurl fireballs had superstrength and on a few rare occasions could even fly although mario could lose his powers by taking a hit similar to the 2d mario sidescrollers it was also possible for them to wear off after a while marios super form is based on his fire form sprites from super mario bros luigis variant of this form replaces the red with his defining color green this resembles what would be their standard fire form color schemes from super mario world onwards but with their shirt and overall colors swapped although marios eyes are the established blue luigis are green instead however their game color is used on the cover of the volume 1 dvd set trouters were portrayed as being far more vicious than they were in super mario bros 2 and would pursue anybody who came near them their appearance more closely resembles that of cheepcheeps and they may be only a merger of the two enemies differences from the other series  editthe voices of mario and luigi in this show most resembles the voice of them heard today whereas their voices in the adventures of super mario bros 3 and super mario world shows voiced by walker boone and tony rosato respectively was lower and raspier for mario and higher and raspier for luigi instead of mario having a higher pitched voice and luigi having a lower pitched voice like charles martinet does for the twos voices and he made neither of them any raspier than mario and luigis voice actors in this show this is the only dic show where there is a live action section there is the plumbers log whose number quote in every episode is a reference to the captains log quote from star trek quotes  editfor a full list of quotes see list of

scared and cautious was arguably first used in the super mario bros super show later this personality appeared in video games most notably in the mario  luigi series luigis mansion super mario galaxy
