introduction the definition of research impact impact measurement principles operational principles glossary research impact pathway table introduction the australian government recognises the importance of research science and innovation for increasing productivity and wellbeing to achieve long term economic growth for the australian community and to enable australia to engage effectively with current and future national and global challenges research is a key contributor to improving australia’s productivity over the longer term 1there is an increasing focus on showcasing or measuring the societal benefits from research and a need for better coordination in reporting and promoting the impact of these research outcomes this will become increasingly important in a tight fiscal government environment where returns on investment in research will need to be demonstrated in terms of environmental economic and social impact for these reasons and others key stakeholders including government industry and the community require more information on the benefits derived from investment in australian research activities a working group was established in 2012 to develop a common understanding of approaches terminology and reporting of research impact the following agencies established a working group to develop a common understanding of approaches terminology and reporting of research impact australian institute of aboriginal and torres strait islanders studies australian institute of marine science australian nuclear science and technology organisation australian research council commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation defence science and technology organisation national health and medical research council national measurement institute since august 2012 a number of meetings have been held with a focus on understanding current arrangements for planning monitoring and evaluating research impact within the above mentioned agencies demonstrating to key stakeholders government industry and community the return on investment from australian research activities both retrospective and prospective establishing a common understanding of the latest developments nationally and internationally in research impact assessment establishing a set of overarching principles and a common understanding of language that underpins the measurement of research impact and achieves a common use of terminology identifying possible common data requirements that can be used to verify research impact outcomes considering new data as measures of impact identifying cost effective and efficient methodologies for reporting sharing experiences in communication strategies to promote research impact to key stakeholders the following principles have been developed as the result of the meetings  topthe definition of research impact research impact is the contribution that research makes to the economy society environment or culture beyond the contribution to academic research  topimpact measurement principles the working group developed the following principles to underpin the measurement of research impact acknowledge that excellent research underpins impact promote understanding through use of common language and terms associated with research impact respect the diversity in research disciplinessectors in demonstrating research impact cooperate in developing a set of common cost effective and efficient parameters for data collection and reporting adopt a consultative approach with stakeholders in regards to implementing impact reporting in support of future research investments encourage recognise and reward positive behaviour in planning monitoring and evaluating research impact  topoperational principles these principles offer high level guidance on operational considerations for implementing the measures and reporting of research impact plan set early and clear expectations on research impact against which progress can be monitored develop capability to effectively collect data and undertake impact monitoring and evaluation identify appropriate data elements for effective assessment of research impact report set up reporting requirements that are appropriate to the scale of investment accommodate multidisciplinary and collaborative research through flexibly designed impact reporting appropriate for its intended outcomes assess utilise planned performance data elements and metrics to monitor and evaluate outcomes consider any learnings from retrospective case study analyses evaluations and reviews promote appreciate and value both intended and serendipitous research outcomes regularly communicate research impact to stakeholders be aware of whole of government agendas for example open access and open data topglossary consistent with the impact principles – the working group developed a glossary to assist with a common understanding of language that underpins the measurement of research impact pdf format 367kb  word format 29kb  topresearch impact pathway table the working group has developed the research impact pathway table which is consistent with the arc’s impact principles the table provides high level examples from the research pipeline and indicates where they would normally sit on the pathway to impact in developing your ‘impact statement’ in an arc grant application form you should consider examples or illustrations from your research plan representing all columns of the research impact pathway table please ensure your chosen examples that demonstrate both the expected outcomes and benefits over time are included in the statement research impact pathway table – pdf format 195kb – word format 23kb  top1 focusing
