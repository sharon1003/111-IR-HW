fragments and native american cliff dwellings day 1daily overview fly into albuquerque nm stay the night our recommendation is to get a rental car from the airport after paying for a taxi to a neighborhood car rental location along with the fact that many neighborhood locations are closed on sundays making drop off difficult the extra cost for the airport rental locations generally evens out for attractions in albuquerque we recommend the 27 mile sandia peak tramway  the ticket price is 20adult and between 12 and 17children based on age additionally albuquerque has numerous museums both covering native americans of the area as well as the science and childrens museum finally you can stroll through old town   hotel accommodations are quite numerous and diverse so choose what

will pass through roswell nm the central location to many of the ufo conspiracies despite your thoughts on the situation roswell makes for an interesting pit stop carlsbad caverns national park has one entrance and parking area visitors can go on the selfguided big room route or natural entrance route but we highly recommend the guided kings palace tour a 15 hour tour deep into the caverns tour fees are 8adult and 4children reservations can be made in advance and are strongly recommended there is only camping in carlsbad caverns national park so for other lodging we recommend whites city or driving back north to the town of carlsbad nm be sure to return to the cavern entrance before sunset for the overwhelming bat flight program each evening the rangers give a talk and then upwards of 400000 bats leave the cave entrance in search of their nightly meal it is by far one of the most memorable experiences of the entire trip day 3daily overview drive to las cruces or deming nm driving distance 321 mi driving time 5 hours 50 mins along the way guadalupe mountains national park white sands national monument leaving the carlsbad area drive south on hwy 62180 to guadalupe mountains visitor center unfortunately this is a long driving day and so a long hike in the park in not advised you can see some of the details on the park map   continue on to el paso tx a good location to stock up on supplies for the next few days drive north leaving el paso on hwy 213 until you reach us hwy 70 and turn right pay close attention from this point as you will be driving through the white sands missile range a highly restricted area it is around a 2 hour drive from el paso to the white sands national monument once at white sands we recommend the dune life nature trail and the interdune boardwalk the hiking trails can be found on the park map   due to the restricted nature of the surrounding area there is no lodging near white sands so drive back south on hwy 70 to las cruces nm based on your plans for the day and the time spent at guadalupe mountains you may want to continue on to deming or even silver city for lodging day 4daily overview drive to petrified forest national park driving distance 284 mi driving time 5 hours 29 mins along the way gila national forest from silver city you can take route 15 an hour north to gila cliff dwellings national monument but these are similar to the much larger dwellings at mesa verde so we recommend skipping that side trip instead we recommend driving through gila national forest in the national forest take the cat walk rd to the catwalk national recreation trail a 1 mile metal walkway through the creek bed surrounding it continuing north on hwy 180 for 4 hours will take you to petrified forest rd into the petrified forest national park in addition to the largest collection of petrified wood in the country the park is home to badlands of the painted desert and historic structures we recommend giant logs long logs newspaper rock and the painted desert area to the north of the park consult the park map  for details there is no camping or accommodations in the park so we recommend finding lodging in nearby holbrook winslow or even gallup nm which is along our route for day 5 day 5daily overview drive to mesa verde national park driving distance 233 mi driving time 4 hours 20 mins along the way four corners national monument for day 5 we recommend a detour on the way to mesa verde to stop at four corners monument though not a natural wonder it is an interesting location where you can be in four us states at one time from shiprock nm take hwy 64 to hwy 160 in teec nos pos az the monument is just off of hwy 160 after a short stopoff continue on to mesa verde national park mesa verde is location of the ancient pueblo indians cliff dwellings dating back almost 700 years all tours of the dwellings are guided and cost 3person however tour reservations must be made in person the day of the tour so plan accordingly as tours fill up quickly you can see the locations of the different tours the park map   there are many lodging options within the park but we recommend making the reservations well ahead of time based on availability you may want to find accommodations closest to the cliff tour that you plan on taking day 6daily overview to start off day 6 we highly recommend driving one hour east to durango co the durango  silverton narrow gauge railroad  offers a unique experience of a traditional steam locomotive taking you high into the san juan national forest however adult tickets are 83 and children are 49 so travelers on a budget may have to see our alterative suggestion below the trains leave quite early from durango so be sure to have a reservation far in advance and to make your way to durango early on day 6 the trains take you up to silverton co and back arriving in durango late in the evening you could drive to black canyon of the gunnison national park but the road there is windy and is not recommended for after the sun sets instead we suggest staying the evening in durango and driving the next day alternative suggestion for those who choose not to take the railroad trip we propose two alternatives first you can stay a second day in mesa verde and tour additional cliff dwellings and spend a second evening in mesa verde alternatively you may drive from durango to silverton rather than taking the railroad though the views are not quite as majestic from there continue on to black canyon of the gunnison national park for the night of day 6 day 7daily overview drive to black canyon of the gunnison national park driving distance 165 mi driving time 3 hours 30 mins black canyon of the gunnison is a narrow deep canyon created by river erosion over millions of years we recommend visiting the south rim of the park due to its proximity to lodging as you can see on the park map   there are many overlooks in the park we recommend stopping at them all there are some hikes near the visitor center that are recommended if time allows there is camping in the park but no other lodging so nearby montrose will offer some accommodation options day 8daily overview drive to pikes peak co driving distance 233 mi driving time 4 hours 27 mins the drive towards colorado springs passes over some of the prettiest mountain regions in all of north america from colorado springs we recommend making your way to pike peak a 14110 mountain there are two ways to reach the top we recommend the cog railway  to the top it runs multiple times per
