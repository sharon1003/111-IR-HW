1230tavon young temple 446 9 345 1180source nflcom if there was any question whether ramsey was a topfive talent in this years nfl draft he all but erased it with a very strong showing at the combine his vertical and broad jumps were elite and he ran a very strong 441 40yarddash so much about ramsey was impressive before the combine of course like the fact he was the first freshman to start at corner for florida state since deion sanders or hes versatile enough to be dominant at corner or safety mike mayock regularly compared him to arizona cardinals star corner patrick peterson during the nfl networks broadcast of the combine charley casserly of nflcom feels ramsey is actually more fluid than peterson coming out of college and would be a top10 to topfive pick in any draft while adding he remains ahead of hargreaves in the cornerback rankings though the florida star was a bit more impressive in the drills matt miller of bleacher report took aim at one of ramseys perceived weaknesses meanwhile matt miller  nfldraftscout i dont get the is ramsey only a press cb talk i mean isnt that what we all want right now is a topathlete press cb2016229 183832ramseys combine may have even catapulted him into discussions about being the top overall pick or at least it should as miller noted matt miller  nfldraftscout in an nfl that is so much about matchups and being able to take away the pass jalen ramsey should get 1 pick consideration2016229 162934hargreaves meanwhile did nothing but bolster his status as a likely top10 pick mayock is certainly a fan of his per the nfl network

cleveland browns star corner joe haden adding hargreaves is the better pure corner cover coming out of college than haden was that pair is head and shoulders above the rest of this secondary class though the defensive backs are a deep group at this draft a few players likely helped themselves climb up the board a bit with strong showings on monday including auburns jonathan jones and texas ams

breaking down biggest nfl qb controversies all eyes were on bosa early on sunday and the topfive talent offered solid results running a decent 486 40yard dash and putting up 24 reps on the bench press those were strong numbers for the 65 and 269pound bosa though it wasnt exactly what the ohio state star was looking for in his testing per bill landis of clevelandcom bill landis  bill landis25joey bosa tells nfl networks kim jones hes unhappy with 40 times thought hed run in 47s for 46s bosa will also do some lb work today2016228 150326he certainly shined in the drills portion of the combine

today the nfl networks mike mayock said during the combine broadcast per college football 247 matt miller of bleacher report compared nkemdiche to bosa meanwhile matt miller  nfldraftscout nkemdiche outweighs bosa by 25 pounds and ran the same 40 time2016228 163923on physical talent alone nkemdiche might be a topfive talent but the fact that he has offfield concerns and has a questionable motor could potentially drop him out of the first round altogether which albert breer of nflcom speculated would happen emmanuel ogbah of oklahoma state turned some heads running a 463 40yard dash and perhaps solidifying his place in the first round bleacher reports luke easterling broke down the dilemma many nfl teams may have while scouting ogbah luke easterling  luke easterling ogbah was flying

checked off all of the boxes he needed to on sunday he came into the combine longer and heavier than expected measuring at 65 and 244 pounds both numbers were positives for floyd who many pundits feared would be too slender coming into the league his added size didnt hurt him however as he posted a very solid 460 40yard dash those positivesâ€”combined with his ability to generate a pass rush off the edgeâ€”make him a very intriguing prospect per steve palazzolo of pro football focus steve palazzolo  pffsteve leonard floyd anthony barrlike conversion or pure edge rusher very interesting prospect2016228 191615regardless floyd certainly helped himself on sunday and should be a firstround selection the two top talents at the position meanwhile didnt run jaylon smiths knee issues kept him from participating in the combine and could even drop him out of the first round smith believes hell recover without issue however everything will be fine he told miller recovery process has taken off we know ill be 100 percent again only a matter of whenmiller is certainly high on the former notre dame star matt miller  nfldraftscout five years at br 10 years of doing this before that jaylon smith is one of my favorite prospects alltime2016228 185108matt miller  nfldraftscout i know you guys dont like this but we really have to wait and see how rehab and medical rechecks go with jaylon smith tycen the tiger2016228 190726jack meanwhile expects to be fully cleared by doctors before his march 12 pro day per pro football talk that didnt stop him from benching a solid 19 reps on sunday however how smith and jack are viewed once they clear their medicals will have a major impact on both the first round and linebacker position in general smith was once considered as high as potentially a topfive talent while jack was considered a top15 pick and a player who could certainly sneak into the first 10 picks if teams have concerns about their health however both will drop and

selection prospects in that position often skip some or all of the combine drills on the premise they could do more harm than good to their draft stock the cal product explained his decision to participate in everything to mike florio of pro football talk ill do it all goff said ill throw and ill do it all i think its the right thing to do ive got nothing to hide go out there and throw and

nflcombine httpstcol kxq gf9w4b2016227 142256goff is going to do far more important things over the next couple months than running 40 yards in a straight line that said as the saying goes its all about checking the boxes during the draft process he also did well during the passing drills yes theres only so much information to yield for throwing against air in workout clothes but the one word to describe his effort would be smooth everything flows nicely when he throws the football nathan zegura of browns daily liked what he witnessed nathan zegura  nathan zegura goff impressive in person so natural and so fluid when throwing the ball everything quick precise and in rhythm tight spiral too2016227 155934while goff shined during the first group of quarterbacks penn states christian

pro qb2016227 162137combine throws arent going to totally make or break his stock and hes still got a chance to turn things around at his pro day and during individual meetings with teams that said it wouldnt be a surprise to see him slip a bit in the rankings at this stage goffs success in the first group put a little added pressure on wentz he responded with a crisp showing of his own and his mechanics really stood out since hes coming out of north dakota state there are more questions for him to answer than a typical powerprogram quarterback but the simplicity of his drop back especially on the fivestep drop was a lot cleaner than most of his counterparts todd mc shay of espn pointed out he also threw the ball quite well todd mc shay  mc shay13carson wentz really impressing with timing and ball placement2016227 184243unfortunately cardale jones didnt get a chance to put his arm talent on display alongside the top options he came up lame at the end of his second 40yard dash attempt with a hamstring problem per sports center and sat out the passing drills pro football talk used the setback to discuss the process pro football talk  pro football talk cardale jones injury is another reason why the top prospects should simply say after their last college game see you at the draft 2016227 173353beyond that nobody else really stood out michigan states connor cook and memphis paxton lynch who are among the second tier of options both had average showings wentz may leave indianapolis with a slight edge over goff but theres no clear winner either way both guys handled themselves well and performed at the level youd expect without any defenders trying to hunt them down their battle will probably go right down to the wire wide receivers2016 nfl scouting combine wr
