answers are voted up and rise to the top how deals surface pro 3 with hd monitorsup vote4down votefavorite ive seen some videos on youtube where the surface pro 3 is connected on 4k monitors and it is working pretty good i do not know very much about 4k technology and how the intel hd graphics processor deals with such resolution but i have a dell ultrasharp u2711  2560x1440  and my current laptop lenovo idea pad z580 cannot support such resolution via hdmi channel just 1920x1080 currently im using vga channel as it supports its best 2048x1152 im disappointed on that but is my problem as i did not consult someone before buying the monitor so my question is will the surface pro 3 support the native resolution of dell u2711 already by using the mini display port also if anyone knows a solution to setup the monitor native resolution on my idea pad z580 ive checked google but all say that this is a graphic card problem  in my case hd4000  thank youresolution microsoftsurfaceproshare

ramhound sep 8 14 at 2121answering your question about your idea pad youll unable to get 2560x1440 on your display via hdmi it is a restriction of the display itself ancient hdmi version resolution this high is available via dvi or display port only for this dell – translucent cloud sep 16 14 at 1501thank you as i understand there is the problem with the hdmi version ive tested on a mac book pro with retina via hdmi channel and same problem up to 19201080 and it was interesting for me because the mac book pro has retina so thats why i thought that may be because of the hdmi channel –

edit on the wikipedia slightly rephrased in a single external display mode over display port the i5 and i7based models support resolutions up to 3840×2160 at 60 hz known as 4k ultra hd so yes its possible to connect your 2560×144060 hz dell display to your surface pro 3 via mini display port youll need either mini display port — display port or mini display port — dvid dl cable or suitable
