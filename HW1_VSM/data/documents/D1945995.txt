only a streamwinner prior to the buddha’s death however buddha said that the purity of his heart was so great that should ananda die without being fully liberated he would be king of the gods seven times because of the purity of his heart or be king of the indian subcontinent seven times but ananda will experience final liberation in this very life  an 380prior to the first buddhist council it was proposed that ananda not be permitted to attend on the grounds that he was not yet an arahant according to legend this prompted ananda to focus his efforts on the attainment of nibbana and he was
