atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia avnrt is the most common type of reentrant supraventricular tachycardia svt the substrate for avnrt is the presence of dual av nodal pathways see etiology  1 2because of the abrupt onset and termination of the reentrant svt the nonspecific term paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or even the misleading term paroxysmal atrial tachycardia pat has been used to refer to these tachyarrhythmias with improved knowledge of the electrophysiology of reentrant svt greater specificity in nomenclature based on the mechanism of reentry has been possible such improved classification aids in the choice of appropriate therapies see etiology prognosis treatment and medication avnrt is usually well tolerated often occurring in patients with no structural heart disease  3 see prognosis presentation and workup patient education patients should be instructed on vagal maneuvers valsalva diving reflex these are used to try to terminate an episode of avnrt patients with hemodynamic compromise or syncope should be instructed on avoiding activities that could be dangerous to them or to others eg driving swimming while the risk of an episode remains ablation obviates the need for longterm restriction for patient education information see the heart health center as well as supraventricular tachycardia svt psvt etiology the substrate for atrioventricular av nodal reentry tachycardia avnrt is anatomic avnrt occurs in young healthy patients but also in those with chronic heart disease in patients with avnr two pathways connect into the av node and help form part of the reentrant circuit  4 in the majority of patients with avnrt antegrade conduction occurs over the slow pathway and retrograde conduction occurs over the fast pathway during avnrt see the image below electrophysiologic mechanism of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia avnrt view media gallery in most patients with avnrt the tachycardia is initiated when an atrial premature complex is blocked in the fast pathway but can conduct via the slow pathway although many patients may have a dual pathway physiology for avnrt to occur the fast pathway must have a longer refractory period antegrade than the slow conducting pathway in approximately 10 of patients avnrt is induced by premature ventricular stimulation in addition to the typical mechanism of av nodal reentry described above atypical av nodal reentry can occur in the opposite direction with antegrade conduction in the fast pathway and retrograde conduction in the slow pathway less commonly the reentrant circuit can be over 2 slow pathways the socalled slowslow av nodal reentry see the images below atypical atrioventricular nodal av reentry tachycardia often an inverted p wave is seen just before the qrs complex in leads ii iii a vf this represents activation of the posterior septum due to antegrade conduction via the fast pathway and retrograde conduction via the slow pathway of the av node view media gallery typical atrioventricular nodal av reentry tachycardia in this electrocardiogram the p wave appears immediately after or just within the qrs complex often a “pseudo r wave is seen in lead v1 and a “pseudo s wave in leads ii iii a vf the retrograde p wave represents retrograde activation via the fast pathway which is anterior septal and superior to the av node view media gallery epidemiology in the united states atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia avnrt occurs in 60 of patients with a female predominance presenting with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia svt the other major types being bypassmediated tachycardias and atrial tachycardias the prevalence of svt in the general population is likely several cases per thousand persons internationally the occurrence of avnrt is similar to that in the united states avnrt may occur in persons of any age it is common in young adults but some patients do not present until their seventh or eighth decade or later prognosis the prognosis for patients with atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia avnrt is usually good in the absence of structural heart disease most patients respond acutely to vagal maneuvers or adenosine and long term to medications to prevent recurrence or to radiofrequency ablation which is approximately 95 curative and has a low risk of complications it is the preferred method of treatment for most patients in a study of 109 adults with congenital heart disease and avnrt who underwent catheter ablation investigators noted differences in outcomes between patients with simple congenital heart disease and those with complex congenital heart disease  5 overall avnrt complicated the course of all these patients but at 32 years followup outcomes were more favorable for those with simple congenital heart disease 100 than in individuals with complex congenital heart disease 86  5complications of avnrt include hemodynamic compromise congestive heart failure syncope tachycardiainduced angina cardiomyopathy myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction clinical presentation overview presentation ddx workup treatment guidelines medication media
