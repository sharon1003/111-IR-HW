any chunk of meat is a roast if it is a loin roast you dont want to cook it much past 145° because it is a very lean cut of meat and it will dry out quickly above that temp if it was a butt picnic or shoulder roast of whatever size you would cook it to maybe 195° or higher to make it tender enough to pull these cuts have lots of internal fat and connective tissue that makes them tough otherwise you need to cook them until the tough stuff breaks down chuck
