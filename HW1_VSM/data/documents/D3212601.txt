expressing interest in having his own comedy television show like seinfeld 7 lopez was only willing to do a show if it meant that the roles were not demeaning to latinos vowing never to play a murderer drug dealer or gang member 7 with an absence of tv deals he continued to perform standup through the 1990s and into the 2000s 7 in august 2000 after being given one of lopezs comedy albums to listen to actress sandra bullock saw lopez perform live at the brea improv comedy club 8 bullock had been interested in developing a tv show with a latino storyline being concerned about the lack of visibility for latinos on american television 8 bullock approached lopez backstage after the show and made her pitch to produce and star in a situational comedy centered around the comedian 9though bullock had connections through hollywood the george lopez show was not an easy sell 10 bullock sought the help of bruce helford who created the drew carey show and had been a head writer for roseanne  and due to his history with abc on those shows became a cocreator and executive producer of lopezs show 10 bullock helford and two of the shows other executive producers met with abc executives later that month and the network tested the show with 4 episodes before committing to 13 episodes the following fall and eventually adding an additional 9 9 10 lopez was given full starring creator producer and writer credits for the show 9 the george lopez show was seen as an attempt from abc to diversify their programming while still appealing to the widest possible audience 9 abc executives were hopeful that lopezs humor and relatability would draw a large family audience focusing on marketing the series as much as possible 9 the network bought promotional time for the show on spanishlanguage networks and took out fullpage ads in some magazines 9lopez drew much of the material for the show from his own life experiences especially his upbringing in the san fernando valley 9 upon the series debut lopez became one of the few latinos to star in a television comedy series following in the footsteps of desi arnaz freddie prinze and john leguizamo casting  editfor the first five seasons the show had an alllatino cast with the exception of albanian american actress masiela lusha who played georges daughter carmen during the shows fifth season aimee garcia was cast as georges niece veronica music  editthe shows theme song is  low rider  performed by war the theme plays in the opening credits and was present when the show aired on abc as well as syndication but was replaced in the dvd releases of all seasons except 1 episode due to licensing costs at the 9th alma awards in 2007 george lopez called the song the  chicano national anthem cancellation  editthe series finale aired on may 8 2007 after the show was canceled by abc 11 according to lopez abc primetime entertainment president steve mc pherson called him over the weekend and explained that the network would lose money if the show was picked up again and that it wasnt doing well financially 12 lopez stated that the explanation was painful to hear noting that the show had four different time slots in only five years and had to constantly compete against shows like american idol yet the final season of the show was still able to outperform two comedy series that were renewed by abc notes from the underbelly and the knights of prosperity lopez said that abc dealt with us from the bottom of the deck and that it was hard to take after what was a good run 12lopez attributed the cancellation in part to the fact that the show was not produced directly by abc studios but instead by warner bros television 12 lopez also criticized abcs decision to approve the show cavemen being perplexed at the circumstances so a chicano cant be on tv but a caveman can according to lopez 170 staff members who worked on the show lost their jobs lopez explained that he took the five years of good and i did a lot with the good my popularity i was involved in charities i overcame my illness all on tv i shared all of that with america – every secret i had every emotion everything was open to the show and what happens 12 in spite of the cancellation nightly episode reruns continue to air on various networks both in the united states and abroad see the syndication section below on september 2 2016
