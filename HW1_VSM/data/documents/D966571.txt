dna is transcribed by enzymes in our cells into m rna these m rna messenger rna are a similar sequence of nucleotides the rnas are then translated by a ribosome into a sequence of amino acids into a polypeptide or protein but yes dna carries information and rna is the way to get that information put into a functional form drew · 1 decade ago1 0 comment dna abbreviation of deoxyribonucleic acid organic chemical of complex molecular structure that is found in all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and in many viruses dna codes genetic information for the transmission of inherited traits rna abbreviation of ribonucleic acid complex compound of high molecular weight that functions in cellular protein synthesis and replaces dna deoxyribonucleic acid as a carrier of genetic codes in some viruses rna consists of ribose nucleotides in strands of varying lengths the structure varies from helical to uncoiled strands one type transfer rna t rna sometimes called soluble or activator rna contains fewer than 100 nucleotide units other types contain thousands of units the nitrogenous bases in rna are adenine guanine cytosine and uracilneethu · 1 decade ago0 0 comment dna is the carrier

dna usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes the set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of dna arranged into 46 chromosomes 62 the information carried by dna is held in the sequence of pieces of dna called genes transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing for example in transcription when a cell uses the information in a gene the dna sequence is copied into a complementary rna sequence through the attraction between the dna and the correct rna nucleotides usually this rna copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation which depends on the same interaction between rna nucleotides alternatively a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called dna replication the details of these functions are covered in other articles here we focus on the interactions between dna and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome genome structure further information cell nucleus chromatin chromosome gene noncoding dna genomic dna is located in the cell nucleus of eukaryotes as well as small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts in prokaryotes the dna is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid 63 the genetic information in a genome is held within genes a gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of dna that influences a particular characteristic in an organism genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed as well as regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers which control the expression of the open reading frame in many species only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein for example only about 15 of the human genome consists of proteincoding exons with over 50 of human dna consisting of noncoding repetitive sequences 64 the reasons for the presence of so much noncoding dna in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size or cvalue among species represent a longstanding puzzle known as the cvalue enigma 65 however dna sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional noncoding rna molecules which are involved in the regulation of gene expression 66 t7 rna polymerase blue producing a m rna green from a dna template orange 67some noncoding dna sequences play structural roles in chromosomes telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes 42 68 an abundant form of noncoding dna in humans are pseudogenes which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation 69 these sequences are usually just molecular fossils although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence 70 transcription and translation further information genetic code transcription genetics protein biosynthesis a gene is a sequence of dna that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism within a gene the sequence of bases along a dna strand defines a messenger rna sequence which then defines a protein sequence the relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the aminoacid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation known collectively as the genetic code the genetic code consists of threeletter words called codons formed from a sequence of three nucleotides eg act cag ttt in transcription the codons of a gene are copied into messenger rna by rna polymerase this rna copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the rna sequence by basepairing the messenger rna to transfer rna which carries amino acids since there are 4 bases in 3letter combinations there are 64 possible codons 43 combinations these encode the twenty standard amino acids giving most amino acids more than one possible codon there are also three stop or nonsense codons signifying the end of the coding region these are the taa tga and tag codons dna replication the double helix is unwound by a helicase and topoisomerase next one dna polymerase produces the leading strand copy another dna polymerase binds to the lagging strand this enzyme makes discontinuous segments called okazaki fragments before dna ligase joins them together replication further information dna replication cell division is essential for an organism to grow but when a cell divides it must replicate the dna in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent the doublestranded structure of dna provides a simple mechanism for dna replication here the two strands are separated and then each strands complementary dna sequence is recreated by an enzyme called dna polymerase this enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand as dna polymerases can only extend a dna strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix 71 in this way the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its dna rna biological roles messenger rna m rna main article messenger rna messenger rna is rna that carries information from dna to the ribosome sites of protein synthesis in the cell in eukaryotic cells once m rna has been transcribed from dna it is processed before being exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form with the help of t rna in prokaryotic cells which have not partition into nucleus and cytoplasm compartments m rna can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from dna after a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides usually with the assistance of ribonucleases transfer rna t rna main article transfer rna transfer rna is a small rna chain of about 7495 nucleotides that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation it has sites for aminoacid attachment and an anticodon region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger rna chain through hydrogen bonding it is a type of noncoding rna ribosomal rna r rna main article ribosomal rna ribosomal rna is the catalytic component of the ribosomes the protein synthetic factories in the cell eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different r rna molecules 18s 58s 28s and 5s r rna three of the r rna molecules are synthesized in the nucleolus and one is synthesized elsewhere r rna molecules are extremely abundant and make up at least 80 of the rna molecules found in a typical eukaryotic cell in the cytoplasm ribosomal rna and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome the ribosome binds m rna and carries out protein synthesis several ribosomes may be attached to a single m rna at any time noncoding rna main article noncoding rna rna genes sometimes referred to as noncoding rna or small rna are genes that encode rna that is not translated into a protein the most prominent examples of rna genes are transfer rna t rna and ribosomal rna r rna both of which are involved in the process of translation however since the late 1990s many new rna genes have been found and thus rna genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought in the late 1990s and early 2000 there has been persistent evidence of more complex transcription occurring in mammalian cells and possibly others this could point towards a more widespread use of rna in biology particularly in gene regulation a particular class of noncoding rna micro rna has been found in many metazoans from caenorhabditis elegans to homo sapiens and clearly plays an important role in regulating other genes first proposed in 2004 by rassoulzadegan and published in nature 2006 2 rna is implicated as being part of the germline if confirmed this result would significantly alter the present understanding of genetics and lead to many questions on dnarna roles and interactions catalytic rna main article ribozyme although rna contains only four bases in comparison to the twentyodd amino acids commonly found in proteins certain rnas are still able to catalyse chemical reactions these include cutting and ligating other rna molecules and also the catalysis of peptide bond formation in the ribosome doublestranded rna doublestranded rna or ds rna is rna with two complementary strands similar to the dna found in all higher cells ds rna forms the genetic material of some viruses in eukaryotes it acts as a trigger to initiate the process of rna interference and is present as an intermediate step in the formation of si rnas small interfering rnas si rnas are often confused with mi rnas si rnas are doublestranded whereas mi rnas are singlestranded although initially single stranded there are regions of intramolecular association causing hairpin structures in premi rnas immature mi rnas very recently ds rna has been found to induce gene expression at transcriptional level a phenomenon named small rna induced gene activation rnaa such ds rna is called small activating rna sa rna source shttpenwikipediaorgwikidna httpenwikipediaorgwikirna sigmund m · 1 decade ago2 1 comment maybe you would like to learn more about one of these
