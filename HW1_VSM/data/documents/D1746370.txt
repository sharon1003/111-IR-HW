heart mother and also high hopes is kind of a hit4more repliesspiderferi30 dec 2017 246am although i dont like the division bell at all i did like it a long time ago but not anymore but calling high

animals anymore it makes me so fucking sad and depressed its so real it hurts especially if youre living in the third world2d3r3k5235 jan 424am who called it shit and also it wouldve been the last song overall of pink floyd if not for the endless river so2toma40019 jan 155am it was called hit not shit but at first i read it as spiderferi so just sayin5stupid genius19 jan 108am animals loses a lot of plays for me because i tend to listen to raving and droolingyouve gotta be crazy almost as much  if not more than dogssheep even when i do listen to dogssheep it tends to be off the animal
