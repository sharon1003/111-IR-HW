dominant mutations wilson white history of the wilson white the wilson white was the first of the chinchilla mutations to appear in captivity the first to be born was on the blythe wilson ranch hence wilson white in redding california in 1955 edn050  young wilson white female this animal was not an albino where there is no pigmentation so pink ears and eyes with purely white fur as had been bred before but was a patchy white and standard animal with dark standardesque ears and eyes this chinchilla had white belly fur akin to a standard animal and also an agouti fur type where the standard fur was showing in patches when bred this animal proved fertile and bred both whites and standards with its mates which were naturally all standards genetics of the wilson white when bred to standards wilson whites are found to be a dominant mutation meaning that a mating of a wilson white to a standard gives 50 wilson whites and 50 standards where ww  homozygous wilson white  nonviable where ww  heterozygous wilson white where ww  standard punnet square for wilson white x standard w ww ww  wilson white ww  standardw ww  wilson white ww  standard wilson white chinchillas come in a variety of pattinations each with their own name but are basically chinchillas which have a basis of being standardgrey in colour showing the usual dark ears and eyes of a standard with some or all of the fur and hair on their body white this means that wilson white chinchillas can be bred in a variety of pattinations but are all principally of the same mutation edn051  young wilson white male the differing pattinations possible makes the wilson white an incomplete dominant mutation since the whiteness is incomplete in most cases and when paired to a standard animal the wilson white will produce 50 standards and 50 wilson whites the white gene effectively suppresses the standardgrey colour of the animal but does not do this entirely when breeding a dominant mutation in the case of the tower beige a homozygous form or double beige genes is able to be bred but in the wilson whites it is thought that there is a lethal factor linked to the double gene or homozygous wilson white which prevents it being viable this is thought to be the case since no wilson white has ever been proven to be homozygous for white meaning that all kits produced off a homozygous wilson white would be heterozygous wilson white with this in mind pairing wilson whites together is not recommended although i have yet to see any evidence to prove the diagnosis of a lethal gene punnet square for wilson white x wilson white w w w ww  homozygous wilson white  nonviable ww  wilson whitew ww  wilson white ww  standard breeding wilson whites when breeding wilson whites all of the usual show qualities should be looked for but in particular clarity blueness and fur strength should be paramount a wilson white without a clearblue colour or with slightly softish fur will not win good awards at uk shows therefore these attributes should be born in mind when trying to breed a quality wilson white there is no favour given to any one of the differing pattinations but they are achieved by breeding selectively in a variety of different ways since mosaics are the most common form of the wilson white it would be unusual to specifically breed for them so instead i shall comment on how to breed silvers and pure whites there are three distinct names given to wilson whites depending on their pattination these aremosaic  a patchwork of white silver and standard fur this is the most common form of the wilson white unusual mosaics can occur where you get predominantly white or standard chinchillas with a saddle or spots of standard or white fur silver  a predominantly white chinchilla with an even distribution of standard tipping andor guard hair showing silvers tend to be bred from specific wilson white lines with a preponderance to throw silvers but the veiling can be improved by breeding them with very evenly veiled standards silvers can also be bred from pure whites crossed with standards of very even veiling coverage with particularly long guard hair pure white  a purewhite animal with no standard guard hair or fur colour showing a quite rare chinchilla when breeding pure whites you must choose standards with very short or visibly no guard hair and even veiling coverage with a shallow tipping to them  principally a wellveiled medium standardour personal preference is to select clear blue strongly furred standards to breed to our edn051  young wilson white male wilson whites we do not favour any particular pattination preferring to choose standards with plenty of long guard hairs not so long as to detract from the overall appearance of the chinchilla but long enough to protrude above the fur of the standard which aides the strength of the white fur in doing this we tend to breed wilson whites which resemble silversmosaics which have silkystrong standup fur quality and which are blue and clear we do not feel a need to pair wilson whites to each other since their tendency for slightly soft fur means using top quality standards is a must and the presence of a possible lethal factor also dissuades us exhibiting wilson whites when looking to exhibit wilson whites all the usual attributes of a show quality chinchilla should be looked for but there are two specific points which judges pay special attention to 1 wilson whites have a tendency to have soft fur which tends to lie back poor quality wilson whites also have fur faults such as split grotzens look like a parting in the fur as that made my a comb and swirls look like rosettes in the fur 2 wilson whites should show no yellowness or creaminess to their fur  the judges are looking for what they refer to as persil white named after a brand of washing powder which makes white washing slightly bluewhite in appearance no favour is given to the pattination of the wilson white in its class so in this respect the veiling term is neglected in the judging of wilson white chinchillas special care should be taken of white chinchillas that they are kept in the cleanest of conditions since any dirtiness or muddiness in their coat would penalise them on the show table this of course applies to all of your potential show animals  cleanliness is next to godliness when it comes to showing your chinchillas combinations of mutations including wilson whites the wilson white being an established mutation to breed has been used to create many different blends of colour combinations some of which are listed belowclick on the links to see pictures where available in our mutation combinations section of this website combination known as in ukknown as in usdescription of the combination seen on uk show tables beige  wilson white pink white pink white or starlight pink whites are a peachy creamy white version of a wilson white with the beiges ear and eye colouration and white belly fur where the standard fur would show on a wilson white you see the beige fur instead you see many variations in pattination akin to the wilson white except the beige veiling gene seems strong so often you see quite evenly veiled pinkwhites compared to wilson whites pink whites should still show a blueness to their fur although a creaminess is often difficult to breed out often black velvet  wilson white blackwhite cross tov white blackwhite crosses are basically a wilson white with the exception that instead of seeing standard guard hair and fur coming through the white you see black velvet guard hair and fur they tend to be shown in classes of wilson whites since they usually strongly resemble wilson whites unless they are of an extreme mosaic pattination seldom beige

examples started to be bred but generally poor fur quality and unless the veiling extended into the belly fur would be judged as a wilson white or a blackwhite cross not seen top
