the interbus was developed by the company phoenix contact the specification has been popular since 1987 and interbus components are available from over 200 manufacturers interbus is a fast universal and open sensoractuator bus system with one master and several slaves data transmission rate and expansion of the bus are independent of one and other the gross data transmission rate is 500k bits the net data transmission rate is 300k bits for special applications with fiberoptic cable data transmission rates of 2mbits are possible the number of users is limited to 512 structure an interbus system conforms to a ring structure a compact strand following one direction in the system is used for the bus connection beginning at the master plc or ipc the bus system connects the respective control or computer systems to the peripheral input and output modules the main line of the system is called the remote bus and bridges distances up to 128 km between peripheral stations from the remote bus branch lines are possible these branches can be either be an installation remote bus or a local bus the data transfer is done using the “shift register with sum framework protocol” in a data cycle all data is shifted through the ring characteristics transmission technology standard rs 485 eight core cable because of the ring structure loop twocore cable modulated signal on supply voltage lwl fibre optic cables baud rates interbus s up to 500 k baud loop2 up to 500 k baud interbus lwl up to 2 mbaud participantsmaximum 512loop max 63 per bus clamp cable length interbus s up to 128 km remote busloop max 200m per loop 20 m between participants interbus lwl max 40 m between participants without signal processing fraba encoder with interbusinterface the absolute rotary encoder is a remote bus user the individual users are connected by an installation remote bus cable this cable carries both the bus line coming from the master and the return line the connection between the rotary encoder and the bus is made by two 9 pin connectors male and female an address assignment is not necessary since the address of the individual users is given by their physical position on the bus projecting and parameterization can for example be done with the interbus cmd software or with pc works encoder profiles three profiles are regulated by the user group encom to ensure smooth data transfer between terminals of different manufacturers profile k1 not programmable 16 bit process data profile k2 not programmable 32 bit process data profile k3 programmable 32 bit process data fraba rotary encoders can be delivered in k1 k2 and k3 interbus loop 2 to connect single sensors and actuators in an economical way a transmission technology adapted for various common operating conditions was developed this is called interbus loop the interbus loop connects terminals to a ring with a simple twocore unshielded cable using these two cores data information and voltage supply are delivered simultaneously the data communication takes place in the form of load independent current signals by this method the interbus loop becomes so interferenceproof that a shielded cable is not necessary the coupling of the interbus loop to the interbus remote bus is made by a special bus clamp 63 interbus loop participants can be connected per bus clamp the successor of the interbus loop the interbus loop 2 contains an integrated report and diagnostic manager and enables a larger distance between the users in the loop the max distance between the individual terminals is 20 m the max loop length 200 m interbus lwl for applications demanding for high noise immunity or high data transmission rates fiberoptic cables are available as an alternative to the conventional transmitting media the supi 3 opc optical protocol chip is used for these demands it enables a distance diagnosis and optical power adjustment for lwl transmitters the fibre optical cable can be easily connected to an existing interbus network with a bus clamp advantages of this system are high noise immunity and also data transmission rates of up to 2 mbits
