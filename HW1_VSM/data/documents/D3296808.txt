how to bridge the gap between snomed ct and icd10 cmposted on 072215for a clinician in a busy clinical environment the primary focus is on patient care the objective of meaningful use is of course to facilitate efficient and effective patient care but complex problems of integration sometimes posed by ehrs can slow things down if not managed appropriately and can even create the opposite of the efficient patient care setting that everyone—patients clinicians administrators—wants for example in the case of snomed ct and icd10cm we’re required to document problems and diagnoses in two very different languages translating between standards is not a new requirement health language has created an effective solution to carry out this translation and bridge the gap between these two quite different taxonomies this leads to increased efficiency at the point of care and prevents the domino effect of billing problems due to imprecise or inaccurate coding that can tax clinical resources using the nlm maps the national library of medicine has provided some maps from snomed ct source concepts to icd10cm health language has expanded these maps in several ways to facilitate their implementation in the emr for example the coding attributes that are required to select a billable icd10cm codes are easily accesses information about the side of the body on which a condition occurs laterality information about the type of encounter with the patient in the case of pregnancies information about trimester in addition hl has added many clinical attributes that distinguish between the icd10cm codes to facilitate choosing the best code to describe in more detail the patient’s condition for example information about the chronicity of a condition heart failure can be acute or chronic disease process – such as heart failure severity – eg moderate mild or severe asthma causative agent such as asthma due to drugs chemicals pollen dust etc it is easy to see how the addition of these icd10cm attributes can really assist in selecting the best codes to speed and improve the documentation process delivering the added specificity a provider needs the health language snomed ct to icd10 maps with the coding and clinical attributes let the provider select the extra options needed to generate the correct icd10 code for the precise condition described during the clinical interaction the additional map choices presented in the health language snomed ct to icd10 maps have been identified by seasoned coding experts as the choices most likely to yield the correct icd10 code these expanded options gleaned from the handson experience of professionals add more than just another tier of choices—they add a touch of human awareness and insight to an ehr integration that can otherwise feel hopelessly limited in its vocabulary in short health language snomed ct to icd10 maps bridge the gap between snomed ct and icd10cm with this complicated and potentially frustrating step out of the way the health care provider can focus on what’s important—providing excellent care what has your experience been with mapping snomed ct interactions to icd10 codes tweet topics icd10  snomed ctabout the author dr brian levy md is vice president and chief medical officer with health language part of wolters kluwer health he holds an md and bs from the university of michigan go blue
