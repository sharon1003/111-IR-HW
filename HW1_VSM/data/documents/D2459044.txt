faqs are free vpns safe if you unblock content in a country where it is illegal such as vietnam – and the authorities find out – you could go to prison that is why it is important not to go for an untrusted vpn that is bad for privacy in certain places using a worldclass premium vpn will protect you completely but free vpns must be evaluated on a case by case basis some free vpns are only good for unblocking content at times when there are very few risks and when privacy isn’t an overruling concern  hotspot shield for example other free vpns can be used for unblocking and for privacy because they provide a limited and restricted free service as an advertisement  loss leader for the full vpn on the whole it is true that a very high percentage of free vpns do not provide good privacy in fact the only free vpns that do provide good privacy tend to be ones that are highly restrictive and are only there to entice users into buying a premium subscription free vpn for torrenting  p2p file sharingwhen it comes to file sharing on p2p networks you will need a vpn that allows a lot of bandwidth unlimited data for downloading and strong privacy for covering your tracks the reality is that you will not find this on the market if you want to torrent securely using a vpn – a cheap vpn or a vpn for torrenting will be your only real optionsi phone and android if you’re looking for a free vpn app for android or a free vpn for i os free vpn for i phone then you are in the right place the free vpns in this article work on both platforms simply follow the links in this article to get access to the free vpn app download however please remember that any free i os vpn or free android vpn will be very limited and could even put you at risk mac and windows the recommended free vpns in this article all provide vpn software for windows pcs laptops and mac computers if you only require limited use of a vpn then one of the private but restrictive vpns in this guide are an option if privacy is not important to you but you want 500mb of unblocking every day hotspot shield is an option however if you require privacy and unlimited vpn use you will need to pay for a vpn for mac or a vpn for windows free vpn for netflix usmany people only want a vpn to unblock foreign netflix catalogs sadly even most paid vpns do not unblock netflix anymore for this reason you will need a very specific premium vpn to watch netflix us a free vpn for netflix is not an option but a money back guarantee will let you use netflix us for freefree vpn for chromebook it is possible to install some android apk files on chromebook for this reason you may be able to use an android free vpn client on your chromebook if this is not possible you may need to configure the vpn manually sadly it is possible that you will need a premium vpn for chromebook free vpn for kodi streaming free content on kodi can be a lot of fun but is better done in privacy in addition to watch a lot of streaming video content on a kodi device you will require unlimited vpn downloads and bandwidth the free vpns in this guide may let you get a feel for what using a vpn for kodi is all about but you will never get to watch much content because of the free vpn limitations to watch a lot of extra tv for free on kodi invest in a premium vpn free vpn for china vpns are now banned in china and are being blocked by isps and the government this makes it hard to get – and risky to use – a free vpn in china a vpn for china needs a lot of advanced features so we strongly recommend sticking to a paid service free vpn for usif you want a vpn in the us to stop your isp collecting data about you and selling it to third parties then a free vpn is not going to be suitable hotspot shield will hide your traffic from your isp but they will also provide data to third parties and advertisers that they are affiliated with this just gives your data to a different firm to sell on any of the vpns in this guide will work in the us but if you require watertight privacy and unlimited data usage you will need to get either a cheap vpn or a top of the range vpn for usa free vpn for ukanybody looking for a free vpn in the uk will be fine with any of the services in this article however if unlimited usage or strong privacy are needed you must take care about which vpn you select hotspot shield free will provide 500 mb of use per day but it will not provide strong privacy for anybody that wants an unlimited use vpn that provides watertight privacy please consider a vpn for uk or a cheap vpn free vpn for canada using a free vpn in canada is an option but if unlimited use or robust privacy is a concern – we urge you to go for a premium vpn for canada free vpns conclusion in this article we’ve described everything you might need to know about using a free virtual private network these free services have a lot to offer our top vpn provides 500 mb of downloads use per day – but is not good for privacy the others provide privacy but are restrictive because of bandwidth limits and download limits most free vpns make a profit from their subscribers by harvesting their web browsing habits to sell to third parties this is exactly the opposite of what a vpn should do if you require a real vpn that provides privacy and unlimited use your best option is to pay for a cheap vpn if you want something a bit better then consider a vpn for a specific use of your choosing all of the vpns in this article are free and each offers varying levels of services so please look at the summaries carefully to understand more about hotspot shield and who may or may not want to use it  please read this article in its entirety each vpn in this guide provides slightly different features and restrictions on its free service so please take a good look at the provider summaries in order to make the best decision for your needs finally remember that these services are free – so if you want to use all of them go right aheadlike it share itwritten by istvan kiss published on march 21 2018 i am a hungarian tech writer with an interest and passion for vpn technology i enjoy long walks in

third parties usually advertisers these cowboy vpn services must never be used for privacy – which is what most people want a vpn for ”then you proceed to rank the vpn that was caught selling user data to advertisers as 1 is that a joke or they just have a sweet affiliate program probably the latter reply douglas crawford verifiedapril 4 2018 at 849 am hi harambewe have affiliate programs with almost all vpns on the market so it doesn’t really matter to us which one you choose when it comes to free vpns we simply don’t think that privacy is a reasonable expectation but hotspot shield is good for streaming and wi fi security and it is known for unblocking content in restrictive countries ray adds“the article does mention that hotspot shield should only be used for those things and does mention the criticism it has come under and links to resources about those criticisms which is why there are 4 other options for people that don’t want hs so its got nothing to do with affiliate programs its got to do with the fact that it is found to be useful for free by many people but isnt for everyone which is why this is explained in detail and other options provided”reply buddy march 30 2018 at 1018 pm i have a neighbor who pays something like 5 dollars a month for a vpn he is very pleased with it does minor stock trading i only want to get local and world news on my computer i am not certain i need a vpn to do this but news was mentioned in this article so i guess i need a vpn to do that i am not concerned so much with privacy as with the ability to do what i want to do with my computer i am guessing the “hotspot” vpn would be my best option i just want to know if i am thinking in the right direction reply douglas crawford verifiedapril 3 2018 at 741 am hi buddyyou do not need a vpn just to access local and world news unless international news is censored where you are but i’m guessing this is not the case to get a clearer idea of what a vpn can and cannot do you i recommend taking the time to read vpns for beginners – what you need to know reply timchangmarch 27 2018 at 120 pmi need the app to go through i have one but it’s slow in browsing the name is slowdns comreply douglas crawford verifiedmarch 28 2018 at 736 am hi timchangthe vpns listed in this article all have apps for i os and android reply ian march 7 2018 at 315 pm hi douglas i’ve tried 2 out of the 5 listed here and was sad my personal favorite windscribe wasn’t featured many of the above are good and while most offer great services personally they don’t seem to add up to the overall performance windscribe offers anyway do you update your top pick review would be nice to see a company that many seem to support on your list great review though and a good eye opener for newbies looking to find the right vpn for themselves reply douglas crawford verifiedmarch 8 2018 at 846 am hi ianwindscribe is a good vpn and yes we do update these 5 best lists fairly regularly the picks are a team decision which weigh up many factors and are very definitely aware of windscribe reply topher march 17 2018 at 148 am ian my personal favorite is windscribe too i’m a fan of the larger gb cap on the free vpn side plus i love kicking my work computer into high gear on the weekends and mine monero with my cpu for points to up my cap or earn pro status for a month i highly recommend it from mining i’m already up to 25gb a month… more than enough for my needs reply andi april 2 2018 at 135 pm windscribecom is far more expensive at least twice as much as all of the above listed vpn services they have very limited number of servers only 1 in the us based on their website httpswindscribecomupgrade  i tried their servers they are very slow connected to the u s germany greece and israel reply windscribe verifiedapril 3 2018 at 120 pmandi – what you’re saying is not true we have servers in over 30 us cities httpswindscribecomstatus as for price you have it the other way around 1 listed company is 2x the cost of windscribe which costs the same as tunnelbear hideme is also more expensive than windscribe reply arthur march 2 2018 at 600 pm why tell lies none of the vpn sevices are free they merely offer a free trial with limited facilities reply douglas crawford verifiedmarch 5 2018 at 841 am hi arthuri must admit to getting very of answering this service these services all offer a free tier yes it these are limited in the hope that you pay for a full vpn service although there are no time limits running a vpn is expensive and time consuming so genuinely free and unlimited vpns simply do not exist any that claim otherwise are scams – they will spy on you and sell you data steal your bandwidth or just infect you malware such as bitcoin miners at least these services are honest reply ivy february 27 2018 at 411 pm hi i’m a windscribe user and think it’s great and was a bit shocked not to see it on your list would you consider it as one of the top 10 and what would you say it’s overall features and services are like compared to those you’ve listed i’m interested to see the difference and was wondering if you’ve done a separate review on it appreciate any inforeply douglas crawford verifiedfebruary 28 2018 at 908 am hi ivyyes – we have a full windscribe review in which it scores very well it is a great service both free and premium tiers reply jjfebruary 15 2018 at 302 pm hi everyone what about windscribe did you consider them as one of the top vpn’s as i’ve seen a lot of great reviews and am also a long term customer of theirs who has always been impressed with their services and the overal product would be interestinf to hear your take on their vpn thanksreply douglas crawford verifiedfebruary 16 2018 at 836 am hi jjwindscribe is a very good vpn with an excellent free service reply sky january 29 2018 at 1059 pmin your review of the proton vpn you gave it rave reviews…that were almost completely false they only limit the number of server locations to three nations if you like myself don’t wanna pay however this causes the connections to be too slow for p2p so they do not allow it…unless of course you do wanna pay then you can torrent all day while pretending to be in any country on earth…somehow i forget that advertisements are disguised as reviews by authors such as mandee who will never appreciate how good she is at wasting my time well done mandee keep up the good work reply douglas crawford verifiedjanuary 30 2018 at 916 am hi skyi must admit that during my proton vpn review i did not test torrent speeds for the free service as i explicitly stated the review was primarily for the paidfor service but i ran some speed tests on the free service anyway and was impressed by them but did not test p2p i will take your word for it that p2p is slow using proton’s free service but i’m pretty sure it is not banned as such mandee is new with us and we are working with her to make her content more objective best vpncom prides itself on the objectivity of our content reply chris january 10 2018 at 801 am vpn were not designed just so you can bypass certain limitations and “surf” the net freely a virtual private network was meant to be just that a network of pcs that are not linked on a network in the traditional way but by creating a network where there isnt actually one so that business can operate from virtually anywhere it has now become a toy for teenagers and very seldom do you actually find vpn software that can set up and maintain an actual network of machines reply douglas crawford verifiedjanuary 10 2018 at 849 am hi chrisvpns were indeed originally developed in order to provide remote workers secure access to corporate lan networks so thus effectively creating virtual lans but so what the technology is very useful for many things – and one of them is accessioning the web unrestricted this is why the burgeoning commercial vpn industry exists if you want to find out more

used lol adware does selling datas logs windscribe is better… wtf who is that retard who listed hotspot shield mentally retarded reply douglas crawford verifiedjanuary 8 2018 at 926 am hi pagewindcribe has asked us not to feature its service on our free page so we have respected its wishes reply ajit january 4 2018 at 1248 pm very deceptive page protovon vpn does not offer “fast connections” and “no limitations” httpsprotonvpncompricing clearly says “speed low” and i can confirm this they throttle the connections so even through you have unlimited bandwidth good luck using more than a few gigs i tried all the other suggestions and theyre all either slow or offer no bandwidth at all 500mbmonth is useless after some googling i found windscribe which is not even listed here with a voucher code you get 50gb of data reply douglas crawford verifiedjanuary 4 2018 at 120 pm hi ajitplease see the speed test results for our proton vpn review i recorded 60 mbps on my 80 mbps connection downlaod although not quite as fast as the premium service we found proton vpn free to me faster than many other premium vpns and by far the fastest free vpn we have ever tested by “no limitations” ray is referring to the fact that there are no data limits whatsoever on proton vpn’s free service and no p2p restrictions either replyhou january 7 2018 at 845 amtry cyberghost vpn reply jeff bowyer december 31 2017 at 604 am hotspot shield takes forever to install hotspot shield takes forever to uninstall why did i uninstall it because its “free” version is only a 7day trial wow–somebody still actually offers limited trial versions my only complaint with your article…why did you bury deep in your article the huge red flags about the dodgy practices of hotspot shield’s parent company for that matter given your section “why you should stay away from betternet and hotspot shield” why did you even include hotspot shield in your list of “5 best free vpns” now i’m worrying about what crap it might have left on my computer reply ray walsh january 4 2018 at 1034 am hi jeff “red flags” about anchor free are not “buried” as you suggest for free the service is good and the targetted advertising is simply a way that it and many free vpns use to create a revenue stream the vast majority of the free vpns that we recommend do not permit unlimited use – hotspot shield does – which is why we have at times recommended it in 5th position as a free vpn it does serve a purpose which i explain in depth here the review of hotspot shield primarily deals with the paid “premium” version of hotspot shield that version does not suffer from the same targetted advertising as the free version which is why the review only mentions the advertising in the free part of the review here at best vpncom we have been very clear about hotspot shield’s service at all stages even in the best free vpn article the hotspot shield summary clearly specifies “although hotspot shield has come under some criticism for serving adverts we think that for free this vpn is pretty amazing why not give it a try” this along with the transparent review and previously mentioned article very clearly represent the truth about hotspot shield while i am sorry if you got confused i don’t feel that we did anything but explain the fact that hotspot shield free version does serve adverts to its users other than this you really have nothing to worry about as long as you properly uninstall hotspot shield after using it – you really should have no problems going forward it does not contain any malware that will remain on your machine reply dorcy december 29 2017 at 922 am i stumbled upon your website for the first time a couple hours ago i really enjoy reading your articles and your style keeps me interested while very informative i will be a long time fan keep up the good work thanks reply max slain december 27 2017 at 1143 am you’ve listed the only con of hide me as “limited to 2gb per month” and one of the pros of zoog vpn as “2gb per month” sic for consistency do you consider 2gb per month a pro or con assuming it’s a pro this suggests that there are no cons to hideme which seems unlikely it’s inability to get into popular streaming services such as netflix the bbc and abc for example could be a showstopper for many people reply ray walsh december 29 2017 at 1034 am right you are i have updated the article for consistency 2gb for free is a pro because it is good that you get something for free – and this does apply to any secure vpn that lets you sample the service for free but being limited to just 2gb a month which isn’t a terribly huge amount of free use is a con in the end it is subjective as to whether you think getting just 2gb per month better than nothing is more of a pro or a con as for not being able to use netflix the article does explain that free vpns don’t tend to do the things that a premium vpn will do replyglenn kyle december 25 2017 at 146 am this article’s bullshit you’ve got to pay for them all don’t bother reply douglas crawford verifieddecember 28 2017 at 930 am hi glennsigh please see my answer to klsnabvn below reply ray walsh december 29 2017 at 1050 am absolute twaddle the article is accurate – did you actually read it or use any of the 5 free vpns all of the vpns have a free service and a paid premium service

is not part of the list – we do have bills to pay have a free tier yes it is limited but that is what you get for going free although proton vpn is pretty darn good even on its free tier replyglenn

limitations but what do you expect from a free service tunnel bear for example allows you to use 500mb per day for free reply walter october 18 2017 at 220 pm it says that the vpn places are free on this site yet everyone i looked at wants a monthly payment after the trial period that ain’t free in my book and hints of possible false advertising needless to say i won’t be going to any listed on this site reply douglas crawford verifiedoctober 19 2017 at 801 am hi walterplease note that express vpn is a promotion and is not part of the free list all the others do offer a genuinely free service these are necessarily limited in various ways however as the only way an honest provider can afford to run a free service is in the hope you will upgrade to a premium plan if you read the provider descriptions we clearly explain what those limits are reply janice delane october 13 2017 at 109 pm thank you for providing such detailed valuable information the info on below express vpn offers a 49 discount if you sign up today however when i went to the site it offers only a 35 discount on a year subscription why the discrepency reply douglas crawford verifiedoctober 16 2017 at 900

protection because i fell prey of online harrassment i had been using cyberghost but i was told it’s not safe nor secure in fact i noticed that when i was using it my browser history was filled with pages i never clicked on and never opened also my youtube history was filled with videos i never clicked on and never watched i got upset again why that happens with cyberghost what does it give away that happens so what’s the best vpn i can use for free thanks reply douglas crawford verifiedoctober 5 2017 at 848 am hi elenacyber ghost free does open ads on your browser so i’m guessing this is what you are seeing unfortunately most free vpns are either very limited or you are paying in some other way running a vpn costs money and noone is doing it purely out of the goodness of their hearts the basic lesson here is that you really should pay for a decent vpn service reply stephanie october 1 2017 at 707 pm if these are all supposed to be free then why is every last one of them asking me for payment before i’m allowed to use them reply douglas crawford verifiedoctober 3 2017 at 954 am hi stephanieexcept for express vpn which is clearly marked as a sponsored post and is not free all these vpns provide a free if somewhat limited service no payment is required you may be getting a little confused because most of them also offer superior premium services which is how they can afford to offer a free service…reply wendy reichelderfer september 20 2017 at 752 pm hello i write for a friend of mine in barbados if she were to use a vpn would there be a problem in allowing her to use pandora thanks god bless you for all you doreply douglas crawford verifiedseptember 21 2017 at 810 am hi wendyyes – a vpn should should fine for pandora – even the android app worked fine for pandora last time i tested it as always though do take full advantage of any free trials or money back guarantees to check your chosen service vpn works without issue with any services you want to access reply killerof liars september 13 2017 at 756 am your number one pick is not secure according to tunnelbear’s license agreement they make no warranty or guarantee that your data will be private or secure their website describes the program as a means to security but if you read the fine print they have no faith in their own program reply douglas crawford verifiedseptember 13 2017 at 917 am hi killerof liarsi have just skimmed through tunnelbear’s privacy policy and it looks pretty sound to me ie no login timestamps no logs etc can you please pinpoint the clause that is worrying you replyzalt57august 10 2017 at 540 am thank you for this article i have a question i live in canada and i will be travelling to china will these vpns work in the great firewall reply ray walsh august 11 2017 at 840 am vpns in china have become highly restricted and as you mention there is the great firewall to contend with in addition it is worth bearing in mind that apple has removed a lot of vpns from the app store sadly i can’t promise that the free vpns mentioned will work in china for a vpn to definitely work in china you should get one with “stealth mode” this is special vpn tech that disguises your vpn traffic as regular traffic so that it isn’t affected by the firewall please look at our best vpns for china article for more help reply rick august 3 2017 at 103 pm i use vpnfacile

paidfor service but do take advantage of any free trials or money back guarantees before in order to ensure everything is working for you however… i have just tied to visit the website you mention and it appears to be completely down if this is the case then a vpn won’t help reply silje nielsen may 13 2017 at 430 am hey i know it’s out of topic but i’ve been using hide me free web proxy for some reasons like omegle for months it worked great but these days i can’t even access that site it says error while connecting to server or i can’t even click the start a new chat button please help thanks reply douglas crawford verifiedmay 15 2017 at 836 am hi siljea problem with web proxies is that they are poor at handling complicated webpage layouts and tend to fall flat when encountering things such flash java and java script scripts although this not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to security it may be that omegle has changed its website design in a way that a web proxy cannot handle this should not be a problem if you use a vpn instead reply dani may 12 2017 at 1121 am hello  i live in spain and wish to unblock bbc i player  can i do this with a free vpn  thanks reply

think people really need to work on the definition of “free” in the case of most vpns i’ve tried free seems to mean “our service will be extraordinarily slow or have extremely limited data unless you upgrade to premium” that is not what free is not supposed to mean reply douglas crawford verifiedapril 6 2017 at 821 am hi jackthere is no such thing as a free lunch running a vpn service is a very costly and timeconsuming affair in other words it is a business vpns that offer a free limited service in the hope that you will upgrade to a premium plan as you describe are at least honest about how they monetize their “free” service those that offer an unlimited service for no money must be profiting somehow like hola they could be selling your bandwidth or they could be selling your data to advertisers an alarming number of “free” vpns will infect your device with malware or perform all sorts of other malicious behavior reply baba march 6 2017 at 616 ami like the virtual private network

article explains free vpns do exist but they are eithera very limited and exist in the hope that you will upgrade to a paidfor premium version of the service on the plus side these vpns tend at least to be at honest and transparent about how they can afford to offer a free service all the above services fall into this category or…b dishonest many “free” vpns monetize their service by stealing your data selling bandwidth infesting your mobile devices with malware etc the simple fact is that running a vpn service is an expensive business and noone is going to do it for free if you are having problems paying for a service because you are based in india then many vpn services accept payment in bitcoin or store cards which can be purchased online from places such as e bay mullvad will even accept cash sent by postit may just be the way in which you have worded the question but just to make it clear using a vpn will not provide you with free internet reply james february 6 2017 at 234 am

provider just asked what model router i have and then instantly detected my exact street address from their web site this is of course for emergency service 911 but i was surprised at how easily this was done i’m sure they needed help from my isp but what does the isp do if anything to verify that such a query is from a legitimate ip telephony service who has me as a customer by the way something which i would consider to be of practical value would be to be able to select a vpn server that is in my own time zone some web sites are time sensitive a while back i was experimenting with tor and facebook among other sites i noticed that facebook was showing me ads for sleep medication i thought that was odd because all advertising on facebook is targeted why do they think i need sleep meds a few weeks later it dawned on me that the answer was right in front of me i made a practice of going to ipillioncom first to verify that tor was working ipillion is a site which displays the location of your ip address on a map it was fun to see that i appeared to be coming from romania then south korea finland california… since these places are in all different time zones it appeared to facebook as though i had been awake at all different times of the day and night i am not trying to hide illegal activity like you noted a vpn service is probably not good enough for that what i would like to do is make things much more difficult for data brokers who may then sell data to anyone including federal state local and foreign governments i think using a vpn does create some expectation of privacy at least here in the us that is important in a legal sense even if it is still technically possible to spy on vpn users with the help of service providers reply douglas crawford verifieddecember 5 2016 at 1006 am hi jamesyikes i can see why that experience has made you interested in vpns please see my vpns for beginners guide for an indepth discussion on what a vpn can and cannot do to improve your online privacy most vpn services run servers from locations all over the word so it is usually very easy to select one that is in your time zone replyred november 24 2016 at

threat but beware reply douglas crawford verifiednovember 30 2016 at 1038 am hi redvypr vpn does not permit torrenting and like every vpn company it is obliged to respond to a legal dmca complaints many vpn companies stonewall these by the simple expedient of using shared ips and not keeping usage logs so they can claim an inability to comply with the demand this is unfortunately not the case with vipr vpn but it was behaving perfectly legally and did not “sell” your data please see 5 best vpns for torrenting p2p filesharing for a more complete discussion on the subject reply psyint zfebruary 16 2017 at 1052 am please do not go around calling legitimate companies a “scam” simply because you didn’t read the eula before signing up for a service then completely ignored it you got yourself into that trouble red vyper had nothing to do with it now accept your punishment like a man and then learn how to read things especially eula and tos before you randomly click those checkboxes from now on to put it in simple terms you literally broke the law and breached the service agreement that you signed checked and then you threatened to sue them over your own wrongdoing the reason they aren’t replying to you is because they’re too busy laughing at you reply karthikeyan november 23 2016 at 1007 am why cyberghost vpn removed from this list i think cyberghost best free

effective and there is less lag as dns translation is pretty much instantaneous although the distance you internet signal must travel remains a factor it may well be a better solution for you than

deal with random hackers and the film industry just taking all your research as they please and than acting like they own the story there should be more antimalware companies that are certified that support vpn so you know they will take your privacy serious and not lie or just try to gain extra money on the side if you think none of these vpn companies have any it security certificates nobody has investigated them as being legit and your not only paying them given them your details but your data reply douglas crawford verifieddecember 22 2016 at 919 am hi breanayou have clearly had a bad experience but express vpn is a reputable vpn company and definitely did not hack into your computer and steal information from it perhaps these “mocking comments” on facebook were genuine expressions

suffering from a continually high level of cluster packet loss on my connections often right up to 100 – does your encrypted connection essentially die when this happens for a while now their support have told me that this is down to the smaller size of some of their servers combined i guess with numbers of users on a particular server at any given time – again i’d be grateful if anyone in the

premium users there is also talk of cyber ghost installing a root certificate on users computers along with its software this a very dodgy thing to do as it effectively gives access to your entire computer as long as you are connected to a vpn server the connection will be encrypted i am a little surprised at the problems you are having with express vpn as i have always found its performance to be excellent reply chris august 12 2017 at 358 pm their manchester servers are painfully slow no matter which one you are connected to the speed always seems to be 5mbit or less on 200mbit but a handful of the london ones gave me my full 200mbit… i only used it briefly as i normally use newshostings vpn service that comes with their newsgroup access package newshosting is far superior reply visitor01september 7 2016 at 630 pm does any of these programms allow torrenting reply douglas crawford verifiedseptember 8 2016 at 835 am hi visitor01most free vpns including all of the above do not permit torrenting i recently reviewed betternet however which does allow torrenting on its free service which also offers unlimited data reply bobb anderson august 30 2016 at 858 pm hi guys please who knows about “just free vpn” jus wanna give a trial can somebody tell me how safe or harmful it could be reply douglas crawford verifiedaugust 31 2016 at 905 am hi bobbi’m afraid that i know nothing about this service perhaps our readers can help replyjawed khan august 30 2016 at 320 pmgood reply alan turing august 28 2016 at 137 am i am using cyberghost vpn and although i can choose my ip country the dns server is always a british server based in manchester to be honest i don’t trust a dns server based in a 5 eyes country what’s your opinion about this is it a dangerous thing or not reply douglas crawford verifiedaugust 30 2016 at 1200 pm hi alanthe dns server should always match the country of your ip address i also agree that the uk is not a good country for anything to be based when it comes to security are you based in the uk if so then you are probably suffering a dns leak unlike many providers cyber ghost does not include dns leak protection as a feature of its software reply alan turing august 31 2016 at 913 am no i’m a spaniard living in spain i have done the ip leak test several times and it’s ok but my only concern is that the dns server is always the manchester one i told you in my first post so for example if i choose a danish ip and i run the test it shows a ip from denmark but it also shows this british server as dns server quite weird in my opinion reply douglas crawford verifiedaugust 31 2016 at 925 am hi alanhmm that is weird and i have never heard of this happening before – as i say the dns address should match the ip location or else the vpn is useless for geospoofing purposes maybe using just one dns server located in manchester is a way for cyber ghost to cut its overheads for free users if you are a fee user have you tried contacting cyber hhost about this issue reply alan turing august 31 2016 at 244 pm hi douglasyes i’m a free user i just talked to cyber ghost support agent via chat and they told me that they have 3 dns servers one in new york one in germany and this one in manchester he also said that the app chooses the server automatically and that it can be changed to one of their there servers if the os allows you to do so so since my ipad doesn’t allow me to change the dns server in a vpn conection there is nothing i can do about it he was very nice but i keep thinking this whole thing is strange douglas crawford verifiedaugust 31 2016 at 309 pm hi alanthanks getting back to me on this yes it is very strange and is not something i have encountered before aside from any worries about gchq accessing your browsing history through cyber ghost’s uk dns server even fairly basic dns detection will prevent users from geospoofing to other countries do you know if it is only free users that are affected by this issue or paid users also alan turing august 31 2016 at 649 pm no i don’t know if paid users are also affected by this thing as i said i’m just a free user who downloaded the cyber ghost app for i os a couple of days ago after reading your excellent article douglas crawford verifiedseptember 1 2016 at 835 am hi alanthanks for all the info you have provided when i have a moment i may chase this up myself helen august 24 2016 at 1135 pm good reply payfor vpnplzbetterservicebitcoinsladz august 21 2016 at 339 pmpay for a vpn you free tightarses – you’ll get alot better experience

site is such a good site found it not so long ago keep it up and cool…… cheers m8replyfitfiot august 8 2016 at 1208 pmwindscribe is not a good option yet  has not the required features  try it does not mean that in case of a real threat it could better than another vpn provider this comparison is never given nowhere reply windscribe verifiedaugust 10 2016 at 142 am hi what features are we lacking we aim to improve so let us know maybe its already in the works replyfiufit august 10 2016 at 413 pm hi what features are we lacking we aim to improve so let us know maybe its already in the works as desktopuser my opinion is that it should be better if these features were improved  – vpn  tor orand tor  vpn it is it yet implemented – vpn  personal password  personal login it is it yet implemented – a linux version must be proposed it is it yet implemented – a free version without the registration be necessary it is it yet implemented – the servers must be not compromised and closed if it is the case it is it yet implemented  it should be nice if something should appear on the screen alert us that the server is under surveysizedcompromised or under attack but i suppose it is impossible to know it – at least 1 nolog server for the free version it is it yet implemented – vpn  game on line it is it yet implemented very difficult without lagjit – a comparison between the different vpn provider and an independent audit about their security  which it works on ubuntumint or smartphone can fail on debian or on a blackberrysony i know that windscribe is a professional  active team thx reply anon noob august 16 2016 at 942 pm well even paid no log vpn servers still in a way do keep logs all vpn companies does keep logs of users one way or another in a way they could all rent us out to govt nsa etc or given large sum of money by companies ps trace the ip of the location you choose and lookup ip addy or dns see their hosting sites and go to their site and check out their privacy policy they sometimes do keep logs even if the vpn provider says they don’t they buy or rent servers and so on douglas crawford verifiedaugust 17 2016 at 816 am hi anon noobwell companies such as air vpn claim that all logs are sent direct to a null file of course a vpn company can choose or be forced to start logging at any time and can always monitor communications in realtime third party hosting providers are an issue but remember that all vpn traffic remains encrypted and most hosting provider collect only aggregate data only the company running the vpn server instance ie the vpn provider will be able to monitor the ip each incoming connection it is also worth noting that a few vpn companies operate their own baremetal servers and therefore have complete control over their networks james december 4 2016 at 248 am when you are talking about the hosting provider being an issue do you mean a situation where for example the owner of the physical location of the servers is aware that a particular server is providing vpn service and they have a firewall which is protecting their network then they can monitor traffic in and out of the vpn by looking at firewall logs gale jenness july 31 2016 at 833 pm i’m not sure about these vpns are they better or worse i don’t care for government or hackers getting into my data but at the same point how do i know some vpn couldn’t take my data too i also hate anything i install on my computer that won’t completely uninstall if i’m not happy with it getting some of these programs off your computer completely is a nightmare often you need other uninstall programs to get them completely deleted your review puts total vpn at the top yet there seems to be so many complaints that i’m afraid to even give it a try will this cause me more problems then it’s going to solve i wish there was clear answers to what’s safe and honest to usereply douglas crawford verifiedaugust 2 2016 at 1132 am hi galemost vpn software uninstalls just fine free vpn providers need to profit somehow and at least the ones listed here are transparent about how they do so – less scrupulous ones will just sell your data which is why we strongly recommend choosing a paidfor service as to total vpn – yup we have received many complaints but it provides the most “unlimited” free service that we know of you pays your money or not in this case and takes your chances we are however monitoring the total vpn situation carefully reply craig july 22 2016 at 1040 am i run web root secure anywhere real time shield it’s interesting that when visiting httpswwwtotalvpncom and httpwwwcyberghostvpncomenus i get this suspicious attack ahead webroot has blocked access to the website you tried to open it has been reported to contain suspicious content it’s as if the sites are designated as suspicious by “the powers to be” to discourage potential customers or maybe the sites have been impregnated with malware by “big brother” reply douglas crawford verifiedjuly 25 2016 at 814 am hi craigi don’t use web root secure anywhere which makes it difficult to comment fwiw i believe cyber gost to be a 100 reputable company but we have received a lot of complaints about toltal vpn…reply alexander november 5 2016 at 951 am could you repeat that for other vpn providers also  it would be interesting to know if something changes when visiting windscribe or any other  replyrashi december 21 2016 at 830 pm i wonder who alexander is 2 years and all these references online alex alexander none of these vpn are encrypted and it would be amazing to see a “professional” vpn service for businesses that need just privacy not downloads or file share reply douglas crawford verifieddecember 22 2016 at 924 am hi rashiall of these vpns are encrypted in fact if the connection is not encrypted then its not a vpn the p stands for private you may like to check out our article on 5 best business vpn services replyantonio july 20 2016 at 1247 pm it is impossible to remove total vpn the windows service named ovpnservice remains there after uninstall setup files remain there after uninstall the windows network connection and its tray icon remain there their chat agents are totally clueless about this they suggest to remove manually the app in the program folder but the app does not install there… and did i mention that all the free servers just 2 did not work reply douglas crawford verifiedjuly 21 2016 at 815 am hi antoniothat does not sound good i did not experience the problem but that might be because i use revo uninstaller as for the free servers there were 3 of them and they worked when i tested the service i must say say though that we have received many complaints abut total vpn and i’m sure that our readers are not just making them up…reply ameer abbas august 3 2016 at 956 amyou need to uninstall the app first then use a registry cleaner to remove all registry entries from the windows registry reply douglas crawford verifiedaugust 3 2016 at 1003 am hi ameerthis will indeed work thanks but really should not be necessary replyshrinivas august 6 2016 at 1033 am network connections that are left out should be removed in device manager please go to device manager and click network adapters there you can uninstall them cheers reply maija july 20 2016 at 117 am i’m still running mac os x 1068… can you recommend anything that will work with that reply douglas crawford verifiedjuly 20 2016 at 843 am hi maijamost custom vpn clients do not support osx snow leopard some might but i know of any off the top of my head unfortunately most free vpns rely on you using custom software just about every paidfor a service check out 5 best cheap vpns  however can be manually configured to run on older versions of mac osx reply hildegard july 18 2016 at 1023 pm windscribe is the best provider on this list by far started using it as a free user and upgraded to pro the next day because everything simply worked i was able to get started in literally under 2 minutes which included downloading the software and making an account swedish servers are really quick for me don’t notice any speed differences at all replytatiana july 21 2016 at 715 amcons  – tor was not tested so torvpn or vpntor were not tested too  – linux version available on proaccount only – port udp or exotic – can you play online  – can you choose your own password  – can you try a free account without to be registered  – no killswitch firewall is given as a better solution – is the addon firefox or the appdesktop were audited  – what is a securelink  i have not clearly understood this feature the professional work of windscribe and the quality of the support are a  replyal july 11 2016 at 829 pm total vpn is not free unless you want your mask to be in iceland russia etc all us servers require upgrade to paid subscription reply douglas crawford verifiedjuly 12 2016 at 840 am hi alall the options listed here are very limited and are offered in the hope that you will spring for a premium plan running a vpn costs a lot of money so it needs to bed monetized in some way at least the providers listed here are transparent about how they do this…replyiamdjboss july 8 2016 at 914 pmi love it got it reply load more comments leave a reply your email address will not be published
