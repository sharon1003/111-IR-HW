how yeast infection aggravates rheumatic symptoms yeast infection  candida albicans can often be a major cofactor contributing to many of the symptoms of rheumatic illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis ra fibromyalgia fms and hypothyroidism includinglow metabolismtirednessdepressed immune system“brain fog”headachesthrush whiteness in mouth tissuesvaginal dischargesskin rashes and psoriasisgenital inflammationpersistent fungal infections eg jock itch and athletes footesophageal lesions heartburnirritable bowel ibsconstipation and diarrhea in alternationnumbness and neuropathyreversible brain dysfunction intoxicationfood allergies related to “leaky gut syndrome”one striking symptom of yeast infection is called “food coma” or post prandial after eating intoxication ingestion of yeastgenerated hydrocarbons can rapidly induce mental collapse stupor and sleep lasting several hours after consuming a meal containing alcohol or just sugars and simple carbohydrates alone which the yeast converts to alcohols and other toxins the candida organism normally grows in the gut and its generation of toxins is exacerbated by sugars and simple carbohydrates infection can be partly controlled by minimizing estrogen found in birth control pills and menopause relief drugs and by severely limiting carbohydrates in the diet atkins and south beach diets are examples of lowcarb approaches to eating the growth of candida is encouraged by antibacterial antibiotics including the tetracyclines which kill the normal “good” intestinal bacterial flora that usually generate molecules that suppress the yeasts clostridium difficile proliferation is also an opportunistic consequence of the antibacterial protocols tropic oils and probiotics help but specific antibiotics may be needed to control the c diff and candidae treatments for yeast sensitivity are directed at greatly reducing the size and extent of the colony they start with intestinal cleanout as for a fiber optic sigmoidoscope exam followed by systemic long term antifungal eg nystatin and topical vaginal nystatin if applicable sometimes a jarischherxheimer reaction is induced and ideally a physician skilled in the treatment of yeast infections should be controlling the treatment the candida microbe can invade cells and live inside them this makes it hard for antifungal drugs to fully eliminate a yeast colony a permanent diet change is essential for control dietary guidelines to suppress candida overgrowth include daily intake of garlic omega3 fatty acids flaxseed fish oil caprylic acid liquid fatty acid found in butter and other fats and oils and especially probiotics such as lactobacillus acidophilus lactobacillus bifidus bifidobacteria bifidus buttermilk yogurt etc goat milk and cheese is rich in caprylic acid coconut oil has palmitic caprylic and lauric acids which are all systemic anti microbialkilling yeasts fungus bacteria viruses and protozoa several tablespoons per day are recommended of a mix of these oils boron deficiency may result in higher susceptibility to yeast and fungal infections see dr axe’s boron article contains recipes for treatment of athletes foot vaginal infections boric acid eyewash may be an effective treatment of fungal corneal infections in another of its forms c albicans extends a microscopic tube that infiltrates the intestine lining and causes it to leak tiny particles of undigested food into the blood this causes the socalled “leaky gut syndrome” leading to the generation of bloodborne immune complexes ig g ig e specific to certain foods that cause allergic reaction these immune complexes exacerbate the inflammation of other resident infections aggravating ra fms and other socalled autoimmune disorders inflammation is also sometimes seen at sites of past injuries where bacterial infection may be latent and waiting for an opportune time to emerge gut inflammation by yeast may be complicated by other infections such as milkborne heat resistant micobacteria paratuberculosis  which is the cause of a crohn’s disease lookalike infection called jonne’s disease in dairy cattle with an epidemic dairy herd infection level at an estimated 15 to 20 other foodwater borne bacterial gut coinfections may include listeria monocytogenes yersinia enterocolitica salmonella certain pathogenic strains of escherichia coli and cryptosporidium a comprehensive classic source of information on yeast and fungal infections and many effective treatments for these conditions is the yeast syndrome  by dr john trowbridge m d and morton walker dpm bantam books 1986 at the time of publication and even today the medical establishment may still deny that c albicans is a serious pathogenic problem despite a huge number of published papers to the contrary eg see “glycoprotein toxins produced by candida albicans ” by k iwata  y yamamoto proceedings of the 4 th international conference on mycoses paho scientific publication 356 1977 dr marjorie crandall awardwinning candida expert who resides in southern california she is the author of dozens of publications in scientific journals and does personal counseling
