holds that the kurdish people are deserving of a sovereign nation that would be partitioned out of areas in turkey northern iraq and syria based on the promised nation of kurdistan under the treaty of sevres early kurdish nationalism had its roots in the days of the ottoman empire within which kurds were a significant ethnic group with the dissolution of the ottoman empire the kurdishmajority territories were divided between the newly formed states of iraq syria and turkey making kurds a significant ethnic minority in each state kurdish nationalist movements have long been suppressed by turkey and the arab majority states of iraq and syria all of whom fear loss of territory to a potential independent kurdistan meanwhile large numbers of kurds in iran show no interest in kurdish nationalism 6 especially shia kurds who even vigorously reject idea of autonomy preferring direct rule from religious government of tehran 7 6 since the 1970s iraqi kurds have pursued the goal of greater autonomy and even outright independence against the baath party regimes which responded with brutal repression including the massacre of 182000 kurds in the anfal genocide since the 1980s the kurdish–turkish conflict led by kurdish armed groups challenged the turkish state which responded with martial law after the 1991 uprisings in iraq iraqi kurds were protected against the armies of iraqi dictator saddam hussein by nato enforced nofly zones allowing them considerable autonomy and selfgovernment outside the control of the iraqi central government after the 2003 invasion of iraq that ousted dictator saddam hussein iraqi kurdistan became an autonomous region enjoying a great measure of selfgovernance but stopping short of full independence kurdish nationalism has long been espoused and promoted by the worldwide kurdish diaspora 8contents  hide 1 history2 ottoman empire3 turkey4 iraq41 british mandate after world war i42 after world war ii43 after the gulf war5 syria6

article history of the kurds the kurdish nationalist struggle first emerged in the late 19th century when a unified movement demanded the establishment of a kurdish state revolts did occur sporadically but only decades after the ottoman centralist policies of the 19th century began did the first modern kurdish nationalist movement emerge with uprising led by a kurdish landowner and head of the powerful shemdinan family sheikh ubeydullah in 1880 ubeydullah demanded political autonomy or outright independence for kurds and the recognition of a kurdistan state without interference from turkish or persian authorities 9 the uprising against qajar persia and the ottoman empire was ultimately suppressed by the ottomans and ubeydullah along with other notables were exiled to istanbul the kurdish nationalist movement that emerged following world war i and end of the ottoman empire was largely reactionary to the changes taking place in mainstream turkey primarily radical secularization which the strongly muslim kurds abhorred centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and kurdish autonomy and rampant turk ethnonationalism in the new turkish republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them 10 western powers particularly the united kingdom fighting the turks also promised the kurds they would act as guarantors for kurdish freedom a promise they subsequently broke one particular organization the kürdistan teali cemiyeti society for the advancement of kurdistan or sak was central to the forging of a distinct kurdish identity it took advantage of period of political liberalization in during the second constitutional era 1908–1920 of turkey to transform a renewed interest in kurdish culture and language into a political nationalist movement based on ethnicity 10 this emphasis on kurds as a distinct ethnicity was encouraged by around the start of the 20th century russian anthropologists who suggested that the kurds were a european race compared to the asiatic turks based on physical characteristics and their language which is part of the indoeuropean language group 11 while these researchers had ulterior political motives to sow dissent in the ottoman empire their findings were embraced and still accepted today by many during the relatively open government of the 1950s kurds gained political office and started working within the framework of the turkish republic to further their interests but this move towards integration was halted with the 1960 turkish coup détat 11 the 1970s saw an evolution in kurdish nationalism as marxist political thought influenced a new generation of kurdish nationalists opposed to the local feudal authorities who had been a traditional source of opposition to authority eventually they would form the militant separatist partiya karkeren kurdistan pkk or kurdistan workers party in english ottoman empire  editmain article early kurdish nationalism saladins heroism and leadership were a great inspiration for the rise of kurdish nationalism during the ottoman empire under the millet system kurds primary form of identification was religious with sunni islam being the top in the hierarchy milleti hakimiye 12 while the ottoman empire embarked on a modernization and centralization campaign known as the tanzimat 1829–1879 kurdish regions retained much of their autonomy and tribal chiefs their power the sublime porte made little attempt to alter the traditional power structure of segmented agrarian kurdish societies – agha sheikh and tribal chief because of the kurds geographical position at the southern and eastern fringe of the empire and the mountainous topography of their territory in addition to the limited transportation and communication system agents of the state had little access to kurdish provinces and were forced to make informal agreements with tribal chiefs this bolstered the kurds authority and autonomy for instance the ottoman qadi and mufti as a result did not have jurisdiction over religious law in most kurd regions 13 in 1908 the young turks come to power asserting a radical form of turkish ethnic identity and closed ottoman associations and nonturkish schools they launched a campaign of political oppression and resettlement against ethnic minorities – kurds laz people and armenians but in the wartime context they could not afford to antagonize ethnic minorities too much 14 at the end of world war i kurds still had the legal right to conduct their affairs in kurdish celebrate unique traditions and identify themselves as a distinct ethnic group 15 the treaty of sèvres signed in 1920 suggested an independent kurdish and armenian state but after the establishment of the turkish republic by a turk ethnonationalist government which balked at the treaty the 1923 lausanne treaty was signed which made no mention of the kurds the once politically unified ottoman kurdistan was then divided into the different administrative and political systems in iraq turkey and syria 16turkey  editsee also kurdish rebellions in turkey by the enforcement of laws such as article 57 of the turkish constitution of 1982 which outlaws any activity harmful to national unity and territorial integrity of the turkish republic kurdish civic rights can be constrained within the context of a constitution guaranteeing equality without acknowledging them as a distinct group 17 equal citizenship rights were enshrined in turkeys 1920 provisional constitution article 8 asserted that the country was composed of both turks and kurds but under the law they would be treated as common citizens 18 however the 1923 formation of the republic of turkey marked the beginning of continuing period of reduced civic rights for kurds the caliphate was abolished a year later as well as all public expressions and institutions of kurdish identity kurdish madrasas newspapers religious fraternal organizations and associations were shut down 19to give an example of the early republican governments attitude towards the citizenship rights of kurds law no 1850 was introduced after popular revolts giving afterthefact legal sanction to civilians and military personnel who killed kurds during the revolt kurdish regions were placed under martial law and the use of the kurdish language dress folklore and names prohibited it was this continued repression that led to reemergence of kurdish nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s 20 during this period the primary goal of the movement was to resolve its grievances with the turkish government through legitimate channels these attempts were heavily suppressed 20civic rights were temporarily improved with the turkish constitution of 1961 which allowed freedom of expression the press and association for kurds the 1964 political parties act criminalized kurdish political parties and the acknowledgment of the existence of different languages and races in turkey the 1972 law of association further restricted rights to association and political organization the failure to address the kurdish grievances throughout the 1960s and 1970s led to alternate avenues of resolution 20 in 1984 the kurdistan workers party pkk started a guerrilla insurgency against the turkish republic the pkks insurgency continued to be a violent insurgency until the lasting ceasefire in 1999 throughout this period there was a significant loss of life in addition to many social and political changes 21in 1991 law 2932 was repealed and the kurdish language was allowed for informal speech and music but not for political or education purposes or in the mass media 22 the same year a new antiterror bill was passed which defined terrorism as any kind of action with the aim of changing characteristics of the republic essentially criminalizing kurdish political activism and many basic forms of expression 23 in 2004 laws were further liberalized allowing kurdishlanguage broadcasts and other restrictions including the giving of kurdish names to infants have been removed 24iraq  editsee also iraqi kurdistan and iraqi–kurdish conflict kdp and puk controlled areas of kurdistan after the iraqi kurdish civil war british mandate after world war i  editafter world war i iraq came under a british mandate to avoid unrest the british granted the northern kurdish region considerable autonomy and recognized their nationalist claims they even tried to institutionalize kurdish ethnic identity in the 1921 provisional iraqi constitution which stated that iraq was composed of two ethnic groups with equal rights arabs and kurds and enshrined the equal legal status of the kurdish language with arabic the mandate government divided the country into two separate regions one arab one kurdish in administrative policy and practice 25 two policies emerged regarding kurds in iraq one for nontribal urban dwellers and one for rural tribal population meant to discourage urban migration the government institutionalized advantages for rural kurds – tribes had special legal jurisdiction tax benefits and informally guaranteed seats in parliament in addition they were exempt from two of the strongest facets of the modern state they had their own schools and were outside the jurisdiction of national courts this privileged position lasted into the 1950s 25 kurdish rights were further entrenched in 1932 by the local languages law a condition of the league of nations undoubtedly under british influence being that to join iraq had to enact constitutional protection for the kurds 26 political rights were fairly open in the interwar years as continued british internal interference and a series of weak government prevented any one movement from dominating national politics prevented the creation of a formal exclusionary citizenship however later the central governments nationbuilding strategy centered around a secular conception of national identity based upon a sentiment of iraqi unity alwadha aliraqiyya with the government dominated by sunni arabists 25 within this new framework as nonarabs the kurds would experience unwelcome changes in status 25after world war ii  editthe 1950s 1960s and 1970s demonstrated a pattern the new arabist leader would assert his belief in the kurds as distinct and equal ethnic group in iraq with political rights for instance the constitution of 1960 claims kurds and arabs are partners within this nation the constitution guarantees their rights within the framework of the iraqi republic once successful at consolidating their power they would repress kurdish political rights militarize kurdish regions ban nationalist political parties destroy kurdish villages and forcibly impose resettlement especially in petroleumrich areas 27 as a result from late 1961 onwards there was near constant strife in iraqi kurdistan 26 a major development was made when the iraqi government and kurdish leaders signed the 1970 peace agreement it promised kurdish selfrule recognition of the binational character of iraq political representation in the central government extensive official language rights the freedom of association and organization and several other concessions aimed at restoring full civic rights to the kurdish population 28 it was to come into effect within four years in 1974 the weaker law of autonomy in the area of kurdistan was actually implemented with much weaker citizenship protections and conflict soon resumed the 1980s especially during the iran–iraq war were a particular low point for kurdish rights within iraq approximately 500000 kurdish civilians were sent to detention camps in southern and eastern iraq and the iraqi armed forces razed villages and hamlets in and near the battle area it is also this time that the iraqi military used chemical weapons on kurdish towns 29after the gulf war  editsee also kurdistan regional government and iraqi kurdistan independence referendum 2017after the gulf war an autonomous safe haven was established in northern iraq under un with u s air force and british royal air force air protection under the democratically elected kurdish regional government citizens experienced civic rights never previously enjoyed student unions ngos and womens organizations emerged as forces in a new civic society and institutionalized tolerance for the regions own ethnic religious and language minorities eg the iraqi turkmen since the 2003 invasion of iraq and the downfall of saddam hussein the kurdish population has found itself drawn back into iraq with promises of autonomy and citizenship based on a federal ethnically inclusive model with strong minority rights and guarantees against discrimination 30 the new iraqi constitution drafted in 2005 establishes kurdish as an official language alongside arabic acknowledges the national rights of the kurdish people and contains the usual promises about absolute equality of citizens regardless of race religion gender etc how effective this constitution will be in safeguarding the equal citizenship of the kurdish population is unclear in the current unstable domestic situation syria  editsee also rojava after the failed revolution of sheikh said thousands of kurds fled their homes in southeastern turkey to syria where they settled and were granted citizenship by the french mandate authorities 31the flag sometimes seen in kurdishheld areas of syria is often flown alongside the flag of kurdistan as being adopted by the pkklinked democratic union party syria pyd since 2012 under the french mandate of syria the kurds enjoyed considerable rights as the french mandate authority encourage minority independence movements as part of a divide and rule strategy and recruited a large kurdish segment for its local armed forces 32 the repression of kurdish civic rights escalated with the shortlived unification of syria and egypt as the united arab republic in 1958 partly in response to more vocal kurdish demands for democracy recognition as an ethnic group and complaints that the state police and military academies were closed to kurds 32 120 000 kurds 40 of the syrian kurd population were stripped of their citizenship in the 1962 census when the government claimed they were in fact turks and iraqis illegally residing in the country 33 stripped of their nationality however these now stateless kurds still found themselves subject to its obligations through conscription in the military the kurdish language and cultural expressions were banned a state that continues today in 1962 the government announced its “arab belt” plan later renamed “plan for establishment of model state farms ” which would have forcibly expelled the kurdish population from a 350 km long 10 to 15 km deep strip of land along syria’s northeast border and replaced them with arab settlers but was never fully implemented 33 there was no change in policy under the new ba’athist regime post1963 it refused to implement its program of land reforms that was benefiting arab peasants where kurds would predominantly benefit until 1971 34 from the 1970s on there was relaxation of official treatment of kurds but the late 1980s saw renewed widespread denial of syrian citizenship status to domestic kurds especially in refusing national identity documents such as passports 35since the syrian civil war syrian government forces have abandoned many kurdishpopulated areas leaving the kurds to fill the power vacuum and govern these areas autonomously 36many kurds consider the kurdishmajority regions of northern and northeastern syria to be western kurdistan  kurdish rojavaye kurdistane and seek political autonomy within syria akin to iraqi kurdistan in iraq or outright independence as part of kurdistan 37 38iran  editsee also iranian kurdistan the similarity between kurdish and persian language and culture compared to the turks and arabs the more equal population balance between the ethnic majority persians and ethnic minorities like the kurds has resulted in a somewhat different citizenship experience for iranian kurds as such most seek autonomy rather than independence 39under the qajar empire  editiranian group identification and social order was based on religious identification with islam specifically shia islam the dominant sect while the majority of kurds are sunni in iran they were roughly evenly split between sunnis shias and shia splinter groups like the sufis because of this preoccupation with religion over ethnicity in practice kurds were treated as part of the majority and enjoyed extensive citizenship rights unlike the ottoman empire this social order was maintained while the imperial system declined and modern iranian identity was forged by a reform movement in the late 19th century to the benefit of kurds under this regime sunni and shia kurds held a privileged position as muslims unlike the other minorities christian armenians jews zoroastrians and others they had the right to work in food production and buy crown land they also benefited from the tuyal land tenure system which favoured muslims this advantage allowed kurds to establish strong control over food production and land 40 the notable absence of ethnic restrictions on holding government office allowed kurdish tribal leaders and notables to purchase office and establish a strong kurdish presence in iranian politics without having to culturally assimilate or deny ethnicity this political presence was bolstered because the qajars appointed many tribal chiefs to government positions in exchange for internal security assurances 41 within this system many kurds reached prominent military political and diplomatic positions 42 exceptional in iran during the 19th century and early 20th was that the nationalist reform movement did not develop a radical exclusionary ethnic based conception of nationality but developed an iranian identity that did not define itself as ethnically persian 43constitutional monarchy  editmain article kurdish separatism in iran the existing beneficial social framework changed with the establishment of a constitutional monarchy by reza shah in 1925 similar to other states he tried to nationbuild by creating an exclusionary nationality based on a secular ethnically persian iranian identity and repress the cultural expressions and equal status of ethnic minorities these minorities including the kurds were coerced into accepting persian culture and many were arrested for speaking the kurdish language 44 however kurds were afforded a special position in the official state ethnicbased nationalism because of their cultural similarity to the persians and their nonarab ethnicity also the distribution of seats in the majlis parliament was based on religion not ethnicity the kurds were able to exercise greater political power than nonmuslim minorities like the armenians and jews 45 the state’s system of military conscription and centralized education served to integrate urban kurdish populations but the majority remained rural 46 after world war ii with the soviet withdrawal from kurdish regions where they had encouraged autonomous kurdish government as the mahabad republic  the shah banned some kurdish political parties expressions of cultural identity ended the open political party system and ruled by firman 47 in 1958 there was a marked liberalization which allowed the activities of kurdish cultural organizations and student associations but still limited political parties 48 unlike other countries the kurds were free to publish cultural and historical information in their own language 49 however with massive investment and military aid from the western world in the 1950s and 1960s iran became a police state which clamped down on many civil rights 50postrevolutionary iran  editmain article 1979 kurdish rebellion in iran after the iranian revolution some kurdish groups chiefly the democratic party of iranian kurdistan allied with iranian leftist and communist groups against ayatollah khomeini s government the kurdish rebellion for autonomy in 1979 was forcibly suppressed by tehran with thousands of kurdish rebels and civilians killed as a result the new theocratic government developed a new exclusionary conception of nationalism based on very conservative shia islam once khomeini consolidated power he expelled sunni kurds from government office placed restrictions on freedom of expression and militarized kurdish regions as part of the war with iraq 51 still compared to other countries kurds were still allowed limited publications to celebrate holidays wear traditional dress and use kurdish except as a language of instruction significant improvements were made in 1997 whereby the government allowed a profusion of kurdish language in media although some of these publications were later restricted 52pjak insurrection  editmain article
