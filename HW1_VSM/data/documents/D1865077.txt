this painting represents a roman eagle also called the aquila the eagle aquila was the bird of jupiter in ancient times the eagle was a symbol of strength and courage and immortality the eagle was believed to be the king of the birds that could ascend above the storm and become the messenger of the gods according to ancient mythology the eagle would carry the soul into the presence of the gods zeus to the greeks jupiter to the roman and odin to the tribes of germania the silver eagle was the ensign of the roman legion and the symbol of its power the legatus was the officer in charge and he would assign an aquilifer who was the soldier that would carry the aquila eagle into battle if the eagle was captured the legion would disband it is interesting that julius caesar personally sanctified the eagle when the legion was brought forth on one of the legion standards the powerful talons of the eagle are gripping golden thunderbolts as the eagle stands ready for flight against all enemies of rome at the very top of the standard above the eagle is a gold bar with the inscription spqr senatus populus romanus honoring the senate and the people the ancient roman eagle is important

horse and the boar in the second consulship of gaius marius 104 bc the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards the eagle being alone retained it was made of silver or bronze with outstretched wings but was probably of a relatively small size since a standardbearer signifer under julius caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it in the folds of his girdle under the later emperors the eagle was carried with the legion a legion being on that account sometimes called aquila hirt bell hisp 30 each cohort had for its own ensign the

millitaria was superior to the others both with respect to the number and quality of the soldiers it had also the charge of the eagle and the standard of the emperor its strength was 1105 footsoldiers and 132 cuirassiers on horseback and its post was on the right of the first line the remaining four cohorts of the first line contained each 555 infantry and 66 cavalry and the five cohorts of the second line contained each the same number of infantry and cavalry thus the whole legion was composed of 6100 footsoldiers and 726 horsemen not including either the triarii or the light troops romethe

twenty maniples of principes and triarii in each legion two were appointed to take charge of the broad passage or street called prindpia extending right across the camp in front of the tents of the tribunes this being the place of general resort during the day and as we know from various sources the part of the camp in which the altars and the eagles stood great pains were taken that it should be kept perfectly clean and regularly watered a labour which would rail very light when portioned out among four maniples aquilifer bearing standard with eagle aquilifer ensign of a roman legion who

thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not acts 258  while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any

photos information  coins archaeology discoveries and the ancient biblical world the black obelisk in the 1840s a british man named austen henry layard had a desire to travel to the middle east and dig around some of the strange looking mounds near the city of mosul he had heard many tales about things being found in these mounds he was looking for any trace of evidence that would lead him to the lost city of nineveh the capital of the ancient assyrian empire little did he know that one of his discoveries would turn europe upside down with excitement he discovered a black limestone monument which is known today as the black obelisk of shalmaneser iii this discovery brought a new authenticity and historicity to some of the stories in the bible it also gained him the support of the british museum and all the finances he needed to continue his excavations and become known as the father of assyriology the pilate inscription it wasnt long ago when many scholars were questioning the actual existence of a roman governor with the name of pontius pilate the procurator who ordered jesus crucifixion in june 1961 italian archaeologists led by dr frova were excavating an ancient roman amphitheatre near caesareaonthesea maritima and uncovered this interesting limestone block on the worn face is a monumental inscription which is part of a larger dedication to tiberius caesar which clearly says that it was from pontius pilate prefect of judea the megiddo seal bearing king jeroboams name  it is very interesting that the jasper seal found at tel megiddo bearing the name of king jeroboam who ruled in the northern kingdom of israel would contain the symbol for their rival the southern kingdom of judah but in examining all of the circumstances involved and seeing what the bible says it is no wonder that the prosperous and victorious northern kingdom of israel would boast with a symbol of their enemy the tomb of cyrus the great an inscription on the tomb of the great persian monarch read o man whoever you are and wherever you come from for i know that you will comei am cyrus son of cambyses who founded the empire of the persians and was king of the east do not

discovery excavated in nineveh in the 1830 records the assyrian king sennacheribs 8th campaign which includes his siege of jerusalem during the reign of hezekiah the judahite in 701 bc there are 500 lines of writing in the akkadian language on this magnificent clay prism is the story true that it was purchased by an american from an antiquities dealer in baghdad coming soon the ishtar gate of babylon during the last days of the southern kingdom of judah the jews were taken captive to a distant land called babylon at the latter part of the 6th century bc they passed through a beautiful entrance gate made of mud brick masonry and glazed skin which stood 47 feet tall commonly referred to as the ishtar gate since its discovery at the turn of the 20th century near modern baghdad iraq the tall gate was dedicated to the gods by nebuchadnezzar king of babylonia who reigned from 605—562 bc is it true that hitler had it transported to berlin where is the ishtar gate now next the remains of solomons temple biblical archaeology the bible mentions many things about people places and events that happened in history the bible also gives an accurate chronology of those people places and events what is amazing is that modern archaeology has confirmed that the bible has never made one error or given any clear contradictions in all of its text in matters of historical fact
