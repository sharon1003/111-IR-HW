patients with back pain has been debated we investigated the prevalence of sacroiliac joint vacuum phenomenon sjvp and the rate at which it is reported on abdominopelvic and lumbosacral spine computed tomography ct images by body imagers and neuroradiologists we hypothesized that it would be more common than not and that neuroradiologists would identify it more frequently than body imagers and on spine images more commonly than abdominopelvic studies due to the search for the source of back pain in the former materials and methods ct images of the pelvis and lumbar spine from january to february 2009 were retrospectively reviewed six hundred fiftytwo patients were studied during this period axial thinsection images were reviewed under default lung and bone window settings age sex and radiologist reports were assessed from electronic medical records results the prevalence of sjvp on ct imaging was 34 with higher rates found in female 41 p 001 and older 39 p 05 patients eightyfive percent of the phenomena were present bilaterally among the 223 patients with sjvp only 17 were reported there were no statistically significant differences between reporting rates for body radiologists and neuroradiologists conclusion sjvp is a prevalent condition with higher rates among older and female individuals the phenomenon is underreported on ct images whether the studies performed are abdominopelvic scans or spine studies and whether they are interpreted by body imagers or neuroradiologists previous article next article keywords vacuum phenomenon sacroiliac joint sacroiliac joint dysfunction1 introduction the presence of gaseous collections within a joint space is known as the vacuum phenomenon vp vp is often seen in intervertebral discs and sacroiliac joints studies dealing with the sacroiliac joint are uncommonly found in the literature 1–3 and most of these studies are not recent there has also been lack of data concerning the incidence significance and correlation of vp with lowback pain in the literature 4 since computed tomography ct studies of the abdomen pelvis and lumbosacral spine are frequently performed the sacroiliac joints are often included in the field of view we observed that gas in the sacroiliac joints is a common finding which is often not mentioned in radiology imaging reports we hypothesized that the prevalence of sacroiliac joint vacuum phenomenon sjvp is similar to what has been described in the literature 306 1 and that this phenomenon is underreported on abdominopelvic and lumbosacral spine ct images as such we also evaluated the rate at which it is mentioned in radiology findings by body imagers and by neuroradiologists as a potential practice quality improvement project2 materials and methods21 research design and patients our institutional review board approved a retrospective review of patient data for this study informed consent was waived by the institutional review board and the study was compliant with the health insurance portability and accountability act all consecutive abdominopelvic and lumbosacral spine ct imaging scans that included the sacroiliac joints performed during the period from january 1 2009 to february 28 2009 were retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical record emr was consulted for demographic data22 investigators investigators included one board subspecialtycertified neuroradiologist d m y  one neuroradiology fellow s s m l and one senior radiology resident z a a biostatistician m c helped calculate statistics23 investigations abdominopelvic and lumbosacral spine ct images were obtained in 075mmthick axial slices images were reviewed at bone window 1776 level 176 andor lung window 1600 level −500 window settings the presence of gas density within the sacroiliac joint was considered a positive finding and each sacroiliac joint was considered separately data concerning sex age groups and modality of examination reported in the emr were compared between those who did and those who did not have the vp findings of the phenomena were also compared with the electronic ct reports in the emr produced by boardcertified subspecialtytrained neuroradiologists or body radiologists who had independently reported these scans the previous year within the period from january 2009 to february 2009 652 patients underwent abdominopelvic  n 502 or lumbosacral spine  n 150 ct scans for various indications these scans were independently evaluated by two investigators to assess any vp in both sacroiliac joints additionally a subset of 40 random 80 sacroiliac joints cases was evaluated by all three investigators to establish interobserver reliability none of the scans was officially reported by the three investigators during the study period and there was no confounding bias in the study24 statistical analysis frequencies and crosstabulations were used for descriptive statistics confidence intervals cis for proportions were obtained using the wilson score interval while cis for risk ratios rrs were constructed using a waldtype normal approximation associations between binary classifications were assessed using fishers exact test while comparisons of two populations means for continuous variables were conducted using the unpaired twosample student t test the kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver reliability in detecting the presence of a sacroiliac joint vp statistical significance was established at 05 all computations were performed using the r statistical environment r

interobserver reliability was graded with kappa values ranging from 061 to 077 indicating substantial agreement between the investigators4 discussion the sacroiliac joint is the largest axial joint in the human body it is composed of a synovial joint in its anterior aspect and a syndesmosis in its posterior aspect 6 although the sacroiliac joint is surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule and ligaments significant motion can be demonstrated the two most common types of motion are nutation backward rotation and counternutation forward rotation 7 vp was first described in synovial joints under traction 8 magnusson 9 later found a similar phenomenon in intervertebral discs and postulated that gas can fill into a potential space during joint motion correlation between vp and degenerated intervertebral disc disease was also described by knutsson 10 the gas within a joint space “vacuum phenomenon” is reported to be mainly composed of nitrogen with elements of oxygen and carbon dioxide the various gas components are proportional to the amounts in the blood stream 11 such phenomena are well recognized in synovial articulations such as the sacroiliac joint in which stress distracts the apposing articular surfaces which creates a negative pressure and a potential space allowing blood gasses to accumulate within that space 12 vp can be visualized as a thin translucent and dark line  fig 1 or gaseous pocket on conventional films or ct images it has been described to be present in several joint spaces such as the spine hip knee shoulder and sacroiliac joints 12–15 due to the low hounsfield unit of air vp is readily identifiable on ct images download highres image 250kb download fullsize image fig 1 axial ct image of the left sacroiliac joint in a 26yearold male patient lung window a linear gaseousdensity dark line arrow is noted in the left sacroiliac joint the mean age of 506±185 years in our population is in keeping with the 515 years reported in a comparable study by faflia et al 1 there is a significant  p 05 difference between the mean age of the patients with sjvp 536±175 years and that of the patients without sjvp 489±187 years in our study no other similar study reporting this finding can be identified in the literature we found the prevalence rate of sjvp to be 34 223652 in our patient population and in 32 4121304 of sacroiliac joints which is different from what has been reported in previous studies the higher prevalence rate found in our study as compared with faflia et al 1 305 and sze and mulligan 16 12 can be explained by our greater ct image resolution 075mm axial thinsection images and better image quality peh and ooi 17 showed a much higher prevalence rate 683 of sjvp as compared with our study which can be explained by the higher mean age and range 55–84 years of their study population as compared with our population mean age 506 range 1–91 years another possible explanation for the discrepancy may be related to a larger female proportion in peh and oois 17 population there is a significantly higher prevalence of sjvp between genders in our study 27 in males vs 41 in females p 001 the difference in the prevalence of sjvp between genders in our study was no different from what had been reported by faflia et al 1 who reported rates of 258 and 317 for males and females respectively the sacroiliac joints in women are slightly wider and more mobile as compared with men 18 likely on the basis of estrogen effects on ligaments which may explain the higher prevalence of sjvp in female populations 19 pregnancy also showed increased mobility and widening of the sacroiliac joints due to increased levels of estrogen and relaxin thus sjvp is considered to be a normal anatomical change during pregnancy 20 a higher prevalence rate of sjvp was also found in multiparous women 1 peh and ooi also showed a lack of association between increasing age and sjvp 17 faflia et al 1 also found that sjvp was only depicted in individuals older than 30 years our study clearly demonstrated a significant increase in the prevalence of sjvp among the older patients 391 in patients older than 60 years vs 277 in those younger than 40 years p 05 the youngest patient having an sjvp in our study population was 9 years old we found the prevalence rate of sjvp to be 25 26102 in patients younger than 30 years41 significance of vpgas in sacroiliac joints may be due to osteoarthropathy infection osteonecrosis calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease and the extremes of distraction in positioning gas in a joint also implies mobility of that joint ie it is not fused 1321 the underlying reason for the higher prevalence rates of sjvp in the elderly population other than osteoarthropathy is unknown the increased rate of sacroiliac joint degeneration in the elderly population may partly explain the higher prevalence of sjvp the association between sjvp and joint degeneration 10 cannot be fully explained by the presence of sjvp in the pediatric population in our study which further supports the theory of sjvp induced by joint mobility arafat and davies 22 reported that the presence of gas in the sacroiliac joint and intraosseous gas supports the diagnosis of sacral insufficiency fracture stäbler et al 23 also reported that the mechanism of gas formation within the insufficiency fracture is probably stress related whereby fracture and joint separation could promote release of gas the presence of gas in the joint space could represent sequelae of a significant distraction force of that particular joint and shows an association between blunt trauma and the presence of gas in joint space 24 however subsequent studies 1617 found no direct association between vp and sacroiliac joint injury or sacral insufficiency fracture the presence of sjvp also showed no direct association with sacroiliac joint osteophyte formation 17 the sacroiliac joint can undergo premature degeneration due to its unique anatomical orientation and development some data have suggested a higher frequency of sacroiliac joint degenerative arthritis in patients with lowback pain 25 the radiological findings of sjvp may provide an indirect sign to the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint degeneration leading to back pain 26 the results of higher prevalence in the elderly and in females coincide overall with a higher rate of back pain in the elderly and in women but a causeandeffect relationship cannot be assumed we have demonstrated that sjvp is underreported in our study only 37 of 223 166 cases were reported by certified neuroradiologists or body radiologists there was no statistically significant difference between reporting rates for body radiologists and neuroradiologists 19 vs 12 p 05 and we found that the reporting rates did not differ significantly based on demographic variables and imaging regions abdominopelvic vs lumbosacral spine the numbers of patients with and those without vp were substantial in our study but there were several limitations we did not assess for back pain in our populations in the emr because as this was a retrospective study there was no way to ascribe the pain experienced even if it had been reported to causes other than the sjvp we also had far fewer lumbosacral ct images to review than abdominopelvic ct scans the number of cases was determined by a period 2 months not equal numbers of cases we also had a variable number of patients in each age group because we based the inclusion criteria only on a date range5 conclusion conventional abdominopelvic and lumbosacral spine ct scans can provide valuable information concerning the sacroiliac joints sjvp is a prevalent condition with a particularly higher rate among older individuals and females the phenomenon is underreported on abdominopelvic and lumbosacral spine ct images mentioned in just 17 of reports in patients with sjvp body imagers and neuroradiologists underreport this phenomenon at an equal rate the potential for improving the reporting of this finding via a practice quality improvement project is great references 1 faflia cp prassopoulos pk daskalogiannaki me et al variation in
