cry on or preparing meals while leaning on loved ones for support helps some parents find that what helps them most is talking to others who have had the same experience as time goes by though the type of support that families need may change sometimes being around other families suffering through the same thing can feel like opening old wounds at that point you might want to switch to a private counselor its also important to remember that what you dont do is key to the healing process as well certain situations  a childs birthday party a baby shower  may be too painful to bear
