bengal tiger habitat posted on may 25 2012 by michael broad share tweet pinterest ranthambore national park – india this article on the bengal tiger habitat looks at where it is and what it is when you write about habitat you have to write about the location as well the four photographs above just click on them to enlarge them show you the bengal tiger habitat in reserves in india the most typical of habitats for this species of tiger i also discuss the wildlife found in this habitat as this is also relevant when writing about this subject we need to remember that the bengal tiger’s wild habitat is decimated much reduced it isn’t possible to simply point to an area on the map and say that is where the bengal tiger lives in general the bengal tiger lives in a wide variety of habitats sixty percent 60 of the habitat is “tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests” twentyone percent 21 of the habitat of the tiger is “temperate and broadleaf mixed forest” and the third most common type is “tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest” they also live in coniferous forest mangrove forest sundarbans – see below and “tropical grass and shrubland” 1 the bengal tiger also lives in dry thorn forest in northcentral india and the tall grass jungles of the northern himalaya 2 the bengal tiger lives primarily in relatively small reserves in india as well – indian bengal tiger reserves and see comments below the tiger has found space away from people in the himalayas of bhutan surviving above 4000 feet – the tigers of bhutan this shows the adaptability of the tiger to different habitats the name “bengal” tells us in what region of the world this animal once lived and at one time in relative abundance in rather crude language the historical and geographical region called “bengal” is at the top right hand corner of india  see map  another way of describing the region is to say that it is located in the northeast of south asia but that doesn’t mean much to me it basically constitutes bangladesh and the indian state of west bengal the map above shows the area of course the bengal tiger doesn’t confine itself to countries or states it knows no boundaries and this big cat is found in bangladesh and india see the places and populations in india where it is found and also in nepal bhutan myanmar burma and tibet view larger map the population of the bengal tiger is perilously low at about 1400 at april 2009 of this number about 280 live in bangladesh most of which are in an area called the sundarbans as at 2008 the problem is that this area of the world is highly populated with people squeezing out the tiger bangladesh is one of the most highly populated countries in the world people and tiger are forced uncomfortably and unnaturally together at the tiger’s expense the bengal tiger habitat is shared with people including tourists it is thought that tourists disturb the tiger because the natural wild tiger habitat has been drastically eroded by people it has been necessary to find alternative and protected habitats these are the reserves nearly all the bengal tigers are now in reserves or parks  src indian tiger  two such tiger reserves are the ranthambore national park in rajasthan india and the sariska tiger reserve another reserve for the bengal tiger is the kaziranga national park in assam which is in north east india there were around 30 bengal tigers in the kaziranga national park 1972 and 86 in the 2000 census  src wikipedia  there are meant to be 37 bengal tiger reserves 6 of which are in nepal and bangladesh many are small – too small it is said we hear what i would consider depressing stories about reserve tigers such as poisoning tigers in this park it is claimed that the kaziranga national park has a rich supply or prey for the bengal tiger which allows it to become larger than normal it is also claimed that the park has the highest density of tigers in the world at one tiger for each five km² of park area so what is it like “on the ground” in say the sundarbans of bangladesh the kaziranga national park and the sariska tiger reserve the picture to the right shows the kaziranga national park lush and green the sariska tiger reserve covers 866 km² and is situated 107 km from jaipur and 200 km from delhi here is a map of the prominent indian bengal tiger reserves if you click on the blue flags you can see more information and a picture of bengal tiger habitat – also you can move the map around left click and hold on the map and move mouse to move the map and this link takes you to a lot more about these reserves indian bengal tiger reserves here is a flickr photograph by by tushar kumar of the sariska tiger reserve he says“sambars are primarily browsers in sariska reserve feed mainly on coarse vegetation grass and herbs and of course favourite of tiger”and what of the sunderbans in bangladesh where the tiger lives cheekbyjowl with people it is an area where there are dense mangrove forests and where the land meets the sea bengal tigers in this region have adapted to the dense forest and the sea water tigers are good swimmers anyway in the sunderbans a national park the primary prey for the tiger is the chital axis deer wild boar and monkeys here is a picture by by yamez a a flickr photographer of the sunderbans to get a feel for the area there are two deer in the photo potential prey for the bengal tiger i have taken the great liberty of reproducing the above map from the sunderbans national park website but have given a link to the site in return if that is a problem please tell me and i will take prompt action bengal tiger habitat – notes1 quotes from iucn red list2 wild cats of the world by the sunquists page 346 bengal tiger habitat

tiger habitat1 the bengal tiger lives in a great variety of habitats2 “habitat” means “the natural home or environment of an animal”3 the habitat and the location of the habitat are part of the same subject and therefore should be discussed together4 in bangladesh the bengal tiger lives in mangrove swamps in the sundarbans this is at sea level the tiger adapts to living near sea water as well the tiger can swim long distances in sea water5 in bhutan it lives at 4000 feet above sea level the bengal tiger lives higher than previously thought it will live in snow here is a picture of rural bhutan6 in northcentral india the bengal tiger habitat is dry thorn forests7 the bengal tiger also lives in reserves in india there are many reserves here is a picture of the bhadra tiger reserve michael aug 18 2011 is the relationship between the tiger and its environment beneficial or harmfulby michael this is a question posed below in a comment the answer depends on whether it is beneficial to people or the cat or bothi presume the question means beneficial to us and the answer has to be it is beneficial the tiger needs a large area in which to live it has a large home range if we allowed the tiger the space it required and in sufficient numbers the human population growth levels would have to fall and stabilise with a lower human population and greater efficiencies in business and with a greater emphasis on quality of life rather than economic growth people would enjoy a better lifestyle living successfully side by side with the tiger but not interfering with it would be a sign of success for humans we need to learn to live with our fellow creatures on this planet what you you think if we made the tiger extinct in the wild do you think it would be detrimental to us i think it would there is your answer the tiger does no harm to the environment it lives in harmony with the environment it is people who destroy the environment and who cannot live in harmony with nature one last point the tiger is the top predator if we preserve the tiger we help preserve the whole ecosystem the animals that the tiger preys upon may 17 2011 hiby lillyyou are awesomemay 12 2011

way through and now my head hurts thant was a lot of words that made no sense to me sorry but im not kidding nov 25 2010 responseby michael in response to the two comments about there not being enough on the habitat i have added a bit more also please look at the videos you can see video of the bengal tiger habitat by clicking on the blue flag markets on the map of the tiger reserves in india i think you may have missed this they show the habitat pictures are better that words in this instance i feel nov 25 2010 saving the tigersby ashley usai came on this site when i searched google  i just love it i absolutely adore all cats wild or tame my favorite big cat is the tiger though for it’s known for its fierceness  beautiful fur i know that there are only a few 100 or more in the wild  would love to save them i believe that man should stop taking  destroying all the land that they don’t use  keep it for the tigers plus even if we grow crops or houses on it things get polluted or just abandoned i also think we should try not to pollute so much or at all so we don’t poison drinking water or food sources that the animals eat for the pollution may spread into the tiger as well from eating the animal i hope this was a good idea  i wish to see the beautiful tigers in the wild more populated it is not a wonderful world without them to bestow their grace nov 06 2010 hiby
