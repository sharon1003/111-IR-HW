your story while leg pain is a common occurrence after an injury pain may also occur because of medical conditions or nontraumatic reasons pain in the legs may be due to injury or inflammation of any of the structures that are found in the leg including bones joints muscles tendons ligaments blood vessels nerves and skin inflammation of tissue is usually the cause of pain pain can also radiate from other parts of the body and be felt in the leg low back ailments may cause pain and numbness of the leg abdominal aorta and iliac artery aneurysms can also present with leg pain a blood clot in the large veins located in the abdomen pelvis or legs is another cause of leg symptoms systemic diseases like diabetes can cause nerve or artery damage that can result in chronic foot pain and leg pain what is the anatomy of the leg the structure of the leg begins with the skeleton the large bones of the leg are the femur thigh bone and the tibia and fibula of the shin the patella kneecap is located in front of the knee joint where the femur and tibia meet smaller bones are found in the feet and toes major joints of the leg include the hip knee and ankle but the small joints in the feet and toes also are important since they help support the body and cushion the force that is generated by walking and running the joints are stabilized by thick bands of tissue called ligaments the ends of a bone that make up part of a joint are covered with cartilage to help them glide through their range of motion and decrease the friction of bone rubbing on bone muscles attach to bone and have tendons that stretch across a joint when a muscle contracts the joint moves major muscle groups that affect leg movement include the buttocks the quadriceps in the front of the thigh the hamstrings in the back of the thigh and the gastrocnemius in the back of the calf there are other smaller muscles including those in the foot that help stabilize the multiple joints in the feet there are two sets of blood vessels in the leg the arterial system delivers blood rich with oxygen from the heart the aorta leaves the heart and descends into the abdomen divides into the iliac arteries and further splits into the femoral arteries at the level of the groin the femoral artery runs along the back of the femur and at the back of the knee the popliteal fossa it begins branching into smaller and smaller arteries to supply the lower leg feet and toes with blood the venous system drains blood from the leg and returns it to the heart allowing tissuelike muscle to get rid of carbon dioxide and other waste products of metabolism there are two sets of veins in the leg the superficial and deep venous systems the superficial system runs along the skin while the deep system is located deep within the muscles and along the bones blood drains from the superficial system to the deep system through connecting veins called perforators that prevent blood clots that occur in the superficial veins from entering the deep vein system and embolizing or traveling to the heart and lungs the superficial and deep systems come together in the groin to form the femoral vein nerves from the spinal cord supply information to the leg transmitting signals from the brain that allow purposeful movement they also return information or sensations to the brain these include the sensations of pain light touch pressure vibration temperature and position as well nerve impulses can flow from the legs to the spinal cord and back without going up into the brain these nerve loops allow the healthcare professional to test deep tendon reflexes when the knee or ankle are tapped with a hammer to assess spinal cord function illness and injury can affect any of these structures causing inflammation discomfort and pain more than one mechanism may occur at the same time to cause leg pain some examples include the following people with poorly controlled diabetes may develop diabetic neuropathy in which the nerves to the legs and feet malfunction symptoms may include pain and loss of sensation in the feet as well as a pinsandneedles or tingling sensation diabetes is also one of the risk factors for peripheral vascular disease which may cause narrowing of arteries in the legs decreasing blood flow to muscles lack of blood supply may cause exercise induced exertional pain or claudication in which muscles start to ache with activity because not enough oxygen rich blood can be delivered intermittent claudication is the term used to refer to pain in the legs that occurs while walking due to peripheral artery disease  peripheral vascular disease  this pain usually gets better with rest as arteries narrow over time decreased activity will bring on increased pain an injured muscle will cause pain because of inflammation and swelling but it may also affect the balance of muscles surrounding a joint if this imbalance persists the joint may start to hurt because of chronic stress placed upon it people with back problems due to arthritis or a ruptured disc may develop sciatica or pain from the sciatic nerve that radiates down the leg sciatica may also be associated with numbness andor tingling in the leg nerve pain slideshow surprising reasons youre in pain slideshow take the pain quiz what causes leg pain readers comments 40 share your story trauma trauma is the most obvious cause of leg pain falls near falls and twisting injuries can damage bones muscles and joints of the leg or a combination of all three back pain due to injury can inflame the sciatic nerve and cause sciatica this is a pain that radiates down the leg that follows the path of one of the many nerve roots that leave the spinal cord and make up the sciatic nerve sciatic pain usually begins in the back and radiates to the buttock and into the thigh overuse injuries may cause pain and can be thought of as multiple minor traumatic injuries to muscles tendons and joints that occur over a longer time span fractures when referring to a bone the terms fracture broken and cracked all mean the same thing the integrity of the bone has been compromised the most common symptom is pain that occurs because the nerve endings located in the fibrous tissue lining of the bone called the periosteum perisurrounding osteumbone have become damaged and inflamed as well the muscles surrounding the bone go into spasm and intensify the pain stress fractures some fractures occur because of repetitive small traumas to a specific area of the body march fractures describe a fracture of one or more of the metatarsal bones in the foot the long bones at the base of the toes that are caused by overuse that fatigues the bone the name comes from the fact that they are found in soldiers who are forced to march long distances as part of their training shin splints are an overuse injury to the tibia or shinbone this condition is also known as tibial stress syndrome running jumping and dancing are the most common causes microscopic fractures occur in the tibia causing pain and swelling if the person continues to exercise and disregards the pain a shin splint can progress to completely break the bone sprains and strains a ligament injury is called a sprain and occurs when the ligament fibers are stretched or partially or completely torn muscles and tendons can also be stretched or torn causing a strain both sprains and strains result in swelling and inflammation that causes pain sometimes a sprain or strain can occur at the location where the structures attach to bone and a small fleck of bone can be pulled off at the insertion of the muscle tendon or ligament this is called an avulsion fracture but often is treated in the same manner as a strain bursitis there are small fluidfilled sacs that cover large bony prominences and allow tendons to slide across the bone bursitis or inflammation of the bursa sac may occur with overuse or injury like a direct blow two bursas in the leg that may commonly become inflamed are the trochanteric bursa that covers the bony prominence of the femur on the outside of the hip and the ischial bursa that covers part of the pelvic bone where we sit bleeding injuries can also cause bleeding into tissues and joints since blood like any fluid cannot be compressed the swelling causes a significant amount of pain as the pressure increases blood is also very irritating to the surrounding tissues when it leaves blood vessels and causes pain by its presence alone compartment syndrome is a medical emergency it describes the situation in which excessive swelling occurs within the sections or compartments of the leg that contain muscles this may cause increased pressure within the compartment that is greater than the blood pressure generated when the heart beats blood supply is cut off within the compartment causing pain numbness and an inability to move the foot or ankle this is a true surgical emergency requiring opening of the compartments and relieving the pressure within to restore blood supply and prevent permanent disability one of the hallmarks of the diagnosis is the finding of pain out of proportion to physical findings the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring pressures within the compartment picture of the muscle and nerve anatomy of the leg causes of a pulled hamstring if a muscle is cold and tight there is a greater chance it can be injured if it is required to stretch quickly if the muscle is warm and has been loosened the risk of injury decreases the hamstring can tear near the knee toward the hip or anywhere inbetween often you feel a pop when the injury occurs and walking becomes extremely painful its no wonder that the athlete collapses to ground when the hamstring is damaged while sprinting as the foot hits the ground the pain can be intolerable read more about pulled hamstrings »what are causes of nontraumatic leg pain there are numerous causes of nontraumatic leg pain and there is no single way of classifying all of these causes healthcare providers often develop their own individual approach to help decide upon a diagnosis sometimes it can help to classify the potential causes based upon the part of the leg that hurts whether the pain is in one leg or both whether it is related to activity or occurs at rest and whether underlying medical conditions exist that can precipitate leg pain pain in only one leg would tend to be due to local problems and not necessarily due to a systemic involving the entire body illness the presumption would be that such an illness would affect both legs this is not necessarily always true for example gout a defect in the bodys ability to process uric acid often attacks only one joint during an acute flare peripheral artery disease pad pain in one leg or both may be due to peripheral artery disease a decrease in arterial blood supply to the leg due to narrowing of arteries often the pain comes on with activity since walking requires more oxygen for the muscles if the arteries are narrow and cant supply that need the muscles begin to ache blood vessels can be narrowed at any level from the aorta the large blood vessel that leaves the heart to any of the branch arteries depending upon the level of narrowing and the particular muscles involved the areas of perceived pain may be different leg pain from peripheral artery disease that occurs with walking is called claudication since peripheral artery disease often affects more than one blood vessel both legs may be affected although the pain may be of different severity in each leg the blood supply may decrease to the point that pain occurs at rest even without exercise poor blood supply to the legs may also compromise the integrity of the skin and may allow infection to occur as well poor blood supply makes it difficult for wounds like lacerations or abrasions to heal blood clot an arterial in an artery blood clot of a leg artery can completely obstruct blood supply preventing tissues from getting oxygenrich blood from the heart this can cause the acute onset of pain aside from pain the leg may become cool and pale while there are many potential sources of a blood clot one common place to look is the heart if the cardiac arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation is present there is the potential that small clots can form on the lining of the heart and break off to travel through the arteries obstructing blood flow at any points distant from the heart aside from the leg the obstruction may occur in one of the blood vessels leading to the brain leading to stroke or one of the arteries to the intestine causing bowel ischemia a blood clot can also occur acutely in an artery that is partially narrowed just like arteries in the heart that can narrow over time because of cholesterol or plaque buildup the same situation may occur in the legs if the plaque becomes irritated or ruptures the body can form a clot at the site occluding the artery and stopping blood supply to the part of the leg beyond the clot a venous in a vein blood clot can also cause pain veins return blood from the legs to the heart there are two systems of veins in the leg superficial and deep if a blood clot occurs in a deep vein deep venous thrombosis it causes a damming effect and blood is trapped behind the blockage this causes redness swelling warmth and pain in the affected area calf pain and swelling are common symptoms superficial veins can also clot and cause pain but the risk of complication of a deep thrombosis breaking off and embolizing to the lungs  pulmonary embolism  is not often present a superficial thrombosis blood clot may not be able to travel to the lung because the valves in the perforator veins that connect the superficial vein system to the deep system act as a sieve however if the clot develops near the groin where the two systems come together the clot can embolize to the lungs superficial veins can also chronically dilate and swell and form varicose veins varicose veins may cause pain from this swelling and inflammation low back pain low back pain from sciatica inflammation of the sciatic nerve may radiate into the buttocks and down the leg the distribution of pain depends upon which nerve root is involved therefore the pain may be felt in the foot shin or thigh sciatica may be caused by a variety of changes in the back from arthritis a herniated disc muscle spasm or injury the common outcome is that the space where the nerve exits the spinal canal is narrowed and there is impingement upon the nerve less commonly tumors and infection can cause nerve root and spinal cord inflammation and resultant leg pain while a herniated disc or arthritis can pinch a nerve root that exits the back at one or more levels spinal stenosis may affect long segments of the spinal cord because the spinal canal itself becomes narrow not leaving enough room for the spinal cord itself spinal stenosis may result in pain numbness and weakness cauda equina syndrome describes a neurosurgical emergency in which back pain may be associated with weakness numbness around the perineal area rectum scrotum vagina inability to urinate and loss of bowel control the spinal cord ends in a mass of nerve roots that appear like a horses tail  cauda equina in latin that can become inflamed if there is damage to the area due to trauma or any other type of compression including tumors neuropathy pain may occur from peripheral nerve inflammation not associated with the spinal cord these conditions are known as peripheral neuropathies this can occur from direct nerve irritation or from a medical illness examples of this type of isolated nerve injury include foot and toe pain from a mortons neuroma most frequently a thickening and inflammation of a nerve that supplies the third and fourth toes or meralgia paresthetica that causes pain in the anterior thigh resulting from entrapment of a nerve that leaves the pelvis this neuropathy is also seen in pregnancy when the pressure of the uterus may cause the nerve to become inflamed these types of pain tend to involve part of one leg only diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy that affects both lower extremities alcohol abuse is another common cause of peripheral neuropathy illness chronic illnesses like diabetes alcoholism cancer and vitamin deficiencies for example b12 deficiency causing pernicious anemia may also result in nerve pain that often affects both legs there are some illnesses that cause leg weakness that may be associated with complaints of leg pain including guillainbarré syndrome and multiple sclerosis skin skin inflammation may also cause significant pain especially if there are underlying illnesses like diabetes or peripheral artery disease that prevent adequate healing the inflammation may be due to infection often caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus bacteria skin that is stretched due to edema or fluid accumulation in the tissues underneath the skin can cause significant pain especially when the legs are not elevated shingles can cause significant pain due to inflammation of spinal cord nerve in the body it is a reactivation of the chickenpox virus that resides in a dormant state in the nervous system following the patient being infected years previously since it is the nerve that is inflamed there can be significant amounts of pain as well a rash can occur along the course of the nerve the rash may appear a few days after the pain begins and may resolve before the rash goes away sometimes the pain persists chronically even after the rash resolves postherpetic neuralgia nerve pain slideshow surprising reasons youre in pain slideshow take the pain quiz what are other causes of nontraumatic leg pain joint pain joint pain may occur because of a local injury but may also be due to medical conditions that can cause inflammation and swelling joint pain associated with swelling is called arthritis arthjoint it isinflammation while pain without swelling is called arthralgia arthrjoint  algia pain some examples include the following patients with progressive osteoarthritis may have days in which affected joints may hurt similarly patients with rheumatoid arthritis may have episodes of joint inflammation when their disease flares exacerbations of gout can cause joints to become inflamed if uric acid crystals start to deposit within the joint it is often the joints that are under significant workload that are affected the joints in the great toe are commonly involved but the ankle knee wrist and fingers are also common sites of uric acid crystal deposition pseudogout can also cause joint inflammation instead of uric acid calcium pyrophosphate crystals deposited in joints are the cause of this condition the knee is often affected by pseudogout and the diagnosis is sometimes made when calcification of the cartilage is seen on plain xrays of the knee joint chondrocalcinosis systemic illnesses there are too many to discuss in this article may also cause joint inflammation some common conditions that may cause joint pain include inflammatory bowel disease  sle  psoriasis hepatitis inflammatory bowel disease and lyme disease joints may become inflamed as part of the bodys generalized reaction to an infection infections may cause synovitis or inflammation of the synovium the lining tissue of a joint most often it is due to a virus but in children there is always a concern that a bacterial infection may be the cause people who take warfarin  coumadin  prasugrel  effient  enoxaparin  lovenox  dabigatran pradaxa rivaroxaban xarelto or apixaban eliquis for anticoagulation to thin their blood may spontaneously bleed into a joint or muscle causing pain muscle pain muscle pain or myalgia myomuscle algiapain is a common complaint and may be due to overuse mild trauma or associated with the generalized aches and pain of an infection muscles may also become inflamed for a variety of reasons myositis myo muscle  itisinflammation including side effects of some cholesterol medications muscle cramps muscles may cramp causing significant pain this may be due to a lack of stretching or an imbalance of electrolytes in the bloodstream the body needs to have the right amount of calcium sodium and potassium for muscles to function well calf and foot muscles are particularly prone to cramping especially at night muscles will also go into spasm to help protect an injured site for example when a hip bone is broken the muscles that move the hip will go into spasm to help minimize movement of the injury heat cramps occur as part of the spectrum of heatrelated illness due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances they may occur immediately after exercising or working in a hot environment or their onset may be delayed for a few hours often it is the large muscles of the legs that are involved because of the amount of work they are asked to do muscle injuries the muscles in the leg tend to be in balance with each other to promote joint stability and act as shock absorbers for the forces that are generated by walking and running the quadriceps muscles on the front of the thigh extend or straighten the knee and are balanced by the hamstring muscles in the back of the thigh responsible for flexing or bending the knee if this balance is lost the muscle fibers may become overstretched and tear this is called a strain hamstring injury the hamstring posterior thigh muscle group is made up of a group of individual muscles known as the semitendinosus the semimembranosus and the biceps femoris while the tendons can be felt at the back of the knee the muscle originates and is anchored in the pelvis bone when the muscle contracts the knee bends and the leg is able to generate power to push the foot away from the ground so that the body can walk walking also requires the quadriceps muscles to fully extend the knee so that the heel of the foot can strike the ground and begin the footstep if the hamstring muscle tendon fibers are not flexible or if there is too much stretch placed on the structure these fibers may be damaged if the knee extends too much or too quickly muscle or tendon fibers may be stretched or even torn causing pain and swelling to protect itself the muscle may go into spasm which may cause even more pain skin abnormalities skin abnormalities may cause pain lacerations and skin tears ranging from trauma to ulcers caused by poor blood flow are among the causes of pain from skin conditions the skin has numerous nerve fibers that can sense pain and anything that damages the skin can cause pain skin infections may be painful again because of inflammation and swelling leg pain in children leg pain in children is a special situation while most leg pain in children is not serious there are times when the pain has a significant cause these may include a joint infection causing hip pain trauma causing damage to growth plates and pain due to systemic illnesses like henochschönlein purpura juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or rheumatic fever growing pains are most likely due to muscle overuse although they may be associated with a mild stretching as the muscles grow along with bone children with leg pain who limp or who will not bear weight on the leg should be seen urgently by a healthcare provider some fractures in children may be difficult to diagnose because immature bones may not have completely calcified due to the presence of growth plates fractures may not be evident on plain xrays and clinical judgment may be needed to decide whether a broken bone is present leggcalveperthes disease describes avascular necrosis or loss of blood supply to the femoral head the ball of the hip joint the cause is unknown but it most commonly affects children from ages 48 and causes hip pain and a limp treatment involves resting the hip joint to prevent longterm arthritis and care is usually supervised by an orthopedic specialist osgoodschlatter syndrome describes an inflammation of the apophysis of the tibia the bony protuberance where the patellar tendon attaches to the bone below the knee this condition occurs because of excess strain on the growth plate of the upper tibia and is often due to excess jumping or running it can cause a tender swollen area just below the knee the condition heals with ice and rest diabetes diabetes may cause leg pain in a variety of ways if blood sugar levels are not well controlled over a period of many years nerves and blood vessels deteriorate and lose their function often the damage occurs in the feet and progresses up the leg with loss of sensation skin infections and foot injuries may occur without the affected person feeling much discomfort alternatively the nerves may be so inflamed that the patient feels intractable pain diabetes also causes blood vessels to narrow and cause symptoms of pad peripheral artery disease or claudication people with diabetes are also more prone to infection because of an impaired immune system along with poor blood supply to the legs the ability to heal

range of presentation the pain may be described in a variety of ways including sharp dull heavy aching or burning it may be constant or intermittent or made better or worse with activity or rest there may be other associated symptoms depending upon the cause pain from muscles and joints often can be felt or palpated meaning that touching the area reproduces the pain this may be difficult if the pain originates in one of the muscles deep in the buttock an example is piriformis syndrome where the piriformis muscle one of the muscles that helps rotate the hip and located beneath the gluteus maximus becomes inflamed and irritates the sciatic nerve that runs beneath it physical exam may not be able to confirm the diagnosis that is suggested by a history of increasing hip pain and sciatica with a normal back exam pain also may radiate from its source to another location sometimes confusing the patient and the care provider for example hip problems may initially present with knee pain this is especially true in children and it is important to look at the hip whenever a child limps or complains of knee discomfort with some injuries and arthritic conditions pain gradually resolves as the muscle or joint warms up during activity but other times the pain may be made worse with use patients who suffer from claudication develop pain with exercise but as the blood vessels narrow over time the amount of activity required to bring on the pain decreases also this type of pain tends to resolve with rest as the disease progresses at some point the patient may complain of pain at rest not requiring exercise or activity to bring it on those who have a blood clot causing ischemia decreased oxygen supply to the tissues tend to have an acute onset of pain that is intense and involves the whole extremity below the area of the arterial blockage there may be associated numbness or paralysis sometimes the body is able to dissolve the clot on its own and as the blood supply is restored the pain resolves most often though this is a true emergency that requires treatment to dissolve or remove the clot to prevent loss of the leg people with neuropathy tend to describe their pain as a burning sensation while those who have sciatica describe intense sharp pain sciatica may also cause changes in sensation along the path of the inflamed nerve root nighttime symptoms of pain and leg cramps may be associated with restless legs syndrome a sleep disorder nerve pain slideshow surprising reasons youre in pain slideshow take the pain quiz when should people seek medical care for leg pain people often decide to seek care after an injury based upon their ability to stand bear weight and walk this is often reasonable however if there is concern that a bone is broken or there is significant swelling to a joint medical care should be sought in an urgent manner a swollen joint is never normal one important reminder just because the leg can move does not mean that it is not injured in most other situations leg pain has a gradual onset and patients seek medical attention when the pain begins to interfere with their daily lives often leg pain is a part of a larger collection of symptoms and is not evaluated independently however when leg pain begins suddenly it should be a cause for concern and medical care should be sought urgently this is especially the case if the leg is warm and swollen and deep venous thrombosis is of concern or if the leg is pale and cool and an arterial clot is a consideration if back and leg pain occurs with episodes of increased muscle weakness falling or changes in bowel or bladder function this may signal an emergency involving the spinal cord called cauda equina medical care should be accessed immediately children who develop leg pain and begin to limp or who develop a fever should be seen immediately for evaluation how do healthcare professionals diagnose leg pain the evaluation of leg pain always begins with the healthcare provider interviewing the patient and performing a physical examination to help determine the potential cause of the leg pain the decision about diagnostic testing including blood tests and xrays depends upon the providers concern as to what the cause of the leg pain might be sometimes testing and xrays are not required blood tests blood tests including a white blood cell count an erythrocyte sedimentation rate  esr  and a creactive protein  crp measurement may help detect an infection these are nonspecific tests that may give further direction to the healthcare provider please note that the white blood cell count may be elevated with an infection unless the patient has an immune system that is compromised at which point it may be falsely normal as with all tests the esr and crp if elevated need to be interpreted in light of the specific illness that is being considered if gout is a consideration a blood test to measure uric acid may be done however in the acute attack the uric acid level may be high low or normal the result is helpful if the level is high and may confirm a gout flare if supported by the history and physical examination other blood tests may be considered depending upon the underlying medical illnesses being considered imaging xrays if there is concern that a fracture or broken bone is present plain xrays may be indicated as well xrays may be taken as a screening to look for fluid or calcifications in a joint ultrasound an ultrasound may be helpful in making the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis superficial vein thrombosis is usually diagnosed clinically based upon the physical examination and no imaging may be required ultrasound may also be helpful to diagnose joint inflammation and swelling anklebrachial index abi arterial blood flow in the legs may be assessed by an anklebrachial index in which blood flow is evaluated at rest and with exercise this test involves comparing the blood pressure in the arms to the blood pressure in the legs arteriogram if further information is needed about the arteries an arteriogram may be performed to look directly at the arterial supply to the legs this is accomplished by injecting contrast dye directly into the arteries and watching it flow through the arteries in the legs via xrays arteriography may also be performed using ct or mri studies see below ct scan computerized tomography ct may be used in a variety of situations ct angiography may be able to take the place of arteriography is some situations to examine blood vessels ct may also be used to evaluate bone and joint anatomy looking for hidden fractures mri magnetic resonance imaging mri may be used to examine the back for the causes of sciatica to evaluate bones joints and soft tissues such as muscles tendons and ligaments mri angiography may also be considered in place of formal angiography to evaluate blood vessels in the body mri is also of use in looking for hidden or occult fractures nerve conduction studies nerve conduction studies may be considered to evaluate nerve function and measure the ability of specific nerves to carry electrical impulses this is helpful in deciding whether nerve pain is due to a central cause from the brain or spinal cord or due to a peripheral nerve injury for example inflammation of the ulnar nerve from hitting the funny bone can cause the ring and little fingers to go numb and is not caused by a stroke  joint aspiration if there is concern about infection or inflammation within a joint a needle may be put into the joint to pull out or aspirate fluid for analysis often this fluid is sent to a laboratory to analyze the white blood cell count within the fluid an elevated white blood cell count may signal inflammation a gram stain and culture looking for bacterial infection or crystal analysis looking for uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate crystals to make the diagnosis of gout or pseudogout respectively compartment pressures if compartment syndrome is suspected compartment pressures may be obtained of the muscular compartments of the leg andor thigh elevated compartment pressures may indicate the presence of compartment syndrome this is an emergency situation that may require surgical release incision of the affected compartment s to relieve the elevated pressure and restore blood flow and nerve function what is the treatment for leg pain the treatment of leg pain depends upon the diagnosis once the reason for the pain is established treatment is focused on both pain control and controlling the underlying problem to prevent or lessen future occurrences are there home remedies for leg pain care at home depends upon the reason for the leg pain for sprains and strains rice is the initial recommendation rest ice compression and elevation acetaminophen  tylenol and ibuprofen  advil may be used for pain control overthecounter medicines are usually safe to take but may interact with other prescription medications healthcare providers or pharmacists are usually available for questions and advice hamstring and calf injuries generally heal with the bodys production of collagen fibers to build scar tissue in the area of muscle damage depending upon the severity of damage it may take days to weeks to completely heal the treatment of a strain is rice rest ice compression and elevation once the initial phase of recovery begins it is important that the muscle regain its length often stretching exercises and massage are used to help restore the hamstring muscles to their full length to allow full range of motion of the knee and leg the decision as to when to start these exercises or to use other types of physical therapy is individualized for every patient and is often made by the healthcare provider crutches may be used in the first few days after injury to rest the leg elastic bandages ace wraps may be applied to the thigh beginning at the knee and moving upward to the hip joint to provide compression ibuprofen may be suggested as an antiinflammatory medication and for pain control as with any overthecounter medication it is important to check with a pharmacist or healthcare provider to make certain that it is safe to take ibuprofen in each specific case people with sciatic pain should consider a short period of bed rest usually less than 24 hours followed by activity as tolerated patients tend to return to normal activity more quickly if the amount of bed rest is minimized alternating ice and heat may be helpful acetaminophen and ibuprofen may also be used chiropractic or physical therapy treatments may be of help if the pain is associated with a change in bowel or bladder function this may indicate cauda equina syndrome in which the spinal cord is at risk of permanent damage and emergency care should be accessed immediately for patients with chronic medical conditions prevention is often the best treatment the pain of neuropathy in people with diabetes is very hard to control a lifetime of bloodsugar control minimizes the risk of this and other complications in later life similarly lifetime control of high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes along with smoking avoidance will minimize the risk of peripheral vascular disease as well as heart attack and stroke most conditions that cause leg pain arise slowly and home care should be individualized for each patient ones healthcare provider is an important resource for diagnosis prevention and treatment if acute pain with leg swelling or loss of feeling associated with a cold leg occurs medical care should be accessed immediately nerve pain slideshow surprising reasons youre in pain slideshow take the pain quiz what are medical treatments for leg pain readers comments 12 share your story therapy for leg pain depends upon the cause once the diagnosis is confirmed care will be tailored to the specific needs of the patient is followup needed after leg pain treatment depending upon the cause of leg pain the need for further care may be minimal if it is due to an injury or it may be lifelong if it is associated with a chronic condition such as diabetes or arterial disease is it possible to prevent leg pain there is a school of thought that says that all injuries are preventable but in the real world accidents happen and injuries are the result some acute situations are potentially avoidable when traveling long distances by car train or by air get up and walk every couple of hours to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis for those prone to falls using a cane or walker may be helpful as well footwear with good grips should be encouraged falls can occur when the walking surface changes for example walking from a carpeted room to one with bare floors or slipping on throw rugs home healthsafety assessments to minimize these kinds of fall risks may be available through ones healthcare provider or the county health department maintaining an ideal weight will decrease the lifetime stress on bones and joints and decrease the potential for arthritis and obesity related illnesses a regular exercise program and a healthy balanced diet including adequate calcium and vitamin d intake will maintain strong bones and joint flexibility for those with longterm medical conditions maintaining good control of the disease is a lifelong commitment and may minimize the risk of developing complications this is especially true for diabetes high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels smoking is a major risk factor for blood vessel disease and should be avoided what is the prognosis of leg pain readers comments 6 share your story advances in the management of chronic pain are occurring routinely and those with chronic leg pain
