best practice povdefinition of marketing modelsjames donius managing director at marketplace measurement worldwideprint definition what is a marketing model in looking for an operational definition of what a marketing model is certain key words emerge these are representation real world events objects processes and relationships importantly a model is not merely an area of application a statistical technique nor a generic description crm regression analysis and data mining are not marketing models per se they are an area of application a statistical technique and a generic description marketing models are created for a purpose make assumptions about what they are representing and typically consist of variables that describe the relationships that are of interest lilien rangaswamy often analogies are made to maps and charts that are also vehicles to portray relationships furthermore in defining a marketing model there tends to be a distinction made between the construction and building of the model vs the application of the model “in the most general sense a “model” is anything used to represent something else – a map used to represent a section of countryside is a model and so is a chart used to represent concurrent changes in fuel oil sales and temperature” buzzell stated another way a marketing model is a stylized representation of reality that is easier to deal with and explore for a specific purpose than reality itself lilien rangaswamy modeling is simply a means of examining depicting specifying and operationalizing relationships smith the following chart exhibits the fundamental correspondence between a model and the real world marketing models are seen as representations of real world objects events and processes there are two points of correspondence shown in the diagram the representation of real objects and events by a model modelbuilding and the application of results derived from a model buzzell chart 1 correspondence between a model and the “real world” “real world” “model” objects and events representation modelrepresentation modelbuilding relationships and processes operations on models real world results model result buzzell  a good way is to look at models is in terms of their intended purpose they may be measurement models whose purpose is to measure variables relationships or demand as a function of a number of dependent variables another purpose is decision support where models are designed to help managers make decisions “a model that is used by a manager should be simple robust easy to control adaptive as complete as possible and easy to communicate with by simple is meant easy to understand by robust hard to get absurd answers from by easy to control that the user knows what input data would be required to produce desired output answers adaptive means that the model can be adjusted as new information is acquired completeness implies that important phenomena will be included even if they require judgmental estimates of their effect and finally easy to communicate with means that the manager can quickly and easily change inputs and obtain and understand the outputs little these decision models can be descriptive predictive or normative finally there are theoretical models whose purpose is to explain marketing phenomena lilien rangaswamy  lilien kotler moorthy a related way to look at models is by the function they are intended to perform describe a process predict future events serve as a control providing a basis of choice among alternative courses of action buzzell another way to look at different types of models is to examine them in terms of their degree of abstraction in terms of representing reality iconic models directly resemble reality analogue models substitute one property for another symbolic models represent by symbols of a logical or mathematical character buzzell
